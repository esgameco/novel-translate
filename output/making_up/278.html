        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming opened his mouth, not knowing how to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>But Su Lingxiu took out a reviving pill and said, "Come, take this reviving pill first, your injuries will recover quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming's injuries were very severe, and the collapse of his spiritual body and the loss of his origin were the most fundamental injuries.</p><p></p><p>If his spiritual body's origin was not restored, even if his injuries healed, his strength would be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to treat him, of course he had to heal him back to his peak condition.</p><p></p><p>This was the first serious patient, which was a good opportunity to showcase his pill-making skills and accumulate experience. If he couldn't thoroughly cure him, wouldn't that damage the reputation of his pill-making martial artist?</p><p></p><p>"It's useless, this old man knows the extent of his injuries," Moon Changming bitterly smiled and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>However, he still took the reviving pill.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, sit down, let me ponder how to treat you!" Su Lingxiu's face was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan also angrily blurted out that the Thousand Martial Hall had shamelessly claimed that his master had stolen the secret sword techniques of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"This Thousand Martial Hall is really vicious!" Li Xuanyi heard this and immediately became furious.</p><p></p><p>"Since you like my sword dao so much, then let the Thousand Martial Hall experience it, and also see how the Transcendent Spirit Sect's strength is.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it can withstand the might of my divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>The disgruntled Li Xuanyi was prepared to take on the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>While also testing the foundation of the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I've decided, I will use the Thousand Martial Hall as a stepping stone, I will suppress the Thousand Martial Hall and step on it to reach the peak of the Spirit Realm!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think?" He looked at his master.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, his master would not deign to personally destroy the Thousand Martial Hall for such a trivial matter, so of course it was up to his disciple to take action!</p><p></p><p>"Mm, okay, treat it as tempering," Li Xuanyi nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had such ambitions, Li Xuanyi could only temporarily suppress the idea of crushing the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the foundation of the Transcendent Spirit Sect was still unknown. If he couldn't destroy the Thousand Martial Hall with a single palm strike, wouldn't that affect his image as an unparalleled expert? He couldn't instantly reduce the Thousand Martial Hall to ashes, or his image as an invincible senior would be somewhat affected.</p><p></p><p>So it's better to be cautious!</p><p></p><p>"It's good this way, Xu Yan has a direction for tempering, his martial dao will surely advance further and he can become stronger quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Destroying the Thousand Martial Hall is a small matter, Xu Yan becoming stronger is the real priority. As long as Xu Yan grows stronger, he will become stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan has already taken the Thousand Martial Hall as a stepping stone, then let's leave it for the disciple to temper himself with.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, you've chosen the Thousand Martial Hall, then which Transcendent Spirit Sect should I choose? There's no sect that has targeted my dao of the blade, it's a bit difficult, I don't really want to make a move on those who haven't offended me..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, feeling a bit frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming: ...</p><p></p><p>Moon'er: ...</p><p></p><p>The grandfather and grandson were both dumbfounded, is the Transcendent Spirit Sect so unworthy in their eyes? Both a stepping stone and something to temper the disciples...</p><p></p><p>They're all lunatics! Meng Chong looked at Moon Changming and asked, "Which Transcendent Spirit Sect cultivates the dao of the blade? I feel like once I reveal my blade dao, they will definitely target me too, then it'll be easy."</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming swallowed hard and said, "In terms of the dao of the blade, it's still the Thousand Martial Hall!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong heard this and his eyes immediately lit up. "Big brother, leave a part of the Thousand Martial Hall for me too, I also want to make a move on them!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In just a few words, the two brothers had divided up the Thousand Martial Hall, using it as a stepping stone to temper themselves and reach the peak of the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The awe-inspiring and unattainable Transcendent Spirit Sect, the Thousand Martial Hall, had actually become just a stepping stone in their eyes?</p><p></p><p>"Your goals make me very pleased, the Thousand Martial Hall being chosen by you to temper yourselves, even if it is destroyed, I believe the ancestors of the Thousand Martial Hall will feel it is an honor!" Li Xuanyi nodded.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the Spirit Realm, his disciples finally had a goal to strive for. Having a goal means having motivation, and with motivation, their martial dao will progress even faster.</p><p></p><p>This is a good thing! The Thousand Martial Hall is rushing to become a stepping stone, what a wonderful sect!</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming no longer knew what to say, completely abandoning the idea of persuading them to escape.</p><p></p><p>Here, the disciples are lunatics, and the master is even more lunatic - a group of complete lunatics!</p><p></p><p>The mighty Transcendent Spirit Sect can be destroyed by his disciples, and it's considered an honorable thing. Where else in the world can you find people as crazy as these?</p><p></p><p>Something's not right! Suddenly, Moon Changming's expression changed drastically, and he abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, what's wrong?" Moon'er asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming was now looking at Su Lingxiu, his lips trembling, his pale face flushed with blood, his voice shaking with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"What is this reviving pill, why is it so effective? I feel my injuries have recovered by a fifth or so!"</p><p></p><p>He had been so shocked by the lunatics here that he had overlooked his own injuries. Now that he had regained his senses, he was horrified to discover that his injuries had indeed recovered by a fifth or so.</p><p></p><p>Although his injuries were still very severe and his spiritual body's origin had not been restored, at least he wouldn't die in a few years!</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, your injuries have improved a bit?" Moon'er was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Xu Yan brother, thank you sister!" Su Lingxiu pressed down on Moon Changming's shoulders and said, "Sit down, don't get excited, the reviving pill I concocted can restore even a dying martial artist and repair their foundation.</p><p></p><p>"But since your strength is quite high and your injuries were more severe, with your spiritual body's origin completely lost, you've only recovered by a fifth or so.</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry, with pill-making saint Su Lingxiu here, I guarantee I can restore you to your peak condition!"</p><p></p><p>Moon Changming was a bit puzzled, he had never heard of such a thing as pills.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, don't ask so much, healing the injuries is the priority, you don't move." Su Lingxiu stopped Moon Changming from asking further.</p><p></p><p>She started acupuncturing Moon Changming's body with golden needles, and took out some spiritual herbs, pondering for a moment before a pill formula appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your injuries are quite severe, your spirit and soul are weakened. The spiritual herbs I'm using this time are quite precious, if I hadn't seized the Jade Spirit Sect and the Jiu Family's treasury, I might not have been able to gather the herbs to save you."</p><p></p><p>As Su Lingxiu spoke, her true essence manipulated the golden needles, and in an instant, Moon Changming was shocked to find that a life force seemed to be emerging within him.</p><p></p><p>A circulation formed around his body, the places where the needles were inserted slightly vibrating, as if there was a mysterious resonance forming within him.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he felt much more energetic.</p><p></p><p>And as Su Lingxiu spoke, a pill flame appeared in her hand and she began concocting the pill.</p><p></p><p>The Void Pill Refining Art, she had almost mastered it.</p><p></p><p>This pill-making technique left Moon Changming increasingly astonished, such a skill was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Moon'er was also like this, her mouth slightly open, staring in shock.</p><p></p><p>Since entering this manor, everything seemed to have become so extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The mighty and awe-inspiring Transcendent Spirit Sect was viewed as a mere stepping stone, and what was this technique?</p><p></p><p>"Sister, I wonder which Transcendent Spirit Sect cultivates the dao of the blade, I feel like they will definitely target me once I reveal my blade dao, then it'll be easy."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you the spiritual medicine."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er said, starting to take out the spiritual medicine from her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I have spiritual medicine, consider it a reward for your message."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pills have been refined.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take the medicinal pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was extremely excited. He had thought he wouldn't live much longer, leaving his granddaughter alone and destitute, even harboring a vengeful obsession and living in agony. </p><p></p><p>Now, he saw the hope of recovery, like seeing the light in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the medicinal pill in one gulp, feeling a warm current flow from his dantian, circulating through his body and entering his spirit, nourishing his spirit. His originally weak and dispirited state began to recover.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu waved her hand, and all the golden needles flew back, saying, "Recover your injuries. Although I can't restore you to your peak, you won't fall in cultivation either." "Your spirit is weak. After resting and being nourished by the medicinal pill, you'll recover when you wake up!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, Miss, I'm deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was also excited and exclaimed, "Thank you, Brother Xu Yan, thank you, sister."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked at her puzzledly. Why did she keep mentioning the elder brother whenever expressing gratitude? The one who saved them was herself!</p><p></p><p>"It's probably because the elder brother brought her here."</p><p></p><p>Thanking the elder brother was also appropriate.</p><p></p><p>"There's an empty room, go rest there."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pointed to the room inside.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you, sister!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er supported Yue Changming and went to rest.</p><p></p><p>"Master, his spiritual body needs to recover, and it's quite difficult. I've looked, and I don't have the necessary spiritual medicines to refine a recovery pill for his spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming's spiritual body had collapsed, his foundation lost, almost dried up. How could recovery be easy?</p><p></p><p>In fact, it could be said that there was almost no possibility of recovery.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if there were suitable spiritual medicines and a suitable pill formula, refining a medicinal pill could activate the dried-up spiritual body and replenish the lost foundation.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't have to be spiritual medicines, a drop of the essence blood of the one who took his spiritual body can also substitute."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes lit up, "She's a spiritual body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu curiously asked next, "Master, am I a spiritual body too?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also came over. He had broken through a realm and transformed, but he was unsure if he was a spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual bodies require certain methods to be detected.</p><p></p><p>But like Su Lingxiu, because of her identity as a Dantian Martial Artist, she could sense the special constitution after contact, just lacking the knowledge of Bao bodies and spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, with his mastery of special constitutions, especially the changes in his disciples' constitutions after their transformations, could instantly discern Bao bodies and spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Master, am I a spiritual body?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Both yes and no!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciple's puzzled expression, Li Xuan smiled and said, "Bao bodies or spiritual bodies, they are just a kind of natural talent. The starting point is higher than ordinary people, that's all.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Martial Dao is endless. Those who reach the peak do not depend solely on constitution, but also on insight, perseverance, and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"Even with an ordinary constitution, one can step by step, realm by realm, surpass the so-called Bao bodies and spiritual bodies. So don't be attached to this.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend yourself, break through yourself, transform yourself, the Martial Dao is limitless, it's about daring to scale the heights!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood. Although the master didn't explicitly say it, he himself did not have a Bao body or spiritual body when cultivating the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was not only not weaker than spiritual bodies, but even stronger! So Bao bodies and spiritual bodies are just one aspect of martial talent, and to reach the peak of the Martial Dao, it is not enough to rely solely on Bao bodies or spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>The Qian Wu Palace was too hard a stepping stone for his current strength, so he must seize the opportunity to break through as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was the same, with a clear goal, his cultivation became more spirited!</p><p></p><p>Yue'er came out of the room, kowtowing to Li Xuan to express her gratitude, then went to thank Xu Yan and Su Lingxiu, while curiously watching Su Lingxiu refine the pills.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat came running over, rubbing against Su Lingxiu's legs, looking cute.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Cat, you've gotten fatter!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu patted the Crimson Cat's head.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat indicated that although it had gotten a little fatter, the hand feel was better now! "Here, eat carefully, the spiritual medicines may be plentiful, but they will eventually be exhausted!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu gave the Crimson Cat the medicinal pills, including the failed ones.</p><p></p><p>No matter how skilled she was in refining pills, when creating new high-grade medicinal pills, there would still be failed ones, but none of them were wasted, all fed to the Crimson Cat.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat was not picky, already accustomed to eating the failed pills, as if it had developed a taste for them.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat was excited, as for the spiritual medicines running out? It would just raid a spiritual sect when that happened!</p><p></p><p>"Is this a cat?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked curious. No matter how she looked at it, this fat cat seemed like a fierce tiger, but its size was indeed that of a cat, and it even meowed.</p><p></p><p>She reached out to touch it, but the Crimson Cat arrogantly swung its tail, slapping Yue'er's hand with a "crack".</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's delicate white hand turned red, and she was shocked, this fat cat was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>"It was originally a Crimson-Eyed Tiger, but it has gotten used to acting like a cat."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu explained.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was a bit confused. It was originally a tiger, but got used to acting like a cat? What did that mean? The arrogant Crimson Cat walked away, not allowing outsiders to touch it!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the border between Luo State and Yu State, several disheveled figures were frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>They were some Refining Deity Realm cultivators who had narrowly escaped from the Luo State Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, escape, notify the Yu State Alliance, hide!"</p><p></p><p>These people were all heavily injured. After reaching Yu State, they rushed to a stronghold of the Yu State Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice sounded, and the Left Protector's figure rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of vigilance. Several Refining Deity Realm cultivators had come, could it be that the Yu State Spiritual Sect Families wanted to make a move?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly notify the allies, hide, don't expose yourselves, the strongest of the Qian Wu Palace has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>A blood-soaked Refining Deity Realm cultivator shouted anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The strongest of the Qian Wu Palace has appeared?</p><p></p><p>"What happened to the Luo State Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the disheveled appearance of these people, his heart sank, having a bad premonition.</p><p></p><p>"The Luo State Alliance was almost wiped out, the Alliance Master and the others were all killed in battle!"</p><p></p><p>The Luo State Alliance Refining Deity Realm cultivator said mournfully.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, follow me, treating the injuries is the priority."</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector hurriedly led them to a secret hiding place.</p><p></p><p>While using a transmission talisman to inform Yu Gao that the Luo State Alliance was nearly wiped out and the strongest of the Qian Wu Palace had appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the border between Luo State and Yu State, a figure stepped forward, the wind and clouds moving with him, the aura of the strongest shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

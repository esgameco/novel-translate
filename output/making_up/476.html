        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among the Immortal Celestial Venerables who participated in the siege of the true dragon, except for a few powerful experts from various realms who secretly escaped in advance and managed to survive, all the rest were completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, the Divine Realm was shaken! Countless powerful experts were anxious and uneasy. Even the forces of various major realms felt a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying was that with the fall of many powerful experts in the Divine Realm, all the Heavenly Caves in various places erupted at this moment and launched attacks on the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sons of the Netherworld, Demon Witches, Unformed True Spirits, and others poured out of the Divine Realm, causing great turmoil.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Divine Realm entered a true great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"They were just wiped out like that!"</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe Realm, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping were both dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon's strength was truly incredibly powerful. Even the two of them together were no match for it.</p><p></p><p>From the available information, although this true dragon was indeed very strong, if the two of them had encountered it, they would not have been without the power to escape.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The stairs in the sky became clearer and clearer. The Taihe Sect Master and others had beads of sweat on their foreheads. At this moment, more than a dozen elders rushed over from within the Taihe Sect to join in opening the Heavenly Ladder.</p><p></p><p>These elders had all been in secluded cultivation, but now with the crisis approaching, they had no choice but to emerge.</p><p></p><p>In the Diyun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen and the other four members of Tianchai all looked towards the sky. From this moment, they could see ripples appearing in the distant sky.</p><p></p><p>A ball of light was emerging.</p><p></p><p>That was the sign of the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder opening.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, everyone get ready!" Tian Seventeen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, everything is prepared!"</p><p></p><p>The thick clouds in the Diyun Heavenly Cave were rotating, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into the cave. Even the laws of heaven and earth were faintly visible at this moment.</p><p></p><p>As the clouds were sucked into the Heavenly Cave, if one were to look down from above at this moment, they would discover that a huge black cave had appeared in the center of the Diyun Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was an enormous Heavenly Cave, and within the cave, powerful auras were accumulating, as if they could erupt at any moment and shoot straight into the sky!</p><p></p><p>A faint layer of light covered the Heavenly Cave, sealing in all the various powers accumulated inside, not allowing even the slightest bit to leak out.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>In front of a great city somewhere in the Divine Realm, an Immortal Celestial Venerable saw rolling blood-red light in the distance. His face changed drastically in fear and he shouted frantically.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the calamity of the true dragon, the Divine Realm's strength had greatly decreased and no longer had enough power to suppress the Heavenly Caves.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these enemies from beyond clearly had made preparations long ago, just waiting for this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, the originally peaceful Heavenly Cave also showed signs of turmoil.</p><p></p><p>However, whether it was the Dayue Heavenly Cave or the other three great Heavenly Caves, they had all been transformed into divine furnaces of heaven and earth by Su Lingxiu. And the Qinghua Realm had also set up the Qinghua Grand Formation. Therefore, as soon as the Netherworld warriors set foot in the Heavenly Cave, they were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the current Qinghua Realm could be said without exaggeration to be the strongest in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three including Dayue Emperor were now Tianhe Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Except for lacking the deep foundation of the major realms and not having the backing of a Dao Realm sect, in terms of strength within the Divine Realm alone, the Qinghua Sect was now number one.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right with the Qinghua Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Faint voices came from beyond in the Dayue Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Those who had originally planned to invade the Qinghua Realm found that they died as soon as they entered. Because of this, they sent in large numbers of fierce beasts from the Netherworld, but these beasts were all refined into blood pearls upon entering.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm remained calm and undisturbed. They even deliberately opened up certain Heavenly Caves to allow Blood Sons of the Netherworld, Blood Disciples, and fierce beasts of the Netherworld to enter, using this to temper the sect's disciples.</p><p></p><p>They had turned these Heavenly Caves into places for tempering.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm adjacent to the Qinghua Realm was now the territory of the Beast Clan. After Red Cat established the Beast Clan and gathered the spirit beasts of the Divine Realm, naturally there were also Immortal Realm spirit beasts who came.</p><p></p><p>As for whether their initial intentions were malicious or not, that was no longer important. They had now all submitted to Red Cat's might as the Beast King and were completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>They had become major generals among the Divine Realm's Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the time for our Beast Clan to show its might, and also the time to accumulate treasures for the Beast Clan, to devour the blood energy of the Netherworld and strengthen our Beast Clan bodies."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat stood proudly, holding a large blade.</p><p></p><p>He had already passed down the methods of the Beast Clan. Now these spirit beasts all had the opportunity to break free from the shackles of bloodline limitations and continuously cultivate and improve like human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They naturally had complete faith in the Great Beast King.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Beast Clan army set out, and these armies were actually arranged in great formations, unleashing incredibly powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was very satisfied with this. This was what he had painstakingly cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha had also contributed their efforts.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Clan battle formations were obtained from Fang Hao's hands, and after his careful study and adjustments, they were more suitable for Beast Clan warfare.</p><p></p><p>At Dagaishan, Wan Tianlin sighed with emotion. In just a short time, the Nine Mountains Realm had changed hands.</p><p></p><p>Even though Dagaishan seemed to be under the control of the Wan family and belonged to human territory, in reality it was just a place for communication, trade, and liaison.</p><p></p><p>The great chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm was not a cause for concern.</p><p></p><p>"The true dragon is too strong. When I, Red Cat, become powerful enough, I will no longer fear any so-called true dragon."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was proud at his core.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon, however, had a look of longing on his face. After all, he was a flood dragon. If he could transform into a true dragon, his strength would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>"Great King, that true dragon is of the same origin as us. One day we must subdue them and bring them into our Beast Clan camp. I am willing to lead the True Dragon Beast Clan for the Great King!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon flattered.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat glanced at him and coughed dryly, "Although I know you really want to transform into a true dragon, I really can't help you right now. But you can try asking your master, our Beast Clan Supreme!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon was stunned. Ask Xu Yan? He suddenly remembered that when he first met Xu Yan, he had been suppressed by the dragon might Xu Yan displayed.</p><p></p><p>"You mean our Beast Clan Supreme, my master Sword God Xu Yan, can get true dragon blood essence for me?" Jade Little Dragon asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"He should be able to, right? After all, he has a Dragon Subduing Palm technique for subduing dragons."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat said, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a true dragon, incredibly powerful, wiping out half of the Divine Realm's powerful experts in one battle.</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Realm was one of the major realms of the Divine Realm, and the Taimiao Divine Sect was a major force in the Divine Realm with a long history and deep foundation.</p><p></p><p>However, as the disaster of the true dragon continued to spread, the true dragon was now heading towards the Taimiao Realm. Once the true dragon entered the Taimiao Realm, even the Taimiao Divine Sect would not be able to resist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the great hall of the Taimiao Divine Sect, the powerful experts of the Taimiao Divine Sect had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's avoid it for now and go to the Taihe Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Taimiao Divine Sect sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"The Taihe Sect should be opening the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder now. The matter of the true dragon will naturally be handled by the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Except for those at the Immortal Realm, all other cultivators should stay and guard the sect. From the current situation, the true dragon only hunts down Immortal Realm cultivators. If we leave the Taimiao Realm, the true dragon naturally won't rampage in the Taimiao Realm for too long."</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Sect Master said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a graceful figure walked in.</p><p></p><p>As she walked, the environment around her seemed like a dream, both real and illusory, impossible to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou! At this moment, Xin Mengrou had already broken through to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mengrou, you've broken through?" The Taimiao Sect Master asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Xin Mengrou nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With her breakthrough, from now on, she would be the master of Taimiao Divine Sect's Dream Path.</p><p></p><p>"The True Dragon Calamity is approaching. We all need to temporarily avoid the edge and retreat to the Taihe Realm for a while," said the Sect Master of Taimiao.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xin Mengrou naturally had no objections.</p><p></p><p>And so, the powerful experts of Taimiao Divine Sect prepared to leave the Taimiao Realm and head to the Taihe Realm to temporarily take refuge, waiting for the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder to open.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Master Grandmother, Great-grandmother, you've broken through?" Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"You two should also strive to break through to the Immortal Realm soon. That kid Xu Yan is getting stronger and stronger," Xin Mengrou sighed.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying's expressions turned serious, and they nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take refuge in the Taihe Realm. Although you have the jade talisman from the senior, you still can't be careless. What's behind the True Dragon Calamity is not simple. Try not to cause trouble for the senior," Xin Mengrou reminded.</p><p></p><p>"We'll follow Great-grandmother and Ancestral Master Grandmother's instructions in everything!" Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts from Taimiao Divine Sect immediately set out to head to the Taihe Realm. However, before they could reach the realm gate, the True Dragon had already descended upon the Taimiao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Its speed exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, quickly cross the wilderness!" The people of Taimiao Divine Sect's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>At the True Dragon's speed, its target was likely also to go to the Taihe Realm! The powerful experts of Taimiao Divine Sect fled frantically. Xin Mengrou brought Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao along as they fled, their speed no slower than the other experts.</p><p></p><p>Before they could cross the wilderness, an imposing aura surged from behind.</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Sect experts looked back, their expressions changing dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Rolling dark clouds and flashing lightning, a flawless jade-white dragon shadow flickered in and out of view within the clouds. Even from a great distance, they could feel the bone-chilling cold emanating from within the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes scattered down from the dark clouds. Wherever they passed, the earth was sealed in ice, vegetation turned to powder - it was a scene of world-ending devastation.</p><p></p><p>"We can't escape!" The faces of the Taimiao Realm experts turned pale. The True Dragon was clearly coming straight for them.</p><p></p><p>On one side of the dark clouds, Old Man Xiao was leisurely striding along, closely following the True Dragon, yet the True Dragon had not noticed his presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Man Xiao frowned as he looked towards the group of Taimiao Sect experts ahead, his brows furrowing slightly as he fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"The people of Taimiao, should I save them or not? If I save them, wouldn't that expose myself? Ever since Taimiao fell into the contradictory mindset between the Dream Path and the Supreme Path, the Taimiao Realm has been divided into two factions, with constant conflicts..."</p><p></p><p>At a certain point, Old Man Xiao's gaze fell upon one person.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This woman's Dream Path is somewhat special, and why does she have Taimiao's secret techniques? Did Taimiao personally pass down the Dream Path to her? If that's the case, then I'll protect these three women. "</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Man Xiao made his decision.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest of the Taimiao Sect people, if they died then so be it. He would just protect those three women, considering it a favor for Taimiao's sake.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, protecting the three women wouldn't expose him.</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Sect Master and others were still frantically fleeing. As for splitting up to escape, with the True Dragon's speed, they would still be hunted down one by one. It was better to fight to the death when there was nowhere left to run - perhaps there would be some chance.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou frowned, hesitating whether to use the secret technique of the Dream Path to temporarily bewilder the True Dragon and buy time to escape.</p><p></p><p>However, she wasn't very confident she could bewilder the True Dragon.</p><p></p><p>After all, the True Dragon behind them was much stronger than her.</p><p></p><p>"All... die!" The True Dragon's violent voice had already reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky, and the world turned pitch black as a bone-chilling cold permeated everything.</p><p></p><p>"We can't escape. Prepare for battle," the Taimiao Sect Master said gravely, with a hint of despair.</p><p></p><p>Before the True Dragon had even arrived, its dragon might shook heaven and earth, feeling like a mountain pressing down on their hearts, extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying's faces turned pale. The two women were the weakest, and even with Xin Mengrou's protection, they still felt terrified in the face of the True Dragon's might!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Master Grandmother, should I use the senior's jade talisman?" Yun Miaomiao spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's brows furrowed. Although she knew that senior was incredibly powerful, what was behind the True Dragon Calamity involved too much. If they got involved, there would inevitably be no small amount of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, she was unwilling to cause trouble for that senior, fearing it would lower the senior's good impression of her.</p><p></p><p>"You need to think this through carefully. Once you use the jade talisman, it's very likely to kill this True Dragon. But there's too much involved behind the True Dragon, and no small amount of trouble. Causing such huge trouble for that senior - would your Young Master Xu be somewhat displeased?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xin Mengrou said this, Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying immediately hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou laughed bitterly in her heart. As long as it involved Xu Yan's affairs, these two little girls would be cautious again and cautious, afraid of causing even the slightest displeasure to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The dark clouds rolled, thunder flashed, and a bone-chilling cold permeated everything as a dragon's roar shook heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying's expressions grew even paler, their delicate bodies trembling slightly as they looked at each other, still unable to make that decision.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of Taimiao Divine Sect now all wore expressions of despair. At close range, they could feel the True Dragon's might even more acutely.</p><p></p><p>"My Taimiao Sect has no grudge with the True Dragon. Why are you hunting us down?" The Taimiao Sect Master couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"Die! All must die, you must all die, kill all of you!" However, the response that came was the True Dragon's irrational, murderous reply.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The world's spiritual energy surged forth as the dark clouds pressed down. Snowflake-like lightning that emanated a bone-piercing chill was sweeping towards them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful experts of Taimiao Divine Sect no longer had any chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the wilderness, in a distant place, a group of Taimiao Realm martial artists now looked towards where the dark clouds were with utter despair. Were the Taimiao elders about to be destroyed by the True Dragon? If so, how could Taimiao Divine Sect continue to stand in the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>Unless powerful experts came from the Dao Realm to preside.</p><p></p><p>"Let's make our move. We have no choice!" the Taimiao Sect Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>As her words fell, an extremely domineering aura surged forth from her body. Her delicate figure suddenly burst forth with an aura that looked down on the world.</p><p></p><p>What she cultivated was Taimiao's Supreme Path!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the powerful experts of Taimiao Sect burst forth with their auras, all giving off a sense of looking down on the world, with only themselves as supreme - forming a stark contrast with their delicate outward appearances.</p><p></p><p>As for Xin Mengrou and the others, a ethereal aura emerged, and in an instant, dreamlike illusions permeated their surroundings, as if reality was a dream, and dreams could become reality.</p><p></p><p>Taimiao's Dream Path! Xin Mengrou glanced at the two little girls who were still hesitating, laughing bitterly in her heart. Even at this moment, they were still hesitating out of fear of displeasing Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed the burst of aura from the Taimiao Sect experts had provoked the True Dragon. An angry voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds churned, thunder roared, and the bone-chilling cold seemed about to freeze this entire world. The True Dragon plunged down from within the dark clouds, charging straight towards them to kill.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing the True Dragon's might head-on, the hearts of the Taimiao Sect experts couldn't help but tremble. Even their auras of looking down on the world seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, a dragon's roar sounded out. A giant golden dragon suddenly appeared, blasting apart the dark clouds as it charged towards that flawless jade-white True Dragon!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 24: Perfecting the Refinement of the Viscera (Seeking Continued Readership)</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Xu Yan returned, and he also brought a jade scepter and several jade ornaments.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, my disciple has truly grasped the essence of my teachings."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This disciple was truly remarkable!</p><p></p><p>Looking at these jades, they were of considerable value!</p><p></p><p>They were so beautiful!</p><p></p><p>As for the fierce beasts in the Evil Killing Forest, since Xu Yan had returned, it was naturally resolved, so Li Xuan did not ask.</p><p></p><p>However, this time when Xu Yan returned, he seemed a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Exactly how he was different, Li Xuan could not quite put his finger on, but he felt puzzled, yet did not think much of it.</p><p></p><p>After returning, Xu Yan resumed his previous cultivation routine, except that he had begun to refine his viscera.</p><p></p><p>"The viscera are fragile, and in the beginning of refining the viscera, one must be extremely careful and cannot be too hasty, otherwise it may backfire and harm oneself."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan was refining his viscera, he mobilized his qi and blood, first nourishing his heart. As the tempering began, his heartbeat became more powerful, and with each heartbeat, his entire body's qi and blood would increase in amplitude.</p><p></p><p>"I will strive to complete the refinement of the viscera within three months."</p><p></p><p>After tempering out his jade-like bones, Xu Yan's confidence had greatly increased, and completing the viscera refinement in three months was already relatively conservative.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>With the tempering, his heart had grown stronger, and his qi and blood had increased by more than half. The subsequent tempering could be more intense without having to worry about harming the heart.</p><p></p><p>However, with the strengthening of his heart, Xu Yan also discovered some problems.</p><p></p><p>"I feel a bit out of balance, I cannot just refine the heart, I must also refine the other viscera."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to refine his lungs.</p><p></p><p>He firmly remembered his master's words about refining the viscera - the five viscera correspond to the five elements, the circulation of qi and blood revolves around the five viscera, forming a complete whole, and when the five elements are unified, the refinement of the viscera would be complete.</p><p></p><p>After the initial tempering of the viscera and obtaining strengthening, Xu Yan then proceeded to refine the five viscera simultaneously, with the circulation of qi and blood flowing between the five viscera. Each tempering allowed him to feel his own advancement.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood were also constantly increasing in strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's return, the days returned to normal, and Li Xuan felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He sighed with admiration for Xu Yan's perseverance.</p><p></p><p>This foolish disciple was truly resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Half a year has passed, just endure another half a year, and I can be free."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed wistfully.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could get through another half a year, he could dissolve the master-disciple relationship and escape to the Wu State.</p><p></p><p>With the generous gifts Xu Yan had presented upon becoming his disciple, he would have no problem living a life of wealth and luxury, and could even take a few beautiful concubines - this lifetime would then pass by beautifully.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current situation, there did not seem to be any overwhelmingly powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if such existed, with Xu Yan's background, he had not been able to access them, so how could Li Xuan possibly access them?</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the viscera was proceeding smoothly and without any waves.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Xu Yan had tempered out his jade-like bones, his martial arts foundation was solid, and the refinement of the viscera was progressing very smoothly and orderly, with continuous advancement.</p><p></p><p>After two months of arduous cultivation, Xu Yan was about to complete the refinement of his viscera.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his viscera had almost transcended the physical state of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's strength had increased two to three times compared to when he first began refining his viscera.</p><p></p><p>Especially his qi and blood, which had become tremendously powerful, both in quality and quantity.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, his thick and robust qi and blood could at any moment burst out from his body, forming a protective shield.</p><p></p><p>"Within the next three to five days, I will be able to complete the refinement of my viscera."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the changes in his own body, Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>With the completion of the viscera refinement, the gateway to the martial dao would be right before him.</p><p></p><p>"According to my master's words, upon the perfection of the viscera refinement, the foundational realms of skin, bone, and viscera refinement will be integrated and summarized into one, and I will then be able to enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"At the time of entering the martial dao, the sinews and bones will thunder, and the qi and blood will be like a raging storm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind was immersed in contemplation, carefully experiencing his own self, how to integrate and unify, how to summarize his entire being and enter the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>It may seem simple and easy, but to truly integrate and unify, to summarize one's entire being, is not that simple.</p><p></p><p>"The skin, bones, and viscera are all parts of my body, so how do I integrate and unify them? How do I summarize my entire being? They are already part of my body, already belonging to the same being."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"No, I've misunderstood the direction.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that it lies in 'enlightenment', in 'intent', and not in form. To integrate and unify, to summarize one's entire being, is that the 'intent' or the 'qi and blood'?</p><p></p><p>"I have a vague understanding, but it's not enough.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, once I perfect the cultivation of my viscera, I'll contemplate more deeply on how to integrate and unify, how to summarize my entire being."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmed his mind and continued to cultivate his viscera.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Xu Yan perfected the cultivation of his viscera.</p><p></p><p>But he still had no clue how to integrate and unify, how to summarize his entire being.</p><p></p><p>His tendons and bones thundered, his qi and blood surging like a fierce gale, but he still couldn't achieve it.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm just a step away from entering the Martial Dao, just a step away from having qi and blood like a fierce gale, but I still can't break through the threshold.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I haven't been able to completely control my own self, that's why I haven't been able to enter the gate."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan carefully contemplated his own self, and he vaguely felt that he was about to break through.</p><p></p><p>He just needed that final step.</p><p></p><p>However, that final step seemed impossible to take.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists, his qi and blood surging, a faint layer of qi and blood appeared on his fists, scarlet like fire, with a fierce intensity, but it lacked solidity and was far from reaching the level of qi and blood like a fierce gale.</p><p></p><p>Let alone enveloping his entire body.</p><p></p><p>"I just need that final step, no need to rush, I will eventually enter it.</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do now is to relax myself, relax from the arduous cultivation. Only with a calm and free mind can I truly grasp the essence."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to relax himself, reducing his cultivation time, feeding the chickens, weeding the garden, tending to the crops, occasionally taking a leisurely ride on a horse.</p><p></p><p>"This foolish disciple, why is he not cultivating diligently anymore? Why does he seem to be just playing around?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi was puzzled, these past few days Xu Yan had not been cultivating arduously, but rather seemed to be in a state of leisure and play.</p><p></p><p>"He couldn't be doubting that I've been deceiving him, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After secretly observing Xu Yan for two days, he found that aside from not cultivating as arduously as before, the young man was still doing everything else as usual, and his attitude towards Li Xuanyi remained respectfully the same.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no sign of doubt, Li Xuanyi heaved a sigh of relief and did not rush to encourage Xu Yan to intensify his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I think I've gained some enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>That day, after finishing his dinner, Xu Yan began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The relaxation he had experienced these past few days, as well as his contemplation of his own self, suddenly led to an enlightenment on how to integrate and unify, how to summarize his entire being.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood circulated, from the skin to the bones, to the viscera, becoming a unified whole, integrating and unifying. In that instant, the qi and blood were no longer in a scattered state, but were consolidated into his entire being.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of his qi and blood consolidating into one, unifying, Xu Yan's control over his own qi and blood experienced a tremendous improvement, as the qi and blood continued to consolidate and unify.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the skin, bones, and viscera formed a complete cycle, and his qi and blood were surging, starting to emanate outwards.</p><p></p><p>His overall strength was also continuously skyrocketing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered a profound state, already oblivious to everything around him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long it had been, but the qi and blood emanating from his body became increasingly fierce, transforming from a mist-like state to a solidified form, continuously expanding outwards.</p><p></p><p>It only stopped expanding when it reached a distance of one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) from his body, and the qi and blood began to churn and undergo a metamorphosis, constantly solidifying.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

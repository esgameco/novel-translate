        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so this is the wonder of the Dao," sighed Li Xuan. Now that he had delved into the principles of the Taicangshu, he would no longer struggle as he had before, but find it much easier.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Shenxiang realm lies the Poxu realm, where one breaks free from the constraints of the laws of heaven and earth. And beyond Poxu is the realm where one touches upon the principles of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The principles of the Dao are the fundamental roots of heaven and earth. The martial cultivator's own martial dao principles should also be elevated further, transforming into the dao principles of the martial cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"But this elevation is not easily achieved. For the martial cultivator, the physical body and spiritual soul are akin to heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>As he broke through the Shenxiang realm, Li Xuan gained deeper insights into the principles of the Dao. He had developed more profound thoughts about the martial realms beyond Poxu.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had already gained inspiration for the next two or three realms.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll be busy for a while," he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan would now immerse himself fully in his grand martial dao undertaking, continuously refining and strengthening the martial dao he had created. The Shentong Wudian was still not yet complete.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to further perfect the subsequent cultivation of Mengchong's physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll pass on the demonic clan's divine abilities to the Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Xuan utilized the powers of his demonic ancestor's true body to transmit the demonic clan's divine abilities to the Red Cat in a dream-like manner.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianliang State, within the Demon King's Palace, the Red Cat suddenly had a moment of clarity, as if its consciousness had entered a dream world. There it saw its master.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the Red Cat transformed into its chubby cat form and scurried to its master's feet, meowing affectionately, trying to curry favor, as it would even in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite an interesting big cat," chuckled Li Xuan, patting the Red Cat's plump head. "Alright, enough with the cute act. Since you've established the demonic clan, I shall pass on the demonic clan's divine abilities to you. You must remember them well and cultivate them diligently to strengthen the demonic clan."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued, "If you want to fully control those spirit beasts, you can confidently pass on the great demonic techniques to them without fear of losing control. You can also gain insights from that."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not say more. Using a demonic art, he transmitted the diagrams of the demonic clan's divine abilities into the Red Cat's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After the transmission, Li Xuan once again patted the Red Cat's plump head, saying, "Alright, you go ahead and cultivate them well."</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered, and the Red Cat returned to its senses, its eyes filled with confusion. Could it be that it had simply missed its master so much that it dreamed this? But then it noticed the diagrams of the demonic clan's divine abilities in its mind - its master had truly passed them on.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow, the Red Cat will definitely work hard to strengthen the demonic clan!" the Red Cat understood that its master had seen its establishment of the demonic clan and thus imparted these techniques, giving it more means to develop and grow the demonic clan.</p><p></p><p>After passing on the demonic clan's divine abilities to the Red Cat, Li Xuan immersed himself wholeheartedly in his grand martial dao undertaking, further perfecting and strengthening the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>He compiled the cultivation theories for the realms beyond Poxu, refined the cultivation methods for the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body, and edited the Shentong Wudian, among other tasks.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he would occasionally take time to delve into the principles of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>"Martial dao is so difficult. I rack my brain every day, and even the arduous compilation of martial dao is no easy feat. There are probably not many martial cultivators who toil as hard as I do."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Although he did not have to cultivate arduously, the compilation of martial dao was still an immense undertaking.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan traveled towards the Yunshan State, he thoroughly organized and comprehended the martial dao of the Shenxiang realm. He had finally grasped it completely.</p><p></p><p>"The Poxu realm is too difficult to comprehend. Perhaps I will need to break through the Shentong realm and truly understand the profundities of divine abilities before I can gain insights into it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. It had taken him a considerable amount of time to comprehend the martial dao of the Shenxiang realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial dao of the Poxu realm, with his current cultivation level, it would likely be too challenging for him to grasp.</p><p></p><p>He was not in a hurry, though. For now, he would focus on perfecting his Shenyuan realm and accumulating a solid foundation. After breaking through to the Shentong realm, he could then attempt to comprehend the Poxu realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Miss Du and Miss Yun are doing."</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the Yunshan State, he naturally headed towards the Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Caicai had both entered the Lingyu with the Jade Token. Although they had ended up in the Taomiao Sect, a supreme sect in the Lingyu, given the Lingyu's strict hierarchy and the disdain towards those from the Inner Realm, their days there might not have been easy.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where Brother Xie is. I'll go ask Miss Du and Miss Yun about him."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Lingyu, there had been no news of Xie Lingfeng and his father, Xie Tiangheng. With the fame of the Changqingg√© spreading throughout the Lingyu, and Xu Yan's own name resounding there, Xie Lingfeng had not come to seek him out.</p><p></p><p>"With Brother Xie's talents, he should have already perfected the Shenmei realm. But without a subsequent cultivation method, he would be unable to break through further."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan headed towards the Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Xie father and son, along with the three Miss Dus, had entered the Lingyu together. Perhaps he could learn of Xie Lingfeng's whereabouts and go to the sect he had joined.</p><p></p><p>In the Yunshan State, the Genius Battle was raging. By now, all the participants were top-tier geniuses carefully cultivated by the supreme sects of the Lingyu. They all possessed extraordinary innate talents.</p><p></p><p>However, these so-called geniuses held no interest for Xu Yan. Their strength was simply not on the same level as his.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the inclination to take action against them.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Taimiao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the gates of the Taimiao Sect, Xu Yan looked up at the misty mountain peaks, unable to see the summit with his own eyes. Yet, he somehow felt a dreamlike, unreal quality about the peak.</p><p></p><p>"The Taimiao Sect is said to be the most deeply rooted and powerful sect among the supreme sects of the Lingyu. It has a truly transcendent, secluded aura."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped towards the Taimiao Sect gates.</p><p></p><p>Information about the Taimiao Sect surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Sect was predominantly female, with extremely high requirements for talent and appearance. This ensured that the number of Taimiao Sect disciples was far fewer than other supreme sects.</p><p></p><p>The male disciples were said to make up only about 20% of the total, and each one was renowned for his handsome looks.</p><p></p><p>"The male disciples of the Taimiao Sect are secretly referred to as the 'Taimiao Pretty Boys', lacking in masculine vigor..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mused to himself, recalling the information he had gathered about the Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Outsider men are not permitted to enter the Taimiao Sect gates!"</p><p></p><p>A young man with a fair, beardless face and handsome features blocked Xu Yan's path at the Taimiao Sect gates.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan appraised the man, sensing that his cultivation had reached the late Zhengshen Tianjun realm. His fair, beardless appearance and handsome features indeed gave off a rather "pretty boy" aura.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sword Immortal Xu Yan, here to visit old friends," Xu Yan cupped his hands and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Since outsider men were not allowed to enter, he would not insist on going in. He would simply have the man inform Miss Du and Miss Yun, and they could come down to meet him.</p><p></p><p>"You are Xu Yan?" the man's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's right," Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The man's expression changed drastically, and he frantically retreated, shouting loudly, "Xu Yan has come to block the entrance of Mount Taixi, elders, come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>While shouting, he frantically fled into the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan: ??? Is this man sick? Can't he hear? Didn't I just say I came to visit an old friend? Where did he get the idea that I'm here to block the entrance of Mount Taixi? Xu Yan was a bit dazed, watching the man's figure disappear into Mount Taixi, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p><p></p><p>There was no one left in front of the Mount Taixi gate. Xu Yan thought for a moment and stepped towards the gate of the Taixi Sect.</p><p></p><p>This nonsense about outsiders not being allowed to enter, it doesn't exist today.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Taixi Sect was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>After the Qianwu Hall, Xu Yan actually wants to block the gate of the Taixi Sect?</p><p></p><p>"How arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, don't think the Taixi Sect is as easy to bully as the Qianwu Hall!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder, let me go subdue him!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the disciples of the Taixi Sect began to gather towards the mountain gate, and the elders of the Taixi Sect also frowned and appeared before the man.</p><p></p><p>"Who does Xu Yan want to challenge?"</p><p></p><p>The man still had a panicked look in his eyes as he said, "He directly came to the gate of our Mount Taixi, saying he's here to visit an old friend. That must mean he's here to challenge us, to block our sect's mountain gate. Luckily I ran fast, otherwise he would have used me to assert his dominance!"</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan blocked the mountain gate of the Qianwu Hall back then, he used the warriors guarding the mountain gate to assert his dominance. If he hadn't run fast, once Xu Yan mentioned the name of the challenger, he would have probably found a way to use him to assert his dominance, forcing the Taixi Sect's genius to fight.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, his reputation as a fierce person is well-known.</p><p></p><p>After a series of speculations, the man became more and more frightened, his forehead even beading with cold sweat. At the same time, he was relieved that he reacted quickly and fled into the mountain gate in time.</p><p></p><p>The Taixi Sect elder's expression turned cold, Xu Yan was so arrogant, and he still wanted to use the mountain gate guards to assert his dominance? She moved her figure and headed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Behind her were the surging crowd of Taixi Sect disciples and a few other elders.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The elder hadn't even reached the mountain gate when she saw Xu Yan leisurely climbing the mountain, and she couldn't help but get angry.</p><p></p><p>"Where have I been outrageous? It's your Taixi Sect that has no manners. I came from afar to visit, and this is how you receive a guest? Or is it that you think I, Xu Yan, am not worthy of visiting your Taixi Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also looked displeased. He didn't come to cause trouble, so why were they accusing him like this?</p><p></p><p>"Visit? Aren't you here to block the gate of our Taixi Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The elder's gaze turned cold, and she angrily said, "The rules of my Taixi Sect state that outsiders are not allowed to enter. You actually dared to come to our mountain gate, this is desecrating my Taixi Sect. Today, I will capture you, and unless you repent and confess, you won't be allowed to leave the Taixi Sect!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she raised her hand to attack Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth gathered, the attack was ethereal, making it difficult to capture the trajectory of the attack.</p><p></p><p>"So what if I came to your Taixi Sect's mountain gate? Wasn't it you who were impolite first?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slapped out a palm.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A golden giant dragon thundered out, instantly blasting the elder away.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator who had only condensed two strands of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was already not worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>A golden giant dragon soared up from the foot of Mount Taixi, and on the dragon's head stood a handsome and majestic young man!</p><p></p><p>The originally surging crowd of Taixi Sect disciples were now all stunned, staring wide-eyed at the golden giant dragon soaring up from the foot of the mountain, and the young man standing on the dragon's head.</p><p></p><p>In front of the golden giant dragon, a figure was blasted up and fell to the ground - it was the elder who had come down the mountain to interrogate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one went to help him up, all of them were shocked by the Xu Yan riding the dragon.</p><p></p><p>The Taixi Sect's gate guard at this moment swallowed a mouthful of saliva, inwardly rejoicing that he reacted quickly, otherwise he would have been in trouble. Xu Yan really is as fierce as the rumors say!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is so handsome!"</p><p></p><p>A voice of admiration came from the crowd! "Yes, yes, Xu Yan is so handsome, so majestic, so..."</p><p></p><p>Many of the female Taixi Sect disciples exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The male disciples: ...</p><p></p><p>This is the enemy, sisters, can you have a little more integrity?!</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have no ill intentions, I have come to visit an old friend!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon under his feet disappeared, and he landed on the ground, calmly looking at the crowd of Taixi Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many beauties here, it's a good place to cultivate one's mind. But now I no longer need to cultivate my mind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, who are you here to visit? Does our Taixi Sect have your friends?"</p><p></p><p>The Taixi Sect's Protector Elder asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"My friends, Du Yuying and Yun Caicai, where are they?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Du Yuying and Yun Caicai?"</p><p></p><p>The Protector Elder frowned, never having heard of these two people, and turned back to ask the elder in charge of the disciple roster, "Does our Taixi Sect have such two disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, our Taixi Sect does not have the people you are looking for."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed. Du Yuying and Yun Caicai had the Taixi Jade Token to enter the Spiritual Realm, they must have entered the Taixi Sect. Could it be that because the two women came from the Inner Realm, something unexpected happened?</p><p></p><p>"My two friends came holding jade tokens, are you sure you don't know about them? Or did something unspeakable happen?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Xu Yan's tone became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Jade token?"</p><p></p><p>The Protector Elder paused for a moment, then said, "Our Taixi Sect has long since stopped issuing jade tokens. This so-called coming with jade tokens is impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, your friends' jade tokens are likely fake, our Taixi Sect does not have the people you are looking for!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, the Taixi Jade Tokens could not be fake, Du Yuying and Yun Caicai's jade tokens came from the same person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he said in a deep voice, "The jade tokens my friends hold were left by Xin Mengrou!"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The Protector Elder suddenly became furious, coldly shouting, "How dare you casually call my teacher's name? Xu Yan, I see you are courting death, coming to our Taixi Sect to provoke us. Today, I'll let you know the might of the Taixi Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, something seemed off about this matter, but the Protector Elder waved her hands, and a shower of petals fell, each petal containing a trace of the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, she was even stronger than the Saber Elder of the Qianwu Hall!</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had already made a move, Xu Yan was also impatient. He might as well go ask Xin Mengrou directly to clarify this.</p><p></p><p>If his friends really never came to the Taixi Sect, he could only go to Yuzhou and investigate the royal family of Zheng.</p><p></p><p>"The jade token my friends hold was left by Xin Mengrou. Whether it's real or not, let Xin Mengrou come out and you'll know!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out a palm, and eighteen golden giant dragons circled, roaring towards the Taixi Sect's Protector Elder, the might of the true dragon form shaking the surroundings, as if a true dragon had descended.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

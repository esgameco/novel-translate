        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was studying the third page of the Tai Cang Book while muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>It had been a while since he had received any feedback from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Has he already broken through the Divine Intent Realm and is about to return to the Inner Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated that the reason Xu Yan had not yet returned to the Inner Realm was that he was accumulating treasures in the Spirit Realm to bring back.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your sword dao disciple Xie Tian Heng has comprehended the Flying Rainbow Sword Intent, and your Flying Rainbow Sword Intent has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled. Xie Tian Heng had comprehended a sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The Flying Rainbow Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>The sword moves like a flying rainbow, swift and formless.</p><p></p><p>"The Flying Rainbow Sword Intent, it seems to be derived from the Flying Rainbow Sword Technique of the Sword Venerable Cliff. This sword intent is not weak, swift and formless, desolate like autumn."</p><p></p><p>A faint rainbow glow appeared on Li Xuan's body, then quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Now I have four sword intents."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's River and Mountain Sword Intent, Gentle Wind Sword Intent, Extinction Sword Intent, and now the Flying Rainbow Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>If Xie Ling Feng were to comprehend a sword intent as well, then he would possess five sword intents! "Not bad, my strength has increased again, my sword dao has been elevated, and I have more usable sword intents."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's feedback brought two sword intents, the River and Mountain Sword Intent and the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, while the Extinction Sword Intent was his own exclusive one.</p><p></p><p>The Flying Rainbow Sword Intent was the weakest.</p><p></p><p>The Gentle Wind Sword Intent targeted the divine soul, making it the most difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>The River and Mountain Sword Intent encompassed the myriad, and had already advanced to the third layer, where the sword intent merged with the environment, making it hard to detect.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a great mood and decided to take a boat and go fishing on the Cang River, enjoying some leisurely time.</p><p></p><p>It had been a while since he had felt this carefree and at ease.</p><p></p><p>So, he put away the Tai Cang Book, boarded a boat, and drifted on the Cang River, holding a fishing rod and casting it into the river, letting the small boat drift with the current.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak of Cang Lan Island, Meng Chong watched as his master drifted on the boat, fishing leisurely, and couldn't help but sigh, "Master's carefree and at-ease manner is like an ordinary person's, without the bearing of a powerful expert. Perhaps this is what Master calls the natural way of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Spontaneous, free, unbound by anything - this was the true state of a high-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Drifting on the river, Li Xuan caught a fish, ignited a wisp of spirit fire to cook it with some seasoning, and enjoyed his leisurely time.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has broken through to the Perfected Profound Realm, and your medicine and martial arts have been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had broken through to the Perfected Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, like Meng Chong, she had not rushed to continue her breakthrough, but was instead accumulating her foundation, intending to undergo a transformation and advancement when she broke through the Divine Intent Realm.</p><p></p><p>As a Green Wood Spirit Body, no matter how much she accumulated after breaking through the Profound Realm, she could not undergo another transformation and advancement. But breaking through the Divine Intent Realm would provide her that opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned from his boat trip, feeling refreshed. He sat in a chair, sipping spiritual tea and eating the spiritual pastries made by Su Ling Xiu, enjoying the tranquility.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Tai Cang Book and had just flipped to the third page when the Great Dao Golden Book on his spiritual platform opened, and golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has assassinated a Refining Divine Celestial, and you have obtained the Divine Oblivion Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"He assassinated a Refining Divine Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>This disciple, was he too fierce?</p><p></p><p>He had just broken through to the Divine Intent Realm, yet he had already assassinated a Refining Divine Celestial? "Even if Xu Yan had transformed into a Mountain and River Divine Bone, he shouldn't have been able to kill a Refining Divine Celestial... Did he use underhanded means to assassinate him?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly formed a conjecture.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Harmonious Coexistence Technique was profoundly mysterious, allowing him to conceal himself and launch a sneak attack. With his Gentle Wind Sword Intent that specialized in attacking the divine soul, it was not surprising that he could assassinate a Refining Divine Celestial who was caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Great Celestial, and your Divine Oblivion Technique has gained more experience."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Feedback continued to come, reporting Xu Yan's successive slaying of several Great Celestials.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Xu Yan has taken down an entire force?" Li Xuan's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current feedback, it seemed that Xu Yan had provoked - no, a force had provoked Xu Yan in the Spirit Realm, and after breaking through, Xu Yan used his advantages to assassinate their Refining Divine Celestials and then wiped out their stronghold!</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more plausible this possibility seemed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath to calm his excited heart.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xu Yan's assassination of the Refining Divine Celestial had triggered the feedback of the Divine Oblivion Technique, a nearly divine-level powerful technique. A single strike could annihilate both the physical body and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the Divine Oblivion Technique was unleashed, it would instantly triple the user's strength.</p><p></p><p>A triple-powered, nearly divine-level technique with a single devastating strike.</p><p></p><p>"Combined with a lethal strike, this power is truly formidable!" Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Oblivion Technique could slay Refining Divine Celestials as easily as crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it could easily crush even the top Refining Divine Celestials, Li Xuan was not certain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true strength of Refining Divine Celestials with Spirit Bodies was still unknown to him.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Xuan was confident that with his current strength, he could slay them as well.</p><p></p><p>But if he could not instantly crush them, it would tarnish his image as an invincible high-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"A lethal strike, the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, the Extinction Sword, the Divine Oblivion Technique, the Extinction Sword Intent... Combining them, even Refining Divine Celestials with Spirit Bodies could be reduced to ashes, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>There was no Refining Divine Celestial that could withstand his strike, unless he chose to spare their lives!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has taken down a force and slain Refining Divine Celestials, he should be ready to return to the Inner Realm by now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to prepare the techniques beyond the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan returned, he would surely need to refine and comprehend what he had gained in the Spirit Realm, and his strength would undoubtedly increase further.</p><p></p><p>He might even comprehend techniques at the Divine Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan had prepared the Esoteric Martial Dao, and the formation diagrams were ready as well, but he had lacked a suitable disciple to pass them on, so they had been temporarily set aside.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Great Celestial, and your Divine Oblivion Technique has gained more experience."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>He had just obtained the Divine Oblivion Technique, and yet it seemed he had already used it extensively, gaining rich experience.</p><p></p><p>"There are many martial dao celestials in the Spirit Realm, but why does it feel like Xu Yan keeps randomly encountering them, and they all seem to have ill intentions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt somewhat exasperated.</p><p></p><p>How many martial dao celestials had Xu Yan killed since entering the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, these were legendary, lofty figures that half-step Celestials had once looked up to and yearned to become. But when they encountered Xu Yan, they were slain one after another, like mere ants.</p><p></p><p>He had even assassinated a Refining Divine Celestial.</p><p></p><p>These were true powerhouses in the Spirit Realm!...</p><p></p><p>In the northern region of the Cang, the gate to the Spirit Realm opened.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had entered the Spirit Realm, the gate had not opened again.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Spirit Realm gate opened once more, and on the mountain peak where the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was located, the powerful experts of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion all tensed up, fearing what might emerge from the gate.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators who came from the Spirit Realm were the existence behind the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"What is the other party coming to the Inner Realm for?" </p><p>"As long as they are not coming to our Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, the rest of the matters are not your concern. The one on Canglan Island will naturally handle it."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man saw the person coming out of the Spirit Realm's gate, and he directly flew away, relieved that they did not come to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As the Pavilion Master, he was used to being superior and enjoying reverence. If the other party came to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, as a servant, he would have to kneel and welcome them respectfully. What worried him more was that if the other party felt he was not doing well enough, they might just slap him to death, which would be so frustrating.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm closed again.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he was now extremely excited. His harvest from the trip to the Spirit Realm was huge. He could now settle down in the Inner Realm for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>When he returned from the Spirit Realm, he seemed to have some difficulty adapting for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the Inner Realm was far inferior to that of the Spirit Realm. Moreover, the Heaven and Earth's spiritual mechanisms were not as active as in the Spirit Realm. This contrast was like going from a prosperous metropolis to a dilapidated, old village.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the cultivators from the Spirit Realm looked down on the Inner Realm as an inferior place.</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the Inner Realm?" Jade Little Dragon poked its head out from the sleeve, asking in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What's the problem?" Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy in the Inner Realm is scarce, and the Heaven and Earth's spiritual mechanisms are not active enough. How did you cultivate to become so strong?" Jade Little Dragon was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm was well known as an inferior place. Even if there were geniuses, confined in the Inner Realm, their strength would be limited and they could not break through the Martial Dao Celestial realm. Only by entering the Spirit Realm could they continue to improve themselves.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon never imagined that Xu Yan actually came from the Inner Realm and directly crushed the various geniuses of the Spirit Realm's Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy in the Inner Realm is scarce, so the cultivation is just a bit slower, that's all." Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Great Desolate Martial Dao did not depend on the activity of the Heaven and Earth's spiritual mechanisms. As long as he accumulated over time, his strength would continue to increase.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just a problem of scarce spiritual energy. The Inner Realm cannot break through the Martial Dao Celestial realm." Jade Little Dragon said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Then don't cultivate the Inner Realm's martial arts." Xu Yan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to know a lot about the Inner Realm?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"How the Inner Realm is, who in the Spirit Realm doesn't know? The cultivators of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families all call it an inferior place. Not to mention the incident of the Blood Demon fleeing to the Inner Realm, the entire Spirit Realm knows about it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. He had already learned about the Blood Demon incident in the Celestial Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"You are not cultivating the Inner Realm's martial arts?" Jade Little Dragon asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm has other martial arts?" Jade Little Dragon was shocked.</p><p></p><p>It had previously guessed that Xu Yan's cultivation might be different.</p><p></p><p>"There weren't any before, but now there are."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan restored his true appearance and headed towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"You are a spirit beast, confined by your bloodline. If you return to Canglan Island and ask the Scarlet Cat to teach you the Great Demon Cultivation, you will no longer be limited by your bloodline like a cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon's heart trembled, and it showed an expectant look towards the "Great Demon Cultivation" Xu Yan mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Could there really be a martial art that spirit beasts could cultivate?</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon did not ask further. Since it had come to the Inner Realm, it would naturally know the reasons. It even considered whether knowing too much would be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>One thing it had already determined was that it could not leave Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"My Jade Little Dragon's opportunity has arrived, the chance to realize my dream of becoming a true dragon must be grasped firmly."</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everything was as usual.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was cultivating on the mountain peak, accumulating his own foundation, while Zi Yun occasionally went to ask him for guidance in the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was researching the Pill Dao and Martial Dao, and her Void Refining Technique was becoming more and more proficient. She rarely used the Refining Furnace when concocting pills now.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, she would take the time to guide Pang Yao Shi and the group of pill disciples. Three of the pill disciples had already initially learned the basic pill concocting techniques and could independently refine the common pills needed in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if she went to the Spirit Realm, she would not have to worry about any problems with the Long Qing Hall's pills.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He, Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu were all working hard to break through their bottlenecks and prepare for the breakthrough to the Penetrating Profound Realm, although they had made some progress, they were still far from breaking through to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>The most leisurely person on the island was not Li Xuan, who was pondering the martial dao beyond spiritual techniques, and was even trying to create a new spiritual technique, although he seemed carefree and at ease, he was actually consuming a lot of Dao Essence from the Great Dao Golden Book every day.</p><p></p><p>The most leisurely person was Xu Mother. Apart from teaching the Scarlet Cat to read and write, she had no other tasks, and teaching the Scarlet Cat to read and write was her great pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Without reaching the Spiritual Technique Realm, trying to create a spiritual technique is still too difficult." Li Xuan sighed as he absorbed the insights from the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed, and he turned his head to look outside Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was back!</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you're back!" Meng Chong exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Flame'er is back?" Xu Mother, who was teaching the Scarlet Cat to read, was overjoyed. She grabbed the Scarlet Cat's tail and pulled it up in her hand, then ran out of the house. The Scarlet Cat looked dazed, like a fat orange cat being held by the tail.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's return made the entire Canglan Island lively.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan was the first one to return from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was very interested in what the Spirit Realm was like.</p><p></p><p>Xu Mother finally remembered the Scarlet Cat in her hand and hurriedly let it go, letting it sit at her feet.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat looked at Xu Yan curiously, waiting for him to recount the events of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, its eyes occasionally glanced at Xu Yan's sleeve, where there was an aura, not of a great demon, but not an ordinary fierce beast either.</p><p></p><p>A spirit beast!</p><p></p><p>After the greetings and paying respects to his parents and master, Xu Yan finally remembered to pull Jade Little Dragon out from his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"This is the spirit beast Jade Crystal Snake, called Jade Little Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon looked around at the people on Canglan Island. Its gaze swept over the seated Li Xuan, and it was greatly shocked. This master of Xu Yan's was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The bald, burly man also had a powerful aura that made it feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was also very light, with an agile spirit, making it want to get close to her.</p><p></p><p>The rest were all weak.</p><p></p><p>Only this cat seemed special, but it couldn't figure out the specifics of how it was special.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the Scarlet Cat that Xu Yan mentioned?

            <p>Chapter 65 Xu Yan Has Returned</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan has returned.</p><p></p><p>He came back carrying a large bundle.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put down the bundle and respectfully paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, it's good that you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Come, this is your junior brother Meng Chong, and this is your senior brother Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan called Meng Chong over.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother Meng Chong pays respects to senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you're too polite!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned the greeting, feeling a bit surprised in his heart - the master had actually taken in disciples!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, this is a gift for your arrival!"</p><p></p><p>Since there was a junior brother now, as the elder brother, he should also have some gesture.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a large sword from the bundle.</p><p></p><p>"This... thank you, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong touched his bald head, and humbly accepted the large sword. As soon as he held it, he was stunned - this sword seemed extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression changed slightly, that sword did not seem like an ordinary steel blade.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, where did you get this sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I obtained it from the imperial palace treasury, all these are what I took from the imperial palace treasury."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled excitedly, opening the bundle to reveal precious medicines, calligraphies, and jade artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, these are gifts that I've brought for you!"</p><p></p><p>"It's thoughtful of you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pleased that his disciple was so filial.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't really care much for these things anymore. After all, his mindset and horizons had changed after becoming a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at it enviously, muttering to himself, "Senior brother has brought gifts from the imperial palace for the master, but since I became a disciple, I haven't even brought a gift for the master yet. </p><p></p><p>When I have achieved in the martial dao, I'll go back to the Wu Kingdom, get ten thousand taels of gold from the Wu Emperor, and take a look at his treasury to see if there are any treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, inquiring about the details of Xu Yan's experiences. Xu Yan recounted the entire sequence of events in detail.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the old Emperor Qi to be quite a good person."</p><p></p><p>At the end, Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, the Emperor Qi was a decisive man, using his reputation to restrain Guo Rongshan, and for the sake of the great virtuous sage's reputation, Guo Rongshan definitely wouldn't rebel unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, you must remember that your strength has surpassed the imperial power, surpassed the Kingdom of Qi, in handling matters, there's no need to be timid..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, then talked about the Heaven Mother Sect: "That Kou Ruozhi actually wanted to make me the Heavenly Emperor Saint, trying to bind me to the Heaven Mother Sect, what a delusional fantasy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback, the Heavenly Emperor Saint?</p><p></p><p>How coincidental, that the other night the Taoist elder and the County Magistrate of Cloud Mountain also wanted to make him the Heavenly Emperor Saint.</p><p></p><p>And now this Kou Ruozhi in the prefecture city also wanted to make Xu Yan the Heavenly Emperor Saint, it could only be said that the Heaven Mother Sect people had been looking for a suitable person to be their Heavenly Emperor Saint all along.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's return, and both disciples present, Li Xuan focused more of his thoughts on the great martial dao, especially on perfecting Meng Chong's physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems that junior brother's cultivation method is a bit different."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cultivated very diligently, spending more than half of his time every day on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at it for a while, with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's natural talent lies in physical constitution, so I've passed down to him the physical martial dao, focusing on the cultivation of the physical body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan called Meng Chong over.</p><p></p><p>It was time to explain to the disciples the issues regarding the martial dao system.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, any new disciples that I take in may even develop their own branch of the martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you cultivate the orthodox martial arts, with a flawless jade-like physique and a pure martial dao. You have already achieved this, so I don't need to say much more about the cultivation of the orthodox martial arts, as you should understand it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mysterious aura enveloped him, and under his clear and tranquil state of mind, he appeared even more unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both startled, thinking that their master was truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong cultivates the physical body martial arts, focusing on the cultivation of the physical body. His strength is manifested in his physique, but he is not a brute."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Bell Covering is the foundational realm of the physical body martial arts, where the qi and blood are refined within the body, granting unparalleled defense..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan briefly explained the physical body martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The foundational peak realm of the orthodox martial arts is to refine a flawless jade-like physique, which is the supreme foundation of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"As for the physical body martial arts, the foundational peak realm is the Diamond Lotus Bone. Only by refining the Diamond Lotus Bone can one attain the supreme foundation of the physical body martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked Meng Chong seriously at the end.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was startled and respectfully replied, "Disciple understands. I will definitely not disappoint you, and I will definitely refine the Diamond Lotus Bone!"</p><p></p><p>"Your unwavering determination pleases me," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, which one is stronger, the orthodox martial arts or the physical body martial arts?" Xu Yan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The physical body martial arts sounded quite formidable. Cultivating to the Great Sun Golden Bell, with a body like golden bells, and unparalleled defense, it would be difficult to breach.</p><p></p><p>And the physical body strength would also be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled calmly and said, "Neither the orthodox martial arts nor the physical body martial arts are inherently stronger or weaker. The strength lies in the individual."</p><p></p><p>"Those who cultivate the orthodox martial arts start with a golden bone, while those who cultivate the physical body martial arts start with a bronze bone. Who is stronger, who is weaker?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if both reach the golden bone realm, who can comprehend more deeply, who has more experience in dealing with enemies, naturally that one will be stronger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded silently, his face filled with excitement as he looked at Meng Chong, "Brother, once you've entered the path, let's spar. The martial artists outside are all too weak, not even worth my time."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, brother, I'll wait for you to enter the path!" Meng Chong was also filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can ordinary people cultivate the martial arts? I want to pass the martial arts down to my family members and let them try it out!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan lowered his head and glanced at Li Xuan as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He needed the master's permission to transmit the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"You can pass it on if you want. But whether they can cultivate to the point of entering the path, and how long it will take, that's unknown. Everyone's martial talent is different, and those without any martial talent may never be able to enter the path their entire lives."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Xuan nodded and allowed Xu Yan to transmit the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The feedback for transmitting a completed cultivation method to others is low, but if more people cultivate it, perhaps there will be unexpected gains.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan wants to pass it on, it's a good opportunity to try it out.</p><p></p><p>The greatest harvest from the "golden finger" is the disciples he personally passes on the cultivation method to, and the unique cultivation methods they develop. If the cultivation method is perfected and then passed on to other disciples, the feedback would be lower.</p><p></p><p>But that doesn't mean there is no feedback, it's just that the feedback is very low.</p><p></p><p>What if the cultivation method is widely transmitted?</p><p></p><p>With more people cultivating it, the accumulation of small gains may lead to unexpected harvests.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan decided to let Xu Yan transmit the cultivation method and see what happens, as it's unknown how many people can successfully cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the martial dao ultimately depends on one's innate talent.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate diligently, strengthening yourself is the foundation. The martial dao is boundless!" Li Xuan encouraged.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned from his boat trip, sitting in a chair and leisurely sipping spiritual tea and eating spiritual cakes.</p><p></p><p>The red cat was sprawled out in the spiritual fruit grove on the island, snoring loudly. In recent days, the red cat had been sleeping more and more, as if it was entering a stage of transformation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still sitting cross-legged on the mountain peak, continuing to comprehend the essence of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was still consolidating the Heaven and Earth Bridge, constantly expanding and strengthening it, accumulating his own foundation, and also contemplating the Dao of the Sword, wishing to enter the realm of the Sword Heart Illumination.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan and several Taoist master scholars had already initially refined the Heaven and Earth Bridge and were in the process of consolidating it.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued to delve into the Medicinal and Martial Arts Classics, summarizing her insights, and according to her, she wanted to compile a new Medicinal and Martial Arts Classic.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was in the final stage of breaking through to the Transcendent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, it was as if a storm was approaching, crossing the Cang River and sweeping towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The majestic might was not at all concealed.</p><p></p><p>More astonishing and shocking than the previous assault of over a hundred peak sect masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up, his gaze calm, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the pinnacle of the Penetrating the Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>His strength was now far beyond what it was before. With a snap of his fingers, he could annihilate a Half-Step Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>A mere four Half-Step Celestial Beings were nothing more than a flick of his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"They've arrived just in time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still comprehending the essence of the sword, and now that the enemy had arrived, including Half-Step Celestial Beings, it was the perfect opportunity for Xu Yan to temper his sword intent and truly grasp its essence.</p><p></p><p>The people on Canglan Island all looked up in shock.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of powerful experts were crossing the Cang River, unabashedly attacking Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Who are they?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned. The last time, over fifty peak sect masters were all killed, yet someone still dared to come and seek their own demise?</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on the four figures in the lead.</p><p></p><p>Even the sleeping red cat was awakened, raising its head and letting out a low growl towards the approaching group. If its strength allowed, it would have already charged over and killed them.</p><p></p><p>How dare they disturb its sleep!</p><p></p><p>"Master, who are these people?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu came out of the house, quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they came for the medicinal pills of the Evergreen Pavilion? Was the deterrence from the previous battle not enough? The majestic might was like a raging storm, and the dozens of peak sect masters all had their faces concealed and identities hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over Su Lingxiu, and this battle can be avoided!"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the group.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was taken aback. Was this for her sake?</p><p></p><p>The Concealed Pavilion's master was already dead, so who else would want to capture her? Just then, a sword beam flashed across, striking the one who had spoken.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The group of peak sect masters' expressions changed, and they hurriedly moved to block the attack.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward, standing proudly, facing the group of powerful experts without the slightest fear.</p><p></p><p>"Either leave or die!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the one who had just spoken, wearing a red robe and a blue mask, and there were nine others dressed the same way.</p><p></p><p>In front of these ten red-robed blue-masked figures, there was also a white-robed blue-masked person.</p><p></p><p>They came from the same faction.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the black-robed Concealed Pavilion, whose purpose was also to capture his shijie.</p><p></p><p>"Half-Step Celestial Beings?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze slightly narrowed as he looked at the four white-robed blue-masked figures. Four Half-Step Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-masked man's gaze was cold as he looked at the proud young man, calmly saying, "Xu Yan, your talent is extraordinary. There's no need for you to perish here. Hand over Su Lingxiu, and we will leave."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I, Xu Yan, have never been threatened by anyone. Mere Half-Step Celestial Beings are still being presumptuous. It's just the right opportunity to temper my Dao of the Sword with you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the least bit afraid, coldly chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then don't blame us."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-masked man's gaze turned icy.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A frigid aura swept out, the blade light like icy frost, directly attacking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Master had made his move! Two sword beams flashed out in front of Xu Yan, forming a life-and-death sword wheel that kept attacking, with a faint wind-like aura permeating it, merging into the sword light.</p><p></p><p>With the Cold Master's attack, the white-robed blue-masked man and the other three led the group of peak sect masters to descend upon Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"One is not enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted coldly, raising a hand and unleashing a golden dragon's roar. The clouds and winds surged, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth constantly pouring into the golden dragon, making it seem almost sentient.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden dragon roared, charging towards the white-robed blue-masked man.</p><p></p><p>One of the other Half-Step Celestial Beings stepped out, meeting the golden dragon, joining the Cold Master in surrounding and attacking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"He must be killed. If he escapes, it will be a great trouble in the future!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-masked man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was too monstrous. It had not been long since he slew the peak sect masters, yet he was able to hold his own against two Half-Step Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>However, the priority now was to capture Su Lingxiu. Once she was in their hands, they could then surround and attack Xu Yan, even if that meant letting him escape for now.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the two Half-Step Celestial Beings attacking, there were also ten peak sect masters joining in to surround Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the least bit afraid. He had not even exerted his full strength, not using the Mountain and River Sword Dao or the Mountain and River Sword Intent, but instead was continuously displaying the fledgling new sword intent in the midst of the battle.</p><p></p><p>A faint wind-like aura, merging into the sword light, as if permeating and extinguishing all spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fought fiercely with the two Half-Step Celestial Beings and the ten peak sect masters. Thunderous sounds echoed in the sky, even pressing down the waters of the Cang River.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Su Lingxiu bit her lip, looking at her master, her eyes slightly reddening.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's because of me that I've brought you and my shixiong trouble."</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Concealed Pavilion want to capture her, but this unknown faction also wanted to seize her. What was the reason?</p><p></p><p>"Just focus on your cultivation. As long as your strength is powerful enough, this will not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly, without the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>It was likely related to Su Lingxiu's origins.</p><p></p><p>"Blue-Masked Ones!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What are the Blue-Masked Ones?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"One of the three most mysterious dark factions in the Inner Realm. All of them wear blue masks, and each Blue-Masked One is at least at the peak sect master level."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said gravely.</p><p></p><p>And the white-robed blue-masked man was clearly extremely powerful, far beyond just a peak sect master.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, come with me. Don't worry, I won't kill you. But if you don't comply, everyone here will die!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-masked man's gaze calmly looked at Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Then his gaze fell on Li Xuan, speaking indifferently, "No matter who you are, one person cannot monopolize everything. If you hand over the girl, we can discuss this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up, the jade talisman in his hand turning, and he chuckled lightly, "I don't care about your goals, but before you came, you should have first measured your own abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Whether Half-Step Celestial Beings or Martial Dao Celestial Beings, to me, they are no different than ants.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I shall not use my realm to intimidate you. Today, I shall let you frog-in-the-well fellows witness the might of one who has Penetrated the Mystery."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up.</p><p></p><p>Looking up into the sky, at those dozens of peak grand masters, he raised a hand.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others were immediately excited.</p><p></p><p>In the last battle at the Qingqing Pavilion, he was not there and had not seen the elders act, but now he was about to witness it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The elder is truly a superior person.</p><p></p><p>Not using realm to oppress others!</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the other Wudao scholars were also greatly excited. The power of Tongxuan, this is the power of the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor himself, how powerful is that? In terms of realm, Tongxuan corresponds to grand masters.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced man and another half-step Celestial Being immediately became solemn, their auras surging, already preparing to act!</p><p></p><p>Dozens of peak grand masters, their auras connected, their auras merging, a terrifying aura, like a cataclysmic storm.</p><p></p><p>"You are alone, let's see how you fare!"</p><p></p><p>A peak grand master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slapped his palm, and a golden dragon appeared in the sky, the clouds and wind churning, under the dragon's claws, it seemed to be controlling the power of wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-zhang golden dragon soared out, carrying a mighty momentum, like a true dragon descending, rushing towards the dozens of peak grand masters who had joined forces.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The power of the golden dragon was unmatched, fierce and unyielding, the raging wind and thunder, as soon as it entered the group of peak grand masters, it instantly annihilated more than a dozen of them.</p><p></p><p>One spiral dive, then a horizontal sweep, in just a few breaths, dozens of peak grand masters were reduced to ashes! Plop!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>This is the power of Tongxuan?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also in the Tongxuan realm, although extremely powerful, one person fighting two half-step Celestial Beings and ten peak grand masters, not losing at all.</p><p></p><p>But it's still quite far off.</p><p></p><p>Is this the power of the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor in the Tongxuan realm?</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced man and the other half-step Celestial Being were now terrified in their hearts, what an incredibly powerful strength? </p><p></p><p>Flee! Not even if the two of them joined forces, perhaps they would still be no match for this person!</p><p></p><p>Could it be, the opponent is a true Martial Dao Celestial Being?</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, don't leave!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent, raising a hand to grab, the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy in the sky turned into a cage-like prison, directly trapping the two.</p><p></p><p>He did not kill the white-robed blue-faced man, but kept him for Xu Yan to temper.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xu Yan was fighting more and more courageously, his new sword intent becoming clearer and clearer, he felt he was about to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>He slashed out a sword.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible wind suddenly blew into the opponents' minds.</p><p></p><p>One of the peak grand masters suddenly felt excruciating pain in his head, his vision darkening, his consciousness wavering, like a candle in the wind, about to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed, and he was instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind was calm, that feeling of comprehension was becoming stronger and stronger, the life-and-death sword wheel swept across, the remaining nine peak grand masters only felt their heads throbbing with pain, their vision darkening, their consciousness wavering.</p><p></p><p>Both their attacks and defenses were instantly lost.</p><p></p><p>Poof! In the sweeping of the life-and-death sword wheel, they were instantly reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Cold Husband and the other half-step Celestial Being were shocked, not daring to be careless at all, frantically attacking.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan blocked their attacks one sword after another, he felt he was about to comprehend the sword intent, but it still seemed to be lacking something.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, letting the white-robed blue-faced man and the other half-step Celestial Being who were attacking the prison break free, the two were overjoyed, hastily fleeing.</p><p></p><p>But a golden dragon suddenly appeared out of thin air, its tail slapping the two and sending them flying to where Xu Yan and Cold Husband were fighting.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced two rushed to attack Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Cold Husband and the other were fully focused, not daring to be distracted at all, joining forces to attack Xu Yan, when they suddenly saw the white-robed blue-faced two attacking, they thought they had caught Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Caught him?"</p><p></p><p>Cold Husband's voice was icy as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, just kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced one said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>They struck with full force.</p><p></p><p>Under the four-person assault, Xu Yan was suddenly at a disadvantage, for a moment it seemed he could not resist.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan suddenly slashed out a sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword did not have a fierce sword light, nor did it have a fierce sword intent, it was as if only a gentle breeze was blowing.</p><p></p><p>Facing this sword, the half-step Celestial Being initially just paused, puzzled in his heart, had Xu Yan already lost the strength to strike?</p><p></p><p>This sword seemed to have no power at all.</p><p></p><p>However, in that instant, he suddenly felt his spiritual consciousness being blown by a wind, this wind was not strong, but it seemed to have a sense of extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>His half-step Celestial Being's concentrated spiritual consciousness, like a weak candle, was swaying and slowly weakening, slowly extinguishing under this wind!</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>This half-step Celestial Being was horrified, he couldn't even have time to refine his spiritual consciousness to resist this strange wind, his spiritual consciousness was extinguished like a candle.</p><p></p><p>His intact corpse fell from the sky, only losing its spiritual consciousness, swept away by the aftershocks of the battle on the battlefield, instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced three were horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, flee!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced one mistakenly thought that Li Xuan had struck.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified beyond measure, this was a Martial Dao Celestial Being, absolutely a Martial Dao Celestial Being, otherwise how could there be such a terrifying strength, silently and invisibly killing a person!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan was greatly excited, he had comprehended it, he had finally grasped this sword intent.</p><p></p><p>He slashed towards the white-robed blue-faced one who was about to flee.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword intent was like a gentle breeze, penetrating everywhere, directly invading the other's spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of secret technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed blue-faced one was horrified, frantically concentrating his spiritual consciousness, trying to resist this strange breeze, trying to resist that extinguishing intent.</p><p></p><p>Poof! However, he was ultimately only a half-step Celestial Being, the spiritual consciousness he had cultivated was not strong enough, like a candle flame, blown out after a few puffs.</p><p></p><p>His corpse fell from the sky!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cold Husband and the other half-step Celestial Being both had horrified expressions, looking at Xu Yan with a frightened gaze.</p><p></p><p>And Cold Husband just realized that the dozens of peak grand masters had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Not that they had fled, but that they had died!</p><p></p><p>In such a short time!</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, why did you capture my shijie!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked coldly at the two.</p><p></p><p>"I... I don't know, you ask him!"</p><p></p><p>The other half-step Celestial Being said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out a sword! Poof! The other only resisted for a while before his spiritual consciousness was extinguished, his corpse falling down.</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked indifferently at Cold Husband! Plop!</p><p></p><p>Cold Husband's expression changed drastically, he was the only one left now.</p><p></p><p>His lips moved, after a long while he said, "It was the blue-faced white demon who found me, I don't know the specific reason, only that it seems to be related to breaking through to the Martial Dao Celestial Being realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, related to breaking through to the Martial Dao Celestial Being realm?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Husband suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>A cold aura surged into the long saber.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was crumbling, Cold Husband's spirit blood was all icy cold, he poured everything into this one sword.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual consciousness was attached to the icy long saber.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The saber slashed towards Xu Yan! (Chapter end)</p>

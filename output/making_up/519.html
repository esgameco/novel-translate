        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since an agreement had been reached, at the crucial moment, they would need to be close to the Taicang realm to exert all the power of the witch-demon world to resist the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up towards the outside of the realm. Due to the restrictions of the laws of heaven and earth, except for realm lord level experts, no other martial artists from the Taicang realm could transcend the realm and enter the Unchanging Land. </p><p></p><p>So now, Xu Yan also could not leave the Taicang realm to enter the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>"Witch-demons? Is Meiwu going to enter Taicang?" Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Meiwu had helped him somewhat and given him some treasures.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where Meiwu's jade bamboo is," Xu Yan thought to himself. If just a small branch of that jade bamboo was already so extraordinary, the complete jade bamboo must be even more remarkable, definitely a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that jade bamboo seemed to be related to one of the seven realm lords, the lord of the Qingling realm. It was also called Qingling jade bamboo!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to comprehend the essence of heaven and earth. Although his comprehension at the Creation realm seemed to have hit a bottleneck, he was about to break through to small success in the Heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Meiwu and the others began to enter the Taicang realm. For a time, the Dao domain became lively.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's two realms were enough to accommodate the martial artists from the witch-demon world, as there weren't that many living beings in the witch-demon world to begin with.</p><p></p><p>In a broken realm, even the laws were decaying. If too many living beings were born, it would consume more of the realm's resources. Meiwu and the others had long been deliberately suppressing the number of living beings.</p><p></p><p>But because of this, the lower limit of strength for the witch-demons was relatively higher, as they had been cultivating for a longer time.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's two realms were divided into a demon realm and a witch realm, which in a sense also separated the witches and demons of the witch-demon world.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite lively," Li Xuan silently observed the living beings from the witch-demon world transferring to the Taicang realm, without interfering.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi also smiled. The more powerful experts and living beings there were in the Taicang realm, the more beneficial it was for him as the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"If we could devour the witch-demon world and incorporate it into Taicang, the Taicang realm would quickly improve by a level," Tianzi thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He felt some regret that he currently had no way to incorporate the witch-demon world, even though he operated the entire realm and had become the complete Heavenly Dao of the Taicang realm. He would still need some assistance to incorporate the witch-demon world.</p><p></p><p>"That Blood Demon fellow is quite interesting," Tianzi turned his attention back to Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>In the Taikun realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng stood quietly in front of a weathered stone platform.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Meiwu and the others have already entered Taicang," a somewhat tired voice came from within the stone platform.</p><p></p><p>"Has the situation already reached this point? Feng'er, if Taicang cannot be protected, take that hand and escape into the Unchanging Land. Follow the direction I gave you and flee as far as you can."</p><p></p><p>The tired voice sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Jiang Feng nodded, then after a moment of silence, added, "Master, Blood Ji's remnant soul may have disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"If it's gone, then it's gone," Taikun said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"But Blood Ji's soul still contained a trace of the Primordial Purple Light. Perhaps it could help Master recover from your old injuries?" Jiang Feng said somewhat reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult! A mere trace of the Primordial Purple Light's intent is not enough to help your master recover. Don't worry about it. When the great battle begins, your master will help you escape," Taikun said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Sorrow appeared in Jiang Feng's eyes. After a long silence, he asked, "Master, what about Tianshai? Can he really obtain the authority of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>The stone platform was silent for a long time before Taikun's voice sounded, "I don't know where his confidence comes from, but what Tianshai cannot achieve, Big Brother Taicang indeed left this opportunity to become the realm lord. But since it hasn't appeared until now, something unexpected must have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, that Tianzi fellow isn't dead yet. Getting Tianzi's approval isn't so easy.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, once Big Brother Taicang died, this realm had no hope. The fact that it has survived until now is thanks to Big Brother Taicang's greatness.</p><p></p><p>"Even if a second Taicang realm lord were to appear, they wouldn't be able to resist."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The stone platform shook slightly, and a scroll flew out.</p><p></p><p>"After such a long period of sedimentation and organization, I've managed to draw this map. These are the Unchanging Lands I once traversed, including the location of my birthplace.</p><p></p><p>"After you escape into the Unchanging Land, use this to explore and return to my birthplace. Try to find Big Brother Taicang's birthplace using the method I told you. Perhaps there will be some opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"If you truly find an opportunity and become powerful, you can seek revenge if you have enough strength. Otherwise, don't think about revenge."</p><p></p><p>Taikun rambled on as if making final arrangements.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Jiang Feng choked up.</p><p></p><p>He was of humble birth, orphaned at a young age, when he fortunately encountered his master who was wandering the realm. From then on, he embarked on the path of the strong, until he became a realm lord and took charge of the Taikun realm!</p><p></p><p>"Go now, prepare for the crisis. Taihe has probably made similar arrangements for Cangli. You can go with Cangli, at least you'll have a companion to support each other."</p><p></p><p>Taikun's voice sounded even more tired.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng nodded and was about to turn and leave when he suddenly thought of something and said, "Master, Tianshai has joined forces with Ao Lie, seemingly targeting the Carefree Realm Lord. The Carefree Realm Lord seems to be plotting something in the Divine Realm. Should we help the Carefree Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Carefree? Wasn't he lazy and uninvolved, indifferent to life and death? How is he plotting something now? Feng'er, you don't need to worry about it. Someone will naturally help Carefree, and besides, Tianshai and the others aren't capable of killing Carefree."</p><p></p><p>Taikun said with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng nodded and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Inside the stone platform, the aged Taikun had deep wrinkles on his face, as if he had little life force left. A gray energy swirled around him, constantly eroding him.</p><p></p><p>As an ancient minor realm lord, one of the earliest to follow Taicang, he had once obtained the Primordial Purple Light, and his strength ranked at the forefront among the minor realm lords.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the main powerhouses who participated in that battle back then, and he even killed a minor realm lord level expert from the Unchanging Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>In the final battle, he witnessed with his own eyes that last moment. He rushed into the battlefield, willing to fight to the death, but was affected by the aura of that one from the Unchanging Divine Temple, resulting in his current state.</p><p></p><p>If not for that palm strike that pushed him out of the battlefield at the last moment, he would have likely perished.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Taicang, even if the realm is destroyed, I won't let you be forgotten," Taikun murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe realm, also a major realm in the Dao domain, the one in charge was not the ancient minor realm lord Taihe, but his personal disciple Cangli.</p><p></p><p>Cangli was once called the Eighth Prodigy of Taicang by some minor realm lords, rumored to have received guidance from Taicang himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" At the foot of a hill, Cangli bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Since the crisis has arrived and the Taicang realm has reached its end, it's impossible to resist. They haven't witnessed the final battle, so they can't understand," Taihe's voice came from within the hill.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When crisis comes, take that bone and flee to the unchanging land," he said.</p><p></p><p>A book of maps flew out from the hill.</p><p></p><p>"This is drawn by your master, showing the unchanging lands I've traveled, including where I was born. I hope you can find it and not get lost in the unchanging land.</p><p></p><p>"Taikun has likely made similar arrangements. You can go together with Jiang Feng for company, and try to find Elder Taicang's birthplace. Perhaps you'll have some good fortune.</p><p></p><p>"If fortune favors you and you become lord of heaven and earth, able to create new realms, don't forget Taicang - that is your root!" Tahe said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. This disciple will never forget Taicang!" Cang Lie said reverently.</p><p></p><p>In the Taimiao Realm, amidst a sea of colorful flowers, there seemed to be a towering figure standing.</p><p></p><p>At some point, a soft sigh sounded, and that towering figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A graceful silhouette emerged from the colorful flower grove. Where she walked, things shattered like illusions. After leaving the flowers, she looked back to see the vibrant blooms had vanished, revealing the true appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was a place of ruins. The ethereal woman suddenly emanated a fierce aura, as domineering as a peerless ruler.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Two figures hurriedly arrived and prostrated themselves, their voices joyful.</p><p></p><p>"Rise. You've had a difficult time," said Taimiao, looking at her two disciples - one with a cold, domineering air, the other soft and dreamy. They were her personal disciples, one cultivating the Way of Dreams, the other the Way of Supreme Dominion.</p><p></p><p>Because she had fallen into contradiction, her two disciples had also come into conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Are Taikun and Tahe still around?" Taimiao asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we haven't heard of them. Rumors from years ago said they had perished. Now Jiang Feng rules the Taikun Realm, and Cang Lie rules the Tahe Realm."</p><p></p><p>Taimiao was silent for a long time, as if reminiscing about past years, or perhaps lamenting old friends.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianshe Realm, Meiwu arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshe, when are we going to settle accounts with Xiaoyao? I can't wait any longer!"</p><p></p><p>"Soon. We're already preparing to act. You must understand, Xiaoyao is after all the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes. If we make a move, we must ensure there are no mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"I'll await your news!" Meiwu turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In the Diying Realm, from the depths of the abyss, a figure like a cloud of mist or a shadow silently left the realm.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes looked towards the Divine Realm. With a single step, it entered silently. Even ordinary realm lords couldn't detect its traces.</p><p></p><p>The Diying Realm Lord had entered the Divine Realm on this day.</p><p></p><p>In the Yuyao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!" A few light coughs sounded as the Yuyao Realm Lord suddenly opened her eyes and looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"Diying, you've finally appeared!"</p><p></p><p>With a step, she instantly arrived outside the Yuyao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm? Is this aimed at Xiaoyao?"</p><p></p><p>Yuyao gave a cold laugh and was about to head to the Divine Realm when her expression suddenly changed. She looked up.</p><p></p><p>Two masked men blocked her path.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yuyao, you'd better rest quietly and recover," one said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang, when did you gain these two?" Yuyao's face darkened. These were two unfamiliar realm lords.</p><p></p><p>Although they were only weak realm lords, they were still realm lords.</p><p></p><p>"The two of you can't stop me!" </p><p></p><p>Yuyao waved her hand, and white light billowed forth. A thin, sharp blade gleaming with cutting intent instantly slashed out.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A battle between realm lords erupted!</p><p></p><p>In the True Dragon Realm, a dragon's roar sounded as Ao Lie rushed towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Diying Realm had fully merged with the Divine Realm, and the Dao Realm was unifying with the Divine Realm, even realm lord level experts could descend to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Realm was instantly in an uproar. Various realm lords emerged, looking towards the site of the realm lord battle. Some looked grave, others remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yuyao and those other two - are they Tianshe's people? Unfamiliar realm lords, Tianshe has hidden them well," one realm lord said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Is this aimed at Lord Xiaoyao?"</p><p></p><p>One realm lord took a step forward, preparing to descend to the Divine Realm, but was immediately locked onto by an energy.</p><p></p><p>"Why meddle in others' affairs? We should just watch the game played by the powerful," another realm lord said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The other realm lords fell silent, looking towards the Taikun and Tahe Realms.</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, Tahe and Taikun showed no reaction, as if not interfering in this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you dare kill my son! Disciple of Xiaoyao, you must die!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an angry roar rang out.</p><p></p><p>A realm lord, burning with killing intent, followed closely behind towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"That's Lord Wantao."</p><p></p><p>News that Lord Wantao's son had been killed, his body destroyed without a trace, had already spread. These realm lords had all heard about it.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao indulging his disciple to kill a realm lord's son had indeed broken the rules between them.</p><p></p><p>The battle between realm lords continued. Although injured and not fully recovered, Yuyao was one of the Taicang Seven Heroes after all. Fighting alone against two realm lords, she was not at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>However, she was still being held back.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianshe Realm, a figure emerged, its aura now powerful, intimidating many strong experts.</p><p></p><p>It was Tianshe!</p><p></p><p>The crowd of realm lords all looked solemn. Tianshe's strength was even greater than expected! Tianshe glanced in the direction of the Yuyao Realm, then walked step by step towards the Diying Realm. It was time to visit the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is Meiwu going to make a move too?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meiwu's figure appear, some realm lords' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"It's said Meiwu has a grudge against Xiaoyao!"</p><p></p><p>As Meiwu emerged, Duanwu, Liwu, Yanmo, Jumo, Bamo, and Chimo also appeared in succession.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, everyone was startled and looked towards the Taimiao Realm.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out of the Taimiao Realm, dreamlike and unreal, yet giving off an air of unrivaled dominance.</p><p></p><p>She gave a cold smile, raised her hand to grab at the air, and Dao power instantly surged forth, gathering in her palm. With a wave of her hand, she struck!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>An overwhelmingly powerful strike instantly descended before one of the realm lords fighting Yuyao.</p><p></p><p>That realm lord's expression changed drastically. He hurriedly moved to block, but was still blasted back thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>Yuyao seized the opportunity. Her form flickered, turning into a beam of white light, instantly escaping the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Tianshe halted his steps, looking gravely towards Taimiao.</p><p></p><p>The other realm lords all looked solemn. Taimiao, the ancient minor world's ruler, had actually left the Taimiao Realm this time. Was she going to assist Lord Xiaoyao?</p><p></p><p>Her first move had already demonstrated Taimiao's formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"Stop her!" Tianshe said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Duanwu, Bamo, and Chimo stepped forward, instantly revealing their true forms.</p><p></p><p>Bamo had a hideous horned head, giant eyes, and a wide nose. His whiskers were like steel needles, and a row of bone spikes protruded from his back. He emitted a low, rumbling sound.</p><p></p><p>Duanwu opened his hundred eyes, reflecting heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Chimo's body was bright red, wreathed in crimson demonic energy. In his hand he held a red halberd.</p><p></p><p>"Taimiao, why intervene?" Chimo said in a resonant voice.</p><p></p><p>Taimiao coldly refused to answer, but showed no fear. She directly made her move.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

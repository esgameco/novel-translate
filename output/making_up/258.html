        <h1>Chapter 258</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As a result, I got excited and gave up the position of the alliance leader.</p><p></p><p>"The transmission talisman, a groundbreaking item that can change the pattern of the martial dao realm of the spiritual domain, how can I not get excited?" </p><p></p><p>Yuguang was not dissatisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>The transmission talisman is absolutely a groundbreaking item in the martial dao realm, how could he not get excited? This excitement led the young man to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Liang is very strong, I am not his match, the strength of the Yushen Sect cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Yuguang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, one step at a time, starting from the spiritual ores of the Yushen Sect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know where the spiritual ores of the Yushen Sect are."</p><p></p><p>Yuguang smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance has not come out into the open, in order not to startle the snakes and avoid being discovered by the spiritual sect families, they would not actively explore important places like the Yushen Sect to avoid being discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Someone knows, as long as Brother Yuguang can help a little."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>To deal with spiritual sects and families, relying on scattered cultivators is not enough, even though the Wanshi Alliance is not weak in strength, but it is in the stage of secretly developing and growing, in order to avoid being discovered, they do not have much intelligence on the spiritual sect families.</p><p></p><p>The people of the spiritual sect families are the ones who truly understand the spiritual sects and families, after all, they are insiders.</p><p></p><p>And Shen Haizhou, the young master of the family, is a different one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as the young master of the family, Shen Haizhou is naturally not stupid, his willingness to provide intelligence must have his own purpose, whether it is to establish deeper friendship or to weaken the Yushen Sect and pave the way for the Shen family to take over.</p><p></p><p>As long as the friendship between the two parties still exists and it is beneficial to both parties, that is enough.</p><p></p><p>After a simple discussion of the plan, Fang Hao was about to continue refining the array tool and the transmission talisman, when Shi Er came over with a knife.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Fang, please help me refine this knife."</p><p></p><p>Yuguang, who was originally preparing to find a place to sit down and recuperate from his injuries, suddenly had a startled expression.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and took the serrated knife from Shi Er's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is... this is the Blood Spirit Knife?"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, looking up at Shi Er, feeling that it shouldn't be, then turning his head to look at the venerable senior sitting on the chair.</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed in shock, "Senior, are you the Demon Patriarch of the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Meng Chong's big palm slapped him on the head, "You are insulting my master, what is this Demon Patriarch? You are not even qualified to lick my master's feet!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong struck him on the head, and with Yuguang's strength that had basically recovered, he could have easily avoided it.</p><p></p><p>However, he was too shocked at the moment, and Meng Chong's palm was not meant to hurt him, so he did not dodge and was slapped solidly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is not the Demon Patriarch of the Blood Demon? Then what is the story behind this Blood Spirit Knife?"</p><p></p><p>Yuguang asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yuguang, a late-stage Refining Spirit Celestial, so shocked by the Blood Spirit Knife, Shi Er couldn't help but swallow his saliva, feeling that this knife was very hot.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the inner domain, because of this knife, that half-step Celestial wanted to come and kill him.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has come to the spiritual domain, this knife has attracted the attention of a late-stage Refining Spirit Celestial like Yuguang, if he carries this knife around in the spiritual domain, won't he be in danger everywhere?</p><p></p><p>"The knife of the Demon Patriarch of the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also somewhat surprised to see the Blood Spirit Knife.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were puzzled, does the Demon Patriarch have such a high status in the spiritual domain?</p><p></p><p>In the mural about the Demon Patriarch's life in the tomb, the information was quite brief, and after such a long time, how could they have imagined that the Demon Patriarch would still have such a fearsome reputation in the spiritual domain?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yuguang, what is your relationship with the Demon Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became alert.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Patriarch was killed by Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Yuguang stroked the Blood Spirit Knife and sighed, "I have no relationship with the Demon Patriarch. I suppose there is no one left in the entire spiritual domain who is related to the Demon Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"I just can't help but think of the formidable Demon Patriarch of the Blood Demon when I see this knife."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was full of curiosity, "My father told me about some things related to the Demon Patriarch, he was a true expert who shook the spiritual sects and families, slaughtering countless people, and the spiritual domain was once a river of blood!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his bald head, puzzled, "You say the Demon Patriarch is so powerful and terrifying the spiritual domain, why do I feel he is so sinister and despicable?"</p><p></p><p>When he was in danger, the Dao of the Knife awakened, and he comprehended the Dao of the Knife, and he killed the Demon Patriarch's remaining soul.</p><p></p><p>Yuguang was stunned and asked in shock, "You've seen the Demon Patriarch? He's not dead?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned and said, "The Demon Patriarch is dead, I killed him."</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, you killed the Demon Patriarch? Is the Demon Patriarch so weak?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The legendary Blood Demon Patriarch, with his terrifying reputation and powerful strength, fell at the hands of his Second Brother? Meng Chong shook his head and said, "The Demon Patriarch only had a remaining soul left, he set his sights on me, coveting my blood essence, so I killed him!"</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the Blood Spirit Knife, "This knife was obtained from the person he possessed."</p><p></p><p>Yuguang sighed, "The Demon Patriarch, after all, was unable to rise again."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but speak up, "As far as I know, the Demon Patriarch had three rises and falls, the spiritual sects and families were extremely wary of him, what exactly did he do in the spiritual domain?"</p><p></p><p>In the mural in the Demon Patriarch's tomb, it briefly introduced that the Demon Patriarch was born in obscurity, suffered bullying, and then became vengeful, etc., causing chaos in the spiritual domain and being hunted by many experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the content in the mural was quite brief, and some things might not have been recorded.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Yuguang returned the Blood Spirit Knife to Shi Er and sighed, "The Demon Patriarch was originally an illegitimate child of a powerful family. In the strict hierarchy of the spiritual domain, and his talents were not particularly outstanding, he naturally suffered bullying..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others listened curiously, and Fang Hao was the same, the information he knew about the Demon Patriarch from his father was rather rough.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Patriarch that Yuguang described was not much different from what Xu Yan saw in the tomb mural, Yuguang just made the details more specific.</p><p></p><p>"He actually blood-refined a top-tier family, achieving his invincible power..."</p><p></p><p>Yuguang's face showed an admiring expression, blood-refined a top-tier family, this was an incredibly powerful ability, an invincible stance.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Patriarch was absolutely an unforgettable figure in the history of the martial dao of the spiritual domain, the most renowned among the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Demon Patriarch encountered betrayal from those around him, and nearly died, or rather, everyone thought he was dead at the time. Centuries later, the Demon Patriarch rose again and swept away his enemies...</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Patriarch who rose for the second time still had a terrifying aura, the spiritual sects and families he destroyed were not few, he even killed the genius of a supreme spiritual sect.</p><p></p><p>"He rose by stepping on the geniuses of many spiritual sects and families, killing the peak experts of the spiritual sects and families, and achieving an invincible stance.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Demon Patriarch also encountered betrayal the second time, and was surrounded and killed by a group of experts, everyone thought he was dead, the spiritual sects and families had been on guard for centuries, and..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For a thousand years, the Demon Lord had been completely silent.</p><p></p><p>"When he rose for the third time, three thousand years later, he immediately began to bloodbath his enemies, offering the masses in blood sacrifice. He had truly become a demon.</p><p></p><p>"The calamity of the Blood Demon originated from this. He no longer believed in anyone, be it the noble Spiritual Sects or the scattered cultivators - in his eyes, they were all just food, resources for his invincible path..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end of the talk about the calamity of the Blood Demon, Yu Gao, a late-stage Refiner, even revealed a hint of fear. </p><p></p><p>His voice trembled as he said, "The Blood Demon's calamity reduced the warriors of the Spiritual Realm by one-twentieth. Yu Zhou was the last refuge for the Blood Demon, and directly lost one-fifth of its warriors!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but take a deep breath. The Demon Lord was truly an extraordinary evil person, no wonder the Spiritual Sects and noble families were so wary of him, driving him into the inner realm in the end, completely sealing off the gates of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cutting off contact with the inner realm was to cut off the Blood Demon's chance of returning.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also inwardly exclaimed in admiration. The Demon Lord was a ruthless person. It was no wonder that after being betrayed twice, and the cultivation method he practiced being inherently bloodthirsty, his mind had become twisted.</p><p></p><p>"Thrice fallen, thrice risen, this Demon Lord truly has great fortune. Even in the last battle, he didn't perish, and still had the chance to rise again. It's a pity that he set his sights on Meng Chong, and was completely destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head inwardly. If the Demon Lord hadn't targeted Meng Chong, he would still have the chance to rise again. And after the previous three lessons, he would undoubtedly be more cautious and harder to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that in the final battle, the powerhouses of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect used the foundation of their sect to forcibly suppress the Demon Lord's strength, severely injuring him.</p><p></p><p>"The impact of the Blood Demon's calamity was too great, so the Spiritual Sects and noble families issued a gag order. Therefore, even to this day, there are very few accounts of the Demon Lord's deeds that have been passed down.</p><p></p><p>"Except for those who experienced it firsthand, perhaps no one else knows the secrets and inside stories."</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao sighed, "The Demon Lord was once a person with great ambitions and dreams, a man of spirit who wanted to fight for a place for the scattered cultivators, and to bring down the high and mighty Spiritual Sects and noble families.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because the purpose of our Millennium Alliance is the same, that I understand more about the Demon Lord's affairs.</p><p></p><p>"When the Demon Lord swept through the Spiritual Sects and noble families, there was a saying that circulated among the scattered cultivators. </p><p></p><p>"It was precisely this saying that made the Spiritual Sects and noble families suppress the Demon Lord's deeds and issue a gag order. Anyone found spreading it among the scattered cultivators would be killed without mercy, and the informant would be greatly rewarded!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were immediately curious when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was the saying that made the Spiritual Sects and noble families so fearful?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, though appearing indifferent, was also secretly curious. He guessed that the Demon Lord's saying might have had an inspiring meaning of rebellion for the scattered cultivators, and that's why the Spiritual Sects and noble families went to great lengths to completely suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yu, what was the saying that made the Spiritual Sects and noble families so fearful?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao's expression became solemn as he said in a deep voice, "With the blood of the Spiritual Sects and noble families, I shall forge the foundation of my martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, "No wonder the Spiritual Sects and noble families had to suppress this saying. The Demon Lord was truly a remarkable person!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly and said, "The Demon Lord was indeed a fierce and formidable person, no wonder the Spiritual Sects and noble families feared him so much."</p><p></p><p>For Fang Hao, who hailed from the Spiritual Realm, and deeply felt the oppression of the Spiritual Sects and noble families on the lower-class cultivators, his blood was boiling with excitement. His eyes shone as he said, "Since I am the Alliance Master of Yu Zhou in the Millennium Alliance, one day I will tell the Spiritual Sects and noble families that Yu Zhou is not their Yu Zhou, but the Yu Zhou of all the people of Yu Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in addition to Fang Hao's pursuit of the Esoteric Martial Dao and his determination to forge his own unique Esoteric path, he had another ambition - to lead the Millennium Alliance of Yu Zhou to stand on equal footing with the Spiritual Sects and noble families, and fight for the freedom of the lower-class scattered cultivators of Yu Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Elder Yu will fully support the Alliance Master's cause!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yu, your injuries have almost healed, you should go stabilize the Millennium Alliance, so that the brothers in the alliance won't be harmed by the Spiritual Sects and noble families," Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Alliance Master!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao nodded, then revealed a flattering expression, "Alliance Master, during this suppression by the Spiritual Sects and noble families, some of the brothers in the alliance must have been injured, even severely. You see..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu rolled her eyes beside them and tossed out a medicinal pill, saying, "Here you go."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss Su!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank my junior brother instead," Su Ling Xiu waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Alliance Master!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Go on then," Fang Hao tossed a transmission talisman to Yu Gao and waved his hand, "I'll contact you through the talisman, await the news."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao excitedly took the transmission talisman and left immediately, the Millennium Alliance was waiting for him to stabilize the hearts of the people.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, the responsibilities of being an Alliance Master are quite heavy, aren't they?" Su Ling Xiu smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"All that I've learned must have a place to be used. I'm willing to try my best!" Fang Hao's chubby face was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Your senior sister supports you!" Su Ling Xiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, finding your own ambition is a good thing. If you need anything, just come find your senior brother," Xu Yan patted Fang Hao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Me too!" Meng Chong also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Of course they would support their own junior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother and sister!" Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Among the four disciples, Xu Yan and Meng Chong preferred freedom and had no desire to build forces. Their ambitions were simply to reach the peak of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Ling Xiu, although she had established the Evergreen Hall, she was also a hands-off boss, not fond of managing affairs or competing for power, and only had a deep interest in the Pill Dao and Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>So she could be said to have an ambition, which was to reach the pinnacle of the Pill Dao and Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Only the fourth disciple Fang Hao had a heart for conquest, a grand ambition to change the landscape of the Spiritual Realm, and the ambition to stand up to the Spiritual Sects and noble families.</p><p></p><p>Having an ambition means having motivation. While he had entered the Millennium Alliance and needed to compete with the powerhouses within to reach the top of the alliance, he also had to contend with the Spiritual Sects and noble families, making his environment much more perilous.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the greater the danger, the greater the opportunity to display his abilities, and his rise would be rapid.</p><p></p><p>Recently the plot has been too difficult to write, feeling a bit weary, thinking every day about how to advance the plot, my hair is falling out in clumps, almost going bald o(╥﹏╥)o</p><p>Seeking some monthly votes~~</p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

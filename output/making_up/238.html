        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Zheng Kingdom, the Zheng Emperor led a group of powerful members of the royal family and several high-ranking Zheng officials, kneeling on the ground. In front of them, two figures sat on chairs.</p><p></p><p>One was a man, with a white beard and wearing a purple robe, exuding an imposing presence without anger.</p><p></p><p>The other was a beautiful woman, wearing a light green dress, her hair tied in a bun, with an indifferent expression, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spirit Realm has opened. Transmit the message to the Inner Realm. Those who hold the Jade Token may enter the Spirit Realm and go to the Spirit Sect and Aristocratic Families that the Jade Token belongs to. The Zheng Kingdom is responsible for escorting the holders of the Jade Token to the forces that the Jade Token belongs to," the man said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor and the others were stunned. According to the original rules, it was not yet time for the gate to the Spirit Realm to open and allow the Jade Token holders to enter the Spirit Realm. Why was it opened early? Could it be that the gate to the Spirit Realm had already opened?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, the Zheng Emperor broke out in a cold sweat and knelt on the ground. "Your Eminence, the gate to the Spirit Realm has already opened, and the people of the Water Star Palace have entered the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>The man looked at him indifferently and said, "Just act according to the rules, there's no need to report it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Eminence!" </p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor heaved a sigh of relief. Acting according to the rules meant that the warriors of the Spirit Sects and Aristocratic Families could be allowed to open the gate to the Spirit Realm and enter the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor and the others bowed and withdrew, beginning to select personnel to be responsible for arranging the opening of the gate to the Spirit Realm and the escort of the Jade Token holders entering the Spirit Realm. This was the first time in nearly ten thousand years that the gate to the Spirit Realm was truly opened, allowing the warriors holding the Jade Tokens in the Inner Realm to enter the Spirit Realm and go to the forces that the Jade Tokens belonged to. There was no room for carelessness.</p><p></p><p>The task of the Zheng royal family was this. If there were any mistakes, the Zheng Kingdom would be ruined. Of course, as long as they fulfilled their responsibilities, even if someone attacked the Jade Token holders and the Zheng Kingdom was unable to protect them, they would not be punished. The superior Spirit Sect would pursue the attacker.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Zheng Kingdom did not fulfill its duties and was negligent, that would be a grave offense!</p><p></p><p>According to past rules, important Jade Token holders would naturally have the forces that the Jade Tokens belonged to escort them, not needing the Zheng Kingdom's escort. But the current situation was different, and it was unknown whether there were Jade Token holders in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yaron, I didn't expect that Taixuan Mountain would send you here. How is your venerable teacher?" the man asked the beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure King is thoughtful. My teacher is well," Yaron replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Azure King, a powerful figure who had risen in the Great Zhou Kingdom in the past hundred years, was already in the late stage of Refining the Spirit. It was a foregone conclusion that he would one day reach the peak of Refining the Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Azure King seemed to have gotten used to Yaron's indifferent attitude and continued to ask, "When your teacher entered the Inner Realm and slew the Blood Demon Patriarch, did he completely eliminate the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon is dead. My teacher personally buried him," Yaron said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon is cunning, rising three times after falling. Although your teacher's strength is unparalleled, and the Blood Demon was in a weakened state, the relationship between your teacher and the Blood Demon..."</p><p></p><p>The Azure King hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Yaron suddenly said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Azure King sighed and said, "You don't need to be angry. You should know that my grandfather, the previous Azure King, died at the hands of the Blood Demon in the Inner Realm. My father was mediocre and could not inherit the title of Azure King. I have painstakingly inherited the title of Azure King. The Blood Demon is a deep grudge for me. Although I trust your teacher, the Blood Demon is so cunning, and I'm most afraid that your teacher will be soft-hearted."</p><p></p><p>Yaron looked at him coldly and said, "My teacher has long since abandoned love and hatred, slaying the Blood Demon, cutting off worldly attachments, and breaking through the shackles..."</p><p></p><p>The Azure King was shocked, looking at Yaron, and took a deep breath, saying, "Your teacher has already taken that step?"</p><p></p><p>Yaron turned her head and no longer paid attention to him.</p><p></p><p>In the hall of the gate to the Spirit Realm, the two guardians were startled and hurriedly paid their respects, "Greetings, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor had actually come in person. Could it be that they had already determined that the young man was the Blood Demon, and the Emperor had come to punish him?</p><p></p><p>"Open the gate to the Spirit Realm, transmit the message to the Inner Realm. Those who hold the Jade Token may enter the Spirit Realm, for a period of one month," the Zheng Emperor ordered solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The two guardians heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, they were puzzled. Why was the gate to the Spirit Realm opened early?</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm opened, not just a crack, but completely. At the same time, an elder following the Zheng Emperor stepped into the gate and entered the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Northern Wilderness, the powerful figures of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion were alerted by the brilliant light. They stood on the mountain peak, looking towards the gate to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the complete opening of the gate to the Spirit Realm?" the purple-capped man exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a massive gate, with rippling light, stood towering between heaven and earth. A surge of dense spiritual energy flowed from the gate into the Inner Realm, causing the spiritual energy density within a hundred-mile radius to instantly double. The heavenly spiritual mechanisms in the area also became more active.</p><p></p><p>An elder walked out of the gate, frowning slightly, finding the spiritual energy in the Inner Realm too thin, and looked up towards the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>With a single step, he arrived at the peak of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. The purple-capped man saw him and immediately trembled, kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>The other powerful figures of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion hurriedly knelt, not daring to offend the powerful figure behind the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The elder looked down at the purple-capped man indifferently and said, "Transmit the message to the entire Inner Realm. Those who hold the Jade Token may enter the Spirit Realm, for a period of one month."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-capped man's heart trembled, hurriedly responding respectfully. He was greatly shocked. Why was the gate to the Spirit Realm suddenly opened, allowing the Jade Token holders to enter? What was the Jade Token?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the purple-capped man realized that he seemed to have missed this important information. If he had possessed the Jade Token, would his situation have been different?</p><p></p><p>After the elder delivered the message, he seemed to find the thin spiritual energy in the Inner Realm quite distasteful and turned to return to the gate to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the elder entered the gate, the people of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion dared to stand up and hurriedly transmit the message through the channels of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to the entire Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Jade Token was, those who understood would naturally understand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Meng Chong was preparing to break through.</p><p></p><p>Two beautiful figures floated over, both exquisitely beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu," Yun Caicai smiled charmingly at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yun, what brings you here?" Xu Yan asked directly as usual.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there is an important matter." </p><p></p><p>While Yun Caicai and Xu Yan were conversing, the Peerless Grand Master kept glancing at Li Xuan, Xu Yan's teacher, who looked surprisingly young and handsome.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up and saw the fully matured beauty, and if his mind was not so clear and unperturbed by external things, he might have been stirred by her beauty and charm.</p><p></p><p>"Peerless Master has greeted the senior," the woman said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded slightly and no longer looked at her.</p><p></p><p>The woman walked over coquettishly, radiating an alluring aura at all times, and politely asked, "Senior, this disciple has a doubt in the martial dao, may I ask the senior for guidance?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Perplexed?" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao, who was conversing with Xu Yan, blushed and her gaze became very awkward. What was her master doing? Could it be that she actually dared to try and seduce Xu Yan's master?</p><p></p><p>"How embarrassing!" "What major event has occurred?" Xu Yan did not pay attention to the Grand Master of Peerless' little movements. With his master's realm, even such feeble seduction would not even warrant a glance.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan indeed did not look directly at Peerless, but his gaze slightly lifted, glancing at Peerless as she bent down to ask for guidance. Whether intentional or not, he caught a glimpse of her snow-white contours that were half-exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Majestic and round like jade!" He sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His expression remained calm and unruffled, not swayed by beauty.</p><p></p><p>He spoke in an indifferent tone, "Seduction can be considered a technique to disturb the mind, to confuse one's will... Used skillfully, it can be effective against enemies, but used recklessly, it will only lead to one's own downfall."</p><p></p><p>Peerless' face flushed red with embarrassment. "Thank you, senior, for the guidance."</p><p></p><p>However, her skin was thick, and she was very curious about Li Xuan, Xu Yan's master. Thus, she took the opportunity to stand beside Li Xuan, pouring tea for him while respectfully saying, "Senior is a distinguished person. Please provide more guidance."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao glanced at her master a few times, then no longer paid attention. Her master should know the proper boundaries, right?</p><p></p><p>She looked at Xu Yan with a serious expression and said, "The gate to the Spirit Realm has opened."</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spirit Realm has already opened, I know this." Xu Yan was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>He had already been to the Spirit Realm and returned.</p><p></p><p>"This time it has completely opened, and a summons has been sent to the inner domain of the world. All who hold a Jade Token may enter the Spirit Realm, for a period of one month!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan suddenly realized. He thought of Du Yuying. Since the gate to the Spirit Realm had opened, Du Yuying should have entered the Spirit Realm as well, right? "Miss Du holds the Taixuan Jade Token, and the Taixuan Sect is one of the supreme Spirit Sects."</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, Xu Yan had already learned the basic information about the several supreme Spirit Sects.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Sect was one of the supreme Spirit Sects.</p><p></p><p>And Du Yuying held the Taixuan Jade Token, and her bloodline originated from the powerful cultivators of the Taixuan Sect. Upon entering the Spirit Realm, her status and position would not be low.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Cloud, do you want a Jade Token?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao had helped him temper his mind, and he had some Jade Tokens. If Cloud Miaomiao needed one, he could give her a token to repay the favor of her previous assistance.</p><p></p><p>"I have a Jade Token." Cloud Miaomiao shook her head, her expression slightly expectant. "Young Master Xu, are you going to enter the Spirit Realm? Why don't you come with me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to politely decline when he suddenly looked up towards the island exterior. Two graceful figures were approaching.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Cui'er.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying greeted with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er's jade-like face flushed red as she sweetly called out.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao's elegant brows furrowed slightly as she looked at Du Yuying, her expression somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>After not seeing her for some time, Du Yuying's bearing had changed greatly, becoming more heroic and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, have you also come for the opening of the Spirit Realm gate?" Cloud Miaomiao asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Cloud, are you here for the same reason?" Du Yuying lightly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the two women, his expression pensive, and spoke, "You two ladies are both going to enter the Spirit Realm, and the hierarchy in the Spirit Realm is strict. As inner domain cultivators, if possible, you should help each other, as it will aid in establishing a foothold in the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Although both women held Jade Tokens, they were still inner domain cultivators. Even though Du Yuying held the Taixuan Jade Token, and her status in the outer realms might not be discriminated against due to the Taixuan Sect's identity, within the Taixuan Sect itself, it might not necessarily be the case.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu speaks rightly!" Du Yuying agreed obediently.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Miaomiao was surprised for a moment, as if she had thought of something, then also smiled and said, "Miaomiao will listen to Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er glared at Cloud Miaomiao, looking disgruntled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been guiding Peerless for a while, occasionally with a gossipy expression, observing the dynamics between Xu Yan and the two women, inwardly sighing that his disciple was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, with the opening of the Spirit Realm gate, where holders of Jade Tokens may enter, what are your thoughts?" Peerless asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Whether the inner domain or the Spirit Realm, they are but a corner of the world. I have no particular thoughts." Li Xuan spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Peerless was taken aback. In the senior's eyes, the inner domain and the Spirit Realm were just insignificant corners of the world. The news of the Spirit Realm gate opening, where Jade Token holders could enter, had already spread throughout the Great Wasteland. Many major forces were curious about what the Jade Tokens were, and some were desperately seeking the Jade Tokens and inquiring about related information.</p><p></p><p>But those who possessed the Jade Tokens remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wasteland Martial Arts Academy, Bai Yunkong frowned.</p><p></p><p>"According to the timeline, it shouldn't be now." </p><p></p><p>"Has it come early?" Pang Yu asked, "Does our academy still have any Jade Tokens?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon opened his hand, revealing three Jade Tokens.</p><p></p><p>"Give them to Xu Yan and Meng Chong. Should we choose one more person?"</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong probably don't need them." Bai Yunkon sighed, ultimately putting away the Jade Tokens. "The Seven Star Academy has already become the past, and the Jade Tokens are useless now.</p><p></p><p>"And the situation in the Spirit Realm is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Whether the forces that the Seven Star Academy connected to the Spirit Realm still existed, and the situation of the academy's ancestor, remained unknown.</p><p></p><p>The last time someone came, the information revealed that the academy's forces in the Spirit Realm were not doing well.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has gone to the Spirit Realm, I don't know when he will return. If he does return, we can ask him about the forces of the academy in the Spirit Realm, whether they still exist."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong should be going to the Spirit Realm as well. Let's go find him and ask."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon nodded, and the two set off for Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>In the northern regions of the Great Wasteland, cultivators continued to appear, rushing towards the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not have Jade Tokens, this was still an opportunity to enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>They had not turned to cultivate the Great Wasteland Dao, and was the Great Wasteland Dao truly more promising? Even if the Great Wasteland Dao was stronger, if they could cultivate in the Spirit Realm, would that not be better?</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the gate of the Spirit Realm, two guardians stood, looking at the surging cultivators and asking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No, no!" </p><p></p><p>"If we don't have a Jade Token, can we not enter?"</p><p></p><p>The group of cultivators spoke up, emboldened by their numbers.</p><p></p><p>"Those without a Jade Token cannot enter!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The aura of a Celestial Immortal erupted, directly intimidating the group of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse, and if you gather again to cause trouble, you will be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>One of the guardians spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the cultivators who wanted to enter the Spirit Realm turned deathly pale. They felt as if their spiritual consciousness was being pressed down by a great mountain, their entire bodies stiffening.</p><p></p><p>This was the might of a Dao Immortal?</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spirit Realm has opened. I do not wish to start a massacre, but if you are obstinate, do not blame me for acting ruthlessly!"</p><p></p><p>One of the guardians spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

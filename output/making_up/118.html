            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 118: Slapping a Grandmaster to Death with One Palm</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the Inner Realm, Xu Yan upheld the principle of keeping a low profile. Although he had a general understanding of the Inner Realm from what Xie Lingfeng and his shijie Su Lingxiu had told him, the actual experience was still quite different from what he had learned from books.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, Xu Yan found himself to be quite poor and his main concern was how to earn enough spirit crystals to purchase spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not worried about the people in the carriage, whether they had malicious intentions or not. Even though he had not yet become undefeatable in the Inner Realm, he could still easily defeat most grandmaster cultivators there.</p><p></p><p>The strongest person in this group was an injured grandmaster cultivator, who posed no threat at all. As long as Xu Yan had enough spirit crystals, he even hoped the others would have evil intentions so he could earn some spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I was entrusted by my late mother to bury her in our hometown. But on the way back, I encountered many dangers. I see that you are not weak, so I would like to make a deal with you - hire me to escort you and I will ensure your safe return. Would you be interested?" said Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows, realizing that even grandmaster protection was not safe, which meant Du Yuying's enemies must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I'm new to the Inner Realm and have no money on me. As for the major forces here that your shijie mentioned, they are all renowned powers. There are many sects and factions even just within the Great Yue Kingdom, not to mention outside of it. Escorting you back is fine. As for your enemies, if I can defeat them, I will; if not, I'll just run. I don't need to worry too much about getting involved, I can just use your brother's name," Xu Yan thought it through and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Escorting you is not a problem, but the price..." Xu Yan said with a smile, thinking Du Yuying's identity must be extraordinary and she should be able to offer a large sum of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred spirit crystals per day, how about that?" Du Yuying said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately dropped his smile and disdainfully said, "Are you trying to pay off a beggar?" He turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, young master. I meant one hundred spirit crystals per day," Du Yuying quickly clarified.</p><p></p><p>One hundred spirit crystals per day? Xu Yan's eyes lit up, that didn't sound too bad.</p><p></p><p>"How many days do you estimate the journey will take?" Xu Yan did not immediately agree, wanting to make sure the price was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"The path is perilous, so I cannot determine the exact number of days required," Du Yuying replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then one thousand spirit crystals as the starting price, plus one hundred per day. I'll agree to that," Xu Yan proposed after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Agreed!" Du Yuying readily accepted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but scratch his head, wondering if he had set the price too low.</p><p></p><p>"Give the young master a horse!" Du Yuying ordered.</p><p></p><p>After mounting the horse, Xu Yan leaned against the carriage and said, "Where are the spirit crystals? The one thousand must be paid upfront."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er opened the carriage curtain and handed Xu Yan a silver card about three inches long and as thin as paper. "This is a spirit token from the Tianbaoge, with a balance of one thousand."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan examined the token, seeing the Tianbaoge name engraved on it and a small rhombus-shaped seal on the back. Cui'er explained that the Tianbaoge was the only one capable of producing these tokens and counterfeiting them would be equivalent to declaring war on the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in understanding and rode the horse to follow the carriage as it departed the town, heading eastward. He didn't ask about the destination, as long as he got paid, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Du Yuying remained silent, while her maid Cui'er kept glancing at her, seemingly wanting to say something but holding back.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, how could you hire such an inexperienced person to escort us? He's at most at the Third Realm, how can he be of any help if we encounter a powerful enemy?" Cui'er finally couldn't resist asking.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was silent for a moment before replying, "This young man may seem inexperienced, but he has an aura of confidence. A Fifth Realm cultivator simply vanished in his hands. His strength should not be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er fell silent, realizing the dangers they must be facing on this homeward journey.</p><p></p><p>Riding alongside the carriage, Xu Yan found the guards to be extremely serious and vigilant, not at all interested in chatting with him. He couldn't help but wonder about the identity of the person they were escorting.</p><p></p><p>As they traveled further, the road narrowed and was surrounded by dense forests. The guards rode closely around the carriage, weapons at the ready, prepared to defend against any potential attacks.</p><p></p><p>To Xu Yan's surprise, they made it through the forest without encountering any ambushes. However, he couldn't resist asking, "Miss, who exactly are you that even grandmaster cultivators are after you?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's expression changed. "Young man, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"There's a grandmaster waiting up ahead," Xu Yan said, nodding ahead.</p><p></p><p>The group suddenly stopped, and a figure emerged from the forest, floating three feet off the ground. He had blood-red hair flowing in the wind, and a crimson long saber in his hand, emanating a bloodthirsty aura.</p><p></p><p>From the carriage, a middle-aged man with a pale face and unhealed injuries stepped out. "A Demonic Sect grandmaster?!" he exclaimed with grave concern. "Miss, I'll do my best to hold him off. You must hurry and leave!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying stepped out of the carriage, her bright eyes filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Turning to Xu Yan, she asked, "Young Master, have you dealt with the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the veiled woman, unable to see her face clearly, but her bright eyes and excellent figure exuded a heroic air, more refined than the palace ladies of the Qi Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I can, but you know, he's a Sect Master, very powerful. It's not easy for me to deal with him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the Cult Sect Master in front of them, who clearly was no good person, exuding a bloody aura, having likely killed many martial artists, and probably cultivating a murderous technique.</p><p></p><p>The Cult had a grudge against him! Both Blood Wuxin and this unknown Cult expert had nearly killed his sworn brother.</p><p></p><p>So, when encountering such Cult Sect Masters, he should kill them if possible.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan had not forgotten his task of earning spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Yuying's eyes lit up, her voice trembling with excitement, "If you kill him, one thousand spirit crystals!"</p><p></p><p>"Only one thousand spirit crystals for a Sect Master?" Xu Yan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's mouth twitched slightly, sensing from his tone that he didn't seem to value the Sect Master at all.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, one thousand spirit crystals is not little. After all, you promised to escort me, and that Sect Master should have some spirit crystals on him as well."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Killing the Sect Master, his belongings would be yours, wouldn't they?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes brightened, "That makes sense, then I'll go deal with him."</p><p></p><p>He rode his horse forward, boldly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's group watched nervously, and Yan Kuan's expression was particularly grave.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, we'd better be prepared to flee. I'll try to hold him back as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Xu Yan was just an inexperienced young man, arrogant and underestimating the power of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately, he is still young and impetuous, with outstanding talent, the more so, the more he looks down on everything, thinking even a Sect Master is nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been injured, he would never have let that young man go to his death.</p><p></p><p>But with his injuries, the young lady's safety was the priority, so that young man could only be pitied!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rode forward, looking at the Cult Sect Master hovering in the air, his aura gradually surging, and asked, "I have a question for you, do you know Blood Wuxin?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>The Cult Sect Master lifted his head, his eyes blood-red, and coldly said, "You know where Blood Wuxin is? Brat, speak up!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you want to see Blood Wuxin? Then let me send you to him." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grinned, "As a Cult Sect Master, killing and robbing is a common thing for you, you should have quite a few spirit crystals on you, right?"</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Cult Sect Master was furious, this brat actually treated him so lightly, seeing him as prey, didn't he know that a Sect Master could not be insulted?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A blood-red sword light burst forth, the might of the Sect Master undoubtedly revealed.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the others were horrified.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's expression was extremely grave, "He's a mid-stage Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>This sword strike, even in his prime, would not be easy for him to block, after all, he was only an initial-stage Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what this young man had said to provoke a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and slapped out, a golden dragon surging forth, its might terrifying, directly blasting away the sword light.</p><p></p><p>The dragon swooped down, its tail sweeping, with a bang, it hit the Cult Sect Master's head, instantly shattering it!</p><p></p><p>Plop!</p><p></p><p>The Cult Sect Master was dead!</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan stared with wide eyes, his hands trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Dead?</p><p></p><p>The Cult Sect Master, actually dead?</p><p></p><p>And that golden dragon, what kind of technique was that, so fierce and domineering, its might so shocking!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Was this young man a Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>Such a young Sect Master, and just starting out...</p><p></p><p>He was a bit afraid to imagine it!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's mouth slightly agape, although she had some guesses, she never imagined it would be true, that he was actually a young Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was his strength, that golden dragon had killed a mid-stage Sect Master with a single strike!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was an advanced Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>The expressionless guards were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, this... this..."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was delighted, feeling like she had found a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan dismounted, took a bag from the Cult Sect Master's body, opened it, and found a few spirit crystals and some spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed, took out the spirit tickets and had a look.</p><p></p><p>He immediately started cursing, "You're a Cult Sect Master, and this is all? A few hundred spirit crystals, how embarrassing! You deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>He had thought that as a Sect Master, and a Cult Sect Master at that, he must have killed many and robbed a lot, his wealth should be considerable.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, there were only five hundred spirit tickets!</p><p></p><p>He activated his true qi, crushing the corpse into ash, only in this way could he ensure the other was truly dead.</p><p></p><p>He remembered his master's teachings well.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the Cult Sect Master's sword, should be able to sell it for some money.</p><p></p><p>He rode back.</p><p></p><p>"You've killed him, where are the spirit crystals?"</p><p></p><p>He came to Du Yuying and held out his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was inwardly excited, with such a powerful Sect Master escorting her, she would surely return safely.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er took out a spirit ticket and handed it to him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily pocketed it, earning spirit crystals was not difficult at all.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan solemnly cupped his fists, "I am Yan Kuan, I haven't asked your..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, "Just a nameless nobody."</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's mouth twitched, he could only return to the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying turned and went back to the carriage, Xu Yan suddenly remembered something, raised the Cult Sect Master's sword and said, "This sword, do you want it? Name a price."</p><p></p><p>"One thousand spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying nodded.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er took out another spirit ticket and handed it to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed in his heart, he was finally not poor anymore, he had some money to buy spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>The group continued on their way.</p><p></p><p>That night, in the mountain forest, they rested.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the night.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, the might of a Sect Master surged.</p><p></p><p>Another Cult Sect Master expert.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, one thousand spirit crystals!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying decisively spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited, another thousand spirit crystals in hand, but he was also a bit puzzled, wasn't it said that in the Inner Realm, Sect Masters were also top-tier experts?</p><p></p><p>Why were one after another appearing?</p><p></p><p>"Get down here!"</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon roared, soaring into the sky, its might even more terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The incoming Cult Sect Master was horrified, hastily striking.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>With a palm strike, he killed a Sect Master, Xu Yan happily looted and crushed the remains, not giving the other a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Why are these Cult Sect Masters all so poor?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The Cult people often engaged in killing and robbing, their wealth should be abundant, but why were one or two of them so poor?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

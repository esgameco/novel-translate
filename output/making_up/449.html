        <h1>Chapter 449</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the peak of Zhongming Realm, Xu Yan stood proudly.</p><p></p><p>A figure descended from the sky and landed on the mountaintop, bowing respectfully. This person wore a Seven-Leaf Tiansha mask on their face.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Tiansha Diying headquarters in Zhongming Realm?" Xu Yan asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Zhongming Realm has three branch offices. I only know the location of one of them. The other two branches cannot be discovered," replied the Seven-Leaf Tiansha member, handing over a map.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the map and glanced at it, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>With the pawns he currently controlled infiltrating Tiansha Diying, he had still been unable to obtain the location of their headquarters.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know Tiansha Diying's true mission.</p><p></p><p>Each Tiansha member was responsible for their own assigned tasks, and had no knowledge of tasks not assigned to them.</p><p></p><p>If one tried to investigate information beyond their own mission, it would arouse Tiansha Diying's vigilance. One pawn had already been executed for this reason.</p><p></p><p>In the contest with Tiansha Diying up to now, the other side had also realized there were traitors within, and had strengthened their mechanisms to prevent leaks.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen," Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>So far, the known strongest member of Tiansha Diying, and even the one deploying their missions, was Tian Seventeen.</p><p></p><p>According to information from Red Cat, Tian Seventeen's strength was above the Immortal Realm, meaning Tiansha Diying had experts above the Immortal Realm hidden within their ranks.</p><p></p><p>"To destabilize the Divine Realm, to unify Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered. Everything Tiansha Diying was plotting was for the unification of Heaven and Earth. There must be supreme experts supporting them behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to infiltrate, and await orders," Xu Yan instructed. The Seven-Leaf Tiansha member vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to visit the great realms, like Taimiao Realm, Taikun Realm, or Tahe Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Only these great realms would know more of the Divine Realm's secrets.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Tahe Realm was the Divine Realm's greatest realm, and also its strongest. It was involved with methods to break through the upper limits of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Second junior brother went to Dayan Realm. He will likely have a great battle with the Treasure Alliance. Does the Treasure Alliance have experts above the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered. The Divine Realm had never had experts above the Immortal Realm appear before. But now that the Divine Realm was in turmoil, with people plotting to unify Heaven and Earth, it was possible that experts above the Immortal Realm might appear in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go to Bihai Realm first, or Taimiao Realm? Forget it, I'll go to Bihai Realm. I wonder how Brother Xie is doing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finally decided to visit Bihai Realm first.</p><p></p><p>He took a step and entered the void between Heaven and Earth. When he emerged from the void in the next moment, he was already tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness, Meng Chong sat cross-legged, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>"The Treasure Alliance is really something, sending over a dozen Immortal Lords to hunt me down. Today I'll be waiting for you to arrive."</p><p></p><p>This time, he was going to unleash a great slaughter.</p><p></p><p>After being hunted for so long, he had pent up a belly full of anger. Now that his strength had broken through, it was time to display his divine might and let the Treasure Alliance know the power of Meng Chong the Celestial God.</p><p></p><p>Since the Treasure Alliance refused to back down or admit their mistakes, thinking they could bully others with their strength, he would be even more domineering than them, and beat them until they submitted.</p><p></p><p>This wilderness would become the burial ground for his pursuers! Let these Immortal Lords witness the violence of the Fleshly Body Martial Way!</p><p></p><p>Swish swish!</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen figures arrived from all directions, instantly surrounding Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, today is your day of death!" declared the leader coldly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they had cornered Meng Chong in this wilderness, completely surrounding him. This time Meng Chong had no possibility of escape.</p><p></p><p>Although it was strange that Meng Chong wasn't fleeing, and seemed to be specifically waiting for their arrival, they didn't think much of it. After all, even if Meng Chong had broken through to the Immortal Realm, he would be no match for over a dozen of them.</p><p></p><p>"Day of death?" Meng Chong grinned, standing up and looking coldly at the dozen or so Immortal Lords. "Today is your day of death. Since your Treasure Alliance wants to bully others with your strength and refuse to admit your mistakes, I'll beat you until you do!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" The leader of the Treasure Alliance experts sneered.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Their auras erupted, the auras of over a dozen Immortal Lords intertwining, shaking Heaven and Earth. This area of Heaven and Earth was firmly under their control.</p><p></p><p>This area of Heaven and Earth seemed to have a solidifying force, sealing off this area. Ordinary Immortal Lords facing such a powerful control over Heaven and Earth would feel as if they had fallen into a quagmire.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant? You haven't seen true arrogance yet. Today I'll let you witness the might of a Celestial God!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Golden light burst forth, endless divine waves surged, a great sun appeared behind his head, and stars began to float around him. In an instant, Meng Chong transformed into a giant the size of a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Treasure Alliance Immortal Lords were instantly shocked. This scene was too impactful.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial way has this kid cultivated?" </p><p></p><p>This thought appeared in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally understood why Meng Chong was called the "Celestial God".</p><p></p><p>This scene truly seemed like the descent of a celestial god!</p><p></p><p>"Take my punch!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snorted coldly. His giant fist, like a great sun, suddenly smashed out towards the leader of the Treasure Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong's punch struck out, this area of Heaven and Earth under their control was instantly shattered. Heaven and Earth shook, and the laws of Heaven and Earth surged.</p><p></p><p>A giant fist instantly passed through the void of Heaven and Earth, appearing before that Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Meng Chong made his move, the crowd of Treasure Alliance experts' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>They finally understood why Meng Chong hadn't fled.</p><p></p><p>He had been deliberately waiting for their arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Attack together!"</p><p></p><p>That Immortal Lord frantically struck out to defend, but the power of that punch made him feel an intense crisis. His body frantically retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered contemptuously. One of his acupoints radiated starlight, and in an instant, the crowd of Immortal Lords felt as if they had fallen into a quagmire. Both their speed and strength became sluggish.</p><p></p><p>The Treasure Alliance experts' expressions were horrified, their hearts sinking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it had come to a matter of life and death. They all roared in anger, their auras surging as they directly unleashed powerful secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Those who could cultivate to the Immortal Lord realm were certainly not ordinary people. When it came time to be decisive, they absolutely did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Mere trifling skills."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>His already giant body grew even taller in the next moment, like a celestial god descending to the world, majestic and awe-inspiring. The great sun hung behind his head, stars densely dotted around him, wind and thunder grasped in his hands. With every movement, Heaven collapsed and Earth split!</p><p></p><p>Boom! One Immortal Lord, even exerting all his strength, was unable to withstand the attack. He was directly blasted apart by one punch, like a bloody firework exploding in midair before dissipating into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>The many fierce attacks raining down on Meng Chong's enormous body were unable to shake him in the slightest, let alone break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body didn't even tremble from the impacts.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, the powerful members of the Wanbao Alliance felt despair.</p><p></p><p>What kind of formidable enemy was this, and what terrifying technique had they cultivated?</p><p></p><p>Some even regretted in their hearts that they shouldn't have pursued Meng Chong, shouldn't have stubbornly refused to let him go, shouldn't have relentlessly attacked for the sake of the so-called prestige and face of the Wanbao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>An earth-shattering battle erupted in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>A god-like giant, with every move of his hands and feet, made the immortal lords bleed and explode one after another.</p><p></p><p>Some wanted to escape, but were restricted by a strange force, as if sinking into a quagmire, their movements sluggish, unable to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong embraced an immortal lord in his arms, and with a squeeze of his arms, instantly annihilated the opponent into ashes! Such a violent scene shocked the remaining immortal lords.</p><p></p><p>Someone begged for mercy!</p><p></p><p>"Coward, spineless, die!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smashed down with a fist, instantly killing the one begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>One of the immortal lords let out a terrified roar, then his physical body collapsed and his soul leapt out, fleeing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He actually abandoned his physical body to escape.</p><p></p><p>As soon as his soul fled, he was delighted to find that the quagmire-like force had disappeared, meaning the strange power seemed to only target physical bodies!</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered, his eyes blazing like suns, suddenly looking towards the fleeing soul.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! To the shock of the remaining immortal lords, that soul instantly perished, dissipating into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>Soul-killing technique?! Moreover, this technique was so powerful it directly annihilated the soul into nothingness! At this point, the remaining people knew there was no chance of escape.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, we'll fight you to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone roared, exhausting their lifelong cultivation to unleash techniques of mutual destruction, unleashing their strongest attacks of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Under such violent attacks, Meng Chong's form shook a few times and retreated half a step! But that was all!</p><p></p><p>Boom! As Meng Chong's fist fell like a sun, the remaining immortal lords all turned to ashes and dissipated!</p><p></p><p>"Exhilarating!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited. This was the violent battle that physical martial arts should have.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if your Wanbao Alliance dares to come hunt me again. I'll kill one for every one that comes!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>His aura receded as he looked towards the depths of the wilderness, taking large strides forward, crossing the wilderness towards the next realm.</p><p></p><p>"From here on is one of the great realms of the divine domain, the Great Flame Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Great Flame Realm was one of the great realms of the divine domain, and unlike other realms, it was ruled by the Great Flame Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>It was also the number one dynasty of the divine domain!</p><p></p><p>The Great Flame Dynasty, with the Zhou royal family, was also the superior dynasty to the Great Zhou Kingdom of the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>The Great Flame Realm had a heavenly cave, one of the ten great heavenly caves of the divine domain, suppressed by the Great Flame Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how that girl Zi Yun is doing."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He would go see an old friend in the Great Flame Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"After seeing the old friend, I'll head towards the Taikun Realm."</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Buping's breakthrough, he would also go to the Taikun Realm to seek justice and settle an old grudge. As his senior brother, he naturally had to go support him!</p><p></p><p>Great Flame Dynasty, Dongyang Prefecture, Dongyang Martial Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Great Flame Realm was the territory ruled by the Great Flame Dynasty, and within the dynasty, all forces were under the jurisdiction of the dynasty, and almost all had backgrounds as dynasty officials, otherwise they could not establish a foothold.</p><p></p><p>Dongyang Martial Academy was a dynasty academy, a place to cultivate martial arts prodigies for the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The Great Flame Dynasty had established martial academies in various places, where all prodigies could enter. If local officials recommended an extraordinary prodigy to enter the academy, they would receive rewards, which was considered an achievement!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the Great Flame Dynasty's series of systems that valued and cultivated prodigies that within the entire Great Flame Realm, if not all prodigies, 99.9% of prodigies were incorporated into the dynasty, serving the royal family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if prodigies were wronged or persecuted, as long as their talent was monstrous enough, the academy would step in to seek justice for them.</p><p></p><p>There was once an extraordinary prodigy of humble birth who was persecuted by local official forces. After much hardship, he finally escaped and participated in the academy's assessment. When his monstrous talent was discovered, he rose under the academy's protection and finally took revenge.</p><p></p><p>There was also an extraordinary prodigy whose enemies, fearing he would gain the academy's protection, killed him on his way to the academy. When this matter was exposed, the dynasty took thunderous measures, completely wiping out the forces that had killed the prodigy on the charge of persecuting a dynasty prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Because of a series of events that had occurred in the past, now in the Great Flame Dynasty, once an extraordinary prodigy was discovered, people would compete to recommend them to the academy to obtain rewards and dynasty achievements.</p><p></p><p>There were also prodigies who were arrogant and rude, doing whatever they wanted relying on their superior talent, and were eventually publicly beheaded by the dynasty!</p><p></p><p>This was to warn prodigies that while the dynasty could allow those with monstrous talent to do some out-of-line things, there had to be a limit. If they were unscrupulous and harmful, it would be considered rebellious intent and they must be executed!</p><p></p><p>Dongyang Prefecture was one of the great prefectures of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>And Dongyang Martial Academy was quite a famous academy of the dynasty. Moreover, this academy was somewhat special. Since it was designated to accept and cultivate prodigies from the spirit domain, the principals of Dongyang Martial Academy had all come from the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>More than half of the teachers in Dongyang Martial Academy were from the spirit domain, and even some of the academy students were from the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>Among the many prodigies from the spirit domain, there was one person with a resounding reputation who was also the biggest backer for all martial artists from the spirit domain in Dongyang Martial Academy and even all of the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>That was the important minister of the Great Flame Dynasty, the Marquis of Dongyang, Xiang Zhen!</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken through!"</p><p></p><p>In a closed room of Dongyang Martial Academy, a beautiful woman in purple robes opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Refining Truth Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to Dongyang Martial Academy, she had been diligently cultivating day and night, and finally broke through to the Refining Truth Realm today.</p><p></p><p>She walked out of the closed room.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level of strength Meng Chong has reached."</p><p></p><p>She missed Meng Chong terribly after not seeing him for so long.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on your breakthrough, Junior Sister Zi Yun," a senior sister of Dongyang Martial Academy said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky, just lucky!" Zi Yun said modestly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Junior Sister Zi Yun, something big happened in the divine domain while you were in closed cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what happened?" Zi Yun didn't care much about big events happening in the divine domain.</p><p></p><p>"You know about the Wanbao Alliance, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the number one merchant alliance in the divine domain, extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanbao Alliance has been hunting someone, but they've never been able to catch him. Instead, several of their branches have been looted..."</p><p></p><p>The senior sister became excited as she spoke about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I've heard about it too. That person is too fierce."</p><p></p><p>Gradually, nearby students of Dongyang Martial Academy gathered around.</p><p></p><p>Among these students, some were from the spirit domain, just having arrived a bit earlier than Zi Yun's batch.</p><p></p><p>Including that senior sister, who was once a princess of a prefecture in the Great Zhou Kingdom of the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

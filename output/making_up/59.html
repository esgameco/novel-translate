        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 59 Permian Yan's Journey to the Imperial Palace to Temper His Mind</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate of Yunshan nodded and said, "Okay, we'll mobilize the congregation to find the precious medicinal herbs, but we'll also need to keep some for ourselves. These precious herbs might be useful for cultivating martial arts."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the hemp robe also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er then said, "Moreover, the Venerable One wishes to see the Heavenly Mother."</p><p></p><p>"Then pass the message to the Heavenly Mother and let her decide for herself," the old man in the hemp robe decided.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the news of the Venerable One's presence in Yunshan County must not be leaked out, or else people from the Commandery City, or even the Capital City, will come to disturb the Venerable One!" </p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The group of experts from the Heavenly Mother Sect all nodded.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity is here, it's just a matter of who can seize it.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even tell people like Kou Ruozhi from the Commandery City.</p><p></p><p>Yunshan County was not very big, and Li Xuan had walked around for half an hour before returning to his residence.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard gate, a figure was standing with a bent back, holding a box in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"County Magistrate of Yunshan?" Li Xuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>These fellows, who usually avoided him like the plague, how come they were now coming to his door proactively?</p><p></p><p>"No, no, the Venerable One can just call me Little Mountain." The County Magistrate bowed and spoke in a very humble manner.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Venerable One is accepting disciples, so I've come to offer my congratulations. This is a small token of my appreciation, I hope the Venerable One will not disdain it!"</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate held up the box in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"That's very thoughtful of you, very thoughtful!" Li Xuan took the box.</p><p></p><p>"Since there's nothing else, then I'll take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, the man was quite tactful.</p><p></p><p>Entering the courtyard, he opened the box to find a ginseng plant.</p><p></p><p>"This is not just any ordinary thousand-year-old ginseng, the Heavenly Mother Sect has quite a few precious medicinal herbs. My disciple's cultivation needs will be well taken care of now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Just as he put down the ginseng, another person arrived.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair without moving, letting Meng Chong go open the door.</p><p></p><p>The visitor was the old man in the hemp robe, also bringing precious medicinal herbs as a gift.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't stand on ceremony, directly accepting them.</p><p></p><p>"In the boundless great mountains, there are actually so many precious medicinal herbs, it must be quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>His guess was further confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the specifics were still unclear.</p><p></p><p>The group of experts from the Heavenly Mother Sect came to his door one by one to pay their respects, and Li Xuan received them all.</p><p></p><p>He would accept the gifts, but if the Heavenly Mother Sect dared to cause trouble under his banner, they better not blame him for being impolite!</p><p></p><p>These medicinal herbs could be considered the "ransom money" of the Heavenly Mother Sect's experts.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was contemplating the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover in the courtyard, and had not made any breakthroughs yet. Li Xuan was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Shi Er came with a chicken.</p><p></p><p>However, he was quite tactful, not approaching Li Xuan directly, but handing the chicken to Meng Chong, smiling and saying, "Young Master Meng, this is the chicken you wanted!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Meng Chong took the chicken and went to slaughter and cook it into chicken soup.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er bowed to Li Xuan, who was sitting in the chair, and then left.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, he's quite a clever fellow."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently nodded as he watched Shi Er carefully close the courtyard gate behind him.</p><p></p><p>Having a runner like this could be useful.</p><p></p><p>Let's observe a bit more.</p><p></p><p>If he's clever enough and can get things done, he can be recruited as a servant.</p><p></p><p>After all, he can't always let his disciple do everything, since the disciple's main focus should be cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If the disciple doesn't diligently cultivate, how can Li Xuan improve his own strength?</p><p></p><p>In the Capital City of Qi, the shock brought by Yan's arrival had not yet subsided.</p><p></p><p>But the scions of many high-ranking officials, leading their guards and servants, had left the Capital City and gone to various great mountains in search of the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The imperial family had even mobilized all their intelligence forces and hidden spies, all for the sake of finding the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was even preparing to personally set out to seek the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>He had suffered the greatest losses in this upheaval.</p><p></p><p>Watching the position of Crown Prince, which he had almost grasped, slip away.</p><p></p><p>The ministers who had originally supported him now seemed to be avoiding him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Like a plague god, everyone kept their distance from him.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say who was the most aggrieved in the capital city, it would undoubtedly be Emperor Qi.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely aggrieved. As the sovereign of a country, he dared not show any displeasure towards a minister.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, Xu Yan was too overbearing!</p><p></p><p>He kept coming into the palace, especially going to the inner palace.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Emperor Qi himself and the underage princes, which man could enter the inner palace?</p><p></p><p>Yet, Xu Yan went in during the day and also at night!</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan was going there to sleep with the imperial consorts or princesses, Emperor Qi could have accepted it a little better, as at least he would have a way to win over Xu Yan by sending him consorts or princesses, which would be a small matter.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan claimed that he went to the inner palace to cultivate his mind!</p><p></p><p>According to his words, at his age, he was in the stage most susceptible to being moved by women. If he could remain unmoved by the beauty there and keep his mind calm without being disturbed, his martial dao heart would certainly become more steadfast!</p><p></p><p>He would not be disturbed by external things and could better comprehend the cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>The most beautiful women in the world are in the inner palace!</p><p></p><p>There are all kinds of beauties there, so that's why he kept going to the inner palace!</p><p></p><p>It would have been fine even if it was just that, but Xu Yan did not hide his visits to the inner palace from anyone.</p><p></p><p>How would the outside world see it?</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, they said that Xu Yan was entering the palace to cultivate his mind, that he did not sleep with the imperial consorts or princesses, but who would believe that?</p><p></p><p>The ministers' gazes towards him were not right!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the crown on his head was not a crown, but a green hat!</p><p></p><p>If he had really worn a green hat, it would have been fine, but the fact that he hadn't, yet was misunderstood and wronged, truly made him feel awful!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi was aggrieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan felt that Emperor Qi was quite a good person. Xu Yan went to the inner palace to cultivate his mind, and not only did Emperor Qi not get angry, he even had the imperial consorts dance to help Xu Yan with his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Old Emperor Qi is a pretty good person. Why would he want to copy my family? Could it be that the regional governor below is causing trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came out of the inner palace with a calm mind. He felt that his cultivation of the state of "no women in the heart" had made a huge breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>His martial dao heart was steadfast and would not be disturbed by external things.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that the state of 'no women in the heart' in cultivation is like having a divine presence, truly profound.</p><p></p><p>"At my age, I am most easily moved by women. If I can achieve this state, not being deluded by women, with a clear mind, naturally my comprehension of the cultivation methods will not be disturbed by external things.</p><p></p><p>"I can then wholeheartedly immerse myself in the comprehension of the cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more he felt that the state of "no women in the heart, cultivation like having a divine presence" was truly profound.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was at the age most susceptible to being moved by women. Women were the biggest external disturbance to him. If he could overcome this, any external thing would not be able to disturb his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he had achieved this.</p><p></p><p>The imperial consorts in Emperor Qi's palace were beauties, but he was unmoved!</p><p></p><p>"I have vaguely comprehended the cultivation methods of the Innate Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was happy in his heart. As he walked out of the inner palace, the ministers were just finishing their court session and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan, they all had strange expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Another trip out of the inner palace?</p><p></p><p>The ministers stole glances at Guo Rongshan, wondering if the Grand Chancellor had also entered the inner palace before.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it was thrilling!</p><p></p><p>When would they have the opportunity to enter the inner palace and witness the beauties there?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded to Emperor Qi as a greeting, his mind immersed in contemplating the Innate Realm cultivation methods, unaware of the ministers' strange expressions, and directly left the palace.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi sent him off with a smile on his face. After Xu Yan left, Emperor Qi took a deep breath, his expression becoming serious, and beckoned Guo Yun over.</p><p></p><p>He issued an edict: "Guo Esteemed Minister, the ministers all left the court without any decorum, violating the etiquette of the imperial court. Give them all twenty lashes as a warning!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Yun was taken aback but silently nodded, "I will obey the edict."</p><p></p><p>That nephew of his really was something, going to the inner palace so openly. Even the emperor had to maintain face.</p><p></p><p>Administering the lashes to the ministers was something only he could do.</p><p></p><p>That day, the ministers were collectively flogged outside the palace, their faces black with anger, cursing the damned emperor in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

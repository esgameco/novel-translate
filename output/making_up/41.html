        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 41: The Compassion of the Heavenly Mother, Saving All Beings</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood in the courtyard, coming to this bustling place for the first time. He felt a sense of awe, thinking that after traversing through time, today was the day he truly entered this world.</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>The streets of the county town were gradually emptying, returning to silence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the county government office, the county magistrate, the county prefect, and the chief clerk had gathered, and even the beggar and the peddler were present.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the main seat was not the county magistrate, but an old man dressed in coarse linen clothes.</p><p></p><p>"I've found out clearly, the wealthy newcomer to the city is the fool son of Xu Junhe, and his teacher."</p><p></p><p>The beggar said in a strange tone.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan? That young man is his teacher? This can't be possible!" </p><p></p><p>The county magistrate exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the reclusive masters that Xu Junhe's fool son found were all eccentric old men, but this young man is not much older than him..."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite understand how that young man had managed to trick Xu Yan into becoming his disciple.</p><p></p><p>The old man in linen clothes sitting in the main seat spoke up, "Xu Junhe is stubborn and unenlightened, possessing vast wealth but unaware of compassion for the common people. Not only did he refuse to join our Heavenly Mother Sect, he even had our sect members arrested and handed over to the authorities.</p><p></p><p>"Now that his son is here, it's a good opportunity for our sect to make use of him. </p><p></p><p>"Later, we'll use the great righteousness of our sect to convert his teacher, making him sincerely join our sect."</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate nodded and said, "The Dharma Protector's words are reasonable!"</p><p></p><p>The old man in linen clothes stood up and said, "Keep an eye on the Donghe Prefecture, this major plan cannot fail. The trouble with Xu Junhe is about to arrive at his doorstep. If he submits, we can save him."</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Protector, don't worry. General Kou is presiding over the situation in Donghe Prefecture. He will definitely be able to successfully take control of Donghe Prefecture," the beggar said reverently.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the old man in linen clothes nodded. General Kou was the strategist of the Heavenly Mother Sect, and with him in charge, it would surely be a flawless success.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me to convert Xu Yan's teacher, making him join our sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate and the others closely followed the old man in linen clothes as they left the county government office.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Xu Yan was cultivating, while Li Xuan was sitting in a chair, holding a book he had someone buy - a popular novel in the Qi state.</p><p></p><p>He was curious why Xu Yan, his foolish disciple, after reading these novels, became firmly convinced that there were incredibly powerful martial arts in the world, and kept searching for eminent masters to become his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother is compassionate, saving all beings. Worship the Heavenly Mother, escape the sea of suffering, and attain great wealth and nobility in the next life..."</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out on the quiet street, accompanied by the sound of bells and footsteps coming from the end of the street.</p><p></p><p>"Bless us, Heavenly Mother!"</p><p>"Bless us, Heavenly Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the neighbors on both sides, the entire street, many commoners opened their doors and prayed devoutly.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p>The sound of metal hitting the ground repeatedly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could tell from the sound that it was the sound of copper coins being scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother is making her rounds, redeeming sinners, aiding the virtuous, eliminating all evil in the world..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of bells grew closer, the ringing becoming clearer. Li Xuan had a strange expression on his face, was this procession heading towards him?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p>It was heading towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had stopped his cultivation, his face showing displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, what is this all about?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's the charlatans of the Heavenly Mother Sect," Xu Yan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother Sect?" </p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback, was this a heretical sect within the Qi state?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The matter of publicly preaching the doctrine has appeared...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother Sect is an ancient religious sect, tracing back to the previous dynasty. Since the establishment of the Qi Kingdom, it has rebelled no less than ten times.</p><p></p><p>It is seen as a thorn in the eye and a thorn in the flesh by the Qi Kingdom court, but despite repeated suppression, it has never been completely eradicated, and it would resurface after a period of time.</p><p></p><p>It is the same in the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother Sect believes in the so-called "Heavenly Mother", widely spreading the belief in the Heavenly Mother, claiming that by doing so, one can escape the sea of suffering and enjoy great wealth and nobility in the next life.</p><p></p><p>And each time the Heavenly Mother Sect rebels, there would appear a group of fearless believers, shouting that their souls would return to the embrace of the Heavenly Mother, escaping the worldly suffering, and attaining great wealth and nobility in the next life!</p><p></p><p>Unafraid of death, they have caused considerable casualties to the Qi Kingdom's troops on numerous occasions.</p><p></p><p>And the believers of the Heavenly Mother Sect have never been few in number. Even though the court has strictly prohibited it, it still cannot be completely eradicated, especially in areas where famine and disasters occur, where the common people are even more devoted to the Heavenly Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother Sect fellows like to rob people of their wealth, and then distribute it to some of the poor commoners, gaining their devotion.</p><p></p><p>"They have even looted government offices and opened granaries to distribute the grains.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Heavenly Mother Sect has been dormant for almost twenty years. At least since I was born, I haven't heard of them openly parading and preaching their doctrine anywhere."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was surprised. The Heavenly Mother Sect has a touch of the White Lotus Sect, and since it has been strictly prohibited by the Qi Kingdom, it should be a target for suppression.</p><p></p><p>Why is it now openly parading and preaching its doctrine in Yunshan County?</p><p></p><p>It is likely that Yunshan County has already been secretly controlled by the Heavenly Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>The commoners in the county town are either believers or members of the sect.</p><p></p><p>"This Yunshan County has probably already been controlled by the Heavenly Mother Sect," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled, suddenly realizing something and said, "My family's shop in Yunshan, could it have already been controlled by the Heavenly Mother Sect? Have they already become believers of the Heavenly Mother Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems they are coming this way."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the footsteps gradually approaching, it was clear they were heading in this direction.</p><p></p><p>"This is outrageous, to usurp my family's shop, and to come disturb my cultivation at this late hour. I'll go and drive them away."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry, let them come. Let's just treat it as entertainment."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Having just come out of the mountain hideout, he was quite interested in these external affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, "Master's state of mind is truly extraordinary. Is this the mentality of a high-level person? To treat the world as a game?"</p><p></p><p>The footsteps stopped outside the courtyard gate, the sound of bells swaying rhythmically, and a voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother is merciful, saving all living beings. Good sir, would you be willing to contribute your strength for the sake of the common people?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was grand and resonant.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed. The speaker was no ordinary person. Could it be a top-notch martial artist in the jianghu?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Xu Yan said, he is too weak!</p><p></p><p>For him and Xu Yan, the speaker is very weak, but for ordinary people, he is a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned and said, "A supreme martial artist of the jianghu? Why does the Heavenly Mother Sect in Yunshan County have such a jianghu expert? Could this be the Heavenly Mother Sect's main stronghold?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly surprised. He had thought the speaker was a top-notch jianghu expert, but it turned out to be merely an expert?</p><p></p><p>The martial prowess of the jianghu in the Qi Kingdom seems to be rather low.</p><p></p><p>"This is a supreme martial artist of the jianghu? How weak!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a blank expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master, they only possess common martial arts skills, with limited strength. A supreme expert is one who has cultivated inner qi. From the sound of his voice, it seems he has unleashed his inner qi..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Inner qi?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became curious.</p><p></p><p>What is this inner qi? Why is it so weak?</p><p></p><p>"It's a kind of explosive inner force, but its power is not strong, roughly equivalent to the initial stage of bone refinement or early iron body stage."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

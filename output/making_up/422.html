        <h1>Chapter 422</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Changyu Realm, White Wood City, was one of the major cities in Changyu Realm. The headquarters of the Myriad Treasures Alliance in Changyu Realm was located in White Wood City.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Treasures Alliance was the number one merchant alliance in the Divine Realm, with influence spread across thirty realms, and Changyu Realm was one of the realms where the Myriad Treasures Alliance had a presence.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire Divine Realm, whether buying or selling treasures, the Myriad Treasures Alliance was always the first choice. Moreover, behind the Myriad Treasures Alliance was the union of many powerful forces, with deep foundations and immense strength.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe was the leader of the Myriad Treasures Alliance in Changyu Realm, with powerful strength, belonging to the top tier of Immortal Venerable Lords. At this moment, the usual smile of geniality and prosperity on his round face had disappeared, replaced by a gloomy expression and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"I, Yan Shanhe, have always been kind to others, focusing on harmony and prosperity. I never offend people, and even when my juniors make mistakes, I am the first to apologize and make amends. I never bully others with my strength.</p><p></p><p>"As the leader of the Myriad Treasures Alliance in Changyu Realm, I work for the interests of the alliance, emphasizing harmony and prosperity, providing quality martial resources for warriors fighting in the Heavenly Abyss, and buying resources at high prices from warriors returning from the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I, Yan Shanhe, have only one son and one true disciple. Now my true disciple has been killed by someone. Could it be that because I have always been kind to others, they think I, Yan Shanhe, am easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, all the powerful members of the Myriad Treasures Alliance held their breath, not daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The body of a young man lay quietly on the ground, his chest split open by a single sword strike, almost cut in half.</p><p></p><p>"I, Yan Shanhe, believe I have taught my disciple well. First, not to bully others with power. Second, not to oppress the weak. Third, to bravely fight in the Heavenly Abyss, defending our Divine Realm from foreign invasion.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple was such a kind person. What kind of brutal villain would cruelly kill him?"</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, everyone lowered their heads in silence.</p><p></p><p>Those familiar with Yan Shanhe privately called him a smiling tiger and a backstabbing scorpion - appearing friendly on the surface but as venomous as a scorpion behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>However, he never took action personally. His subordinates would do the dirty work, and if exposed, he would decisively abandon them, adopting an attitude of impartial law enforcement, executing the subordinates to give justice to the victims.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Yan Shanhe had an excellent reputation in the outside world. Many warriors praised him as someone who upheld the reputation of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, impartial and selfless, never shielding subordinates who violated the alliance's reputation!</p><p></p><p>The forces affiliated with the Myriad Treasures Alliance and those powerful individuals naturally knew of Yan Shanhe's venom, but they dared not speak of it. Instead, they vigorously promoted and praised Yan Shanhe's uprightness and selflessness.</p><p></p><p>His personal disciple, of course, was no good person either.</p><p></p><p>But like Yan Shanhe, he appeared to be a great person on the surface. Only he himself knew how many dirty deeds he had done behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Relying on Yan Shanhe as his master and the power of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, who in the entire Changyu Realm would dare to harm him? Moreover, his own strength was extremely powerful, at the peak of True King Venerable Lord.</p><p></p><p>He was also always accompanied by three guards. Apart from an Immortal Venerable Lord taking action, who could kill him? And Immortal Venerable Lords wouldn't offend Yan Shanhe for this. As for other True King Venerable Lords, they all knew better and wouldn't target him.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Yan Ping understood boundaries and knew which forces and individuals he couldn't bully. Therefore, no one could have predicted that Yan Ping would one day be killed!</p><p></p><p>"Speak, who is the murderer?" Yan Shanhe asked with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, the murderer's identity is unknown. We only know he was bald, muscular, with powerful sword skills. The three of us fought to the death but couldn't resist him," said a middle-aged man kneeling behind Yan Ping's body, his face pale and one arm missing, in a weak voice.</p><p></p><p>"Ping'er was at the peak of Tempering Truth realm, and you three have been honing your skills in the Tempering Truth realm for a long time. The four of you together couldn't defeat him. In the entire Changyu Realm, apart from Immortal Venerable Lords, who in the Tempering Truth realm could achieve this?</p><p></p><p>"Even if you couldn't win, you should have been able to escape. Yet only one of you escaped, and severely injured at that. When did such a powerful Tempering Truth realm expert appear in Changyu Realm?" Yan Shanhe said with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, is it possible that the warrior came from another realm? Within Changyu Realm, even if someone had such strength, they would never dare to do such a thing," a powerful member of the Myriad Treasures Alliance said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, how did my disciple offend him?" Yan Shanhe looked at the one-armed man.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, Young Master Yan fell in love with a beautiful woman, but who knew that she..." </p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe waved his hand, understanding the situation. What love? It was nothing but coercion and temptation. Who knew they would encounter someone willing to intervene, resulting in the loss of life.</p><p></p><p>"Deal with that woman. Issue a bounty to hunt down this person. Reward those who report his whereabouts, and a hefty reward for those who capture and bring him here...</p><p></p><p>"Relay my order: Twenty men from the Treasure Guard are to be dispatched, led by two half-step Immortal Venerable Lords, responsible for capturing this person. I want to flay him alive!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Myriad Treasures Alliance powerhouses in the hall hurriedly and respectfully said, "Yes, Alliance Leader!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, my poor disciple!" Yan Shanhe's round, chubby face showed a sorrowful expression. "To think that I, Yan Shanhe, have been kind to others all my life, focusing on harmony and prosperity, yet my true disciple has been brutally murdered by a villain. Give him a grand burial."</p><p></p><p>Turning his back and walking away, everyone in the hall immediately breathed a sigh of relief, as if a great weight had been lifted from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, Yan Shanhe's voice came from afar: "The guards failed in their duty, are severely injured, and one has lost an arm. It would be a waste of divine medicine to treat him. Bury him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the hall felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed man turned pale and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In a secret room of a mansion in White Wood City.</p><p></p><p>"Was it successful?"</p><p></p><p>"Family Head, it was successful. Yan Ping is dead, and all those involved have also been killed. Yan Shanhe has issued a bounty to hunt down Meng Chong."</p><p></p><p>"Very good! This Meng Chong has actually come from the Nine Mountains Realm to the Changyu Realm. Xu Yan must have also left the Nine Mountains Realm. Pass this information to Lord Tian Seventeen."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Family Head, Xu Yan and Meng Chong are such extraordinary talents, there must be powerful figures behind them. What if we provoke their backers..."</p><p></p><p>"Foolish! What is the purpose of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow? The stronger the forces behind Xu Yan and Meng Chong, the better, isn't it? We're only afraid they won't retaliate. As long as they retaliate, it's a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Our Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is spread throughout many major forces. Once they get involved, how can the Divine Realm not be thrown into chaos?"</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, has Song You not been killed yet? He must be eliminated. If he knows something and leaks it, it would be detrimental to us."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Family Head. He is already being hunted down and won't live much longer. Besides, if he knew anything, he would have leaked it by now."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, deal with it as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in Changyu Realm, Meng Chong walked casually towards a city.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find out what special Heavenly Abysses and unique heavenly materials and earthly treasures Changyu Realm has. It's time to start collecting treasures to prepare for my future breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a rough plan for his future martial path.</p><p></p><p>Throughout this journey, each of the thirty-six realms of the Divine Realm had its unique heavenly materials and earthly treasures. He could collect them one by one in preparation for his transformation when breaking through to the second level of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even comprehended the third level yet..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've figured it out, but there's no rush. I can try to find some miraculous treasures like the Blood Heart Fruit to assist in comprehending martial arts, which can help me understand faster," Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"According to those martial artists, if you want to buy and sell treasures, or even martial arts manuals and catalogs of rare materials, you can go to the Myriad Treasures Alliance to purchase them. The Myriad Treasures Alliance is spread across the thirty realms of the divine domain, and has a better understanding of the unique rare materials in each realm. It would be good to buy a catalog to learn more."</p><p></p><p>"After entering the city, I'll go check out the Myriad Treasures Alliance and see if there are any treasures worth buying."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong strode into the city. After a brief inquiry, he headed straight for the local Myriad Treasures Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" On a building in the city, several martial artists were gathered when suddenly one of them exclaimed in surprise. </p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the person with a bounty from the Myriad Treasures Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Bald head, muscular build... Yes, it's definitely the villain wanted by the Myriad Treasures Alliance for killing Young Master Yan Ping!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! This guy has some nerve, swaggering through the streets without a care, not taking the Myriad Treasures Alliance seriously at all. He's completely disregarding Yan Shan and the Alliance Leader. Could he have some powerful backing?"</p><p></p><p>"To dare kill Young Master Yan Ping, he probably does have some backing. But the Myriad Treasures Alliance is no ordinary power. Even a supreme genius from a major realm would have to give an explanation. This guy is being too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly report his whereabouts to the Myriad Treasures Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, look, isn't he heading to the Myriad Treasures Alliance branch?"</p><p></p><p>"Gasp! He really is. Could he have a grudge against the Myriad Treasures Alliance? Is he going to destroy this branch?"</p><p></p><p>At this thought, the martial artists were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!" The martial artists hurried excitedly towards the Myriad Treasures Alliance branch, eager to watch the drama unfold.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was completely unaware that there was a bounty on him as he walked straight into the Myriad Treasures Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>The person in charge of a Myriad Treasures Alliance branch was called the Chief Manager, with strength at the peak of True King realm or even half-step to the Immortal realm. </p><p></p><p>The leader of the treasure protection team was certainly at the half-step Immortal realm, a powerful expert who had been honing their skills at the True King Celestial Lord realm for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yang was in the middle of entertaining an honored guest and was about to see them off when he saw a bald, muscular man walk in. At first, he paid no attention.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, a flash of realization hit him! The headquarters in the Long Cloud Realm had issued a bounty. Yan Shan and the Alliance Leader had even dispatched twenty powerful members of the treasure protection team to pursue the murderer who killed Young Master Yan Ping.</p><p></p><p>The murderer was described as a bald, muscular martial artist - a description that matched the man who had just entered perfectly! The murderer!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Feng Yang was shocked. Had the murderer come to turn himself in? He heard the murderer's voice: "I'd like a catalog of rare materials from the divine realm. Please introduce me to the rare treasures your Myriad Treasures Alliance has in its collection."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yang saw off the honored guest and turned back to see the bald young man at the counter preparing to make a purchase.</p><p></p><p>The attendant responsible for serving customers had a strange look in her eyes. She had also recognized this person as likely being the one with the bounty on his head - the murderer of Young Master Yan Ping.</p><p></p><p>But she wasn't completely certain. How could someone so brazenly walk right in? Maybe he just looked similar to the murderer?</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, esteemed guest. Please wait a moment. If I may ask, do you need any divine weapons? What kind of divine weapon are you looking for? Seeing how mighty you look, I assume you practice sword techniques? A domineering sword would suit your imposing presence!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and said with a smile, "Not bad, not bad. You have a good eye to know that only a sword is worthy of my might!"</p><p></p><p>There's no doubt now! This must be the criminal! Feng Yang was shouting internally. A chance for meritorious service had arrived, but this person's strength was extremely high. He definitely couldn't handle him alone, let alone capture him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he sent a mental message to the treasure protection team members, while also having the team leader invite powerful experts from the city to assist.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask your esteemed name?" The attendant placed a thick catalog of rare materials from the divine realm on the counter while beginning to introduce the rare treasures available at this Myriad Treasures Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>She was stalling for time!</p><p></p><p>"My name is Meng Chong," Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guest, these are the rare materials at our branch. They all come from various realms of the divine domain and are of extremely high grade. Naturally, the prices are not low. Some cannot even be purchased with spirit crystals..."</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong looked through the catalog and listened to the attendant's introduction, he said, "Do you have any special rare materials, similar to the Blood Heart Fruit? Also, treasures related to the physical body, including those extremely toxic substances that damage the body..."</p><p></p><p>The attendant smiled as she answered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong's brow furrowed. Killing intent! He abruptly raised his head. Over a dozen experts at the peak of the True King Celestial Lord realm from the Myriad Treasures Alliance had surrounded him. The attendant who had been explaining quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"What does your Myriad Treasures Alliance intend to do?" Meng Chong asked in surprise. He hadn't offended the Myriad Treasures Alliance. Could this be a branch of the Heaven Destroying Earth Shaking Sect? His gaze turned to Feng Yang as he asked sternly.</p><p></p><p>Although they outnumbered him, Meng Chong didn't take mere True King Celestial Lords seriously at all. Even if one of them was at the half-step Immortal realm, it made no difference.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, is it? You dare to swagger into our Myriad Treasures Alliance branch after killing the disciple of our Alliance Leader? Have you come to turn yourself in? If you're smart, you'll surrender without a fight!" Feng Yang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What Alliance Leader's disciple? I haven't killed anyone yet!" Meng Chong was puzzled. He had just arrived in the Long Cloud Realm and had only encountered a few martial artists to inquire about the situation here before coming to this city. He hadn't killed anyone yet.</p><p></p><p>"You must have the wrong person?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yang was furious. "Arrogant criminal, don't try to quibble! Surrender now!"</p><p></p><p>"Seize him!" With a wave of his hand, the group of experts immediately sprang into action, sealing off all directions and cutting off any escape routes.</p><p></p><p>"I, Meng Chong, have nothing to hide. I haven't killed anyone, and that's that. Since you won't listen to reason, let my sword explain it to you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes flashed. Although he realized he had probably been framed, now that the Myriad Treasures Alliance experts had made their move, how could he not fight back?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Golden light burst forth, and starlight appeared. In that instant, under the illumination of starlight, the Myriad Treasures Alliance experts felt their bodies grow heavy, as if sinking into a deep quagmire.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial technique is this? No wonder he was able to kill Young Master Yan Ping!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Myriad Treasures Alliance members were alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Several members of the treasure protection team immediately used secret techniques. Over a dozen True King Celestial Lord realm experts joined forces, attacking with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Since they couldn't be reasoned with, Meng Chong didn't hold back either. After this incident, he would inevitably be at odds with the Myriad Treasures Alliance, so why be overly cautious?</p><p></p><p>"This is a Myriad Treasures Alliance branch, with many treasures stored here. Since you've forced my hand, I, Meng Chong, won't be polite!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Meng Chong let out an angry roar. In an instant, he transformed into a giant glowing with golden light. With a wave of his hand, he shattered the main hall of the Myriad Treasures Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

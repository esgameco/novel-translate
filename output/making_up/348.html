        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Icezhou, the abode of the Sky Cavern.</p><p></p><p>A bed floats above the Sky Cavern, light gauze surrounding it, and a graceful figure can be vaguely seen reclining within.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of beautiful women surround the bed.</p><p></p><p>Their appearances vary - some are gentle, some fiery, some coquettish, some serene... Without exception, they are all draped in light gauze of various colors - pink, white, black, green, yellow, and more.</p><p></p><p>These women were once the warriors of the Quiet Snow Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Prey has arrived," the Bewitching Witch murmurs with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Her enchanting face is filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Prey, are you all ready? To let you die happily is the greatest mercy I, the Bewitching Witch, can offer. My heart is so kind!"</p><p></p><p>The Bewitching Witch smiles radiantly.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" </p><p></p><p>When Wu Tiannan and the other powerful cultivators arrive at the outer Sky Cavern, they are shocked to see that the former site of the Quiet Snow Palace has become a pitch-black cave.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Sky Cavern?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou furrows her brows.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be the Sky Cavern, but why would the Quiet Snow Palace have a Sky Cavern? The Spiritual Realm only has one Sky Cavern relic!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect is puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Among these powerful cultivators, Wu Tiannan is the only one who is not a Spiritual Sect expert, so he is completely bewildered. What is the Sky Cavern?</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cavern is a mysterious cave that does not exist on the surface, like an independent small space, or a hole opened between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm has a Sky Cavern relic, within which there are some opportunities, but due to the passage of time, the opportunities have likely dwindled.</p><p></p><p>"The spots for the Genius Confrontation are to enter the Sky Cavern relic," Xin Mengrou explains to him.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Sky Cavern come to be here?" Wu Tiannan frowns.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know!" The others shake their heads.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Sky Cavern belonging to the Quiet Snow Palace seems amiss, and there may be danger, so everyone must be careful," the Patriarch of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect says solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Those are the people of the Quiet Snow Palace!"</p><p>"Is that the Jade Palace Master of the Quiet Snow Palace?"</p><p>"They have all become..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the bevy of beauties surrounding the Sky Cavern, the powerful Spiritual Sect cultivators are all shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Quiet Snow Palace members all appear rather licentious.</p><p></p><p>"Something is wrong!"</p><p>"They may no longer be their original selves, or their temperaments have greatly changed?"</p><p>"I never expected the Jade Palace Master to be like this..."</p><p></p><p>A senior of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect laments.</p><p></p><p>"As guests, I apologize for the poor reception. I hope you can forgive us," the Jade Palace Master says with a charming smile.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have come, why don't we engage in some deeper exchange?" </p><p></p><p>The senior of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect steps forward, his expression hardening, saying, "Let me go investigate and see what peculiar changes have occurred."</p><p></p><p>He heads straight for the Jade Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, he used to have a secret crush on the Jade Palace Master, and now..."</p><p>"Sigh, let's all keep an eye out, and hope no accidents happen!"</p><p></p><p>The other seniors of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect sigh.</p><p></p><p>The rest of them keep a close watch, ready to act if any mishap occurs.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, the Jade Palace Master has become so... so..."</p><p>"Is this really the Jade Palace Master? Something seems off!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators are dumbfounded and incredulous as they see the Spiritual Cultivation Sect senior approach, and the Jade Palace Master joyfully greet him, then suddenly crouch down, tearing off the senior's pants and opening her mouth...</p><p></p><p>The sight leaves everyone utterly stunned and disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a piercing scream comes from the Spiritual Cultivation Sect senior.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, intervene! They are no longer their original selves, be careful they don't devour..."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation Sect senior cries out in terror.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Patriarch of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect unleashes his divine artifact, the powerful energy rippling outward.</p><p></p><p>But a faint pink light surges forth, easily blocking the divine artifact's might, and the Spiritual Cultivation Sect senior turns into a shriveled corpse.</p><p></p><p>"What a delightful flavor, so exquisite!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master laughs enchantingly, her jade-like face flushed, even letting out a burp.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is now shuddering with horror, their scalps tingling!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this? Soul possession? The Jade Palace Master's own strength is not weak, how can she possess others? And this method is no longer something the Jade Palace Master should possess..."</p><p></p><p>"When has the Spiritual Realm ever had such bizarre techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Sky Cavern may portend a crisis, we must strike them down!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect and the others say with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou steps forward, and as she does, dreamlike mist begins to emanate, blurring the boundaries of reality.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The others, including the Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect and the Patriarch of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect, are all slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wu Tiannan wields his scepter, striking directly at the Jade Palace Master from the air.</p><p></p><p>His attack causes the others - the Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect, the Patriarch of the Spiritual Cultivation Sect, the Emperor of the Great Zhou - to be slightly taken aback, realizing that Wu Tiannan's strength has grown even further.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful Spiritual Sect cultivators brandish their divine artifacts and strike.</p><p></p><p>"What a delightful fragrance, so many of them! How intriguing!" </p><p></p><p>On the bed, the Bewitching Witch narrows her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A bit too dreamlike and illusory? Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze falls on Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The battle erupts, with the Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect and the others - now the strongest in the Spiritual Realm - unleashing the might of their divine artifacts, the overwhelming power cascading outward.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Thunder Cloud Sect, wielding the Thunder Cloud Hammer divine artifact, lightning flashing in the sky as he strikes ferociously toward the Quiet Snow Palace members.</p><p></p><p>The pink light gradually spreads, rippling in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master and the others also join the fray, their actions sending shivers through the powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The battle rages on.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou battles the Jade Palace Master, her dreamlike powers constantly shifting, hiding a keen killing intent amidst the blurred reality.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, holding his scepter, continually strikes, forcing several Quiet Snow Palace warriors to retreat.</p><p></p><p>As they draw closer to the Sky Cavern, the bed floating above it also comes into view, and they know the mastermind behind this calamity lies there.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, to have caused such disaster and upheaval in the Spiritual Realm?" the Emperor of the Great Zhou, his body wreathed in crimson flames, demands sternly.</p><p></p><p>"The Bewitching Witch's hunting ground, of course, must have deaths. You are all my prey," the Bewitching Witch replies with a coquettish laugh.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the gauze on the bed rises, and a graceful figure is revealed for a fleeting moment. In that instant, a delicate white hand reaches out from the bed, grasping toward the Emperor of the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, be careful!" </p><p></p><p>One of the Great Zhou's strongest cultivators, standing beside the Emperor, cries out in alarm, swiftly moving to block the Emperor, his divine artifact unleashing a violent attack.</p><p></p><p>However, the delicate white hand effortlessly pierces through the powerful strike, grasping the cultivator's neck.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! He is instantly pulled into the bed.</p><p></p><p>Through the billowing gauze, the onlookers see the beautiful woman on the bed open her mouth slightly and suck, drawing the cultivator's soul into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>A terrified scream echoes out.</p><p></p><p>Slap! The lifeless body is thrown out, landing among the Quiet Snow Palace women, and one of them catches it, opening her mouth to bite the soulless corpse.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the body shrivels up.</p><p></p><p>This horrifying sight leaves the powerful cultivators trembling with fear, their bodies shaking.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was the Great Zhou Emperor, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing one's spiritual soul, what kind of demonic art is this?" </p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord was horrified.</p><p></p><p>The previous calamity of the Blood Demon was merely sacrificing the common people, refining blood to cultivate, but never so bizarre, directly absorbing one's spiritual soul, and it was impossible to resist! "The hunt has begun!"</p><p></p><p>On the bed, a delicate white hand reached out and grabbed towards an elder of the Imperial Spirit Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou both retreated, not continuing to attack the women of the Quiet Snow Palace, but instead assaulted that delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The delicate white hand, however, seemed to ignore the violent attacks, directly grabbing that elder and pulling him into the bed.</p><p></p><p>"A bit old, but it doesn't matter." </p><p></p><p>The Enchantress said, opening her mouth to suck, the spiritual soul was absorbed, the corpse thrown to the women of the Quiet Snow Palace!</p><p></p><p>"This woman is too strong, quickly retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou were the two strongest among the group, but at this moment they also felt their scalps tingle!</p><p></p><p>The woman on the bed was too bizarre, too powerful.</p><p></p><p>"She may have come from the Heavenly Abyss, why would the Heavenly Abyss have such a terrifying existence?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The delicate white hand reached out again, grabbing towards an elder of the Thundercloud Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>Everyone frantically attacked, but still could not resist that delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Another powerful expert perished! At this moment, everyone's hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she started from the relatively weaker ones, toying with the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat! Get out of the Ice State!"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Manor Master said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer an enemy they could deal with.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Hall should have already requested the Venerable One's descent, let us quickly return to the Rainbow State and request the Venerable One's assistance!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>Everyone retreated cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going? This is just the beginning!"</p><p></p><p>A light laughter came, the bed flew over, the delicate white hand grabbing towards another person.</p><p></p><p>Another one perished! Everyone frantically fled, but before they reached the border of the Ice State, they found the rear path blocked.</p><p></p><p>That bed was quietly floating there.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful as jade, with a charming smile, but it made everyone break out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"The men shall all die, as for the women, they shall become my flesh puppets, helping me devour the essence of men, it will be wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a chill down their spines.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go all out!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan raised his spirit ruler, his aura constantly surging, instantly unleashing his full strength, his powerful aura shocking the Thundercloud Manor Lord and the others.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's expression was calm, step by step walking forward, petals scattering in the air, the illusory scene constantly expanding.</p><p></p><p>"Go all out!"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord and the others wielded divine artifacts, their auras erupting, ready to use their secret techniques at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, several battle flags descended from the sky, wind, fire, thunder and lightning, smoke instantly appearing, enveloping the bed, the illusion of confusion and disorientation also manifesting in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly escape!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's figure appeared in the distance, then he immediately turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were invigorated, taking the opportunity while the Enchantress was trapped in the formation to frantically flee.</p><p></p><p>"An interesting technique, but it's a bit weak!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The formation was broken, the Enchantress standing on the bed, stepping out, instantly blocking the group again, raising her hand to capture the fleeing Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Hao's figure flickered, disappearing from the original spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Teleportation talisman! The Enchantress' brows furrowed, this technique was somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to catch that little fellow, no time to play with you all, the prey must meet the fate they deserve."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress raised a delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others had expressions of despair, the Enchantress' strength had already surpassed the limits of the Spiritual Realm, even if they joined forces, they could not resist her.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an overwhelmingly powerful aura appeared in the heavens and earth, a figure soaring over.</p><p></p><p>The might of heaven and earth surged in all directions, the newcomer wearing black armor, holding a long spear, a cold voice already sounding, "Scum of the Heavenly Abyss, do not act recklessly!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Help has arrived, it's the Venerable One!" </p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord and the others were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they sincerely thanked the shameless fellows of the Thousand Martial Hall, for if they had not requested the Venerable One's descent, how could they have been saved?</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress turned back, her expression becoming grave.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, this demonic woman devours spiritual souls, it is extremely bizarre, truly a great calamity for our Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord shouted.</p><p></p><p>Everyone took the opportunity to frantically flee, leaving the Ice State, hiding behind the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's expression was solemn, the spear glowing with icy brilliance, step by step approaching, with each step, the laws of heaven and earth surged forth, the mighty powers of the heavens and earth constantly converging upon him.</p><p></p><p>The winds and clouds gathered on his body, the might of heaven and earth all in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Law Venerable One!</p><p></p><p>"Convey my order, seal the Ice State, do not allow anyone in the Ice State to leave, wait until I have slain this enemy, then investigate one by one."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One commanded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord and the others respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One stepped towards the Enchantress, and at this moment, the Enchantress no longer had the previous composure, her brows furrowed, the appearance of this Refining Law Venerable One was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>And he appeared so quickly in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"An interesting prey has arrived, devouring you will make me even stronger."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Pink light surged from her, the women of the Quiet Snow Palace behind her all collapsing to the ground, lifeless.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual souls occupying their bodies had returned to the Enchantress' main body, further enhancing her strength.</p><p></p><p>Facing this Refining Law Venerable One, the Enchantress also dared not be careless.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm, it's impossible for the Heavenly Abyss to appear here, how did you appear?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"There is nothing impossible."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Spiritual Realm is weak, as long as you slowly, bit by bit, erode it over the years, you can open a hole and channel a portion of your power in."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's gaze narrowed, but then he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is, you dared to invade alone, seeking your own demise!"</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress covered her mouth and laughed, her seductive charm fully displayed, the pink light giving off an alluring aroma that could captivate one's primal desires.</p><p></p><p>On her head, a pink lotus-like flower appeared.</p><p></p><p>A faint fragrance permeated the air, this fragrance seemed to be able to arouse one's primordial desires.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the pink lotus, stood a figure similar to the Enchantress, but not entirely the same, with a lotus flower mark on the forehead, her hair like long snakes.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual mechanisms of the heavens and earth where the Enchantress stood seemed to have become chaotic, a stream of inexplicable energies constantly converging from the Heavenly Abyss, gathering above the Enchantress, forming a pink cloud.</p><p></p><p>"My hunting ground naturally belongs only to me, do you think I would share it with others? You, as a prey, are somewhat interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>But the Venerable One stared at the pink lotus on the Enchantress' head, and the Enchantress-like figure on the lotus, his expression suddenly changing drastically, the hand gripping the spear tightening slightly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was filled with grave concern.</p>

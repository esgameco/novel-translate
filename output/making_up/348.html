        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ice State, location of the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>A bed floated above the Sky Cave, surrounded by light gauze. A graceful figure could be vaguely seen lying lazily inside.</p><p></p><p>Around the bed, hundreds of beautiful women encircled it. </p><p></p><p>They had varied charms - some gentle, some fiery, some coquettish, some serene... Without exception, they all had light gauze covering their delicate bodies, in pink, white, black, green, yellow and other colors.</p><p></p><p>These people were all once warriors of the Snow Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Some prey has arrived," Mei Wu murmured with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Her alluring face was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"My prey, are you all ready? Letting you die happily is the greatest mercy I can show you. How kind-hearted I, Mei Wu, am!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other experts arrived outside the Sky Cave. Looking at where the Snow Palace used to be, now transformed into a pitch-black cave, they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Sky Cave?" Xin Mengrou frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be the Sky Cave, but why would there be a Sky Cave at the Snow Palace? There's only one Sky Cave relic in the Spirit Realm!" </p><p></p><p>The master of Thunder Cloud Manor said in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Among these experts, Wu Tiannan was the only one who wasn't a Spirit Lord, so he was completely baffled. What was the Sky Cave?</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cave is a mysterious cavern that doesn't exist on the ground. It's like an independent small space, or like a hole opened between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"There's one Sky Cave relic in the Spirit Realm with some opportunities inside, but since too much time has passed, there are probably few opportunities left."</p><p></p><p>"The spots for the Genius Competition are for entering the Sky Cave relic."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou explained to him.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Sky Cave come to be?" Wu Tiannan asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know!" Xin Mengrou and the others shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cave that appeared at the Snow Palace seems off. There's likely danger, so everyone be careful," the master of Spirit Control Manor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Those are people from the Snow Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Is that... the Jade Palace Master of the Snow Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"They are all..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd of beauties surrounding the Sky Cave, the Spirit Lord experts were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Looking at them now, all the people of the Snow Palace seemed to have become somewhat wanton.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>"They're probably no longer their original selves, or their natures have greatly changed?"</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined the Jade Palace Master would be like this..."</p><p></p><p>An elder from Spirit Control Manor said painfully.</p><p></p><p>"Guests from afar, please forgive our poor hospitality!" the Jade Palace Master said with a charming smile.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've all come, why don't we have a deep exchange together?"</p><p></p><p>The elder from Spirit Control Manor's expression tightened. He stepped forward and said, "Let me go investigate what strange changes have occurred!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he rushed straight towards the Jade Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, he used to have a secret crush on the Jade Palace Master, and now..."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, everyone keep watch. Let's hope nothing goes wrong!"</p><p></p><p>The other elders from Spirit Control Manor sighed.</p><p></p><p>The rest all watched intently, ready to act immediately if anything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, how could the Jade Palace Master be so... so..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the Jade Palace Master? Something seems off!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of experts saw that as soon as the Spirit Control Manor elder approached, the Jade Palace Master happily welcomed him. Then she squatted down, pulled open the elder's pants with both hands, and opened her small mouth...</p><p></p><p>The sight left everyone dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a scream of agony came from the Spirit Control Manor elder.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, attack! They are no longer their original selves. Be careful of them devouring..."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Control Manor elder cried out in horror.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The master of Spirit Control Manor attacked fiercely, unleashing the might of his divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>But a faint pink light emerged, easily blocking the divine weapon's power. The Spirit Control Manor elder turned into a withered corpse.</p><p></p><p>"What a wonderful taste, so wonderful!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master smiled enchantingly, her jade face flushed. She even burped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's scalps tingled in horror!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this? Soul possession? The Jade Palace Master's own strength wasn't weak, how could she be possessed? Moreover, this technique is no longer the Jade Palace Master's..."</p><p></p><p>"When has the Spirit Realm ever had such a bizarre technique?"</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Sky Cave likely heralds the arrival of a crisis. We must attack and kill them!"</p><p></p><p>The master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others said with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Let's attack!" </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou stepped forward. As she walked forward, dreamlike illusions spread out, blurring reality and fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" </p><p></p><p>The master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others' expressions tightened.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wu Tiannan wielded his ruler and launched an attack from mid-air, striking directly at the Jade Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>When he made his move, the expressions of the Thunder Cloud Manor master, Spirit Control Manor master, Great Zhou Emperor and others changed slightly. Wu Tiannan had grown even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>The group of transcendent Spirit Lord experts wielded their divine weapons and attacked.</p><p></p><p>"So many wonderful flavors, how interesting!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu narrowed her eyes on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Too Elusive Dream? Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle erupted. The Thunder Cloud Manor master and the others were now the strongest group in the Spirit Realm. Wielding divine weapons, they attacked fiercely, unleashing torrents of violent power.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Cloud Manor master wielded the Thunder Cloud Hammer divine weapon. Lightning illuminated the sky as he smashed down violently towards the crowd from Snow Palace.</p><p></p><p>Pink light gradually spread out, surging in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master and the others also began to attack. Their attacks immediately made the experts' hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>The battle was intense.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou fought against the Jade Palace Master. Her dream powers constantly shifted, hiding deadly intent between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan wielded his ruler, continuously striking out, beating back several Snow Palace warriors.</p><p></p><p>As everyone got closer to the Sky Cave, the bed behind the Snow Palace women also came into view. Looking at the figure on the bed, everyone knew that was the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, creating such calamity and bringing chaos to the Spirit Realm?" the Great Zhou Emperor asked sternly, crimson flames surging around his body.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu's hunting grounds naturally require deaths. You are all my prey."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu laughed coquettishly. </p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, the gauze on the bed lifted, and that graceful figure was revealed to everyone for an instant. In that moment, a delicate white hand reached out from the bed, grabbing towards the Great Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>A top expert from Great Zhou beside the emperor cried out in alarm. He moved in a flash, instantly blocking in front of the emperor. His divine weapon struck out violently.</p><p></p><p>However, that delicate white hand directly broke through the violent attack and grabbed onto his neck.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Without any resistance, he was instantly pulled onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>Through the lifted gauze, everyone saw the beauty on the bed open her small mouth and lightly suck in the Great Zhou expert's soul.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>A terrified scream rang out.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The corpse was thrown out, falling among the Snow Palace women. One of the women caught the corpse and bit into the soulless body with her small mouth. In an instant, the corpse withered away.</p><p></p><p>This horrifying scene made the experts' hearts tremble in terror, their bodies shaking.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the Emperor of Great Zhou, his face was extremely pale.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing people's souls, what kind of demonic technique is this?" The master of Thunder Cloud Manor exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Blood Demon disaster in the past was just sacrificing living beings and refining blood for cultivation. There was never anything so bizarre as directly absorbing souls, and it's unstoppable!"</p><p></p><p>"The hunt has begun!" From the bed, a delicate white hand reached out, grabbing towards an elder of the Spirit Governing Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengruo retreated, no longer attacking the women of Jingxue Palace, but instead striking at that delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The delicate white hand seemed to ignore the violent attacks, directly grabbing that elder and pulling him onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>"A bit old, but that's okay," the Charming Witch said, opening her mouth to suck in his soul. The corpse was then thrown to the women of Jingxue Palace!</p><p></p><p>"This woman is too strong, retreat quickly!" The master of Thunder Cloud Manor said with a drastically changed expression.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengruo were the strongest among the group, but even they felt their scalps tingling!</p><p></p><p>The woman on the bed was too bizarre, too powerful.</p><p></p><p>"She may be from the Abyss. How could such a terrifying being exist in the Abyss?" The Emperor of Great Zhou said with a heavy expression.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The delicate white hand reached out again, grabbing towards an elder of Thunder Cloud Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>Everyone attacked frantically, but still could not resist that single delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Another powerful expert fell! At this moment, everyone's hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the opponent started with the weaker ones, intending to toy with the strong experts.</p><p></p><p>"Go! Retreat from Ice Province!" The master of Spirit Governing Manor said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>This was already an enemy they could not deal with.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Palace should have already requested a Venerable to descend. Let's quickly return to Rainbow Province and ask the Heavenly Venerable to take action!" said the Emperor of Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Everyone began to retreat cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going? This is just the beginning!" A light laugh came as the bed flew over, the delicate white hand reaching out to grab someone again.</p><p></p><p>Another person fell! Everyone fled in panic, but before reaching the border of Ice Province, they found their retreat blocked.</p><p></p><p>That bed was floating silently there.</p><p></p><p>The beauty was like jade, with a charming smile, yet it made everyone break out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"All the men can die. As for the women, you can become my flesh puppets and help me devour men's essence. It'll be wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt chills all over their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight to the death!" Wu Tiannan raised the ruler in his hand, his aura surging continuously. In an instant, he unleashed his full power, his mighty aura shocking the master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengruo's expression was calm as she walked forward step by step. Flower petals scattered in the air, and the dreamlike scene kept expanding.</p><p></p><p>"Fight to the death!" The master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others held divine weapons, their auras erupting, ready to use secret techniques at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, several formation flags fell from the sky. Wind, fire, thunder, lightning, and smoke instantly appeared, enveloping the bed. A scene of confusion and disorientation also manifested in this instant.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly escape!" Fang Hao's figure appeared in the distance before he turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were invigorated. Taking advantage of the Charming Witch being trapped by the formation, they fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>"An interesting technique, just a bit weak!" </p><p></p><p>Boom! The formation was broken. The Charming Witch stood on the bed, taking a step forward. In an instant, she blocked everyone again, raising her hand to capture Fang Hao who had fled far away.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Hao's figure flickered and disappeared from the spot in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Teleportation talisman! The Charming Witch frowned slightly. This technique was somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to catch that little guy now. No time to play with you anymore. Prey should meet the fate of prey."</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch raised a delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others wore expressions of despair. The Charming Witch's power had already surpassed the limits of the Spirit Realm. Even if they joined forces, they couldn't resist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an extremely powerful aura appeared in the world, and a figure flew over.</p><p></p><p>The majesty of heaven and earth spread in all directions. The newcomer wore black armor and held a long spear. A cold voice had already transmitted: "Trash from the Abyss, don't be presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>A Heavenly Venerable had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"We're saved! A Heavenly Venerable has come!" The master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they sincerely thanked those shameless fellows of the Thousand Martial Palace. If they hadn't requested a Venerable to descend, how could they have been saved?</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch turned to look, her expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, this demon woman devours souls. She's extremely bizarre and a great calamity for our Spirit Realm!" shouted the master of Thunder Cloud Manor.</p><p></p><p>Everyone took the opportunity to flee frantically, leaving Ice Province and hiding behind the Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable's expression was grave. His long spear radiated cold light as he approached step by step. With each step, the laws of heaven and earth surged forth, and the power of heaven and earth continuously gathered.</p><p></p><p>The wind and clouds gathered in one body, the majesty of heaven and earth all in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Law Condensing Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"Transmit my order: seal off Ice Province. Do not let anyone from Ice Province leave. Wait for me to slay this enemy, then investigate one by one."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable walked towards the Charming Witch step by step. At this moment, the Charming Witch no longer had her previous composure. Her brows furrowed. The appearance of this Law Condensing Heavenly Venerable was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>And he had appeared in the Spirit Realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"An interesting prey has come. After devouring you, I can become a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Pink light surged from her body. Behind her, the martial artists of Jingxue Palace all collapsed to the ground, losing their vitality.</p><p></p><p>The souls occupying their bodies returned to the Charming Witch's main body, further increasing her strength.</p><p></p><p>Facing this Law Condensing Heavenly Venerable, the Charming Witch didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>"It should be impossible for the Abyss to appear in the Spirit Realm. How did you appear?" The Heavenly Venerable asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is impossible." The Charming Witch smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Spirit Realm is weak, as long as you erode it bit by bit over years and years, you can open a hole and project some power in."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable's gaze focused, but he also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. Only you alone dare to invade. You're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch covered her mouth and laughed, her charming demeanor fully displayed. Pink light gave a sense of captivating one's soul.</p><p></p><p>Above her head, a pink lotus-like flower appeared.</p><p></p><p>A faint fragrance spread, seemingly able to arouse one's primal desires.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the pink lotus stood a figure similar to the Charming Witch, but not exactly the same. There was a lotus mark on her forehead, and the hair on her head was like long, thin snakes.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth where the Charming Witch was seemed to become chaotic at this moment. Streams of mysterious energy continuously gathered from the Abyss, converging above the Charming Witch to form a pink cloud.</p><p></p><p>"My hunting ground is naturally just for myself. How could I share it with others? You, this prey, are quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>However, that Heavenly Venerable stared at the pink lotus above the Charming Witch's head, as well as the Charming Witch form on the lotus. His expression immediately changed drastically, and the hand holding the spear tightened.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were full of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the computer screen for a long time makes my eyes sore and uncomfortable. I can only reduce writing time to rest a bit and avoid staring at the screen for long periods. For now, I can't resume updating twice a day. (End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked up, the terrifying sword light pouring down like a storm. Yet Meng Chong's figure remained towering and unmatched in its domineering presence, constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>A sword light slashed across the sky, as if about to cleave the heavens, thunderously striking towards the sword light like a storm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks of the fierce battle raged, causing the trees in the dense forest to be reduced to fragments and scattered in all directions, turning the air into a hazy gray.</p><p></p><p>The intense battle continued.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fought with increasing fervor. Occasionally, attacks that he could not fully block landed on him, but they were neutralized by his formidable physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to break through his physical defense.</p><p></p><p>"A half-step Grand Master, truly powerful. I've just entered the Golden Body Realm and cannot defeat him!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was filled with a sense of pressure. However, the opponent would not be able to defeat him either. </p><p></p><p>As the battle dragged on, it would come down to who could outlast the other. But Meng Chong was confident that with his Golden Body, the opponent could not outlast him.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was now alarmed. With his half-step Grand Master cultivation, he could not overcome the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not completely defend against the opponent's attacks, as long as he could block 50-60% of the power, the remaining attacks could not harm him at all. The invincibility of the physical body was unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, becoming increasingly fierce. The black-robed man attacked ruthlessly, the terrifying sword light pouring down ceaselessly as he closed in, trying to find an opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>However, with each slash Meng Chong unleashed, the black-robed man was unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was grave, but he showed no fear, fully unleashing his martial arts. The Heaven-Dominating Saber continued to be wielded, and the Domineering Saber Intent seemed to be growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Each time, he only blocked 50-60% of the black-robed man's attacks, allowing the remaining attacks to strike his physical body. But he used the opponent's attacks to temper his Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Every time Meng Chong struck out with his saber, the black-robed man had to be cautious in his defense. If he failed to block it, a single strike could be fatal, as his physical defense was far inferior to Meng Chong's.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>After another fierce collision, the black-robed man retreated, putting some distance between them, gripping a curved saber with a gloomy expression, refraining from attacking further.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have interfered in this matter, dare you reveal your name?" the black-robed man asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood holding his saber, proudly gazing at the opponent, his Golden Body shimmering with a golden light and a scorching aura surrounding him. At this moment, he appeared ferocious and domineering, exuding an unparalleled aura.</p><p></p><p>"What, since you have interfered, why do you not dare to reveal your name? If you cannot even expose your name, I advise you not to meddle in this matter," the black-robed man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong narrowed his eyes, as there was no way he could reveal his real name.</p><p></p><p>"Sister said that Sword Saint Cliff is a top power in the Inner Realm, and that Brother Xie, as Sword Saint Cliff's genius, naturally has an imposing presence."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered, remembering that Xie Lingfeng had said that no matter what happened, he could use his name to resolve any difficulties in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Meng Chong proclaimed proudly, "I'm afraid saying my name might frighten you!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" the black-robed man coldly snorted. "Then let's see how you can frighten me!"</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, listen carefully!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thumped his chest and said, "I am Xie Lingfeng of Sword Saint Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man: ...</p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Cliff, Xie Lingfeng? The genius of Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years? </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was stunned. What was Meng Chong doing? Impersonating Xie Lingfeng? That was the genius of Sword Saint Cliff, the only son of the current Sword Sect Master Xie Tianheng. Impersonating him was more dangerous than offending the power behind the black-robed man. Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu swallowed hard and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. He pondered that after this, he should separate from Meng Chong, or else who knows when Sword Saint Cliff would come after them.</p><p></p><p>Being associated with Meng Chong, he would surely be implicated. Sword Saint Cliff was a formidable power, known as the number one sect in the Inner Realm in terms of sword dao. Its influence might not surpass the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and the Seven Star Academy, but its strength would not be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the three most top-tier powers recognized in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was also taken aback, but soon revealed a doubtful expression. "Xie Lingfeng of Sword Saint Cliff, I have heard of him, but I've never heard that he was bald!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Chong reached into his robe and pulled out a wig, putting it on his head.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p>The black-robed man: ...</p><p></p><p>Now the black-robed man was somewhat unsettled. If Sword Saint Cliff intervened in this matter, they could only retreat.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong's imposing appearance did not quite match the rumors about Xie Lingfeng, it was understandable that a powerful sect would not publicize the flaws and weaknesses of their genius disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng cultivates the sword dao, yet you are wielding a saber!" the black-robed man gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was silent for a moment, then said, "What if I don't want people to know my true identity, so I'm deliberately using a saber?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man: ...</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he decided that continuing the battle would not lead to victory, and he was even worried that he might be the one to be defeated if the battle dragged on.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he said solemnly, "Since that's the case, I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and he departed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a sigh of relief, removing the wig and stuffing it back into his robe, his face beaming. Using Xie Lingfeng's name was truly effective! The deterrent power was so strong!</p><p></p><p>He was also grateful that he had followed Stone Two's advice and prepared a wig, which came in handy at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>He descended from the air.</p><p></p><p>"I've driven away the people from my family's place. Hurry and go take the spirit herbs," Meng Chong said.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked distressed, "Brother Meng, how could you impersonate Xie Lingfeng? He is the genius of Sword Saint Cliff, Master Xie's only son!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean I'm impersonating him?" Meng Chong said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, Xie Lingfeng's build is far less imposing and powerful than yours. How could I not tell the difference? Your appearance is quite different from Xie Lingfeng's," Meng Shushu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Meng Chong frowned, feeling his head.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan from Sword Saint Cliff also has a powerful build, not as much as mine, but closer to my appearance, except for the head. Next time I'll just use Hu Shan's name, hopefully that will also work!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He patted Meng Shushu's shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I'm not impersonating, I'm just borrowing. You understand, right? This is what Brother Xie Lingfeng promised me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was puzzled, "You know Xie Lingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know Hu Shan from Sword Saint Cliff?" he then asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Hu Shan is a master of Sword Saint Cliff, he's Xie Lingfeng's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The disciple of the Grand Master, Hu Hai, the son of the Grand Master, was quite renowned.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Chong heaved a sigh of relief and said, "Hu Shan also has a reputation, so it'll be much easier next time. I'll just use his name then."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu: ... After a great battle, the dense forest was mostly destroyed, and the large tree on the cliff wall was also broken in half. Meng Chong and the other came to the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>"Is this where we enter?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the stone cave and asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, there's a door behind the stone cave that must be opened with a key. If we force it open, it might cause damage inside. If there are sixth-grade spirit medicines inside, the loss would be great."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu explained.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the people in black robes had not forcibly broken in.</p><p></p><p>"There are spirit medicines here, fortunately they haven't discovered it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu excitedly went to the big tree, took out his brush, and carefully scraped away the soil layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit medicines are in the soil?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, there was not a single weed or vine.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu picked up a gray, withered tendril not much thicker than a hair from the ground and said, "See this? This is the Earthen Spiritual Tendril. It's in a withered state now, so someone unfamiliar wouldn't even realize it's the Earthen Spiritual Tendril.</p><p></p><p>"It only grows in the winter when the snow covers the ground. If you're not familiar, you'll naturally miss it."</p><p></p><p>Digging along the Earthen Spiritual Tendril, Meng Shu Shu continued, "Underneath is the eighth-grade spirit medicine, the Earthen Spiritual Root. Now is the best time to harvest the Earthen Spiritual Root.</p><p></p><p>"If the Earthen Spiritual Tendril sprouts leaves, it's actually not the best time to harvest. The medicinal power of the Earthen Spiritual Root would be much weaker then."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up. The Earthen Spiritual Root? It was on the list of spirit medicines that Xu Ling Xiu had given.</p><p></p><p>"It's here too!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong got excited and carefully dug down along the thin Earthen Spiritual Tendril with his knife.</p><p></p><p>After digging more than three feet, a white, potato-like object appeared in the soil.</p><p></p><p>This was the Earthen Spiritual Root!</p><p></p><p>Carefully digging out the Earthen Spiritual Root, it was over three inches long and the size of a thumb, wrapped in a thin white skin.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a tender white radish.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, be careful, don't break the skin of the Earthen Spiritual Root. Otherwise, without a container to store the spirit medicine, the medicinal power will dissipate once the skin is broken."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong dug out one Earthen Spiritual Root and carefully put it in a bag. Fortunately, the thin skin, though delicate, was tough and not easily damaged.</p><p></p><p>The two of them dug around the big tree outside the stone cave and in total, they dug out eight Earthen Spiritual Roots.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, collect them."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu handed all the Earthen Spiritual Roots to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put the Earthen Spiritual Roots in the bag and tucked it into his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, into the treasure trove!"</p><p></p><p>After digging up the eighth-grade Earthen Spiritual Roots outside the stone cave, it was clear that the spirit medicine treasure trove inside must contain even higher-grade spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to enter the stone cave, Meng Chong's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Two figures abruptly appeared, emanating a terrifying aura like the might of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters! True Grand Master experts! Both were in black robes, one of them being the Half-Step Grand Master who had retreated before.</p><p></p><p>The other, in a black robe with a hood covering his face, revealing only his eyes, was a true Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this Grand Master, Meng Chong's expression changed. He finally understood why he had felt a sense of familiarity when he saw the black-robed person - their attire was almost identical to the Grand Master who had gone to the remote frontier to capture Xu Ling Xiu!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master in front of them wore the same outfit, with no difference at all.</p><p></p><p>"He's my sister's enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart raced. He never imagined that the force targeting Meng Shu Shu was also his sister's enemy, and that they were searching for spirit medicines, perhaps also to target his sister.</p><p></p><p>"So you're Xie Lingfeng? You can't fool me!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master coldly said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll tell the truth. I'm actually Hu Shan from Jianxun Cliff."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so what?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master casually struck down with his hand to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was prepared, grabbing the back of Meng Shu Shu's collar and instantly shifting their position, evading the strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>They soared into the air, moving like a raging thunderbolt across the sky, their speed unimaginably fast.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master let out an angry hum, "Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>And rushed to chase after them.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, your life is too valuable, not just a storage bag can compare. You owe me two storage bags, you know?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cursed as he felt the terrifying power chasing after them.</p><p></p><p>Hastily, he threw Meng Shu Shu onto his back, with their backs against each other.</p><p></p><p>Now Meng Shu Shu had become a human shield facing the pursuing Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu's face turned green. Damn it, I've become a human shield?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master's speed was not slow, but catching up to Meng Chong was almost impossible. He immediately slashed out with a sword, the terrifying sword qi rushing to kill them.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the distance, the sword qi's power had almost dissipated by the time it reached them.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this was still a strike from a Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>"My friend, hurry and do something!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, without looking back, grabbed Meng Shu Shu's collar with one hand, frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu saw the sword qi rushing towards him and his face turned pale. He was the one directly facing it, having become a human shield!</p><p></p><p>He quickly pointed his large brush, pouring all his strength into a strike, trying to block the nearly dissipated sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The sword qi was extinguished by his strike, but the aftershock still hit him.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Meng Shu Shu coughed up a mouthful of blood, feeling like his internal organs were about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, well done!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong praised, the force of the impact increasing his speed, widening the distance between them and the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, put me in front!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu panted.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, I run faster, you might not be able to withstand the fierce winds in the front, it's safer for you on my back!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu's face turned black. Damn it, they really are treating me like a human shield!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Grand Master gradually closing the distance, his face turned green again.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, hurry and run!"</p><p></p><p>As the Grand Master struck, the one facing his might first was Meng Shu Shu.

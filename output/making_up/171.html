        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the Great Wilderness was indeed the work of Xu Junhe's hands. Li Xuan slightly focused his mind and heard the conversation between Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi in the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The two were discussing how to establish a foothold in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Iron Mountain County belonged to the Blue Peace Prefecture of the Great Yue Kingdom. If the Great Wilderness wanted to take root in the inner domain, the first thing it had to face would be the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was just established, and its strength was not strong, with all its warriors not yet reaching the level of a hundred. It would be difficult to resist the suppression of the Great Yue Kingdom, so the two felt they should proceed cautiously, wait for their strength to increase, and not be hasty in establishing the name of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, this is the beginning of heaven and earth, the orthodox Great Wilderness. Won't it provoke the people in the inner domain? Aren't you going a bit too far?" Kou Ruozhi said with some concern.</p><p></p><p>Originally a remote and savage land, to come out and say the Great Wilderness is the orthodox of heaven and earth, this is indeed provoking the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Those who were originally willing to watch the Great Wilderness and the Great Yue Kingdom fight, might not be able to help but take action against the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Junhe smiled slightly and said, "That's not wrong. I said the Great Wilderness, not the remote wilderness. The inner domain can also be the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's mouth twitched, and he said, "But the inner domain has to recognize it!"</p><p></p><p>"As more people cultivate the martial arts of the Great Wilderness, they will naturally recognize it. It's just a matter of time," Xu Junhe said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the conversation between the two, Li Xuan muttered to himself that the entry of the Great Wilderness into the inner domain would trigger a martial arts storm.</p><p></p><p>After a series of struggles, if it was discovered that the martial arts of the Great Wilderness were actually stronger than the martial arts of the inner domain, it was easy to imagine that the young people in the inner domain who wanted to pursue the martial arts would inevitably choose to cultivate the martial arts of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating martial arts was for the sake of becoming stronger and living longer, right? No one would leave the strong martial arts and cultivate the weak ones.</p><p></p><p>During the stage when the two martial arts intertwined, it would inevitably trigger a storm in the inner domain, but this storm was still too far away from him. It could not be stirred up in the short term.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was still too weak now, with all its warriors not yet reaching a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"If the inner domain all becomes the Great Wilderness, and the martial arts I created replace the existing martial arts, what kind of feedback will I get?" Li Xuan thought to himself, and suddenly felt excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, Kou Ruozhi, Guo Rongshan, Qi Huang, Wu Huang, and the others were not fools. They naturally knew that the strength of the Great Wilderness was weak and would not rashly provoke a conflict with the inner domain, but would slowly infiltrate and gradually strengthen themselves.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong would definitely become the representative figures of the martial arts of the Great Wilderness. The stronger their reputation, the more people would be attracted to the martial arts of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the Great Wilderness and the changes that had quietly taken place in Iron Mountain County due to the arrival of the Changqing Pavilion were unknown to Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who were on their way to the spiritual medicine treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The three of them finally arrived at the outskirts of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, do you see that mountain? There is a valley inside, with a deep pool. The spiritual energy gathers in the valley, forming a treasure land where spiritual medicines grow. The pool water gushes out from underground, containing the spiritual energy of the earth, which is more suitable for the growth of spiritual medicines. The cliffs of the mountain in the valley are where the Black-Robed people are."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pointed to the mountain in front of them and said, "In one of the cliff walls, a fifth-grade spiritual medicine is growing, and there may be more than one spot where spiritual medicines are growing on the entire cliff wall."</p><p></p><p>"If it's really the lair of the Black-Robed people, there must be many strong experts. We must be cautious and not let anyone escape. If it's just a branch, we absolutely cannot let them send out a message," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Killing the Feiyuan will naturally cut off their communication, but the Feiyuan are fast and very sensitive. Ordinary people can't get close before they fly away. This is also one of the methods used by the major forces to guard against intruders," Meng Shushu said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong couldn't help but frown. To cut off the communication, they had to kill the Feiyuan, but to kill the Feiyuan, they would certainly be obstructed by the Black-Robed people. Once they encountered obstruction, they might not be able to kill all the Feiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they did not know where the Feiyuan were hiding.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything that can attract the Feiyuan?" Xu Yan asked Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>"The Feiyuan usually eat spiritual beans, but it's almost impossible to lure them. These Feiyuan won't eat unfamiliar spiritual beans," Meng Shushu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then took out a small bottle and poured out a few pills, "What about these pills? Can they attract the Feiyuan?"</p><p></p><p>"This..." Meng Shushu looked at the pills in his palm, her eyes shining, but she was not sure whether they could attract the Feiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it. Your sister said these pills have the ability to attract the Swallowing Toad, and if they can attract the Swallowing Toad, they should be able to attract the Feiyuan as well, right?" Xu Yan decided to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>The pills in his hand were refined by Suling Xiu as practice, with the ability to attract spiritual beasts. Perhaps they could also attract a Swallowing Toad, which was the main material for making storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had brought the pills with him, and maybe he would have the chance to catch a Swallowing Toad.</p><p></p><p>The three of them cautiously approached the mountain. When they were about 20 miles away, Meng Chong and Meng Shushu stayed behind, and Xu Yan silently approached the mountain alone.</p><p></p><p>Outside the valley, he found a suitable place, crushed a pill, and a special fragrance wafted out. This fragrance blended with the aroma of plants, and even if people smelled it, they would not notice anything special and would not alert the people in the valley.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hid his figure in a large tree and waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>At some point, a Feiyuan suddenly appeared and landed in front of the crushed pill.</p><p></p><p>"It's effective!" Xu Yan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Feiyuan flew low instead of high, which was not a warning signal, so the people in the valley would not pay attention.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Feiyuan did not always stay in one place. Only when they flew high was it a warning signal, indicating that there were strangers approaching.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flicked his finger, and a faint sword intent instantly killed the Feiyuan, turning it into flying ash that disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After killing one Feiyuan, another one soon flew over, and then another one came. Xu Yan flicked his finger and killed the incoming Feiyuan one by one.</p><p></p><p>In total, he killed five Feiyuan, and then no more appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Five Feiyuan is a bit too few. This may just be a branch, or one of the treasure lands occupied by the Black-Robed people," Xu Yan collected the crushed pills.</p><p></p><p>He returned to Meng Chong and the others and said, "I have killed all the Feiyuan, so they can no longer send out messages. This may not be the main lair of the Black-Robed people, but just a branch."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's go in directly. I want to smash that Grand Master!" Meng Chong said, rubbing his fists eagerly.</p><p></p><p>He had been chased by the Black-Robed Grand Master for a while and was feeling angry.</p><p></p><p>Now the opportunity for revenge had come.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, be careful and pay attention to whether there are any escapees," Xu Yan said solemnly to Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, don't worry, I'll be guarding the perimeter. If my strength allows, I'll kill any escapees."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu nodded.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Shushu did not think there would be any escapees.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were ferocious and terrifying, and the black-robed people in the valley had no chance of escaping.</p><p></p><p>The valley was quiet, with only the sound of the stream flowing out of the pool. Moss occasionally covered the cliffs, and if one didn't look closely, they would never discover that there were people living inside the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>Even less could they discover that there were spiritual herbs inside the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'll take the initiative to test the waters first."</p><p></p><p>Although he guessed that this was not the main base of the black-robed people, but rather a branch, he still couldn't be reckless for the sake of caution.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure soared into the air and descended directly into the valley, his aura completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>With his appearance, a thunderous sound rang out, and fragments of rock flew as a black-robed figure emerged from the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"There are people here, sir!"</p><p></p><p>A grand master cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And a late-stage grand master at that.</p><p></p><p>"Robbery! Hand over the spirit crystals and spiritual herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body was enveloped in a golden glow as he wielded a ferocious treasure saber.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person's gaze gradually turned icy cold. A stranger had appeared, and Fei Xuan had not given any warning, and its trace had been lost, indicating that Fei Xuan had been dealt with by the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you?!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person looked at the bald head and burly figure, immediately recognizing the person.</p><p></p><p>The one who had rescued Meng Shushu and ended up being chased and killed by a grand master cultivator, but the grand master cultivator had all died! And the spiritual herbs in the blessed land had also been plundered!</p><p></p><p>"You're seeking death, so I'll grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person brandished his saber, and the aura of the late-stage grand master erupted, forming a storm-like pressure in the sky above the valley, as if the might of heaven had descended!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong held his saber and sneered, "Today, I will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The saber light slashed through the sky, with raging winds and thunderous sounds. A single stroke unleashed his powerful aura, as if it could shatter the black-robed person's momentum.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person was horrified. The other party's strength was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The curved saber slashed out, the saber light pouring forth like a storm.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The cliff wall was shattered again, and two more figures emerged, both grand master cultivators wielding curved sabers, joining the fierce battle and surrounding Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect timing!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not the least bit afraid. He unleashed his Golden Body Technique, the Heavenly Overlord Saber, and the Golden Ape Fist, taking on the three of them. Not only did he not fall behind, but he grew stronger and stronger, suppressing the three grand master cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Transcendent Realm, Meng Chong had also nourished himself with a Golden Body Elixir, strengthening his foundation. His strength was far beyond what it was before.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he easily handle a single late-stage grand master, but even three late-stage grand masters surrounding him could not defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"Come out of hiding, you coward. If you don't act, these three will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was ferocious beyond measure. He didn't even bother to defend against the attacks of the two entry-level grand masters, letting them strike his body without any effect.</p><p></p><p>The might of the Flesh Dao was fully displayed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The two entry-level grand masters were terrified, while the late-stage grand master roared and unleashed his full power. The saber light was like a raging storm, carrying a terrifying might, trying to annihilate Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>However, a saber light that dominated the world, with surging winds and thunder, slashed through and shattered all the attacks, aiming to exterminate him.</p><p></p><p>The two entry-level grand masters coughed up a mouthful of blood, their faces instantly turning deathly pale. They activated their martial arts secret techniques, joining forces to resist Meng Chong's devastating strike.</p><p></p><p>As for the late-stage grand master, his curved saber floated in the air, and his entire aura was instantly infused into the saber, forming a storm-like pressure of heavenly might that poured into the saber.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the saber had become bone-chillingly cold.</p><p></p><p>An icy and bone-piercing saber qi spread out, and the saber slashed through the air, shattering into pieces. In midair, a bone-chilling saber qi descended.</p><p></p><p>After unleashing this strike, the late-stage grand master's face turned ashen, his breath erratic, and his figure staggered a few steps.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this killing move had exacted a heavy price from him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's brow furrowed. In that instant, he felt as if he had been targeted by a cold, icy gaze, and an icy aura enveloped him, inescapable and unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>"Is this his trump card?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his saber, his body shining like the sun. The icy aura retreated, and before the surging winds and thunder, the dominating saber intent transformed into a raging storm of winds and thunder.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a single saber!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying saber light, like a raging storm of winds and thunder, instantly shattered the bone-chilling saber qi and dispersed the icy aura, surging towards the black-robed person!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person was horrified. He was a late-stage grand master, and his ultimate strike had been crushed, and the other party's powerful attack was now descending upon him.</p><p></p><p>The aura of death was approaching!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At that moment, a saber light slashed out from the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>This saber strike had gathered the surrounding heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, its power terrifying, as if it possessed the might of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Meng Chong's saber strike was blocked.</p><p></p><p>A figure in a black robe, with a red leaf embroidered on the chest and white hair visible under the hood, a peak grand master, slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>With each step, he seemed to stir the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, forming a powerful aura that surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>"White Dharma Protector!"</p><p></p><p>The late-stage grand master hastily saluted.</p><p></p><p>"This person is the one who rescued Meng Shushu."</p><p></p><p>The late-stage grand master pointed at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The White Dharma Protector's gaze was cold and sharp, staring at Meng Chong. "Surrender yourself!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy formed a storm-like pressure around him, and the sky above the valley darkened, an overwhelming pressure covering the area.</p><p></p><p>The might of a peak grand master! Upon reaching the peak, one could make the heavens and earth change color. This was the existence at the pinnacle of the Inner Realm, the peak grand master!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was grave. The peak grand master was incredibly strong, and if not for his deep foundation, he might not be a match.</p><p></p><p>But to defeat a peak grand master would be extremely difficult. However, Meng Chong was confident that with his formidable physical body, he could ultimately emerge victorious in a prolonged battle.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the cliff wall, the broken wall revealing several concealed chambers carved into it. In one of the chambers, a gray small herb was growing in the crevices.</p><p></p><p>Likely a fifth-grade spiritual herb!</p><p></p><p>What delighted him even more was that there were packages in the chamber, indicating that the black-robed person's belongings were not on his person at the moment, so Meng Chong didn't have to worry about destroying any spirit tickets in the process.</p><p></p><p>The other party probably never expected to be attacked, so when Meng Chong appeared, they hastily emerged without having the time to retrieve their valuables.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps they relied on the peak grand master's protection, thinking that any intruders would be easily eliminated, and never considered the possibility of needing to flee.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was on high alert. This True King Celestial Lord who suddenly appeared seemed to be helping him, but clearly had ulterior motives and had deliberately come here looking for him.</p><p></p><p>Bewitched by Mei Wu, he was acting on Mei Wu's orders. </p><p></p><p>What good could come from Mei Wu looking for him? Revenge?</p><p></p><p>"I don't need your so-called protection. My affairs with the Wan family don't require your interference. Get lost!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the Wan family's strength..." That True King Celestial Lord became anxious. Their strength among True King Celestial Lords was not considered very strong, and they couldn't hold back the Wan family elders for long.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, and a sharp sword intent burst forth, forcing that True King to hastily retreat.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Wan family elders were pushing back the blocking True King Celestial Lords step by step. It was clear they couldn't hold on much longer, but Xu Yan refused to take the opportunity to leave, which made these True King Celestial Lords extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin frowned. These True King Celestial Lords who suddenly appeared didn't seem to be Xu Yan's behind-the-scenes forces, but had another purpose?</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cicada Blade trembled, but he didn't attack again. Instead, he looked at Xu Yan with a solemn expression and said in a deep voice, "Since you dare to provoke my Wan family, do you dare to leave your name!"</p><p></p><p>"Why wouldn't I dare?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled proudly and said, "Listen carefully, I am who I am, Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"You are Xu Yan? Xu Yan from the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"You know me? It seems I, Xu Yan, have quite a reputation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He had made quite a name for himself in the Qinghua Realm, especially for teaching the way of the sword. Sword cultivators in the Qinghua Realm all revered him greatly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect it to spread to the Nine Mountains Realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that Sword God Xu Yan's sword techniques are marvelous, and he holds a lofty position among sword cultivators in the Qinghua Realm. It's also said that Xu Yan can summon true dragons..." </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and slapped, and a golden dragon roared out, its majestic aura spreading.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wan Tianlin confirmed that this was indeed Xu Yan from the Qinghua Realm, who was already hailed as the number one of the younger generation in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were many rumors about Xu Yan, spreading more and more fantastically. However, in the Nine Mountains Realm, it was generally believed that the Qinghua Realm had suffered heavy losses and urgently needed to rebuild its prestige, so the rumors were just exaggerated hype.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him today, Wan Tianlin instinctively felt that the rumors were unnecessary!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword techniques were indeed marvelous, he could summon true dragons, and his strength was such that even the elders beside him couldn't do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>He had almost reached a level where, unless an Immortal Celestial Lord appeared, he would be invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, I, Wan Tianlin, don't believe I have offended you. I sincerely wanted to trade with you. Even if you felt I was a bit arrogant, there's no need to target me and my Wan family like this, is there? My Wan family has never had any grudges with you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin took a deep breath and said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The two elders also stopped attacking. Since the young man was Xu Yan from the Qinghua Realm, if he truly had a grudge against the Wan family and came to target them, this matter would not be simple.</p><p></p><p>It might even involve conflicts between powerful forces in the Qinghua Realm and the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Conflicts between the two realms were beyond the level that cultivators of their rank could get involved in.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and said coldly, "I, Xu Yan, have never been one to cause trouble, but I'm not afraid of it either. Since I brought out the Blood Heart Fruit for trade, I naturally intended to trade sincerely. I don't care about your attitude, I just need the treasures required for the trade to be paid.</p><p></p><p>"But you, Wan Tianlin, are a bit black-hearted, aren't you? You actually sent someone to assassinate me. Do you think I, Xu Yan, am someone who won't fight back when attacked?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin frowned. It was true that one of his guards had gone to assassinate Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>However, the reason the guard tried to assassinate Xu Yan was because he had been ambushed.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was Xu Yan from the Qinghua Realm and had no grudge with the Wan family, why would he rashly try to assassinate him?</p><p></p><p>Could there be a problem here?</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's heart sank. He had a feeling that he was smelling the scent of a conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>As a genius of the Wan family, besides having outstanding talent, although he was a bit arrogant, he was not just a brute who only knew force and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If Wan Tianlin was just a brute with outstanding cultivation talent, he wouldn't have been so valued by the Wan family and groomed as the future head of the family.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin took a deep breath and cupped his hands, saying, "Brother Xu, after finishing our discussion at Jade Bamboo Slope, I was preparing to return to the Wan family to gather the items needed for the trade.</p><p></p><p>"However, I was ambushed on the way..."</p><p></p><p>Having realized something was amiss, Wan Tianlin immediately explained what had happened that day.</p><p></p><p>"That guard of mine returned to Jade Bamboo Slope to assassinate you because of this. There must be a misunderstanding here. My Wan family is willing to compensate you for this, Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. He suddenly looked at those True King Celestial Lords controlled by Mei Wu. At this moment, he understood a bit. There was a third party force behind the scenes, stirring up conflict between him and the Wan family!</p><p></p><p>"When I left Jade Bamboo Slope, I was attacked by assassins trying to steal the Blood Heart Fruit. I, Xu Yan, am not one to be beaten without fighting back, so I returned to hunt you down. On the way, I encountered your guard..."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's face turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Blood Heart Fruit trade?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly realized that this matter was unusual.</p><p></p><p>"I gave it to your guard!"</p><p></p><p>"My guard is dead, and we didn't get the Blood Heart Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wan Tianlin understood that someone was manipulating everything behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was furious inside. They dared to use him as a pawn? He looked coldly at those few True King Celestial Lords and said in a cold voice, "Are you the ones behind this? Or is it the one behind you?"</p><p></p><p>Swish! He directly slashed out a sword, attacking one of the True King Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was them or not, since they were controlled by Mei Wu, they definitely had ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Capture them alive!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan attack, Wan Tianlin immediately took action as well. The two Wan family elders also moved, wanting to capture live prisoners to interrogate about the mastermind behind this.</p><p></p><p>The few True Kings who came from Thousand Fold Mountain were caught off guard at this moment. They had originally come to rescue Xu Yan from trouble, but instead ended up being targeted by both sides.</p><p></p><p>"It's not us, this has nothing to do with us!"</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly tried to explain.</p><p></p><p>However, neither the Wan family nor Xu Yan paid any attention to their explanations. They attacked furiously, wanting to capture them.</p><p></p><p>"We were only ordered by our noble one to find Young Master Xu, we're not the assassins!"</p><p></p><p>However, their explanations were useless.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's eyes, they had already been controlled by Mei Wu and were dangerous individuals.</p><p></p><p>In Wan Tianlin's eyes, they were clues to investigate the mastermind behind this.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing they were no match, these True Kings panicked and could only try to escape! However, how could they easily escape from the two Wan family elders?</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Under the Small Heavenly Eye, Xu Yan's gaze focused. A True King Celestial Lord who was about to be captured by a Wan family elder had a power erupting from within his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful aura surged, and a vast power burst forth from that True King Celestial Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>As this power erupted, it seemed to gather all of this True King Celestial Lord's life force, blasting away the Wan family elder.</p><p></p><p>Even that Wan family elder's expression changed, and he retreated to avoid the sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, that True King Celestial Lord directly</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It exploded, as if using up all its cultivation, just for this one blast.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's eyes, at the moment the True King Celestial Lord exploded, a faint pink aura flickered briefly before dissipating into the world.</p><p></p><p>That was the enchanting power the Charming Witch used to control the True King Celestial Lord. Under that enchantment, he chose to self-destruct on the spot rather than fall into the hands of the Wan family elders.</p><p></p><p>"A suicide soldier!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's expression turned ugly. </p><p></p><p>Such a resolute self-destruction, unwilling to be captured - only suicide soldiers could do this, not other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Among the several True King Celestial Lords, three ultimately managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's face was grim. Since these were suicide soldiers, without powerful methods it would be impossible to capture them alive or interrogate them for clues.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, confirming they were Charming Witch's people who came for him was enough.</p><p></p><p>Trying to capture them alive would not be easy.</p><p></p><p>"This matter was a misunderstanding. My Wan family will definitely root out the mastermind behind it," Wan Tianlin said with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>"Are you so certain it has nothing to do with me?" Xu Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu comes from the Qinghua Realm and represents its elite talents. Even if there were grudges with my Wan family, you wouldn't need to use such methods. This involves too much, so I believe Brother Xu is unrelated and is actually a victim. The mastermind wanted to use Brother Xu to target my Wan family."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Wan Tianlin continued: "They may even be trying to provoke conflict between my Wan family and the Qinghua Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, his gaze cold. "Those who dare use me, Xu Yan, must pay the price. Brother Wan, if you have any leads, you can notify me. Perhaps we'll have a chance to cooperate!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's heart stirred as he spoke: "Although this was evil people sowing discord, ultimately my Wan family failed to detect it in time and misunderstood Brother Xu, publicly putting a bounty on you which affected your reputation to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"I, Wan Tianlin, am willing to represent the Wan family in apologizing to Brother Xu and making amends for this matter. This will also create conditions for our cooperation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Wan Tianlin in surprise. "How do you plan to compensate me?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said seriously: "Whatever items Brother Xu needs, I will gather them as quickly as possible and deliver them to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but look at Wan Tianlin with newfound respect. Since the other party was so sincere and willing to collect the treasures he needed, he should also make a gesture.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll give this Blood Heart Fruit to Brother Wan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a Blood Heart Fruit and handed it directly to Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"Also, there was someone from your Wan family who tried to assassinate me. I used some methods that will result in him being killed back in your Wan family. You may want to pay attention to that."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, gathering spiritual energy. Under the rippling waves, Shen Kui's appearance was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin bowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"In as little as 5-6 days or at most half a month, I can gather the items Brother Xu needs. If there are any clues, I will also inform Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said gravely after receiving the list.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then took out a communication talisman and handed it over, saying: "This is a communication talisman. You can use it to send me messages. I can receive messages within 500,000 li."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin was greatly shocked. This talisman could actually transmit messages?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu..."</p><p></p><p>The importance of the communication talisman was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask me for more. I don't have many communication talismans, these are just spares."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He took a step and instantly vanished from the spot. His voice echoed in Wan Tianlin's ears from afar: "Brother Wan, I await your good news."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin and the two Wan family elders' expressions changed slightly. Xu Yan's speed was too fast, disappearing without a trace in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Who below the Immortal Celestial Lord realm could do anything to him?</p><p></p><p>"Return to the Wan family!" Wan Tianlin's face was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Dagai, the wanted posters for Xu Yan were all taken down overnight, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Within the Wan family, this matter was personally assigned to Wan Tianlin, as a test from the Immortal Celestial Lords of the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin felt great pressure, but he began to make arrangements, especially investigating starting with Shen Kui. To his surprise, Shen Kui had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu said he used some methods. Could it be that Shen Kui didn't target the Wan family, but instead targeted the forces behind the scenes?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin had a guess.</p><p></p><p>With the Wan family's resources and power, gathering the treasures Xu Yan needed naturally wouldn't be a problem. It was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Dagai, undercurrents surged. The Wan family's secret forces were investigating some powers within Mount Dagai, and even began to search the entire Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>There was only one goal - to root out the forces behind the scenes!</p><p></p><p>After reaching an agreement with Wan Tianlin, Xu Yan immediately suspected that the mastermind was the Charming Witch's handiwork.</p><p></p><p>"The Charming Witch is in the Nine Mountains Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for Wan Tianlin's treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan assessed that his strength was still too weak. It would be better to investigate the mastermind after breaking through to the Divine Phase realm.</p><p></p><p>At the location of the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow cave, the new Heavenly Fiend finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>When the masked figures saw him, their hearts trembled. A Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend was much stronger than the previous Heavenly Fiend.</p><p></p><p>"Has the operation targeting the Wan family and Xu Yan failed?" </p><p></p><p>The man wearing the fierce fiend mask with five leaf patterns spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family withdrew the bounty on Xu Yan, and there's been no news of capturing Xu Yan. It seems to have failed," </p><p></p><p>An Earthly Shadow said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"What was the reason for the failure?" </p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend asked.</p><p></p><p>"There may be a traitor within our Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow organization!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, someone said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Since its founding, our Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow has never had a traitor. Now a traitor has appeared, causing the plan to fail. This matter cannot be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Before the next operation, investigate internally and be sure to root out anyone with ulterior motives!"</p><p></p><p>Following the new Heavenly Fiend's order, the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow on Mount Dagai began to experience some turmoil as they investigated internal traitors.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the Wan family were unaware of all this. Even the powerful Wan family had not detected the existence of such a secret organization as the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a month, Xu Yan received a message from Wan Tianlin that the needed treasures had been gathered.</p><p></p><p>They met again at Stone Peak. Wan Tianlin reported on the Wan family's investigation, which had not uncovered any valuable clues.</p><p></p><p>As for those few True King Celestial Lords, they came from Thousand Fold Mountain. Their identities had all been ascertained and were confirmed to be unrelated to the forces behind the scenes. However, why they were looking for Xu Yan and who the noble person was remained unknown for now.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood in his heart. The Charming Witch was in Thousand Fold Mountain. One of the purposes of this trip to the Nine Mountains Realm was to gather treasures needed to accumulate foundation and resources.</p><p></p><p>Now that the treasures had been gathered, the trip to Thousand Fold Mountain was no longer necessary. Xu Yan had not yet decided whether to avoid the Charming Witch.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can we find out which force the man in the black robe belongs to?"</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard of the Seven Star Academy, Du Yuying asked the person in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>The person shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying pondered for a moment and said, "Go to the Tianbaoge and ask if there is any information about the man in the black robe."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, even if the Tianbaoge knows about such a powerful hidden force, they should have some agreement with the other party and won't reveal it externally. </p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianbaoge is willing to disclose it, we may not be able to afford the price!"</p><p></p><p>The person sighed.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was silent for a moment, then said, "Have you found that place? And the spiritual herbs I need."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the spiritual herbs have been found, as for that place, we only have one clue at the moment and are still investigating."</p><p></p><p>The person replied.</p><p></p><p>"Give me the spiritual herbs, and quickly find out the location of that place."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying rubbed her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Wushuang Pavilion, the woman in plain clothes asked her master, "Master, what force is the man in the black robe?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of Wushuang sighed and said, "My disciple, the man in the black robe is very powerful, it's best not to provoke him."</p><p></p><p>She was a bit headachy, her disciple was using all her efforts to gain Xu Yan's favor.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not provoking him, I just want to get information about them."</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"There's no news yet."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, it's been a long time since we've heard from him. Canglan Island has been occupied by the Fiend Slaughter Venerable, but he hasn't made a move. Has Xu Yan temporarily retreated?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think Xu Yan is the kind of person who would retreat?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master was taken aback, and the image of Xu Yan's arrogance appeared in her mind - he was a very wild person who would never shrink back. Now that he had been absent for a long time, there could only be one reason.</p><p></p><p>He had not received news of the situation on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone into seclusion to improve his strength?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master pondered.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan makes his move again, will he kill a peak Grand Master? Or kill the Fiend Slaughter Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, she was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>While the various forces and powerhouses in the Inner Domain were waiting to see how Xu Yan would respond to the Fiend Slaughter Venerable, the distant Xu Yan was busy moving to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had already led some members of the Qingqing Pavilion to enter the Inner Domain and establish a foothold there.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe had regained his fighting spirit, wanting to accumulate a large fortune in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>So when Su Lingxiu found him, he agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>And under Su Lingxiu's guidance, Pang Yaoshi had laid a basic foundation for pill refinement, although he still could not complete the refinement alone, he was already quite familiar with the various steps, especially the final step of solidifying the pill.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a pharmacist and had a natural talent for medicine.</p><p></p><p>The pill refining room was temporarily placed under his charge, and he had also entered the Inner Domain with Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Iron Mountain County, there was a large manor that was taking shape into a small city. A tall building stood there, attracting the attention of all the forces in Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>But no force dared to obstruct or covet it.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Qingqing Pavilion had already spread in Iron Mountain County. It was said to be a commercial force established by a mysterious warrior, mainly selling herbs needed for cultivators' cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbaoge in Iron Mountain County did not pay attention to the establishment of the Qingqing Pavilion, nor did he think it would surpass the Tianbaoge and be able to compete with it.</p><p></p><p>There were many small commercial forces in the Inner Domain, but in the face of the mighty Tianbaoge, they were just small fry and posed no threat at all. Some even had to rely on the Tianbaoge to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for the Qingqing Pavilion selling herbs needed for cultivators' cultivation, the Tianbaoge didn't even care about that.</p><p></p><p>The herbs of the Tianbaoge were more expensive, but their effects were far beyond what other commercial forces could sell.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Tianbaoge never oppressed other commercial forces, because it was simply not interested and had no need to do so. Many commercial forces even sourced their goods from the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked at the Qingqing Pavilion manor, his brow furrowed, hesitating whether to go and inquire, but afraid of exposing himself.</p><p></p><p>He had been in Iron Mountain County for some time, trying to find news of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Where are Xu Shixiong and Meng Xiong? The message I left with Sword Venerable Cliff hasn't been responded to."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>The contact methods he had left behind were all unable to reach Xu Yan and Meng Chong, so he had to come to Iron Mountain County in person, but still got no results.</p><p></p><p>In his impatience, he even started to inquire if anyone had seen a tall, bald young man, and noticed that the person from the Qingqing Pavilion seemed a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go and inquire, I can't stay here any longer, or my tracks might be discovered, and that would be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pondered.</p><p></p><p>If news of him inquiring about Meng Chong got out, it would certainly attract the attention of the Black Robe Force, as Meng Chong's appearance was too distinctive.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Xu Yan's fame had overshadowed Meng Chong, so the attention was all focused on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll go and inquire, no matter the result, I have to leave Iron Mountain County!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu gritted his teeth, stood up and was about to go to the Qingqing Pavilion to make some inquiries.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a weight fell on his shoulder! A hand was placed on his shoulder, and Meng Shushu was startled and about to strike to break free, when a voice sounded: "My family member, are you looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>It was Meng Chong! Meng Shushu's face turned dark, he looked up at Meng Chong, and said unhappily, "Can't you make some noise? You almost scared me to death!"</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to accept that as a Sect Master Cultivator, he was approached without even noticing.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's strength seemed to have increased even more.</p><p></p><p>"My family member, are you being chased by someone again? The Black Robe Force?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't been chased for now."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and asked, "Where's Xu Shixiong?"</p><p></p><p>"My Shixiong is busy with some matters, if you have anything, just tell me directly."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Without Xu Shixiong, this matter is not easy to handle."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"What, does it involve a Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his eyebrows and said.</p><p></p><p>Then he clenched his fist and said fiercely, "Where is the Grand Master? I'll just beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>"Meng Xiong, have you broken through in strength?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's confidence meant that his strength had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"It should be no problem to beat up a Grand Master now."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"We still need to find Xu Shixiong, this matter is not ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong had broken through in strength, Meng Shushu still lacked confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me specifically what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, you know I owed you and Xu Shixiong a storage bag, in order to buy the storage bag as soon as possible, I have exhausted all my means to search for spiritual herbs, and I actually found a treasure trove..."</p><p></p><p>After parting ways with Xu Yan and Meng Chong, Meng Shushu thought it over and felt that he couldn't continue to be lazy, he must make efforts...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Struggling, striving to break through the realm of the great masters. He gritted his teeth and made up his mind to start searching for spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>After employing various secret techniques and methods passed down in his family to search for spiritual herbs, he finally explored a treasure land where the possibility of finding a sixth-grade spiritual herb was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The excited Meng Shushu was about to enter the treasure land, but discovered that the treasure land had another world within, and there was a powerful force lurking there.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, Meng Shushu would simply retreat, after all, it was quite normal for some treasure lands to be occupied by forces, as many forces would establish their sects on top of such treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>However, the force occupying this treasure land was actually the Black Robe faction!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to retreat, he witnessed a Black Robe cultivator emerge from a stone wall, and in a fleeting glance, he saw a small herb growing inside the stone wall, which was extremely similar to a certain fifth-grade spiritual herb recorded in the books.</p><p></p><p>That Black Robe cultivator was a master-level warrior, and Meng Shushu believed his strength was slightly superior to the opponent's. He was about to seize the opportunity to make a move, but discovered that there was a secret chamber behind that stone wall.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura was emanating from the secret chamber, and Meng Shushu hurriedly and cautiously retreated, leaving the treasure land. After that, he began to look for Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"That person is most likely a peak great master!" Meng Shushu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Black Robe faction's lair?" Meng Chong's eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Meng Shushu wanted to find his senior brother. A peak great master, with his current strength, he naturally would not fear a peak great master, but to defeat one would be impossible in a short time.</p><p></p><p>If he had not accumulated a deep foundation, he might not even be able to defeat a peak great master.</p><p></p><p>If that was truly the Black Robe faction's lair, there would surely be more than one peak great master there. Only his elder brother could take them all down!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, are you sure there is a fifth-grade spiritual herb there?" Meng Chong asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"About 80% sure!" Meng Shushu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Robe faction is truly wealthy!" Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this matter is not urgent for now. Their lair is there, and it won't run away. You've done well, and in the future, you should continue to strive, with spirit storage bags and fifth-grade spiritual herbs as your goals.</p><p></p><p>You must believe in yourself. Great masters are not the ultimate goal. If you lose your ambition, you won't even be able to break through to become a great master."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted Meng Shushu's shoulder and encouraged him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do my best, and try to find more spiritual herbs," Meng Shushu said with a lack of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"This is a dan pill refined from the essence of the Heavenly Dew, which can enhance your innate talents and comprehension abilities. Its effects are much stronger than consuming the Heavenly Dew itself. I promise I'll give you one, and I won't go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled and took out a Heavenly Dew Dan.</p><p></p><p>As long as Meng Shushu took this dan pill and tasted its benefits, his fighting spirit would surely be ignited.</p><p></p><p>"This is the dan pill?" Meng Shushu looked at the jade bottle containing the Heavenly Dew Dan, completely amazed. Just by looking at it, he could tell this dan pill was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Find a place to take the dan pill, and in the future, if you need to find me, you can go to the Changqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Shushu nodded, eager to try the effects of the dan pill.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Bianyuan, Meng Chong found Su Lingxiu and told her about Meng Shushu's news.</p><p></p><p>"Is it truly the Black Robe faction's lair?" Su Lingxiu's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Not entirely certain, it may just be a treasure land they control, with a powerful cultivator stationed there," Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"There seems to be a fifth-grade spiritual herb there. My elder brother and I will definitely bring the spiritual herb back."</p><p></p><p>The preciousness and miraculous effects of a fifth-grade spiritual herb could be seen from the Heavenly Dew Dan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother." Su Lingxiu was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm going back to the Inner Realm," Su Lingxiu said while massaging her teacher's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, then go to the Inner Realm," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was time to go to the Inner Realm. That was where the true martial arts world of this world was located.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving!" Li Xuan stood up, waving his hand to make the chair fall onto Chihu's back, while Shi Er was hanging two large baskets on Chihu's body, which angered the great cat.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's mouth twitched, this big cat was stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>"Chihu, the things in these baskets are not mine, they belong to the master and the young miss. If you don't want to carry them, you might... in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er spoke helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chihu glared at him, as if blaming him for not saying it earlier.</p><p></p><p>"This fatty tiger has actually become smarter, could it really be turning into a great demon?" Shi Er cursed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat on the chair on Chihu's back, and even placed a small table in front of the chair, brewing a pot of Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea and some pastries.</p><p></p><p>These pastries were refined by Su Lingxiu using her alchemy techniques, combined with spiritual fruits, as an offering to her teacher.</p><p></p><p>Chihu's body was large, but with the chair and small table, there was still ample space. Su Lingxiu also got on Chihu's back, sitting behind Li Xuan, and started kneading her teacher's shoulders, happily asking, "Master, how do the spiritual pastries taste?"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, now that I'm going to the Inner Realm, there's a chance my identity may be exposed, and I'm afraid it will cause you trouble," Su Lingxiu said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble? For me, there is no such thing as trouble, just like this ant." Li Xuan raised his hand, and a small ant was crawling on his finger. He pinched his two fingers together, crushing the tiny ant into dust.</p><p></p><p>"You see, can this ant cause me any trouble?" Su Lingxiu was stunned, then became greatly excited. "Master, I was overthinking."</p><p></p><p>In her master's eyes, even her sworn enemies, the peak great masters, were nothing more than ants.</p><p></p><p>"You understand now, but I'm actually quite lazy. Although it's just an ant, I don't even want to bother crushing it," Li Xuan nodded, then added.</p><p></p><p>Although with his strength, he could easily swat away a group of great masters, he was worried that his disciple would think she had a powerful backer, and end up provoking cultivators even stronger than great masters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Xuan reckoned that even cultivators above great masters would not be his match, but he was concerned about even higher-level experts.</p><p></p><p>As for whether such experts existed in the Inner Realm, it was an unknown. The old man who had his soul stolen in the Wu Kingdom was clearly not at the great master level.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful beings might not be in the Inner Realm, but they must exist somewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand. I won't actively invite trouble," Su Lingxiu said happily.</p><p></p><p>Chihu carried Li Xuan and Su Lingxiu into the boundless mountains, heading towards the Inner Realm. Shi Er and Zhou Ying followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Later, Xu Yan and Meng Chong also arrived.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan came to bid farewell as well, saying they would return to the Sword Veneration Peak to collect and purchase the Heavenly Dew Dan they owed, and would bring the spiritual herbs in ten to fifteen days.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the Bianyuan had already faded into the distance, and the Inner Realm was right in front of them. From this day on, they would truly step into the martial arts world of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Bianyuan cultivators took their first step towards the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

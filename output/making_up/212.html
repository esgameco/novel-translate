        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu regained his composure, his expression a bit awkward, and said, "Junior Xu, Junior Meng, they are just like that, don't pay too much attention to their words.</p><p></p><p>"That madman, just a few days ago he managed to cultivate and research a secret technique, almost crippling himself. I've been worrying myself sick over them.</p><p></p><p>"They are so reckless, it's simply foolish!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Martial Arts Scholars, with a few of them limping, their injuries not yet healed, guessing that they were all from accidents while cultivating their own researched martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"They are all admirable warriors!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. </p><p></p><p>He had some admiration for these fellows, recklessly researching and experimenting with martial arts secrets on their own.</p><p></p><p>Not finding outsiders to test and research their martial arts secrets, this mindset is also worthy of affirmation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan even suspected that if he were to fabricate a cultivation method, they would probably start cultivating it without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts secrets they research are derived from the vast array of martial arts cultivation methods, since they have a basis, that's why they dare to cultivate them, and not just made up out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"If the cultivation methods were just fabricated, there would be no one in this world who would cultivate them, let alone succeed in cultivating them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone cultivate something that was just made up? It would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>The collection of the Scholars' Pavilion was much smaller than the Typical Repository, but they were all core secrets, involving broader martial arts and more secret techniques, especially with the accumulated experiences and insights of generations of martial arts scholars.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were browsing the collection in the Scholars' Pavilion, further understanding the martial arts of the inner domain, drawing analogies and verifying their own, perhaps able to gain some inspiration from it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Desolation Cabinet, a secret meeting was convened. Guo Yunshan sat at the head of the cabinet, and although his strength was not strong, none of the elders present dared to offend his dignity.</p><p></p><p>Even the martial artists from the inner domain who had joined the cabinet knew Guo Yunshan's status in the Great Desolation, and knew that offending him would have serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Desolation seemed weak, Canglan Island was its mainstay, able to suppress the entire inner domain.</p><p></p><p>More and more people were cultivating the martial arts of the Great Desolation, and it had been confirmed that the martial arts of the Great Desolation were stronger than the original martial arts of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the cabinet had already obtained the method for masters to completely convert to cultivating the martial arts of the Great Desolation, which was not just a simple method of refining true qi, but a complete conversion to the martial arts of the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation's inner guards already had master-level martial artists beginning to convert to cultivating the martial arts of the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunshan sat at the head, looking at the members of the cabinet, his heart filled with mixed emotions, never having imagined that one day he would sit in such an exalted position.</p><p></p><p>Normally, unless it was a major issue, he would not participate in the cabinet meetings, spending more time on his own cultivation, constantly improving his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear that in the world of martial artists, the strong are respected.</p><p></p><p>Although he had obtained this lofty position relying on his grandson Xu Yan, his own strength could not be too lacking either.</p><p></p><p>Today's meeting was of great importance, so he came.</p><p></p><p>Several figures, wearing hoods to conceal their faces and with their voices altered, participated in the cabinet meeting.</p><p></p><p>These were all the high-ranking officials of the Great Yue Kingdom who had been subverted.</p><p></p><p>They did not know the identity of the others, and it was not yet time to reveal their identities.</p><p></p><p>Only a few people knew the identities of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Today's cabinet meeting was about how the Great Desolation could replace and annex the Great Yue Kingdom, and how to act to successfully annex the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial house has suffered heavy losses, the Heavenly Robe Guard and Heavenlyå¾¡ Guard are still not weak in strength, so it will not be easy to overthrow the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial house," said a hooded figure in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Great Yue imperial house cannot be underestimated. Although we can control most of the prefectures and armies of the Great Yue Kingdom, the core power is still in the hands of the imperial house."</p><p></p><p>"We need a strong expert or a powerful force to suppress the Great Yue imperial house, only then can we smoothly replace the Great Yue!"</p><p></p><p>Several hooded figures expressed their views.</p><p></p><p>After much discussion, everyone looked to Guo Yunshan, as the final decision would depend on him.</p><p></p><p>The true strong ones of the Great Desolation could only be contacted by him.</p><p></p><p>Before Guo Yunshan could speak, a person walked in, fan in hand, with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The strong ones will naturally come, you don't need to worry, just act according to the plan," said Kou Ruozhi with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The rebellion was planned by him and the two emperors, including how to subvert the high-ranking officials of the Great Yue Kingdom, all these measures were participated in by him and the two emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation cabinet meeting dispersed, and the high-ranking officials of the Great Yue Kingdom who had come quietly also left quietly.</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Palace of the Great Yue Kingdom, in the Imperial Study.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor felt somewhat heavy-hearted. The Great Yue Kingdom seemed to have calmed down, with no apparent crisis, but precisely because of this, he felt that a crisis was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Among the five Princely Dukes, the Zheng Duke had shown signs of disloyalty and a tendency to secede from the Great Yue Kingdom, which greatly surprised the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Among the five Princely Dukes, the Du Duke was the strongest and most likely to break free from the control of the Great Yue Kingdom, so he had always been the target of suppression, and the crisis in the Du Duke's mansion was related to the behind-the-scenes manipulation of the imperial house.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Zheng Duke, who had always been loyal and obedient to the imperial house, was now going to rebel and become independent.</p><p></p><p>If the Zheng Duke succeeded, the other four Princely Dukes would also develop disloyalty and secede from the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The chain reaction triggered by this would not be as simple as just one Princely Duke becoming independent.</p><p></p><p>It would represent the decline of the Great Yue Kingdom, and some aristocratic families and clans would certainly become restless.</p><p></p><p>If not handled properly, the Great Yue Kingdom could even be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an edict, the Heavenly Robe Guard and Divine Spear Army are to suppress the Zheng Duke's mansion, order the four Dukes to assist, and divide the Zheng Duke's mansion based on their contributions..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He must suppress the Zheng Duke's mansion with a thunderous force. If he showed any weakness, all those with disloyalty would make a move!</p><p></p><p>Since the last major action of the Great Yue Kingdom to suppress the Evergreen Hall, it was time to demonstrate its power again, this time targeting the mansion of the Zheng Duke among the five Princely Dukes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Yue Kingdom was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Xuan let out a breath, finally having completed the editing of the Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the feedback information on the Dao Golden Book:</p><p></p><p>Unbreakable Golden Body:</p><p>Perfection Degree: Medium-High</p><p>Boundary Connection Degree: High</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: Medium-High</p><p></p><p>The Perfection Degree had reached the Medium-High evaluation as desired, which could be considered quite complete.</p><p></p><p>The Boundary Connection was evaluated as High, which was an unexpected pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Cultivation Difficulty was still evaluated as High, but the Comprehension Difficulty was evaluated as Medium-High.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the Comprehension Difficulty has dropped to Medium-High as desired, Meng Chong's talent is not bad, comprehending it should not be a problem. The Cultivation Difficulty is high, but as long as he can comprehend it, the cultivation itself should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Being able to use the Golden Finger to edit martial arts cultivation methods, it was indeed much easier and simpler.</p><p></p><p>Now that the cultivation method was edited, it could only be truly perfected and widely disseminated after it was comprehended and cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The conditions required for cultivation would then become the normal martial arts requirements.</p><p></p><p>Of course, cultivation still depended on talent...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It has always been demanding, wanting to cultivate to higher realms, the natural talent must not be poor.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain martial dao is like this, and the Great Desolate martial dao is naturally no exception.</p><p></p><p>There are many who cultivate the martial dao, but how many are martial grandmasters?</p><p></p><p>And how many are great grandmasters? This shows that the further one goes in the martial dao, the higher the talent requirement, the strength of martial artists presents a pyramid-like situation, the stronger they are, the fewer their numbers.</p><p></p><p>"I need to compile the cultivation methods for the realms after the Divine Will Realm, and pass them all to Xu Yan in one go.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can reduce the comprehension difficulty of the cultivation methods to medium-high, with Xu Yan's prodigious talent, he should be able to comprehend and break through the realms."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye grew increasingly excited.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xu Yan comprehends the cultivation methods, he can obtain the feedback of that realm, his realms will keep rising, allowing him to greatly surpass his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there will always be a period where he and his disciple are at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength is a hundred times greater, he will ultimately be at the same realm, not surpassing his disciple.</p><p></p><p>The only way to always surpass his disciple's martial dao realms is to compile the cultivation methods of the future realms in advance, and let Xu Yan comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>"I need to think carefully, after the Divine Will Realm, how should I compile them, and continue to maintain my strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>As for the Mysterious Gate martial dao, there is no hurry for now, his fourth disciple's shadow has not even appeared yet, compiling it will require finding a suitable disciple to comprehend and cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>The urgent matter is to focus on enhancing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao strength in the Spirit Realm is currently unknown, with his current Divine Will Realm strength, he may not be able to sweep everything effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he cannot sweep everything effortlessly, Li Xuanye will feel a lack of security, the image of a superior person may suddenly be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, enhancing his own strength is the urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong have returned.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>The two respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, second brother, you're back."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu came running over excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Xu Yan and Meng Chong each recounted their experiences.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the serrated knife Meng Chong brought back was the Demonic Lord's Blood Spirit Knife, it can be confirmed that Meng Chong had killed the Demonic Lord's remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh, the Demonic Lord was really an unlucky fellow.</p><p></p><p>Originally he was about to rise again, but ended up targeting Meng Chong, and now he is completely dead.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye also learned about the Three Celestial Realms from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still felt indignant about killing that martial dao celestial, he didn't provoke him at all, but he started insulting him as a pig and dog.</p><p></p><p>He deserved to die! </p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye inwardly clicked his tongue, that little celestial was really unlucky to have encountered Xu Yan, being high and mighty but still insulting him, his death was not undeserved.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong and Xu Yan returned, they were all summarizing their own gains and accumulating their foundations, the opening of the Spirit Realm's gate, they all felt a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>Especially after killing a martial dao celestial.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what forces he belonged to, they might come seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was anxious for several days after learning that the Spirit Realm's gate had opened, perhaps it was related to Su Ling Xiu's origins, Li Xuanye did not ask further.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu felt a sense of urgency, and began to prepare for breaking through the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed out the key points for her to break through the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>That day, Meng Chong was cultivating when Kou Ruozhi came with a flattering smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Meng, there's something I'd like to ask you for a favor."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the Great Desolate, we are preparing to replace the Great Yue Kingdom and establish the Great Desolate, everything is ready, we just lack a powerful expert to suppress the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family.</p><p></p><p>"You know that during the siege of Canglan Island, the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family was secretly supporting it, we can't let them off easily.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu is a bit stronger, but..."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi smiled awkwardly, he was afraid when he saw Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It's better to find Meng Chong, and Meng Chong is alone, his towering and majestic figure is more intimidating and fits the image of a Great Desolate martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered for a moment, then nodded: "Alright, the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family is it? I'll go suppress them right away."</p><p></p><p>Since the royal family of the Great Yue Kingdom secretly supported the siege of Canglan Island, they should settle the account, they can't be easily forgiven.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate replacing the Great Yue is also a good thing.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm experts look down on the Inner Realm, with disdain. Although he comes from the Outer Desolate, when it comes down to it, he is also in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the collapse of the dynasties, the Inner Realm's people are not united, it's time for the Great Desolate to unify the Inner Realm and replace it, moreover, the martial dao of the Great Desolate can be cultivated in the Inner Realm without restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the martial dao strength of the Inner Realm will be on par with the Spirit Realm, so that the experts of the Spirit Realm can no longer look down on them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Senior Meng!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>That day, Meng Chong left Canglan Island with Kou Ruozhi, heading towards the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>An event that will impact the situation in the Inner Realm, with far-reaching consequences, is about to unfold.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye sighed inwardly: "In the future, there will be no more Inner Realm, only the Great Desolate."</p><p></p><p>But whether it's the Inner Realm or the Great Desolate, they are just one region in the vast heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began to prepare for the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>She has already reached the Spiritual Wood Spiritual Body stage, after breaking through the Penetrating Mystery Realm, she will not have a transcendent transformation, it's just that after breaking through the Penetrating Mystery Realm, she will be able to cultivate the Void Refining Pill Technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye walked leisurely to the front of the Scarlet Cat.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was frowning, dragging a thick golden chain, climbing onto the Scarlet Cat, preparing to hang the golden chain around its neck.</p><p></p><p>This was the third golden chain he had changed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to wait for the Scarlet Cat to undergo its transformation before preparing the golden chain for it, but the Scarlet Cat refused, insisting that he change the golden chain for it.</p><p></p><p>It seems that having a golden chain hanging around its neck will make its cultivation easier.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er seriously doubted that the Scarlet Cat was taking revenge on him! The Scarlet Cat, as big as a small mountain, with thunderous roars occasionally sounding from within, its demonic aura rolling, its powerful pressure occasionally revealing itself.</p><p></p><p>"The first great demon, it must have some fortune and opportunities, according to the current trend, after the Scarlet Cat's transformation, it should be comparable to entering the Penetrating Mystery Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye roughly judged the Scarlet Cat's strength.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after transforming into a great demon, its strength would be comparable to the Innate Realm, but the Scarlet Cat is the first great demon, belonging to the pioneer of the great demon martial dao, its initial strength is naturally stronger, which is understandable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it has consumed so many pills, accumulating a rich foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat opened its eyes, although Li Xuanye is small compared to its body size, even smaller than one of its eyes, the Scarlet Cat was still anxious in its heart.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of being cooked!</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the person it fears the most is Xu Yan, and then Li Xuanye.</p><p></p><p>After all, the master may say he will cook it, but it seems to be more of a scare.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan is different, if he says he wants to cook it, he will really cook it, and Xu Yan's aura somehow makes it feel afraid.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

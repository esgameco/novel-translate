        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 19: Xu Yan Refines Golden Bones (Seeking Continued Readership)</p><p></p><p>"So this is the 'Enlighten the Heart and Observe My Cultivation of the True Intent'. Every minute detail of change is within my consciousness, and I can perceive the subtle changes in bone refinement without any leaks."</p><p></p><p>This was half a month after Xu Yan had returned to the small mountain village.</p><p></p><p>As usual, before dawn, Xu Yan was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had another enlightenment. Regarding the subtle changes in the bones, the changes in every part of the body, and the circulation of qi and blood, they were all within his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency of bone refinement had once again greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>"The two-sentence formula is by no means just this, I have not truly grasped its essence yet!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, the formula passed down by his master was truly profound.</p><p></p><p>Each time he felt that he had grasped the profundity.</p><p></p><p>But the result, a flash of insight, suddenly revealed that his understanding was still not enough!</p><p></p><p>"Now I have undergone eight transformations, and my entire skeleton has turned into golden bones!"</p><p></p><p>"Only the last transformation is left, and I will be able to have a complete golden skeleton!"</p><p></p><p>The diligent bone refinement over the past half month, especially the renewed enlightenment of the formula, has deepened his control over qi and blood, and the speed of bone refinement has also increased significantly. He has now undergone the eighth transformation.</p><p></p><p>His entire skeleton has turned golden.</p><p></p><p>The ninth transformation, to have a complete golden skeleton, is not far away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to cultivate, he had a premonition that the golden bones would be refined within the next one or two days.</p><p></p><p>"Once I refine the golden bones, I will be on par with the ancient geniuses, and I can start refining the viscera.</p><p></p><p>"Mastering it within a year should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"As for the jade bones, my master said that it is not something that can be achieved through talent and perseverance alone, I cannot be too ambitious and ask for too much."</p><p></p><p>Golden bones are already extraordinary, as for jade bones, that is too difficult.</p><p></p><p>If he aims too high and wastes time trying to refine the jade bones, it may prevent him from mastering it within a year.</p><p></p><p>Since he has already reached the level of the ancient geniuses, what else is there to be unsatisfied with?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xu Yan plans to start refining the viscera after completing the golden bones.</p><p></p><p>He can begin to comprehend the method of refining the viscera.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Yan was refining his bones while also recalling and deeply contemplating the method of refining the viscera that Li Xuan had taught him.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation of refining the skin and bones, refining the viscera is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>He already has the direction for refining the viscera, the only thing left is to deeply understand the profundity and mystery of the method of refining the viscera.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan yawned and looked at the cultivating Xu Yan, sighing inwardly, "This foolish disciple, he is really persistent, and he can even keep his composure?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, after all this time, he had not sensed any qi and blood from Xu Yan, but Xu Yan could still persist without any impatience.</p><p></p><p>He showed no signs of anxiety, depression, or shame in front of Li Xuan for not being able to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>He also did not continue to ask Li Xuan how to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"This mentality of his is truly rare, not anxious or depressed, but persistently cultivating diligently every day. If there really is a cultivation method, with his diligence, as long as his talent is not lacking, he can become a strong cultivator, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If he knows that I have been deceiving him, and the cultivation method is fabricated, how would he react?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that it's better not to expose it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looks like an honest person, bullying an honest person too much, if he explodes, that would not be a joke.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he is also a person of extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let him continue to play around, now the path out of the village is also safe, once the one-year period is up, I'll just send him away."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I can even collect another master's gift?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the Eastern River Prefecture or even the Qi Kingdom anymore, I'll go to the Wu Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already planned his retreat route.</p><p></p><p>Lying back in the chair.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Below, leisurely and carefree, having gotten used to the relaxed days, in the future when no one is attending to me, I'm afraid I won't be accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>In the future when I go to the Wu State, I'll have to buy a few maidservants to attend to me.</p><p></p><p>Another two days passed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached the ninth stage of his transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The golden bones are complete!"</p><p></p><p>The blood qi was being refined, and the bones were undergoing a transformation, the golden bones starting to radiate a dazzling brilliance.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The bone marrow surged like a rushing river, the blood qi instantly increasing greatly, the dragon-like blood qi suddenly expanding by more than double.</p><p></p><p>Coiling and circulating around the entire skeleton, the rushing bone marrow also underwent changes, the blood qi constantly being generated, the bones emanating a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>The golden bones were resplendent, seemingly indestructible.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He had finally refined the golden bones!</p><p></p><p>With the golden bones formed, his physical body also underwent a transformation, the blood qi becoming purer, the physical body stronger, on the golden, glittering bones seemingly appearing some profound, delicate patterns.</p><p></p><p>Just like the wondrous principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Every time the blood qi circulated, it was like a mighty dragon roaring.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the golden bones were formed, a faint golden light radiated from Xu Yan's body, his entire person seeming to be bathed in brilliance.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the sun rose, the golden sunlight shining through the alleys of the small village, illuminating Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan came out of the house, just glancing over, not paying much attention.</p><p></p><p>He just thought it was the sunlight shining on Xu Yan, as it had been many times before.</p><p></p><p>But he failed to notice that the golden light radiating from Xu Yan now was even more dazzling than the usual sunlight shining on him.</p><p></p><p>And it was emanating from within his body.</p><p></p><p>The golden light receded, Xu Yan carefully contemplating the changes within himself, comprehending the immense power of the golden bones.</p><p></p><p>With the golden bones formed, their increase in power far surpassed the previous eight transformations.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan experienced what true strength was, feeling the profundity of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the ancient prodigies?"</p><p></p><p>"I've finally refined the golden bones, meeting my master's requirements, I, Xu Yan, am no weaker than the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>"They all said I was stupid, they all mocked me, ridiculed me, in my eyes you are nothing but frogs at the bottom of a well."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan recalled the events over the years, when he sought out experts, becoming a laughingstock in the Eastern River Commandery.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the golden bones formed, his strength so great, even the top experts of the jianghu would be like paper in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You said my brain doesn't work well, bringing shame to you, I told you, I would make it so you could never match me, and I will absolutely make it so you can never match me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes gleamed with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"I feel my life force is boundless, with the golden bones formed, my lifespan has greatly increased as well.</p><p></p><p>"My master said, with the golden bones formed, even if buried underground for ten thousand years they would still be resplendent, and my own lifespan would naturally increase greatly as well."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan felt that he and the other martial artists outside were from completely different worlds.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even the old emperor of the Qi State would not make me the slightest bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Do I now have the qualifications to scorn imperial power?</p><p></p><p>"No, I cannot have such arrogant thoughts, I must be humble and not complacent, I must remember my master's teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan repeatedly admonished himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I've refined the golden bones, I must go tell my master, I now stand equal to the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed at having refined the golden bones, Xu Yan, after completing his cultivation, excitedly went to his master, wanting to personally tell him that he had refined the golden bones, standing equal to the ancient prodigies.</p><p></p><p>He had not disappointed his master!</p><p></p><p>After all, he was still a young man, unable to resist the desire to earn his master's praise.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

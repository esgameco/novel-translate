            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the manor of Yunshan County, Li Xuan sighed, "Xu Yan has already started killing grand masters. I don't know what exactly happened. It's been such a short time since he went to the inner realm, and he's either killing masters or grand masters."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Chong was being chased by grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt somewhat worried, but since they hadn't caught up to Meng Chong for so long, he shouldn't be in too much danger.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has reached the peak of the innate realm and has deeply comprehended the mysteries of true qi. He should be close to mastering the cultivation method of the Penetrating Mystery Realm," Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had almost completed the cultivation method for the realm above the Penetrating Mystery Realm. The theoretical framework was already in place, just needing some final refinements.</p><p></p><p>"Once Xu Yan masters the Penetrating Mystery cultivation method, I can pass on the cultivation method for the next realm to him. Perhaps he will comprehend it even before breaking through the Penetrating Mystery Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had great expectations for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had already entered the martial dao, and she was perfecting the Elixir Compendium, beginning to comprehend the art of manual elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>The size of the Red Cat continued to grow. The thick golden chain around its neck had been replaced with an even thicker and longer one.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, the Red Cat would either be lying at the manor gate or trying to curry favor with Su Lingxiu to obtain the elixirs she bestowed upon it. Its massive size made it appear even more majestic.</p><p></p><p>Although Shi Er had broken through to the minor success of the Qi and Blood Realm, he could no longer suppress the Red Cat, and could no longer whip it with a whip.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after a period of indoctrination, the Red Cat seemed to have genuinely believed that the whipping was for its own good.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to study ancient texts, and the more he read, the more ideas he had. Whether his conjectures were correct, he would have to wait until his strength was sufficient to verify them.</p><p></p><p>That day, Li Xuan strolled leisurely outside the manor, deciding to visit the borderlands to see if he could find a suitable next disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although the fourth martial dao system was still incomplete, just an idea with questionable feasibility, it didn't stop him from determining the next disciple.</p><p></p><p>He could temporarily not take the disciple in, and wait until the fourth martial dao system was completed before accepting them.</p><p></p><p>With this idea in mind, Li Xuan set out. He first went to the East River Commandery to visit Xu Yan's parents.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's master, he should meet his parents.</p><p></p><p>The Xu couple was overjoyed and hurriedly performed a grand ceremony, for Li Xuan was the Martial Dao Saint and the Martial Ancestor of the Borderlands, the object of worship for the martial cultivators of the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family, as a prestigious martial dao clan in the Borderlands, often had martial cultivators come seeking guidance.</p><p></p><p>After the conversation, Li Xuan sighed, finding Xu Junhe to be a remarkable person, no wonder he could marry the daughter of the former Commandery Governor and become the wealthiest man. Xu Junhe's talent was also not bad, slightly better than Shi Er, and he had already reached the minor success of the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu's martial dao realm was a bit lower, but she had no ambition for martial dao cultivation, only doting on her precious son Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan could freely seek out high-level cultivators to train and spend money without restraint - it was all due to Lady Xu's indulgence.</p><p></p><p>After imparting some guidance, Li Xuan departed.</p><p></p><p>He then went to the capital of the Qi Kingdom, but did not reveal his true identity, only wandering around as an ordinary person before leaving Qi.</p><p></p><p>He then went to the Wu Kingdom and then to the Northern Barbarians, one of the three Borderland Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Barbarians were different from Qi and Wu, being composed of multiple tribes. The Northern Barbarian King was chosen by force, and after each king's death, the tribes would compete to determine the next king.</p><p></p><p>The one with the strongest martial prowess would become the king.</p><p></p><p>This place greatly revered martial might and valor. With the current old king nearing death, the major tribes, including the king's own tribe, were engaged in fierce battles to determine the next king.</p><p></p><p>The eventual victor would represent their tribe in the competition for the kingship.</p><p></p><p>Due to its remote location on the grassland borderlands, far from Qi and Wu, and being in a transitional period between the old and new, the Northern Barbarians were unaware of the changes in Qi and Wu.</p><p></p><p>Martial dao had not yet reached this place.</p><p></p><p>According to Northern Barbarian customs, once a new king was established, they would launch a southern invasion of Qi and Wu to plunder resources and demonstrate the might of the Northern Barbarian king.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stayed in the Northern Barbarians for two days, and he could almost foresee the scene of the martial cultivators from Qi and Wu easily repelling the Northern Barbarian invasion.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head with some regret, Li Xuan found no suitable disciple in the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>He began to return to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>"Having already taken in Xu Yan and Meng Chong from the Borderlands is already remarkable. Lingxiu came from the inner realm, so it's unlikely I'll find another suitable disciple in the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"How could such a small Borderlands produce so many prodigies?" Li Xuan chuckled wryly, abandoning the idea of finding another disciple in the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush for a new disciple, since the new martial dao system isn't completed yet."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Xuan returned to Yunshan County and sat down, golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain the grand master chasing Meng Chong, and your River and Mountain Sword Intent has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Indeed! Xu Yan had gone and killed the grand master pursuing Meng Chong after receiving the news.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is still fierce!" Li Xuan marveled inwardly. Xu Yan had directly taken on high-level opponents in the inner realm, slaying masters and grand masters one after another.</p><p></p><p>Just after breaking through to the peak of the innate realm, he had already defeated a grand master, and now he had killed another grand master.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain the grand master chasing Meng Chong, and your River and Mountain Sword Intent has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>So, the one chasing Meng Chong was not just a single grand master?</p><p></p><p>There were so many grand masters in the inner realm that Xu Yan could just randomly encounter them?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already killed three grand masters!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain multiple grand masters, and you have gained the Annihilation Sword Intent!"</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the golden finger continued.</p><p></p><p>Annihilation Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, finally gaining a sword intent of his own, beyond just his disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilation Sword Intent, capable of annihilating all, was incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Martial cultivators should go forth and explore the martial dao world. My disciples, go forth and blaze your unstoppable paths!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's hands were circulating qi and blood, refining them into elixir flames, as she practiced the art of manual elixir refinement. She had been practicing for several days and had already grasped the key to elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Her elixir refinement art should have improved again, right?" Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, Li Xuan didn't know what they would do after reuniting.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, Li Xuan took his bamboo staff and pointed out the acupoints on the Red Cat's body, especially the one on its head, instructing it to focus on opening that acupoint first.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The red cat still had a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the great demon's technique can succeed. If it does succeed, what kind of feedback will I get?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>After all, the great demon's technique was the way of the great demons. As a human, what kind of feedback could he get? Could he cultivate the great demon's technique?</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking it. Whether the red cat can cultivate it is still unknown."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's expression was grave, with beads of sweat on her forehead. Her delicate white hands gathered the blood qi into a cinnabar furnace shape, while another stream of blood qi was refined into cinnabar fire, enveloping the cinnabar furnace.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, her hand trembled, and the blood qi dissipated, leaving a few medicinal pills in her palm.</p><p></p><p>She had successfully refined the pills with just her bare hands!</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Xuan sat down, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has mastered your manual of refining pills with bare hands. You have obtained the Void Pill Refining Technique (Elementary)."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. He had instantly and completely grasped the Void Pill Refining Technique, as if he had been born with the knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This was a truly powerful pill refining technique, even at the elementary level.</p><p></p><p>"Once Su Ling Xiu becomes proficient in refining pills with her bare hands, I'll pass on the Void Pill Refining Technique to her. With that as a foundation, she can further comprehend even stronger pill refining techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>After successfully refining pills with her blood qi, Su Ling Xiu's speed and the quality of the pills were significantly better than using a furnace, though she could not produce them in large quantities. For mass production, a pill furnace would be necessary.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Ling Xiu would continue to cultivate the Pill Dao while refining pills, using the Pill Dao Compendium as a basis.</p><p></p><p>She was not far from fully comprehending the Blood Qi Realm, almost catching up to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>And with the help of the medicinal pills, Zhou Ying was also not far from entering the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Another beautiful day."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan brewed a pot of tea and savored it, having grown fond of drinking tea these days. It seemed to have a scholarly elegance to it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has killed a Sect Master cultivator. You have gained experience from the Extinguish Deity Slash, and it has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, wondering if this was the start of Meng Chong's revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Grand Sect Master. Your Void Sword Intent has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had killed another Grand Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"These Grand Sect Masters are too weak, like big cabbages, easy to kill?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was speechless. Xie Lingfeng, Hu Shan, and even Su Ling Xiu had all said that the Grand Sect Masters in the Inner Realm were true top-tier experts, leading the first-class forces. But the results were like this?</p><p></p><p>"They must have had a limited perspective, thinking the Grand Sect Masters were so strong. In reality, they are not that powerful. There should be many first-class forces with Grand Sect Masters in the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt relieved, realizing that there were still plenty of Grand Sect Masters for Xu Yan to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has comprehended the initial form of the Pill Dao Martial Classic. You have obtained the Pill Dao Martial Classic."</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was truly excited this time. The Pill Dao Martial Classic was the complete system of the Pill Dao, including pill refining, medicine, and combat techniques. Su Ling Xiu had already gained some understanding of the Golden Needle Acupuncture and Golden Needle Techniques, all based on the Pill Dao Compendium.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had discovered a way to accelerate the acquisition of the Heavenly Tribulation Feedback. By passing the initial Pill Dao Martial Classic to Su Ling Xiu, she could quickly master the complete system and use it as a foundation to comprehend even higher levels of the Pill Dao Martial Classic.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when will my senior brothers return?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu came over and sighed as she massaged his shoulders. She had refined all the medicinal herbs collected by Kou Ruozhi and the others, but the effects were not very strong since they were not spiritual herbs. And the pill-refining process had become effortless for her.</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual herbs, she could not refine the true medicinal pills described in the Pill Dao Compendium.</p><p></p><p>"They should be back soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted her small hand and stood up, saying, "Since you have entered the path, and there are no more herbs to refine, you should focus on cultivating your martial arts and comprehending the Bagua."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Su Ling Xiu's eyes lit up. Her senior brothers' exceptional body techniques were all derived from their Bagua comprehension, and the Bagua encompassed the profound principles of heaven and earth. If she could gain even a glimpse of understanding, it would be invaluable.</p><p></p><p>In the mountain forest outside the manor, where Xu Yan and Meng Chong had once comprehended the Bagua, Li Xuan stepped forward, and the Bagua diagram instantly appeared on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The Bagua consists of Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen, Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui. This is the Bagua diagram..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the Bagua to Su Ling Xiu, and then said, "Ponder on it well. When your senior brothers return, you can ask them for guidance."</p><p></p><p>Leaving Su Ling Xiu to immerse herself in Bagua comprehension, Li Xuan returned to the manor with a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu reduced her pill refining, only occasionally refining pills with her bare hands to hone the technique, and spent more time cultivating the Bagua and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched the diligently cultivating Zhou Ying, who had successfully transitioned to martial arts cultivation with the help of the medicinal pills and was now in the Refine Dantian stage, about to complete it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's cultivation was extremely arduous, perhaps due to the responsibilities she had borne, always protecting and caring for the young Su Ling Xiu, who was like a daughter to her.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, and a faint sword intent enveloped Zhou Ying, allowing her to complete the Refine Dantian stage and enter the Martial Arts Initiation stage more quickly.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Zhou Ying's bones and muscles thundered as she entered the Martial Arts Initiation stage.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Tribulation Feedback did not activate.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm stronger, she has only just entered the Martial Arts Initiation stage, which is no longer enough to trigger the feedback. To get the feedback, I may need a larger number of Martial Arts Initiates."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. There were many cultivators in the Borderlands, but the number of Martial Arts Initiates was probably less than fifty.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has broken through to the Blood Qi Realm Mastery. You have obtained the Pill Dao Martial Classic (Innate Realm)."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had broken through to the Blood Qi Realm Mastery.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

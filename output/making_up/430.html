        <h1>Chapter 430</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary beings who transcend heaven and earth probably couldn't write this, after all, transcending heaven and earth doesn't necessarily mean having such an intimate understanding of the Cangqiong realm.</p><p></p><p>There's only one possibility! Only the ruler of the Cangqiong realm could have such an intimate understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Cangqiong Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Cangqiong Realm must have encountered some mishap and left behind this Cangqiong Book for future generations. Whoever obtains the Cangqiong Book can become the new Lord of the Cangqiong Realm!"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan didn't understand - if this book existed and whoever obtained it could become the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm, why weren't powerful beings searching for and fighting over it? Or perhaps there had been struggles for it in the past, but due to some special circumstances, the Cangqiong Book had been lost in the borderlands and forgotten as time passed?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the Cangqiong Realm and could faintly see scars left by great battles. Were these scars caused by fights over the Cangqiong Book?</p><p></p><p>Or were they left behind when the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm fought off enemies?</p><p></p><p>"Could that majestic figure Xu Yan saw be the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm?" Li Xuan wondered in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"So, did the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm die or what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Was the appearance of the Cangqiong Book in the borderland state of Wu an accident, or was there some connection? What was the relationship between the being in the small stone house in the Wu royal palace and the Cangqiong Book? Could that being be the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm?</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible. How could the Lord of the Cangqiong Realm be sealed within the Cangqiong Realm?" Unless they were suppressing a great enemy?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, feeling excited as if he had discovered some incredible secret.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this Wu Tiannan is quite interesting. Is he truly a child of destiny?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was about to head to Wu when he suddenly became surprised.</p><p></p><p>With his increased power and insight into the Cangqiong Realm, he immediately noticed something odd through his martial arts connection with Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's body contained the destiny of the Cangqiong Realm, which allowed him to turn danger into safety and obtain opportunities even when facing powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with this realm's destiny?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. If he used the Eye of Heaven's Way to look at Wu Tiannan, he could naturally perceive everything.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's not a bad thing for Wu Tiannan after all."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the principles related to the realm's destiny, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"This is interesting. It seems the person Wu Tiannan saved back then was quite extraordinary, truly someone with great destiny."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to meet me and receive my guidance, he can be considered part of my sect. He really does have great fortune."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back on Wu Tiannan's experiences, Li Xuan couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Divine Realm, as Wu Tiannan's strength broke through, he began to touch upon the realm's destiny, fully awakening the destiny within him.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his cultivation speed increased rapidly, and he was even able to cultivate divine abilities. </p><p></p><p>No wonder Wu Tiannan was the first among the Cangqiong martial artists to cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"He's not far from the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an odd expression. If his guess was correct, after Wu Tiannan broke through to the Immortal Realm, he might even be able to break through beyond the Immortal Realm in the Divine Realm under the guidance of destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Is Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide there?"</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, with his insight into the Cangqiong Realm, judging from Wu Tiannan's destiny, it seemed to have some karmic connection to that place.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give Wu Tiannan some more guidance when I have time. I should also go back to Wu to take a look. I'm curious about who that person in the stone house is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt excited inside.</p><p></p><p>He was about to uncover a mystery and satisfy his curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Let Xu Yan consolidate for a while before passing on to him martial arts methods beyond the Realm Boundary."</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out of Li Xuan's body and sat down in a chair, relaxed and carefree.</p><p></p><p>This was his Extreme Soul Body.</p><p></p><p>Although there shouldn't be any accidents at the Qinghua Realm, Li Xuan still left behind his Extreme Soul Body just in case. If any special situations really did occur, it could suppress them in time.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Cangqiong Book, Li Xuan vanished from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Body remained sitting in the chair as usual, relaxed and carefree. No one could tell it was another martial arts version of Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, as spiritual energy increased, cultivation speed became faster and faster. The grade of spiritual herbs also improved. After years of development, the overall strength had long surpassed the former Inner Regions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, almost everyone in the Great Wilderness now practiced martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts classics of the former Inner Regions had not been destroyed, but became a part of history, stored in the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy and some former martial arts forces.</p><p></p><p>At Sword Veneration Cliff, after Xie Tianheng and Xie Lingfeng left, the current masters of Sword Veneration Cliff were the father and son Hu Hai and Hu Shan. Both had cultivated sword intent and could be considered the number one swordsmen in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island, the holy land of the Great Wilderness, was surrounded by great formations. Every year, prodigies recommended by the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy would come here to cultivate for a month and learn more profound martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The alchemists of Changqing Pavilion held respected positions in the Great Wilderness. Artifact refiners had also begun to appear, all left behind by Xu Yan back then.</p><p></p><p>The entire Great Wilderness was developing vigorously, but conflicts were naturally unavoidable. However, everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>The borderlands remained special. Although spiritual energy was not scarce, it was violent, without the existence of natural energy.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally martial artists from the Great Wilderness would come here to cultivate and experience the violent spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Cangqiong martial arts could not be cultivated without natural energy, but Great Wilderness martial arts did not require it.</p><p></p><p>In the northern barbarian lands of the borderlands, a great leader had emerged, leading a large army to invade the former states of Qi and Wu, intending to unify the borderlands.</p><p></p><p>The northern barbarians, living in the harsh borderlands, did not yet know about the changes in the borderlands or the emergence of martial arts. After a period of intense internal turmoil, they reunified, and the Northern Barbarian Court produced its strongest leader in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Having accumulated sufficient strength, they finally embarked on the path of conquest, intending to unify the world.</p><p></p><p>When the Qi Emperor and Wu Emperor learned of this, they were excited. With just the two of them, they swept through the northern barbarian army, capturing the barbarian leader alive.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of all the northern barbarians were devastated. They had originally thought they could destroy Qi and Wu in one fell swoop and occupy the fertile lands, but they were swept aside by just two people!</p><p></p><p>The power they displayed was like that of gods! Even the true gods the barbarians worshipped and offered sacrifices to seemed like ants in comparison!</p><p></p><p>The northern barbarian leader was dumbfounded. Anyone with slightly weaker willpower would have been driven mad by the shock! After this incident, the northern barbarians changed. They began to submit to the two emperors of the Great Wilderness and become citizens of the Great Wilderness. The barbarian leader was even more decisive, kneeling down to become a disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The northern barbarians have strong physiques and can endure hardship. They are suitable for cultivating the Great Wilderness physical martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>And so, some talented northern barbarian prodigies were taught the Great Sun Golden Bell Technique and began to cultivate Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the past...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Inner Domain had long been forgotten by people, to the point where even the younger generation didn't know that the Great Wilderness was once called the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The older generation of martial artists rarely mentioned the Inner Domain. Only in the historical records of martial arts academies was some history about the Inner Domain before the Great Wilderness recorded. The number of martial artists who practiced Inner Domain martial arts was ultimately too vast, and not everyone could successfully transition to Great Wilderness martial arts. Therefore, among the older generation of martial artists, those practicing Inner Domain martial arts still made up the majority.</p><p></p><p>However, although these martial artists did not practice Great Wilderness martial arts, they had integrated into the Great Wilderness. They no longer called themselves Inner Domain martial artists, but took pride in being Great Wilderness martial artists.</p><p></p><p>In the frontier lands, in the Wu Kingdom's palace.</p><p></p><p>This place had become one of the two emperors' palaces in the Great Wilderness. Emperor Wu would come to reside in this palace for a period of time each year.</p><p></p><p>But the vast palace was cold and quiet most of the time, only becoming lively during the days when Emperor Wu returned.</p><p></p><p>Usually, it was some former eunuchs who cleaned the palace.</p><p></p><p>The eunuchs who remained were basically those without much martial arts talent, unable to pursue the martial path, and could only spend the rest of their lives here.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these eunuchs actually did practice some martial arts, but their abilities were very poor. However, it was enough to give them sufficient physical strength to clean the palace and do some odd jobs.</p><p></p><p>When Emperor Wu returned, he would reward them with some medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had already abolished the eunuch system. The eunuchs serving Emperor Wu and Emperor Qi were all from the initial batch, with no new eunuchs.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the palace, there was a palace building that only Emperor Wu could enter.</p><p></p><p>In the cold and quiet palace, inside a small stone house, a muttering voice suddenly sounded, "What's going on? Why does it feel increasingly wrong? The spiritual energy and the world's spiritual mechanism are increasing too quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, that kid Emperor Wu has actually become a martial artist, but why is the martial art he practices different from what I know? Could it be that Tai Cang has fallen? Impossible, if it had fallen, why haven't I noticed?"</p><p></p><p>This voice was full of doubt and confusion.</p><p></p><p>If Emperor Wu were here, he would know that this voice was the mysterious voice that had disappeared long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, should I probe a bit when that kid Emperor Wu comes next time? No, no good, I'm playing dead now, I can't expose myself."</p><p></p><p>"Right, I can't expose myself. There are too many liars out there, all liars who tricked me to come here and trapped me here."</p><p></p><p>"I can't be fooled again, I can't be curious again, I must not be deceived, I won't trust anyone, including Tai Cang!" Yes, I don't even trust Tai Cang, he actually tricked me, locked me up here, and went off to die himself!"</p><p></p><p>The muttering voice grew angrier as it spoke, but there was also a hint of sadness in it.</p><p></p><p>"How long has it been? I can't remember anymore. Anyway, it's been a very, very long time. I've slept and slept, but Tai Cang still hasn't come back. He really is dead."</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, even he is dead, this is too terrible. Can this world continue to exist? Will it fall? What should I do if someone discovers me?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it, I'll just sleep. Let's pretend nothing happened."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's it. Sleep and pretend nothing happened. Wuwu... Tai Cang must have died miserably. Who told him to lock me up here? If I had helped him, even if he died, he should have been able to leave at least a bone!"</p><p></p><p>In the small stone house, the muttering voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep, sleep, everything will be fine after a sleep. I can't be curious. That kid Emperor Wu is definitely trying to arouse my curiosity on purpose. Hmph, I won't fall for it!"</p><p></p><p>The voice gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned to the Great Wilderness, walking among it, watching the young people working hard to refine their skin, bones, and organs, striving to practice martial arts. It was a thriving scene.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. In a hundred years, a thousand years, the strength of the Great Wilderness martial arts world will surge."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't disturb anyone, stepping on the clouds, he made his way to the frontier.</p><p></p><p>"The frontier, let it remain like this. The lack of world spiritual mechanism isn't necessarily a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>He arrived outside the Wu Kingdom's palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky. With his current strength and the Eye of Heaven's Way, he immediately discovered some special features.</p><p></p><p>"A seal? It doesn't seem like it. It's more like using the world itself to restrain a being. It's somewhat special."</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his insight into Tai Cang's world, possession of the Eye of Heaven's Way, and strength reaching the World Realm, he probably wouldn't have been able to discover the anomaly here.</p><p></p><p>"Even a supreme being who has transcended the world couldn't detect it."</p><p></p><p>It was too well-hidden!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this kind of technique wasn't something an ordinary powerful being could achieve.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Tai Cang's World!</p><p></p><p>This was the work of the Lord of Tai Cang's World. Only the Lord of Tai Cang could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>"What powerful being is trapped here? One that even the Lord of Tai Cang's World couldn't deal with?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was astonished.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from how secretly it was arranged, it seemed as if there was fear of someone discovering and rescuing the person trapped here.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to where the small stone house was located.</p><p></p><p>As if penetrating all obstacles, he vaguely seemed to see, beneath the small stone house, at an unknown depth of many miles, a faint purple light shimmering.</p><p></p><p>"This stone house..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. The stone house was ordinary, yet not ordinary. It was related to the entire arrangement and was also part of hiding the trapped being.</p><p></p><p>"Without entering the stone house, it's probably impossible to see through it completely."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He only saw a faint purple light, but couldn't see clearly what was within the purple light.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even if the other party is restrained, no matter how strong they are, they can't exert their power. There's no need to worry about danger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stepped towards the palace.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura emerged at this moment, making him appear profound and unfathomable, enough to intimidate the trapped person.</p><p></p><p>Holding a jade ruyi scepter in his hand, walking with a carefree stride, he fully displayed the demeanor of a great master.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the palace door and entered.</p><p></p><p>The palace door closed.</p><p></p><p>Calm and carefree, he entered the small stone house. The empty small stone house looked ordinary, with no unusual features.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out a chair and sat down leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He brewed a pot of spirit tea and poured two cups.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, come up and have a cup of tea."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled amiably.</p><p></p><p>Since he was playing the role of a supreme master, he naturally had to maintain the image of one. No matter how strong the other party was, they would still appear insignificant before him! The other party couldn't see through his strength and would only feel that he was profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>That being the case, calling the other party "little friend" was quite reasonable, right? Li Xuan smiled on his face, like a kind senior, "Little friend, stop pretending. I've seen you. Come have a cup of tea and let's chat, just consider it casual conversation."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

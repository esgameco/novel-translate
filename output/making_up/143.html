        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cheerfully found an empty room and went in to start refining his true qi.</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu was puzzled, realizing that he had come to freeload on the accommodation.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong should be on his way to the Seven Star Academy now, right? The entire Seven Star City is now hotly discussing Shixiong's formidable and monstrous abilities, and the Seven Star Academy is in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if Shixiong can withstand this reputation."</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu sighed inwardly. </p><p></p><p>This friend of Shixiong's was far too powerful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the manor of the Duke, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan hurried straight to the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The legend of the young man who had slain a Half-Step Grand Master right in front of a Grand Master, and had even defied the Grand Master of Wushuang, yet left unharmed, was still circulating around Qianxing Lake.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, the peerless genius of Jueming Peak! He truly lived up to his reputation.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that Xie Lingfeng had some entangled love affair with the mysterious beauty of the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>That legendary beauty was said to have been deeply captivated by Xie Lingfeng's peerless elegance, falling deeply in love with him, unable to extricate herself.</p><p></p><p>And the rumors just kept getting more and more exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I think you shouldn't use your real name, I'm afraid it might be dangerous!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng: ...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had built up too much of a reputation, killing someone in front of a Grand Master, and even being rumored to have an indescribable obsession with the beauty of the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>If he was mistaken for an impersonator, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"You make a good point!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The two hurried towards the Wushuang Pavilion, wanting to find out about Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xie Yan, I have come to inquire about the whereabouts of my brother Xie Lingfeng."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng asked the manager of the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan: ...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice came down from the top floor of the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Could you be the friend that Young Master Xie spoke of? Please come up for a chat."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng perked up, could this be the peerless beauty rumored to be obsessed with his brother?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng flew up towards the top floor of the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan followed closely behind, but was pressed down by a force.</p><p></p><p>"Outsiders are not allowed up!"</p><p></p><p>A cold female voice came from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan: ...</p><p></p><p>He could only wait in frustration below.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stepped into the courtyard and saw a woman in white robes. Suddenly, his expression changed, and his hand involuntarily gripped the hilt of his sword.</p><p></p><p>His aura swirled around him, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white turned around, her bright eyes seemingly able to arouse one's primal desires.</p><p></p><p>Even without seeing her features, she gave off an aura of unparalleled beauty - her white robes, her shining eyes like stars. She stood there so gracefully in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, in that instant, Xie Lingfeng was inexplicably agitated! His heart seemed about to leap out, his hot blood surging, as if his desires were about to overwhelm his reason, or as if he wanted to prostrate himself as her subject.</p><p></p><p>Desire was burning, but this sudden desire was not directed at the woman in white, but arose without cause.</p><p></p><p>That woman in white robes seemed untouchable, yet the desire he felt was only urging him to find someone downstairs at the Wushuang Pavilion to vent his frustrations.</p><p></p><p>"This is not good!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought with alarm.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? Although he was not as strong as Xu Yan, he was still the peerless genius of Jueming Peak in a thousand years, his natural talents not low, and his comprehension of the sword dao extremely profound.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xie Lingfeng circulated his true qi, constantly soothing his agitated heart, drawing his sword halfway, the sword light swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu once said, with no woman in one's heart, the sword dao becomes divine. I finally understand a bit of this profound realm, but it is so difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps if I break through this barrier, and enter this profound realm, my sword heart will truly become clear!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white withdrew her gaze, lightly chuckling, "No wonder you are a friend of Young Master Xie, you are indeed extraordinary. Among the inner disciples, those who can match you can be counted on one hand."</p><p></p><p>"You flatter me," </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sheathed his sword and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"As for where Young Master Xie has gone, I do not know. You may leave."</p><p></p><p>The woman in white waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>"I take my leave then."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He was deeply alarmed, "This woman, though only at the initial Sect Master realm, her mysterious seductive technique is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"If we were to truly fight, and I am unable to calm my agitated heart, I may not be able to defeat her!"</p><p></p><p>The rumored Wushuang Flower Courtesan of the Wushuang Pavilion was actually this powerful.</p><p></p><p>"This Wushuang Flower Courtesan is not a true courtesan, she is here in the Wushuang Pavilion to cultivate that mysterious technique."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>"How did Brother Xie deal with her before?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had come to the Wushuang Pavilion to temper his heart, so he must have encountered this mysterious seductive technique. Just how did he deal with it?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng suspected that the woman in white had not used her full strength against him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, how did it go?" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan came up to him curiously.</p><p></p><p>"No news, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng dared not linger, hastily leaving.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor of the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Grand Master of Wushuang appeared, looking at the woman in white robes and smiling, "Little girl, you've taken a liking to him, haven't you? As soon as you heard he was a friend, you called him up!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't talk nonsense, I was just curious, how powerful is the friend he spoke of."</p><p></p><p>The woman in white robes rolled her eyes at her master.</p><p></p><p>"To be a friend of Young Master Xie, he must truly be extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>She sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, where shall we go next?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving Qianxing Lake, Hu Shan asked.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng pondered for a moment and said, "Let's keep an eye out for any news of my name at Jueming Peak."</p><p></p><p>As the top inner sect force, Jueming Peak naturally had its own information network to obtain news from the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a black shadow flashed in the sky, descending a gray bird the size of a fist, with a message tube tied to its leg.</p><p></p><p>"A messenger falcon, something must have happened?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was startled upon seeing it.</p><p></p><p>Messenger falcons were a common communication method used by the major forces in the inner realm. They were specially trained birds that were fast, stealthy, and could fly high day and night to deliver messages.</p><p></p><p>The major forces would set up a vast communication network of messenger falcon stations within their territories, and only a few powers in the inner realm were capable of organizing such a large-scale communication system.</p><p></p><p>Jueming Peak was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was an emergency or special circumstance, they would not use the messenger falcons, as each use consumed a lot of resources, requiring spirit medicines to sustain the falcons' communication.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng opened the message tube on the falcon's leg and took out the letter inside.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After going to the Seven Star Academy, he had actually broken through the nine layers of the Martial Arts Platform... </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's scalp tingled.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was shocked: "Has Xu Yan already defeated a Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>"No, Xu brother broke the rules and defeated ten peak Sect Masters on the ninth layer, and then used my name to enter the Seven Star Academy's Treasure Vault."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng handed the letter to Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>After reading it, Hu Shan joyfully said: "Young master, this is great news! Your reputation has shaken the Seven Star Academy, and it will also shake the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with a wretched expression: "What strength does Xu brother have, and what strength do I have? Do you think I can bear this reputation?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought about it and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Seven Star Academy!" Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He must clarify that he is the real Xie Lingfeng, otherwise if this continues, one day he will have to change his name - such a reputation, he cannot bear it.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng set out for the Seven Star Academy. In the Wushuang Pavilion, the woman in plain clothes also took a letter from a flying falcon's leg and became increasingly shocked as she read it.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xie, there is no one else like you in the world!" She sincerely exclaimed, looking at her master: "Master, I want to go to the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of Wushuang smiled and said: "See, you're not just thinking about spring, are you?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes rolled her eyes, not wanting to bother with her master, and looked at the other side, saying, "Aunt Yao, come with me."</p><p></p><p>An old woman appeared in the courtyard and said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>She was also a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days had passed, but the turmoil caused by Xu Yan at the Seven Star Academy had not subsided, and instead became a hot topic of discussion among the academy's disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, Young Master Xie has come to the Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>In a secluded courtyard within the academy, Cui'er ran over excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's eyes lit up as she asked, "Cui'er, where is Young Master Xie?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but everyone in the academy is discussing Young Master Xie. He broke through the nine layers of the Martial Arts Platform and defeated ten grand tutors single-handedly."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er's eyes were full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, quickly have someone find where Young Master Xie is, I want to go see him!" Du Yuying's jade face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss, I'll spend some extra money to have someone investigate."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was also eager.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying instructed.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er hurried away.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Sovereign Cliff's side hall, Xu Yan's finger qi had divided into ten strands, each extremely condensed, not in a diffused state.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded."</p><p></p><p>Contemplating the qi on his fingers, the true qi then surged out from his body, continuously dividing - one strand became two, two became four... As it divided, the true qi became finer and more condensed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there were countless fine true qi needles surrounding Xu Yan, making him look like a human porcupine.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the profundity of true qi. By dividing my true qi, I'm actually enhancing it, raising it to near its limit. Now my true qi's purity has increased by about 30%."</p><p></p><p>This was almost the limit of true qi, and he had grasped the profundity of true qi, also gaining some insights into the Penetrating Mystery Technique.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited. His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the needle-like true qi gathered together and formed a small true qi dragon. This was not the dragon from the Descending Dragon Palm, but one formed by dividing and combining the true qi.</p><p></p><p>"My Descending Dragon Palm's power has also increased."</p><p></p><p>As his control over true qi became stronger, especially being able to divide and combine it, the power and attack methods of the Descending Dragon Palm had also been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to break through to the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmed his mind, his eyes shining with joy.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm, he would no longer fear Grand Masters. Even if he could not defeat peak Grand Masters, they would not be able to harm him.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing a major realm boundary in strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>At the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm, he no longer feared Grand Masters, and once he broke through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm, he could easily defeat ordinary Grand Masters. Even the top peak Grand Masters of the Inner Realm would not be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged, beginning to break through to the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged in, constantly refining into Xiantian true qi.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy of the Inner Realm is too gentle, lacking some fierceness and domineering. Is this the reason for the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, he could allow the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to enter his body, almost able to control the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. He felt a gentle rhythm of the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be what is called the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanism?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan contemplated silently.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the Inner Realm was too gentle. Almost without needing to operate any cultivation method, just with a thought, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would pour into his body, refine into true qi, and enter the sea of qi in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the cultivators of the Inner Realm are also like this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the Borderland or the Inner Realm, he could absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth for cultivation. But after coming to the Inner Realm, the speed of absorbing spiritual energy was almost unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Even without operating any cultivation method, just with a thought, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would actively flow into his body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan guessed that this was the function of the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanism. He was curious whether the cultivators of the Inner Realm also cultivated in this way.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The true qi in his body kept increasing, and the sea of qi in his dantian was continuously expanding, becoming as vast as a great ocean.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm encountered no obstacles, and Xu Yan directly broke through in one breath.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Perfection of the Xiantian Realm. With my current strength, even Grand Master Fu Yuntian would not be able to pose a threat to me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan secretly evaluated, "Fu Yuntian is the Grand Tutor of the Seven Star Academy, a Great Perfection Grand Master, one level higher than me. And he is among the top experts at the Great Perfection Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>"He has surely mastered many secret martial arts of the Seven Star Academy, and must have cultivated a secret technique that can instantly increase his strength by sacrificing himself.</p><p></p><p>"So it won't be easy for me to defeat him. I'll have to use my Eighteen Golden Dragons to bombard him with dozens of strikes to probably be able to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made a rough judgment.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's first reaction was to absorb that extraordinary aura, gathering it in his palm to examine.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other powerful cultivators from the Spirit Realm also carefully entered, their eyes full of curiosity - how exactly was this Heavenly Cave formed?</p><p></p><p>"There's some strange aura here," Wu Tiannan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, I feel that if we absorb this aura, it will remain in our bodies and may cause some trouble," Xin Mengrou warned gravely. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt somewhat helpless - his strength was a bit weaker, unable to sense the conditions beyond heaven and earth. After all, he had not truly transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this aura?"</p><p></p><p>More and more of the extraordinary aura gathered on his palm, enveloping his entire hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned, his intuition telling him this aura was not simple. After all, it could not be refined, giving a sense of eternal existence.</p><p></p><p>"Should I try it?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind stirred as he looked at the Golden Book of the Dao on his spirit platform. </p><p></p><p>He had obtained information about the Taicang Book Pattern using the Golden Book of the Dao. Could he also obtain information about this extraordinary aura?</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Book of the Dao was on the spirit platform. He would need to absorb a strand of the aura into his spirit platform and inject it into the Golden Book of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't guarantee what would happen if this strand of aura entered his spirit platform.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Li Xuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan was also sensing this extraordinary aura.</p><p></p><p>"It's just one strand, it shouldn't cause any major problems."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan finally gritted his teeth and decided to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>This extraordinary aura could not be refined, but a mere strand shouldn't cause any big issues. Moreover, with his many divine abilities, he would surely have a way to expel it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan carefully absorbed a strand of the aura and drew it into his spirit platform.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any accidents, his primordial spirit had already retreated to a corner of the spirit platform, with all defensive measures deployed. The Golden Book of the Dao was placed in front of his primordial spirit as a shield.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the aura entered the spirit platform, Li Xuan immediately saw the platform tremble slightly. There was a sense of chaos, as if affected by the aura, with a vague feeling of eternal immortality.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan did not rejoice at this. Instead, his heart tightened, because he discovered his spirit platform had become heavy, as if a mountain was pressing down on it.</p><p></p><p>There was even a feeling that, over time, the spirit platform would be unable to withstand it and collapse.</p><p></p><p>"For Spirit Realm cultivators, if their souls are contaminated by this aura, it will be like a great mountain pressing down. Their souls may even become muddled and their consciousness scattered because of it."</p><p></p><p>Even with his strong spirit platform and powerful primordial spirit, he felt a sense of heaviness. How much worse would it be for the souls of Spirit Realm cultivators?</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao opened, and Li Xuan injected that strand of aura into it.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fixed intently on the Golden Book of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Golden light surged forth, and that strand of aura was absorbed by the Golden Book of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Information appeared on the pages of the Golden Book of the Dao: "Unchanging Qi, immortal and immutable, chaotic and primordial. Only the great Dao and the initial opening of heaven and earth can transform it... If it enters a cultivator's soul, it will scatter consciousness, muddle the mind, and return one to an undeveloped, unenlightened state..."</p><p></p><p>Unchanging Qi!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked as he read. This Unchanging Qi was extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Only the great Dao and the initial opening of heaven and earth could transform it, turning it into the primordial essence of heaven and earth. Things like spiritual qi were all derived from this.</p><p></p><p>Once it entered a cultivator's soul, it would scatter their consciousness and return them to an undeveloped, unenlightened state.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the aura from beyond heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan inwardly marveled.</p><p></p><p>If Unchanging Qi could be used for cultivation, it would undoubtedly be a supreme treasure that could greatly enhance a cultivator's strength.</p><p></p><p>However, due to its unchanging nature, cultivators were unable to use it for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that it can't be utilized. The Taicang martial arts may not work, but that doesn't mean my martial arts won't. Even if it doesn't work now, I can come up with a method.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Unchanging Qi isn't completely unusable at this stage. As long as it's not taken into the spirit platform and primordial spirit, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the information provided by the Golden Book of the Dao, Li Xuan's thoughts began to race.</p><p></p><p>Unchanging Qi couldn't be used to cultivate and increase one's realm, but it could be used to cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Not just divine abilities, but things like restrictions could also make use of it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan divided the Unchanging Qi in his hand into fine strands. With a movement of his fingers, he used the Unchanging Qi to form a restriction, which fell to the bottom of the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>This was an experiment, applying Unchanging Qi to restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As the Unchanging Qi fell to the bottom of the Heavenly Cave in the form of a restriction, that area at the bottom was instantly sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, my idea wasn't wrong."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted. Just because the Taicang martial arts couldn't do it, didn't mean his martial arts couldn't.</p><p></p><p>The power of divine elements was inherently more mystical than the power of Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The seal drawn with Unchanging Qi was stronger and harder to break by force, which was related to the properties of Unchanging Qi.</p><p></p><p>To break this seal, one must understand the key to it. Otherwise, trying to break it by force would require strength far surpassing the sealer.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Unchanging Qi permeating the Heavenly Cave. This Unchanging Qi was all surging up from the bottom of the cave, but it wasn't continuously emerging. Once the Unchanging Qi reached a certain amount, it would maintain a balance and stop emerging.</p><p></p><p>Only when the Unchanging Qi in the Heavenly Cave was consumed would more emerge to replenish it, forming a balanced state.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Unchanging Qi would not surge out beyond the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Xu Yan. His senior disciple was pondering the Unchanging Qi, while Wu Tiannan and the others were curiously exploring the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Unchanging Qi, once it enters the soul, will scatter consciousness and return one to an undeveloped, unenlightened state..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan warned.</p><p></p><p>"Unchanging Qi?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled and asked curiously, "Master, I feel the Unchanging Qi is somewhat special. It seems impossible to refine, yet extraordinarily remarkable..."</p><p></p><p>The others were all shocked and hurriedly restrained their minds, afraid of absorbing the Unchanging Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Unchanging Qi has many uses. Although it can't be refined like spiritual qi to increase cultivation realms, it can be used to cultivate divine abilities, set up restrictions, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>He didn't continue explaining the rest, leaving it for his disciples to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"It has such benefits?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was delighted and began to fiddle with various jars, preparing to collect Unchanging Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Can it be used for alchemy?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"It can, and it can't."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly, not giving a definitive answer.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of his alchemical martial arts divine ability, the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace, which could refine all the myriad Daos of heaven and earth. He wondered if it could refine Unchanging Qi?</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, if it could refine even the Dao, why not Unchanging Qi? Unchanging Qi would only transform with the great Dao or the initial opening of heaven and earth, while the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace could refine all the myriad Daos of heaven and earth. Theoretically, it should also be able to refine Unchanging Qi.</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible, but with my current strength, using the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace is not enough to refine Unchanging Qi."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a judgment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were collecting Unchanging Qi, preparing to cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other Spirit Realm cultivators felt helpless about this. They couldn't make use of it at all, and didn't even know what divine abilities were.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm martial arts had never had any concept of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was walking in the Heavenly Cave when suddenly, his foot kicked something.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave appeared to be a cavern, but in reality it was a gray-black expanse with no plants or vegetation. The cave walls seemed smooth, as if untouched by even a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>Kicking something at this moment made Li Xuan curious. </p><p></p><p>Looking down, he saw a fist-sized, grayish-black stone.</p><p></p><p>"This stone seems special," Li Xuan thought.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the stone fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Though only fist-sized, it was as heavy as a great mountain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this stone was similar to Immutable Qi, giving a sense of being immutable and imperishable.</p><p></p><p>"An Immutable Stone?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently put the stone away.</p><p></p><p>He planned to try refining it later with the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace, to see if he could melt down this stone.</p><p></p><p>"At my current level, I likely can't refine an Immutable Stone. When I'm able to refine one, it will mean I can also refine Immutable Qi," Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Cave, besides this one Immutable Stone and the Immutable Qi, there were no other special objects.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan and the others continued collecting Immutable Qi, it began to flow into the bottom of the cave as well.</p><p></p><p>"How is this Heavenly Cave relic different from the one the top talents will visit?" Wu Tiannan curiously asked Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>"That Heavenly Cave relic is extremely ancient. No one knows what era it's from anymore. That cave relic is much larger than this one."</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm has divine objects. Besides a few places in the Azure Sea, only the Heavenly Cave relics in the Eighteen Provinces contain divine objects."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the divine objects in the Heavenly Cave relics are quite special. The materials needed to forge divine weapons all come from excavating the Heavenly Cave relics."</p><p></p><p>"However, after countless explorations, the Heavenly Cave relics likely don't have many opportunities left now," Xin Mengrou explained.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave relics of the Spirit Realm were secrets of the transcendent spirit sects. Even though entry was limited each time, after many explorations, there were likely no more opportunities left in the cave relics now.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was collecting Immutable Qi, spoke up: "It would be good to go see what differences there are between that relic and this Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also curious about how the Heavenly Cave relic of the Spirit Realm differed from this Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Cave had produced the powerful being Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>Had similar powerful beings also appeared in that relic in the past, only to be suppressed?</p><p></p><p>Is that why it became a relic?</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Cave still has the possibility of being infiltrated. It must be sealed off," Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, Meiwu was an enemy from outside this world who had infiltrated through the Heavenly Cave. Even though Meiwu was dead, there could be other beings from outside this world infiltrating the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Spirit Realm's strength was relatively weak - it absolutely could not deal with enemies like Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>So as Li Xuan walked along the bottom of the Heavenly Cave, he manipulated the Immutable Qi to form restrictive patterns, sealing off the bottom of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan and the others had collected enough Immutable Qi and stopped gathering more.</p><p></p><p>"What is Master doing?" Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Sealing the Heavenly Cave!" Fang Hao said, staring intently.</p><p></p><p>"Master is using the Immutable Qi to draw restrictive patterns to seal off the bottom of the Heavenly Cave!"</p><p></p><p>"So Immutable Qi can be used like this," Fang Hao's mind raced with possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the senior's actions, otherwise the Spirit Realm would be in danger," Wu Tiannan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Is the senior sealing the bottom of the Heavenly Cave to prevent beings like Meiwu from appearing?"</p><p></p><p>"That should be it."</p><p></p><p>After sealing the bottom of the Heavenly Cave, apart from Immutable Qi being able to flow in, any other forces would be blocked and sealed out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held a jade ruyi scepter behind his back with one hand as he strode out of the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing of value left in the cave.</p><p></p><p>The crisis of the Ice Province Heavenly Cave was now resolved.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan sat leisurely in a chair, his mind pondering future martial paths and some speculations about the world beyond.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his fellow disciples also returned to Changqing Pavilion one after another.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others also emerged from the Heavenly Cave. Xin Mengrou, the Great Zhou Emperor and others dispatched elders to Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province to deal with the aftermath of this calamity.</p><p></p><p>"The Genius Competition has concluded. Let's set out for the Heavenly Cave relic now," Fu Tianhai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I agree!" Thundercloud Manor Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>The others had no objections, including the Thousand Martial Palace Lord.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, powerful figures like the Thousand Martial Palace Lord had become more low-key, no longer daring to mention conflicts with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They even feared being remembered by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They privately sought out Fang Hao to negotiate peace.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful expert in the Spirit Realm, and Fang Hao the Young Alliance Leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance being that expert's disciple, changes to the Spirit Realm's power structure were now a certainty.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to target them would displease the expert and lead to the Thousand Martial Palace's destruction.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a Heavenly Venerate was killed by Meiwu, and Meiwu at an even stronger level was effortlessly destroyed by the expert.</p><p></p><p>The gap was simply too vast.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath in Cloud Province, Ice Province and Great Marsh Province would naturally be handled by the various spirit sects, with the Myriad Worlds Alliance also involved.</p><p></p><p>As the top four geniuses on the Genius Ranking, Xu Yan and his three fellow disciples would of course enter the Heavenly Cave relic. All four were very curious about the Spirit Realm's Heavenly Cave relic.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see how it differed from the Ice Province Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship departed from Ice Province, heading towards the Heavenly Cave relic under Fu Tianhai's lead.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm's Heavenly Cave relic was in Rainbow Province, at the foot of a seaside cliff tens of thousands of miles from the site of the Genius Competition.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Cave relic can only be entered periodically. Although some time remains before it can be entered, we can open it early now," Fu Tianhai explained as they arrived at the cave's location. The cave was not visible at the base of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heavenly Cave relic?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw the cave's location at a glance. This Heavenly Cave relic had been locked by gathering the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to fix its entrance, then sealed with the power of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, the spiritual energy would disperse slightly and the power of the laws would relax, revealing the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>This was an artificial seal.</p><p></p><p>Achieving this was not something an ordinary Heavenly Venerate could do.</p><p></p><p>"A technique set up by a cultivator above the Heavenly Venerate level," Li Xuan understood.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, the cave entrance appeared.</p><p></p><p>This was a Heavenly Cave over ten times larger than the one in Ice Province, and this was just the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship flew directly into the Heavenly Cave relic. Fu Tianhai, the Great Zhou Emperor and the others could only hurriedly follow. As for the rule that only geniuses could enter, they pretended it didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>After all, they weren't the ones breaking the rules.</p><p></p><p>Besides, so-called rules didn't apply to experts. The expert's rules were the true rules.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

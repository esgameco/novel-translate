        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the first moment, Xu Yan absorbed that extraordinary aura, circulating it in his palm to examine it.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and other powerful experts from the Spiritual Realm also entered cautiously, their eyes filled with curiosity, wondering how this Sky Pit was formed.</p><p></p><p>"There is some strange aura here," Wu Tiannan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, I feel that if we absorb these auras, they will linger in our bodies and may cause some trouble," Xin Mengrou warned solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a bit helpless, as his strength was a bit weaker and he could not sense the situation outside the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not truly transcended the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of aura is this?" </p><p></p><p>The extraordinary aura gathered on his palm became increasingly dense, enveloping the entire palm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan furrowed his brows, his intuition telling him that this aura was not simple, as he could not refine it, feeling a sense of eternal existence.</p><p></p><p>"Should I give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was moved, looking at the Dao Golden Book on the spiritual platform. He had obtained the information of the Taicangshu pattern from the Dao Golden Book, so perhaps he could also acquire the information of this extraordinary aura?</p><p></p><p>However, the Dao Golden Book was on the spiritual platform, so he needed to absorb a wisp of aura and infuse it into the Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>What would happen if this wisp of aura entered the spiritual platform, he dared not guarantee.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Li Xuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xu Yan was also sensing these extraordinary auras.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a wisp, it won't cause any major problems," Li Xuan finally gritted his teeth and decided to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>This extraordinary aura could not be refined, but a mere wisp would not cause a big issue. Moreover, he possessed many divine abilities, so he could ultimately expel it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan carefully absorbed a wisp of the aura and infused it into the spiritual platform.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any accidents, his divine sense had already retreated to a corner of the spiritual platform, with his divine sense defense measures fully deployed, and the Dao Golden Book shielding his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>As the aura entered the spiritual platform, Li Xuan immediately saw the platform tremble slightly, as if it was affected by a hazy feeling, faintly exuding an eternal and indestructible aura.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan did not feel joy, but rather a sense of tension, for he discovered that the spiritual platform had become heavy, as if a mountain was pressing down on it. There was also a feeling that the spiritual platform would eventually collapse if this continued.</p><p></p><p>"This aura is like a great mountain pressing down on the spiritual realm cultivators' divine spirits. Their consciousness will become muddled and scattered if their divine spirits are contaminated by it."</p><p></p><p>Even with the strength of his spiritual platform and divine sense, he felt a heavy burden. As for the spiritual realm cultivators, their divine spirits would be crushed.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book opened, and Li Xuan infused that wisp of aura into it.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on the Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Golden light surged forth, and the Dao Golden Book absorbed that wisp of aura.</p><p></p><p>Information appeared on the pages of the Dao Golden Book: "The Unrefined Qi, indestructible and eternal, chaotic and obscure, can only be transformed at the time of the initial opening of the Dao and the heavens and earth...Upon entering the divine spirits of martial artists, it will cause their consciousness to scatter, returning them to an uncivilized, unintelligent state."</p><p></p><p>The Unrefined Qi!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly shocked by what he saw. This Unrefined Qi was extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Only at the initial opening of the Dao and the heavens and earth could it be transformed, becoming the source of the heavens and earth, such as spiritual energy and the like, all derived from it.</p><p></p><p>Once it entered the divine spirits of martial artists, it would cause their consciousness to scatter, returning them to an uncivilized, unintelligent state.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an aura from beyond the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clicked his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The Unrefined Qi, if it could be cultivated, would undoubtedly be a priceless treasure, greatly enhancing the martial artists' strength.</p><p></p><p>However, due to its unrefined nature, martial artists could not cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't mean I can't utilize it. The Taicangshu Dao may not work, but my Dao can certainly find a way.</p><p></p><p>"And for now, as long as I don't infuse it into the spiritual platform and divine sense, I can still make use of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the information provided by the Dao Golden Book, his mind becoming active.</p><p></p><p>The Unrefined Qi could not be used to cultivate and improve one's cultivation, but it could be used to cultivate divine abilities and formations.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan divided the Unrefined Qi in his hand into fine strands, and with a flick of his fingers, he used the Unrefined Qi to form a formation, which descended into the bottom of the Sky Pit.</p><p></p><p>This was an experiment to apply the Unrefined Qi to formations.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As the Unrefined Qi descended into the bottom of the Sky Pit in the form of a formation, that area seemed to be instantly sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"As I thought, my idea was correct."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly delighted. What the Taicangshu Dao could not do did not mean his Dao could not do it.</p><p></p><p>The divine elemental power was more wondrous than the Taicangshu Dao.</p><p></p><p>The formation created with the Unrefined Qi was more powerful and harder to forcefully break through. This was related to the characteristics of the Unrefined Qi.</p><p></p><p>To break this seal, one would need to understand the key to it, otherwise, they would need to possess strength far surpassing the formation creator to forcefully break it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Unrefined Qi permeating the Sky Pit. These Unrefined Qi were gushing up from the bottom of the Sky Pit, but they did not continuously flow out. Once the Unrefined Qi reached a certain amount, it would maintain a balance and not continue to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Unrefined Qi in the Sky Pit was consumed, it would continue to gush out to replenish the balance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Unrefined Qi would not flow out of the Sky Pit.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Xu Yan, his senior disciple was pondering the Unrefined Qi, and Wu Tiannan and the others were also curiously exploring the Sky Pit.</p><p></p><p>"The Unrefined Qi, once it enters the divine spirit, will cause the consciousness to scatter, returning to an uncivilized, unintelligent state..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded them.</p><p></p><p>"Unrefined Qi?" Xu Yan was startled, and curiously asked, "Master, I feel the Unrefined Qi seems to be quite special, as if it cannot be refined, yet it is also extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>The others were also alarmed, hastily calming their minds, fearing they might have absorbed the Unrefined Qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Unrefined Qi has many uses. Although it cannot be refined like spiritual energy to improve one's cultivation, it can be used to cultivate divine abilities and set up formations, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan briefly introduced it.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, he did not continue to explain, leaving it for his disciples to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"It has such benefits?" Fang Hao was delighted, and began to make various jars, preparing to collect the Unrefined Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Can it be used to refine elixirs?" Su Ling's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"It can, and it can't," Li Xuan said calmly, not giving a definitive answer.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of his Dao of Elixir Refinement divine ability, the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace, which could refine the myriad ways of heaven and earth. He wondered if it could also refine the Unrefined Qi?</p><p></p><p>In theory, if it could refine the Dao, it should be able to refine the Unrefined Qi as well. The Unrefined Qi could only be transformed at the initial opening of the Dao or the heavens and earth, and the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace could refine the myriad ways of heaven and earth, so it should theoretically be able to refine the Unrefined Qi.</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible, but with my current strength, I cannot yet use the Myriad Dao Divine Furnace to refine the Unrefined Qi," Li Xuan judged.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were collecting the Unrefined Qi, preparing to cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other spiritual realm experts were helpless, as they could not utilize it at all, not even knowing what divine abilities were.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm Dao had never mentioned divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanxing was walking in the Heavenly Cave when suddenly he kicked something on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave seemed to be a cave, but it was actually a gray-black place without any plants or the like. The walls of the Heavenly Cave appeared smooth, as if untouched by dust.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, kicking something piqued Li Xuanxing's curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He looked down and saw a fist-sized, gray-black stone.</p><p></p><p>"This stone is somewhat special," Li Xuanxing said, as he waved his hand to bring the stone into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Although it was fist-sized, its weight was no less than a huge mountain. Moreover, this stone had a quality of being indestructible, giving a sense of being imperishable.</p><p></p><p>"An indestructible stone?" Li Xuanxing muttered as he put the stone away, intending to try melting it in the Myriad Dao Furnace after returning.</p><p></p><p>"With my current realm, I probably can't melt the indestructible stone. When I can melt the indestructible stone, it will mean I can also melt the indestructible qi," Li Xuanxing thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this indestructible stone and the indestructible qi, there were no other special objects in the Heavenly Cave. As Xu Yan and the others continued to collect the indestructible qi, the bottom of the Heavenly Cave also began to be filled with it.</p><p></p><p>"What is the difference between the Heavenly Cave relic where the Genius Ranking spots went and this place?" Wu Tiannan asked Xin Mengrou curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou explained that the Heavenly Cave relic was much older, and it contained rare divine objects that were needed to forge divine weapons. However, after countless explorations, there was likely no more opportunity left in the relic.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Xuanxing decided to seal the bottom of this Heavenly Cave with the indestructible qi, fearing that enemies like Mei Wu could infiltrate the Spiritual Realm through it.</p><p></p><p>After sealing the Heavenly Cave, Li Xuanxing returned to the Long Qing Pavilion, while Xu Yan and the others prepared to set out for the Heavenly Cave relic, curious about the differences between the two places.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 49: The Mighty Dragon Displays Its Prowess, One Man Sweeps Away Countless Troops</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the destroyed shops and felt a pang of heartache. Many of them were his family's shops!</p><p></p><p>"I acted rashly! I shouldn't have fought in the city. My family has so many shops here, and destroying even one results in a significant loss.</p><p></p><p>"And harming innocent people is even worse.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that the martial way is not about killing. Since I have the ability to control myself, I shouldn't have caused unnecessary casualties!"</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more he felt that he had acted impulsively just now. He should have gone outside the city to fight.</p><p></p><p>As for capturing Jiang Pingshan, Xu Yan had no such intention. He was here to display his strength and give the old Emperor Qi a shock.</p><p></p><p>To single-handedly defeat the army he considered the pillar of the nation, the Shenwei Army, would be a big enough shock, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>From the rear of the Shenwei Army, a somewhat trembling voice was heard: "Good! We'll fight outside the city!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan's voice was trembling. He could not believe this terrifying power that had single-handedly crushed the charge of the Shenwei Army.</p><p></p><p>And this person was once a potential son-in-law of his!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a scene from the past flashed through his mind - Xu Yan's forceful words: "...one day, you will regret it deeply, you will not be able to reach up to him!"</p><p></p><p>Now, it seems that his daughter might truly not be able to reach up to this man.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Pingshan did not believe that Xu Yan could be a match for the Shenwei Army.</p><p></p><p>In the streets of the city, the Shenwei Army could not fully display their abilities. But outside the city, that would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>That was the true battlefield of the Shenwei Army.</p><p></p><p>This time, to completely destroy the Tianmu Sect and help the Crown Prince establish his prestige, Emperor Qi had dispatched ten thousand Shenwei soldiers to be stationed and commanded here!</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand Shenwei soldiers, how could a mere mortal flesh and blood be their match?</p><p></p><p>"Retreat, gather outside the city!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan calmed his trembling heart and issued the order.</p><p></p><p>The Shenwei Army began to withdraw. Although facing an opponent with inhuman strength like Xu Yan, the Shenwei soldiers still showed no sign of retreat.</p><p></p><p>As the Shenwei Army withdrew from the prefecture city, the civilians who had been confined to their homes also began to emerge, informing each other with expressions of shock on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The son of the wealthy family was going to challenge the Shenwei Army single-handedly?</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking was the fact that the prominent figures within the prefecture city found it hard to believe that Xu Junhe's son had cultivated such overwhelmingly powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Where did he find such a reclusive master?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, to the city wall!"</p><p>"Let's go, this battle will decide the fate of East River Prefecture and even the entire Qi Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the prefecture city's prominent figures, under the protection of their guards and servants, rushed to the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, to the city wall!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe also spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Madam, please!"</p><p></p><p>A guard brought a horse-drawn carriage over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe held his wife's hand and entered the carriage, with the guards and servants surrounding the carriage as they headed towards the city gate.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu, does your son have a chance?" </p><p></p><p>A voice came, and Xu Junhe looked up from the carriage window to see Kou Ruozhi and a group of Tianmu Sect elites following along to observe the battle from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er does not fight a battle he is not confident of winning," Xu Junhe replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I have full faith in the might of the Heavenly Honored Saint," Kou Ruozhi laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu, about our cooperation..."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"We'll discuss that after the battle," Xu Junhe responded evasively.</p><p></p><p>The group soon arrived at the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, the Shenwei Army was fully equipped, the soldiers clad in heavy armor, wielding long spears, with long sabers hanging at their waists, even their horses were armored.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Shenwei Army, such a mighty army, how can one man be their match?" </p><p></p><p>The many prominent figures on the city wall, as well as the surging crowd of civilians, were all awestruck by the imposing might of the Shenwei Army.</p><p></p><p>Truly the pillar army of the Qi Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>"My dear, will Yan'er be alright?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's wife couldn't help but worry as she looked at the formidable Shenwei Army outside the city.</p><p></p><p>"If Yan'er dares to fight, he must be confident. My dear, please rest assured!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was also anxious inside, but he tried to remain calm as he comforted his wife.</p><p></p><p>The group of Xu family guards, including Physician Pan, were also present.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the couple of Xu Junhe, they were guarding against possible attacks.</p><p></p><p>While Kou Ruozhi and others were in an even more outer circle, vigilantly watching the surroundings, guarding against anyone attacking the Xu couple.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kou Ruozhi actually hoped that someone would attack the Xu couple, so that the Heavenly Mother Sect would have the opportunity to come to their rescue.</p><p></p><p>To make Xu Yan owe them a favor.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Mother Sect staging this themselves, Kou Ruozhi and the others did not have the courage to do so. Once exposed, they would have to bear the wrath of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother Sect could not withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The important figures in the prefecture city were all silently observing Xu Junhe, waiting for the outcome of the battle. Once Xu Yan was victorious, they would go to establish a relationship with Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was excited, his eyes filled with a fighting spirit, looking at the surrounding Shenwei Army, his blood was surging, and there was a faint roar of surging waves within him.</p><p></p><p>His whole body was circulating his qi and blood, the Descending Dragon Palm was ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the martial dao, he finally had the chance to unleash himself freely.</p><p></p><p>"Although these soldiers are wearing heavy armor, they cannot withstand the power of my palm. I will hold back a bit, not to kill them all.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a butcher, after all.</p><p></p><p>"And I feel this is an opportunity to refine my control of qi and blood, and to further improve my Descending Dragon Palm at will."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, his eyes widening as he said, "Come, and let you see what a true martial arts expert is!"</p><p></p><p>His voice thundered across the battlefield, reaching the ears of the onlookers outside the city.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan, riding on a horse, took a deep breath and pointed his long spear at the ground.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Shenwei Army charged, the long spears raised, the war horses galloping, like a torrent rushing towards Xu Yan from all directions!</p><p></p><p>The long spears glinted in the sunlight, the rows of spears converging on Xu Yan with no blind spots.</p><p></p><p>This charge, unless Xu Yan took to the air and flew over the army, he must withstand the onslaught of the army.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying charge, how could one person withstand it?</p><p></p><p>How could a mortal body block it?</p><p></p><p>"Hiss! The fool son of the wealthy family, his brain really doesn't work, how can he defend against this?"</p><p></p><p>"He's doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers on the city wall, watching this scene, couldn't help but exclaim, the fool son of the wealthy family, his brain really doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>The important figures in the prefecture city also had the same thought.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength was formidable, possessing superhuman power, but he stubbornly chose to fight the Shenwei Army in the encirclement, with nowhere to escape or hide. How could one person withstand the army's charge?</p><p></p><p>It's really a brain problem!</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a loud roar, pushing out his palms, and two scarlet-red giant dragons thundered forth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xu Yan's palms flashed, and one scarlet-red giant dragon after another kept bursting out, in an instant, the giant dragons were circling and charging in all directions.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan stepped forward, his Descending Dragon Palm power surging and receding, the scarlet-red giant dragons either diving, sweeping horizontally, coiling, or charging straight - palm after palm, the Descending Dragon Palm was becoming more and more proficient.</p><p></p><p>In the surging and receding of the palm power, it was fierce and unmatched, freely controlling the strength and weakness.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the incantation of the Descending Dragon Palm emerged: "The dragon has divine abilities, changing with the situation... So that's how it is, I've gained deeper understanding!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the Descending Dragon Palm reached the initial mastery stage, the dragon-shaped palm power had a faint "living" aura.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>An even thicker giant dragon thundered forth, circling the entire battlefield around Xu Yan, its tail like a long whip, sweeping across the battlefield!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers on the city wall were now completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>They saw Xu Yan unleashing one giant dragon after another, the charging Shenwei Army, both soldiers and horses, were all swept to the ground, the torrential army was collapsing.</p><p></p><p>One after another, they were either knocked down or thrown away.</p><p></p><p>One person sweeping away an entire army!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the common people in the prefecture city had only one thought in their minds:</p><p></p><p>It is we ourselves who have the brain problem!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

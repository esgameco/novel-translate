        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress Witch had the ability to devour souls. She particularly enjoyed consuming the souls of martial artists. Each time she absorbed a soul, she didn't digest it immediately, but rather stored it to savor slowly.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as a soul entered her mouth, she could taste its flavor. This was a unique talent of the Enchantress Witch.</p><p></p><p>For her, the process of absorbing souls was a wonderful enjoyment. She could taste the deliciousness of the souls and experience the pleasure of devouring them.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the souls of several True King Celestial Venerable, although she felt these souls had a slightly spicy taste, it was still another kind of delicious enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>However, when she absorbed Xu Yan's soul, the Enchantress Witch was stunned. Why was this guy's soul so spicy?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan's soul was also too vast. It was like a gust of wind, continuously being absorbed, giving a sense of endlessness.</p><p></p><p>"If this guy's soul is so spicy, his master's soul must be inedible. The taste would definitely be extremely unpleasant!" The Enchantress Witch thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was trying his best to let the Enchantress Witch absorb more of his Xun Wind Sword Intent into her body, which caused the phenomenon of an endless, vast soul being absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"My Xun Wind Sword Intent, fused into the fake soul pill, is something the Enchantress Witch has never encountered before. She absolutely won't be able to detect it," Xu Yan thought secretly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know that due to the Enchantress Witch's special talent for souls, although she hadn't discovered this was a fake soul, she felt this soul was too spicy.</p><p></p><p>The Xun Wind Sword Intent was ultimately a sword intent targeting souls. Even though Xu Yan had made the Xun Wind Sword Intent gentler and fused it into the soul, other martial artists probably wouldn't be able to detect any difference.</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress Witch was different, which is why she felt this soul was somewhat spicy!</p><p></p><p>Of course, as Xu Yan had anticipated, the Enchantress Witch had never encountered this situation before. In her carelessness and underestimation, she didn't think this soul would have any hidden killing intent.</p><p></p><p>She only thought that since Xu Yan was the disciple of a powerful master, it was understandable that his condensed soul was different from ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress Witch continued to absorb Xu Yan's soul. Finally, she felt the soul starting to weaken, about to be completely absorbed. She sighed inwardly that this guy's soul was equivalent to six or seven True King Celestial Venerable souls.</p><p></p><p>And what was his actual strength? "His soul condensation technique is extraordinary," the Enchantress Witch marveled.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan's body was completely devoid of energy. His eyes remained wide open in shock and anger, but there was no sign of life, as if only an empty shell of flesh remained.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as his soul was absorbed, this empty shell fell by inertia into the Enchantress Witch's arms.</p><p></p><p>"Handsome boy, even if it's just an empty shell, I still like it," the Enchantress Witch said with a smile on her face. She had finally caught this guy.</p><p></p><p>His soul was swallowed inside her body, and his physical body was in her hands. Let's see what his master could do now.</p><p></p><p>"Although my true body can't come here, if you want to save your disciple, let's see what price you're willing to pay. If you kill me, your disciple's soul will also dissipate."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Enchantress Witch was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Although her true body couldn't descend, and this avatar's strength was limited and naturally no match for that person, his disciple's soul was inside her body. If she died, his disciple's soul would dissipate along with her.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe you can reassemble your disciple's dissipated soul. If you really have that ability, I, the Enchantress Witch, will never provoke you again!"</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress Witch sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Once a soul entered her body and dissipated with her power, it would completely vanish from heaven and earth. Even with the ability to penetrate heaven and earth, there would be no possibility of reassembling the soul.</p><p></p><p>If someone could really do that, she would admit defeat and never think of opposing them again.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could achieve this would have unimaginably strong power, far beyond what she could contend with!</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, sister will cherish you..." The Enchantress Witch looked down at Xu Yan, her smile becoming increasingly beautiful and alluring.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Suddenly, the smile on her face froze, replaced by an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>A sword had pierced into her body.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying sword intent was raging, destroying this body of hers.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Enchantress Witch was shocked and furious. At this moment, a violent force raged inside her body, as if a destructive storm had suddenly appeared within her.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Yan's spicy soul, which had now turned into a terrifying sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but the souls of the several True King Celestial Venerables she had devoured also turned into storms, raging inside her body.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Sword light shot out from the Enchantress Witch's body. The sword intent inside her body seemed to have intelligence, greatly damaging her body, rampaging from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>"How did you..." The Enchantress Witch was shocked. Xu Yan, whose soul she had absorbed, had now opened his eyes, and the sword in his hand had pierced into her body.</p><p></p><p>"I have dual souls!" Xu Yan said with a straight face.</p><p></p><p>Having succeeded with one strike, Xu Yan's form instantly disappeared from the Enchantress Witch's arms. Then, a black sword light, as if annihilating heaven and earth, slashed down towards the Enchantress Witch!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Enchantress Witch was furious. All the people in the small building instantly fell to the ground, and all their souls instantly returned to the Enchantress Witch's body.</p><p></p><p>Pink light bloomed, and crescent-shaped pink blades began to appear.</p><p></p><p>However, the sword intent inside her body was raging wildly, turning into a sword that kept drilling back and forth inside her, continuously inflicting heavy damage.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your sword drilling to!" The Enchantress Witch was furious.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan struck out with a palm, and a golden giant dragon roared. Terrifying dragon might surged, like an enraged true dragon wanting to perish together with its enemy! The divine ability: True Dragon's Fury!</p><p></p><p>Before the Enchantress Witch's pink crescent blades could strike, the True Dragon's Fury had already hit. With a puff, her body exploded into a burst of pink light and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The elegant small building, all its decorations, including the corpses of those True King Celestial Venerables, all dissipated into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>The body the Enchantress Witch had descended into ultimately didn't possess the power of an Immortal Venerable. With the Xun Wind Sword Intent invading her body, she had suffered heavy damage from the start. How could she have any strength left to resist?</p><p></p><p>"My master can blow you up, and I, Xu Yan, can blow you up too!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you despicable and shameless brat, you deserve to die!" An angry roar echoed in the Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, pink light appeared above the Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved, arriving beneath the pink light. Sword intent surged, and everything in the Heavenly Pit turned into swords, layer upon layer, forming a sword formation.</p><p></p><p>A pink figure was descending.</p><p></p><p>It was the Enchantress Witch, descending into a new body.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan struck out with a palm, and a golden dragon roared, attacking upwards. While this new body was not yet fully formed, he directly blasted it apart with one palm!</p><p></p><p>"Shameless brat, just you wait!" The Enchantress Witch was furious. She had always been the one to ambush others, who would have thought that today she would be ambushed by a young man! This was too much!</p><p></p><p>"You've devoured one of my souls. I, Xu Yan, have formed this grudge with you. Sooner or later, I'll beat you until you beg for mercy!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He looked angry and unwilling, as if he really had dual souls and the Enchantress Witch had devoured one of them.</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress Witch's form continued to appear, trying to descend again, but Xu</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yan unleashed another palm strike, sending her half-materialized form that had not yet fully taken shape back.</p><p></p><p>"Damn your dual souls! You little brat Xu Yan, how dare you scheme against me. You master and disciple better watch out - from now on, you two are my sworn enemies for life," Mei Wu's furious voice rang out. </p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A pink curved blade slashed down towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Xu Yan summoned a torrent of ten thousand swords. The sword formation emitted a blinding light, destroying the incoming attack!</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have condensed an origin soul and a sword dao soul. This is the reason for my exceptional sword dao talent. You've swallowed my sword dao soul, and for this grudge, no matter where you hide, I will find you!" Xu Yan roared resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't let Mei Wu know about the fake soul. What if there's a chance to trick her again in the future?</p><p></p><p>The reason why the soul that entered Mei Wu's body surged with sword intent and rampaged like a sword was because it was a sword dao soul! This explanation made sense.</p><p></p><p>"Your sword dao soul?" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was half-believing, half-doubting. But thinking of that unique soul that transformed into surging sword intent, it did seem plausible. After all, it was her avatar that had swallowed the soul. Even though her main body could experience the consciousness and sensations across the barrier between realms, it wasn't her actual body, so she couldn't be entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>From Xu Yan's resentful tone, as if he had suffered a great loss, she started to believe what he said. </p><p></p><p>So that soul that tasted so pungent was actually a sword dao soul?!</p><p></p><p>"As the Sword God Xu Yan, isn't it perfectly normal for me to condense a sword dao soul? Mei Wu, your Seven Wonders Divine Flower cannot compensate for my loss. This grudge must be repaid!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mei Wu felt much better. Although she had been tricked and lost another avatar, she had at least destroyed one of Xu Yan's sword dao souls.</p><p></p><p>"If you want revenge, I'll be waiting. You master and disciple will fall into my hands one day!" Mei Wu sneered.</p><p></p><p>"You're not worthy of my master taking action!" Xu Yan said contemptuously.  </p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Mei Wu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Above the abyss, the pink light began to dissipate. Mei Wu decided not to continue manifesting. </p><p></p><p>After all, with Xu Yan blocking below, she couldn't manifest a stronger avatar. It was impossible to descend into the abyss again.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Xu Yan's mouth curved up slightly. This trip had been quite fruitful - he had obtained the Seven Wonders Divine Flower and destroyed Mei Wu's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, I have a feeling we'll meet again," Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's strength was undoubtedly immense. Xu Yan felt that even if he broke through to the Void-Breaking Realm, he might not be her match.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth Realm is a big leap. Even if not equal to Mei Wu's main body, it wouldn't be far off."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited. He had already reached the Divine Image Realm and wasn't far from the Void-Breaking Realm. </p><p></p><p>As for the Heaven and Earth Realm, although he hadn't comprehended it yet, with the Seven Wonders Divine Flower in hand, he should be able to figure out the dao methods of that realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan glanced at his Mountains and Rivers Sacred Body, feeling some insight.</p><p></p><p>Using the body as heaven and earth - wasn't his Mountains and Rivers Sacred Body, which could contain all living things, in a sense an embryonic form of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>He didn't linger in the abyss. Now that he had the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, he naturally needed to find a place to consume it, comprehend his own dao, understand the Heaven and Earth Realm methods, and cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Coming out of the abyss, the True Monarch Celestial Lord who had been sent by Mei Wu to deliver the message was waiting. As Mei Wu's avatar was destroyed, he had awakened from the bewitched state.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still under the control of the Heaven's Will Mind-Fixing divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"You continue to guard here," Xu Yan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The True Monarch Celestial Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan was about to leave, eager to use the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, the True Monarch Celestial Lord suddenly said, "Young Master Xu, there's something I'm not sure if I should mention."</p><p></p><p>"What is it? Speak directly!" Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. His first thought was whether this True Monarch Celestial Lord knew about the forces behind the instigation between him and Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"During the days you were missing, someone came looking for you..." </p><p></p><p>The True Monarch Celestial Lord thought for a moment, then relayed some of the information they had learned while searching for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The person who was seeking information about you seemed to be hunted by some force. Later there was no more news. We don't know the specifics," the True Monarch Celestial Lord said finally.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes turned cold. From the True Monarch Celestial Lord's words, though the information was vague, he was certain that the person looking for him was Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>And Meng Chong was being hunted by a mysterious force?</p><p></p><p>"I understand this matter!" Xu Yan's face remained impassive. He took a step, used the divine ability Thoughtless Vanishing, and disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Which force is hunting Second Junior Brother? Could it be the ones behind the instigation between me and the Wan family?" Xu Yan immediately thought of this mysterious instigating force.</p><p></p><p>If it was one of the major forces in the Nine Mountains Realm hunting Meng Chong, that True Monarch Celestial Lord would surely know. Since he didn't know which force it was, it clearly wasn't one of the overt major forces in the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Wan Tianlin has found any clues."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could only temporarily put aside the idea of secluding himself to use the Seven Wonders Divine Flower. He returned to Mount Dagui to contact Wan Tianlin, inquire about the forces behind this, and search for traces of Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"If I reveal my whereabouts, the people behind this will probably come for me too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, after returning to Mount Dagui, Xu Yan directly revealed his whereabouts, wandering around a city, waiting for assassins to come.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he revealed himself, two figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>Wearing fierce masks, their auras powerful - peak True Monarch Celestial Lord realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"You're the ones who wanted to incite hatred between me and the Wan family, right?" Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The two masked figures, without a word, immediately launched vicious killing moves, clearly intending to end his life.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted coldly. His divine image appeared, heavenly laws descended, and in an instant, the power of heavenly laws transformed into a vast mountains and rivers divine image, instantly enveloping the two assassins.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Xu Yan has become stronger!" The two masked figures' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible he was hiding his strength before!" The other's gaze turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the dao methods Xu Yan displayed were ones they had never seen before. This wondrous mountains and rivers image gave a sense of an immortal Celestial Lord merging with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't actually merging with heaven and earth, but rather controlling heavenly laws to form this divine image. It was still somewhat different from truly merging with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the two sensed danger.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

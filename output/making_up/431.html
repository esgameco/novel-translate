        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A faint purple light shimmered, containing a small space inside that resembled a tiny room. Originally there should have been other things in this space, but now they were all gone, leaving only a bed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this bed was somewhat broken, as if it had been violently smashed.</p><p></p><p>A youth in purple robes lay on his side on the bed, seemingly asleep.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, stop pretending to sleep. Come have some tea and chat with me. Who knows, if I'm in a good mood, I might even let you out," Li Xuan said with a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly he was secretly shocked. He couldn't quite see through this purple-robed youth. The other party didn't seem to be a martial artist, but rather some kind of special existence.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't clearly discern how strong the youth's abilities were, but the other party was restrained, unable to unleash his full power unless the restraints were removed. </p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't unleash his power, Li Xuan naturally had nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth lay still, motionless, without the slightest response, as if he were already dead.</p><p></p><p>"Play dead, play dead, he can't see me, he can't come in here, he definitely can't come in. Don't panic, just play dead!" The purple-robed youth kept hypnotizing himself internally.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already dead, yes, I'm already dead!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Xuan's voice, he didn't respond at all. Inwardly he even gave a cold laugh, "You think you can trick me into coming out with this ploy? Do you really think I'm a three-year-old child?"</p><p></p><p>"But where did this person come from? Why do I get such an unfathomable feeling from him? Even someone as strong as Tai Cang didn't give me this feeling."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing that's given me this feeling before was that pair of eyes, and those eyes made one tremble. Tai Cang may have died at his hands."</p><p></p><p>"However, he's completely different from those eyes, so it shouldn't be the same person. But where did he come from? How can he have such terrifying power?" It can be confirmed that he's not one of Tai Cang's martial artists, but if he's an outsider, why didn't I sense him? Even though I'm confined here, I should still be able to sense if a powerful outsider entered Tai Cang's realm."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth grew more and more puzzled as he thought.</p><p></p><p>This person was unfathomable. Such a terrifyingly strong expert shouldn't exist within Tai Cang's realm. No one should be able to surpass Tai Cang here.</p><p></p><p>If he was an outsider, why hadn't he sensed him?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this person's strength was so great that even he couldn't sense when he entered Tai Cang's realm?</p><p></p><p>If that were true, wouldn't his power far exceed even that of the owner of those eyes? The more he thought, the more unsettled the purple-robed youth became.</p><p></p><p>"He couldn't really have seen me, could he? He won't come in here, right? Play dead!" Yes, play dead! If I'm dead, he won't be interested. Surely he can't be interested in dead people?</p><p></p><p>"He's not some old ghost from the netherworld, how could he possibly be interested in dead people?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth began to hypnotize himself again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm dead, I'm already dead..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if thinking of something else, he thought:</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to be uglier. Surely he can't be interested in an ugly corpse?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the purple-robed youth lying on the bed didn't move at all, but gradually some changes appeared. If one could see his face, they would find his entire face had wrinkled up, becoming old and ugly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. What was wrong with this purple-robed youth? Why did it feel like his thoughts weren't quite the same as normal people? Self-hypnosis?</p><p></p><p>Playing dead?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't really think that Li Xuan couldn't see him or enter his little space, could he? Looking over the small space where the purple-robed youth was, as well as that somewhat broken bed that had been violently smashed, Li Xuan became lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The other things in the small space must have all been smashed by the purple-robed youth. That bed was also smashed by him, but he probably stopped halfway through smashing it, considering that if the bed was gone, he wouldn't be able to lie down and sleep on it.</p><p></p><p>Lifting his foot, Li Xuan stomped on the ground. A force transmitted downwards, reverberating in the small space.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, stop playing dead. Come chat with this old man. Aren't you bored? Don't worry, I mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>The small space shook once.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth playing dead instantly panicked inside. "He's discovered me, what should I do? Keep playing dead?"</p><p></p><p>"No good, if I keep playing dead, what if he gets angry and smashes my little house? Then wouldn't I be exposed? Forget it, forget it, I'll go up and meet him."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think you'll get any information out of me. I'm very good at playing dumb!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the purple-robed youth muttered: "Disturbing someone's sleep is immoral behavior!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he stretched lazily, yawned, and put on an impatient expression as if he had just been woken up.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of purple light, the purple-robed youth appeared in the stone room.</p><p></p><p>He could only appear inside the stone room and couldn't walk out of it. If the stone room disappeared, he would only be able to stay in that small space.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other's wrinkled, old and ugly face, Li Xuan's expression darkened. He said, "Little one, stop pretending to be ugly!"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you calling little? I'm as old as heaven and earth!" The purple-robed youth became haughty.</p><p></p><p>He restored his original appearance - a delicate face that looked about 15 or 16 years old, even somewhat feminine.</p><p></p><p>"As old as heaven and earth? Then how old is heaven and earth?" Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was just casually continuing the conversation by asking this question.</p><p></p><p>"As old as heaven and earth, this guy is a bit strange, not like any living being I know," Li Xuan thought to himself in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"How old? Heh, let me tell you, since heaven and earth were born..." The purple-robed youth suddenly started counting on his fingers. "How many years was it again? I can't count that high. Anyway, it's many, many years!"</p><p></p><p>In his heart he was exclaiming: "I almost let it slip! Good thing I'm quick-witted."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other counting on his fingers and playing dumb, Li Xuan felt exhausted.</p><p></p><p>This acting was too poor.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't expose him. His guard is too high. There's no rush, I'll slowly persuade him. First I need to find a way to figure out his identity."</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't seem to be a normal living being, nor is he a soul body. He's truly strange. Since he's as old as heaven and earth, his strength must far exceed what I can match now."</p><p></p><p>"Some methods can't be used on him, and there's no need anyway. I'll just slowly persuade him. Who knows, maybe I can even take on a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"He looks just like a youth whose mind has recently matured. Easy to persuade."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth was counting on his fingers when he suddenly asked, "How old are you?"</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura floated around Li Xuan, his gaze profound. At this moment he actually displayed a kind of ancientness, as if recalling something. He said slowly: "Me? I existed before the years. The years cannot be counted on me."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth listened in a daze, feeling that this statement sounded very profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful, truly unfathomable, so mysterious and profound."</p><p></p><p>His heart felt a small shock.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, what's your name?" Li Xuan asked kindly.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I've forgotten what my name is. What about you? What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>The youth in purple robes scratched his head, feigning a look of complete confusion, as if he had truly forgotten his own name.</p><p></p><p>His acting skills were rather poor.</p><p></p><p>"My name, well, the karmic consequences are too great. A little friend like you couldn't bear it. It's better if you don't know."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, not exposing the other's poor acting.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, tell me. I'm sure I can handle it. What karmic consequences could I possibly not be able to bear?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Here, little friend, have some tea!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pushed a cup of tea in front of the purple-robed youth and continued: "The world is very small. My karmic consequences transcend heaven and earth. Even if you, little friend, were as old as heaven and earth, you still couldn't bear it."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked confused, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the tea in front of him, picked it up and took a sip, then immediately made a bitter face. "This tea is terrible, it's completely undrinkable. How can you drink such awful tea?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's smile remained, but inwardly he felt extremely helpless. The tea leaves used to brew this pot of spirit tea were given by the Great Yue Emperor himself. It was the finest spirit tea at the Qinghua realm, extremely rare in quantity.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Yue Emperor couldn't afford to drink it every day. He had taken out his treasured spirit tea just to please Li Xuan, whom he regarded as a great master.</p><p></p><p>This was already the highest grade spirit tea Li Xuan could offer, yet it was actually despised! For a supreme master to drink such "terrible" spirit tea would damage his image.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, your realm is too low. It's precisely because your realm is too low that you care about the grade of spirit tea, that you care about what heavenly and earthly treasures you drink.</p><p></p><p>"At my current realm, even if it's just a cup of ordinary water, I can drink it with great relish.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why? Because I have long transcended the stage of pursuing heavenly and earthly treasures. What I drink is not tea, but I'm savoring the Dao of the world. What I'm drinking is the loneliness of being invincible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued smiling as he started boasting.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth listened in a daze, his heart once again experiencing a small shock.</p><p></p><p>"Drinking not tea, but savoring the Dao of the world? Drinking the loneliness of being invincible?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth was puzzled. He scratched his head, feeling it was too profound. He couldn't help but take another sip of tea, still finding it hard to swallow.</p><p></p><p>"But I still think this tea is terrible!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, it's because your realm is low. You can't taste the Dao in it. But when you transcend worldly matters, when all things in heaven and earth become like illusions to you, you won't care about the grade of tea you're drinking anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Because you'll be savoring the Dao of the world, not the tea in the cup."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan poured himself a cup of tea, took a sip, and continued: "With this sip of tea, I'm savoring the greed of all living beings in heaven and earth, the desires of martial artists, their longing for invincibility, their yearning for eternity.</p><p></p><p>"With this sip, I'm savoring the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning pouring down between heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth blinked, listening in confusion. He couldn't help but take another sip of tea. For some reason, this sip didn't taste as bad as before.</p><p></p><p>"What did you taste in that sip of tea?" Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I tasted bitterness and unpleasantness!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Your heart is troubled, not at ease, so naturally you taste bitterness," Li Xuan said mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Being sealed here for who knows how many years, it would be strange if he wasn't troubled.</p><p></p><p>"I see?" The purple-robed youth tilted his head and held out his cup. "Give me another cup."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan poured him another cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth gulped it down in one go, his whole face scrunching up as if he had just swallowed a mouthful of bitter water.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression, Li Xuan looked at the tea in his hand and found he couldn't drink it either.</p><p></p><p>Before this, he had been drinking it with relish, but now he suddenly realized the tea was actually terrible? Gulp!</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth struggled to swallow the tea in his mouth. "It's so hard to drink. What kind of tea is this? If only I hadn't finished all the tea I had stored before, I could let you taste what good tea really is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's smile didn't fade as he said, "Little friend, with your current state of mind, you wouldn't be able to taste the flavor of even the best tea.</p><p></p><p>"You see, your realm is too low. You're still fixated on the grade of spirit tea you're drinking. When you one day transcend worldly matters, you won't be bound by such things anymore.</p><p></p><p>"The way of Dao is natural. When you're close to the Dao, savoring the myriad ways of the world, all things are contained within. Even plain tea and simple food can let you taste the flavor of the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan repeatedly emphasized that the other's realm was too low, which was why he was still fixated on the quality of the spirit tea.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth blinked, seeming lost in thought. An image floated up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was also like that, indifferent to all things, as if all the treasures of heaven and earth no longer caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme treasures, delicious food and drinks, were given to him.</p><p></p><p>"Is Taicang also like this? But Taicang is dead. That one is even more terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, the purple-robed youth looked somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Xuan immediately understood. The other must have thought of something, so he smiled and asked, "Little friend, if you have something on your mind, why not share it? Just consider it casual conversation."</p><p></p><p>"Are you very powerful?" the purple-robed youth suddenly asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I count as powerful, but so far, no one has been able to withstand a single slap from me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and smiled wryly, then added, "Being too powerful isn't actually that great. When you can solve all problems with just one slap, there's no challenge at all. It becomes very boring!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked at him suspiciously, feeling that this person seemed to be showing off his strength! But his expression seemed to show genuine distress at being too powerful, not like he was pretending.</p><p></p><p>"His strength must be greater than Taicang's, maybe even stronger than that guy with the pair of eyes?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth was somewhat shocked. Taicang's strength was immeasurable, and that being with the pair of eyes seemed even more formidable than Taicang.</p><p></p><p>This is a senior! Thinking this, the purple-robed youth's manner became a bit more respectful as he asked, "Senior, is it true that the stronger a person is, the greater their greed, the more they desire to become even stronger, wanting to control everything, wanting to be the sole ruler?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped his tea, his manner relaxed, but inwardly he was secretly delighted. Things were progressing. By slowly persuading him, he would surely be able to get the answers he wanted from the other's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"For me, that's not a strong person. A truly strong person won't have a strong desire to become stronger. They will return to ordinariness, approach the Dao, and play in the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>"Because being invincible is lonely. On the path of martial arts, one can no longer see companions. The desire to become stronger has long faded.</p><p></p><p>"Only the weak yearn to constantly become stronger. The invincible strong are all thinking about how not to be lonely..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth listened in a daze, looking suspiciously at Li Xuan. The other seemed to be telling him, "You understand now, right? I'm that kind of strong person!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 20: My Bone of Gold Does Not Impress the Master, I Must Refine a Bone of Jade</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not know that Xu Yan had already refined the fake "bone of gold" that he had fabricated, and was now excitedly coming to tell him, wanting to receive praise and recognition.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Xuan was playing with the gifts Xu Yan had given him last time - a golden sword and a jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>The golden sword was inlaid with precious pearls, made of solid gold, and was of great value.</p><p></p><p>The jade ruyi scepter was carved with auspicious cloud patterns, flawless throughout, clearly an exquisite jade carving. In terms of value, it might even surpass the golden sword.</p><p></p><p>"Although this golden sword is not of low value, I somehow feel that the jade ruyi scepter is of even higher value and rarer.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the quality of this jade, flawless throughout, crystal clear, with a smooth and mellow feel when held in the hand... Compared to the golden sword, I prefer this jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>"If I could get a matching pair, it would make for the perfect family heirloom.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've already deceived him, I don't really care. I'll just have my foolish disciple find me another jade ruyi scepter to complete the pair."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan played with the jade ruyi scepter, liking it more and more.</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, asking his disciple to find another jade ruyi scepter to make a matching pair, as a family heirloom.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Xu Yan came over.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, you've come at the right time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pushed the golden sword aside, as if disdaining it, and held the jade ruyi scepter, his eyes filled with affection for it.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this jade ruyi scepter, flawless throughout, smooth and nourishing to the soul. As they say, gentlemen love jade, and your master is also one who loves jade. If we could get a matching pair, it would be perfect."</p><p></p><p>Looking up at Xu Yan, he said, "Disciple, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking to himself: Have my disciple go find another jade ruyi scepter for me.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had originally come excitedly to tell his master that he had refined the "bone of gold", rivaling the ancient prodigies.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw Li Xuan disdainfully pushing the golden sword aside, playing with the jade ruyi scepter instead, and saying that gentlemen love jade and hoping to get a matching pair, Xu Yan thought, "Next time I go home, I'll find another jade ruyi scepter for my master."</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a thought struck him: "Wait, why would the master be talking about liking jade at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"The master's words must have a deeper meaning...</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, the master has high expectations of me, hoping that I can refine a 'bone of jade', so he's using the jade ruyi scepter as a metaphor. Compared to the 'bone of gold', the master prefers the 'bone of jade'!</p><p></p><p>"But the master is worried that I may not be able to accept the difficulty of refining the 'bone of jade', so he's hinting at it through the jade ruyi scepter, reminding me. If I don't comprehend the deeper meaning in the master's words, the master may be disappointed in me and lower his expectations, thinking that my insight is not enough to even understand such a simple hint."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately jumped to these conclusions. He felt that although the master was outwardly just asking for a matching pair of jade ruyi scepters, he was actually hoping that Xu Yan would continue refining his bone, not give up or retreat, and strive to refine the 'bone of jade'.</p><p></p><p>If Li Xuan knew about Xu Yan's wild speculations, he would certainly be dumbfounded: I just simply want the damn jade ruyi scepter!</p><p></p><p>After this bout of speculation, Xu Yan felt he had grasped the deeper meaning in the master's words. With a determined gaze, he said, "Master, I understand. I will not let you down!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan showed a satisfied smile: "If you understand, that's good. Your master believes in you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved: "The master has such high expectations of me, hoping that I can surpass the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>"The 'bone of gold' is nothing. I must refine the 'bone of jade'!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not bring up the 'bone of gold' again, for the master had already seen through everything. The mere 'bone of gold' was not worthy of the master's attention!</p><p></p><p>Continuing his cultivation, Xu Yan found that no matter how he circulated his qi or refined, there was no effect. It seemed that the 'bone of gold' was his limit.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was an impassable chasm that blocked further advancement.</p><p></p><p>"The master said that a jade-like constitution cannot be forged through natural talent, perseverance, or persistence. Those who attain a jade-like constitution must either have great fortune, be favored by heaven and earth, or possess exceptional comprehension and an ability to grasp the Tao..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, "I don't know if I have great fortune, and it's unlikely. Being favored by heaven and earth is even more impossible. So the only path left is comprehension..."</p><p></p><p>"The master often says that emphasis should be placed on intention and comprehension, which means he thinks my comprehension is not bad and is reminding me of my own strengths.</p><p></p><p>"To refine a jade-like constitution, I can only rely on my comprehension."</p><p></p><p>After this realization, the two lines of the cultivation formula once again surfaced in Xu Yan's mind: "Clarify the heart, observe the self, and cultivate the true intention; the blood and qi will be like a dragon, forging the golden body."</p><p></p><p>"I clearly have not fully comprehended the essence of these two lines. If I could grasp their true meaning, would I be able to break through the constraints of the golden bone and refine a jade-like constitution?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immersed himself completely in the cultivation formula, his mind free of distractions, discarding everything, merging with the object, trying to fathom its profound meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, cultivating the true intention. I thought that nourishing the blood and qi within the bones and marrow was cultivating the true intention, but where is this 'intention'?</p><p></p><p>"Nourishing the marrow is only the initial step, it has not actually cultivated the true intention."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of insight struck Xu Yan. He realized he had misunderstood the meaning of cultivating the true intention.</p><p></p><p>He had never truly cultivated the true intention.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know what 'intention' meant.</p><p></p><p>"The blood and qi forging the golden body like a dragon, when I refine the golden bone, the circulating blood and qi, are they truly like a dragon? That is just superficial, without the nourished 'intention' of the blood and qi dragon, how can it be considered a true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Xu Yan felt that he had encountered a barrier.</p><p></p><p>If he could just break through this barrier, he would be able to fully comprehend the cultivation formula and break through the constraints of the golden bone to enter the jade-like constitution stage.</p><p></p><p>However, this barrier remained stubbornly unbreakable.</p><p></p><p>He became somewhat troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go ask the master for advice?</p><p></p><p>"No, the master has already taught it very clearly. 'Intention' can only be comprehended by myself, and what cannot be explicitly stated, I must have overlooked something..."</p><p></p><p>For the next three days, during his cultivation, Xu Yan kept trying to comprehend the cultivation formula, wanting to grasp the true 'intention', but he was always just a step away from a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>He was unable to break through the barrier and grasp the essence.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his foolish disciple with some puzzlement. In the past three days, the disciple seemed to be somewhat distracted, occasionally staring blankly.</p><p></p><p>"After so long without any gains, is he feeling discouraged, thinking he's not capable?"</p><p></p><p>"My Jade Talisman is not in my hands yet, how can he be dejected?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me think of some mystical words to deceive him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>On that day, after finishing the meal, as Xu Yan was about to clear the dishes, Li Xuan spoke up: "In the path of cultivation, persistence is indispensable. If you encounter a bottleneck and make no progress, you can relax your mind, empty your thoughts, and try to comprehend the grass and trees.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend the natural world, capture the hidden insights around you. If you can suddenly attain enlightenment, the gates of the martial dao will open.</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, there are many who were stuck at a bottleneck without any advancement. But because they attained sudden enlightenment, they were able to break through the constraints."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke these nonsensical words, trying to persuade Xu Yan to go seek enlightenment in the so-called insights, and if he could attain enlightenment, he would be able to enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Since diligent cultivation was not working, then let him seek enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

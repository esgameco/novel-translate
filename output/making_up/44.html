            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 44 - Let's See Who Dares to Raid My House! (Seeking Continued Reading)</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe did not speak, but sighed inwardly. After this great calamity, if his foolish son had managed to escape and hide in the Wu Kingdom, he was probably still obsessed with seeking out a reclusive master.</p><p></p><p>Only by finding a reclusive master and learning the legendary powerful martial arts could he take revenge.</p><p></p><p>He knew his son too well.</p><p></p><p>"Old Pan, you should leave tonight. Chen the Escort Leader and the others may try their best against the Tianmu Sect, but when it comes to the government, they won't go all the way with the Xu family."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe pondered and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan nodded and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, will the people from the Tianmu Sect come tonight?" </p><p></p><p>Mrs. Xu asked after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>"Probably."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded.</p><p></p><p>He looked out the window, his heart somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu family mansion, in a restaurant across the street, more than a dozen people sat, all wearing coarse linen clothes. The leader, holding a goose-feather fan, stood by the window, gazing at the Xu residence.</p><p></p><p>"Military Strategist Kou, aren't you going to make a move?" </p><p></p><p>A burly man asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Xu family will perish tonight. The Donghe Prefect thinks that by setting up a net, he can raid the Xu family and wipe us out at the same time. What a joke.</p><p></p><p>"I, Kou, have already made all the arrangements. Once he makes his move, it will be time to replace the Donghe Prefect. Controlling the Donghe Prefecture starts from tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had a look of assured victory.</p><p></p><p>"The foolish and unrighteous Emperor Qi, the Qi court is full of incompetent and indolent officials. We of the Tianmu Sect uphold the will of Heaven, and we will start from this Donghe Prefecture, to show the old Emperor Qi where the true talents for governing a country are!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's gaze was sharp, and his tone was full of anger towards Emperor Qi and the Qi court.</p><p></p><p>The burly man nodded frequently, expressing his indignation. "Military Strategist Kou was unparalleled in martial arts and literary talents in the past, yet he failed the imperial examinations three times. The Qi court is truly incompetent and short-sighted."</p><p></p><p>The rest also nodded in agreement. Strategist Kou was the brain of the Tianmu Sect, brilliant and unmatched in strategies, yet he failed the examinations three times. Emperor Qi was incompetent, and the court was full of short-sighted people.</p><p></p><p>It's for the best. Since Strategist Kou joined the Tianmu Sect, he has been carefully planning, and now they only need this final push to seize the Donghe Prefecture and raise the banner of rebellion!</p><p></p><p>With Strategist Kou's strategic planning, this rebellion must succeed!</p><p></p><p>Clip-clop, clip-clop...</p><p></p><p>The sound of hooves and footsteps echoed on the quiet street, approaching the Xu family mansion.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's expression brightened. "Act according to the original plan. When they are transporting Mr. and Mrs. Xu to the prison, we will rescue them.</p><p></p><p>"As long as Xu Junhe joins our sect, both the Qi and Wu Kingdoms will have our sect's business, and we will be as rich as a country."</p><p></p><p>"But will Xu Junhe agree?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"He will."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had a look of confidence. "He won't just consider himself, but also his foolish son."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The main gate of the Xu family was broken down.</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Prefect, leading his soldiers, stormed in. The Xu family was thrown into chaos. Chen the Escort Leader, Wang the Innkeeper, and others were taken aback - they were not the evil cult members of the Tianmu Sect, but the soldiers?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, their expressions changed, and they quietly retreated to the side, ready to flee if the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Junhe has colluded with the Tianmu Sect, his crimes are heinous. By the order of myåºœ, we will raid the Xu family and arrest Mr. and Mrs. Xu!"</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Prefect looked sternly at the group of guards and Chen the Escort Leader, saying in a deep voice, "Those unrelated, hand over your weapons, and after verifying your identities, you may leave."</p><p></p><p>The guards all put down their weapons.</p><p></p><p>Chen the Escort Leader and the others...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>People are the same way.</p><p></p><p>This is the government office, not the heretical cult of the Heavenly Mother. To act like this is tantamount to rebellion, a grave crime worthy of the extermination of an entire family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe supported Madam Xu as they walked out, his expression calm as he looked at the Prefect of East River, who had been cheerfully drinking with them just recently, but now was acting so mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>This is the cruelty of the struggle for the crown prince.</p><p></p><p>"Colluding with the Heavenly Mother cult? Why is that so?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed as he looked at the Prefect.</p><p></p><p>Colluding with the Heavenly Mother cult is an extremely heinous crime, one that would lead to the complete annihilation of the Xu family and Xu Junhe's father-in-law's family.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of East River spoke coldly and indifferently, "My office is responsible for searching the Xu residence. As for the matter of colluding with the Heavenly Mother cult, it will be judged fairly by the Ministry of Justice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The fact that they had not definitively accused him of colluding with the Heavenly Mother cult was likely to make him carefully consider whether he had truly done so. If he had, there would be no room for retreat.</p><p></p><p>This was a crime worthy of the extermination of an entire family. </p><p></p><p>If he was convicted on other charges, he might only be exiled, not exterminated.</p><p></p><p>But all of this was beyond the control of a mere merchant like him. Only his father-in-law in the capital might be able to leave some room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>"Take them away!"</p><p></p><p>The Prefect waved his hand, and two guards stepped forward with shackles, prepared to arrest Xu Junhe and his wife. A swarm of officials rushed out, ready to search the Xu residence.</p><p></p><p>The richest man in East River, with his vast wealth - who would not be envious? </p><p></p><p>Now this towering giant was about to fall, and countless hungry wolves would pounce to feast on the remains.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar thundered out.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see who dares to search my family's home!"</p><p></p><p>Madam Xu's face changed drastically as she cried out, "Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Her face immediately turned deathly pale. Why had he returned at this time?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, two crimson dragons, shrouded in terrifying, scorching power, swooped down from the sky, sweeping away the officials who had rushed to search the Xu residence with the might of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the officials were blasted back, falling to the ground and struggling to get up.</p><p></p><p>The officials who had held the shackles to arrest Xu Junhe and his wife were enveloped by a giant dragon, which then exploded them in midair, their charred remains raining down on the other officials.</p><p></p><p>A young man, surrounded by scorching spiritual energy, descended from the sky with an awe-inspiring presence, standing before Xu Junhe and his wife.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of East River was trembling, his eyes wide with shock.</p><p></p><p>The officials were all sprawled on the ground, shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family's guards stared with gaping mouths and wide eyes at the young man who had descended from the sky, completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Chen the Head of Security was constantly swallowing his saliva, beads of sweat dripping from his forehead, his eyes bulging as his mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's foolish son?</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible!</p><p></p><p>The most shocked were Xu Junhe and his wife. Seeing Xu Yan descend from the sky, especially those two terrifying dragons that had swept away the officials, this was a power beyond human.</p><p></p><p>Their son had always been seeking out reclusive masters, wanting to cultivate the powerful martial arts spoken of in legends and stories.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had truly succeeded in his cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's face was filled with fury. He had held back just now, otherwise those officials would have been instantly annihilated, their bodies scattered. </p><p></p><p>This was the Xu residence, with his mother present, so he did not want to scare her by making a mess.</p><p></p><p>Only those two officials holding the shackles had been enveloped by the power of his Dragon Palm Strike, exploding them into charred remains.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 70: Blood Without Heart, the Endless Great Mountain Changes (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan strolled around the city and found that many scions of wealthy families had come to Yunshan County, all of them seeking to visit the masters in the Great Mountain and resting temporarily in the county town.</p><p></p><p>And there were not just one, but multiple swindlers like the white-bearded man!</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd was that some fools had fallen for their tricks!</p><p></p><p>"The people from the Heavenly Mother Sect are also moonlighting as swindlers?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but comment wryly. The white-bearded man and the other swindlers were all high-level practitioners from the Heavenly Mother Sect pretending to be masters.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shi, are you heading back?" </p><p>"Yes, Brother Tan, I'll be taking my leave now."</p><p>"...Brother Shi, did you obtain a martial arts secret manual?"</p><p>"How did you know?"</p><p>"I also obtained a martial arts secret manual, but it seems a bit unreliable..."</p><p></p><p>The group of scions were perplexed - martial arts secret manuals had become common goods? Surely they must be fake!</p><p></p><p>When they compared them, they realized that these were even inferior to the genuine martial arts manuals circulating in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>The group noisily went to the county yamen, demanding that the Yunshan County Magistrate arrest the swindlers. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew without even going to see that these scions of wealthy families would be fleeced again by the Yunshan County Magistrate after going to the yamen.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's grand display of power, a craze for seeking out martial arts masters had swept across the Qi Kingdom. It was not just the scions of officials and nobles, but also the top experts in the jianghu who were searching for martial arts masters, hoping to encounter a fortuitous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the Endless Great Mountain, wondering if only by crossing it could he truly understand the true face of this world?</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just speculation, whether it was true remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer. Now that Xu Yan has reached the Transcendent realm and Meng Chong has entered the martial dao, the cultivation methods of the martial dao can be appropriately disseminated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Before disseminating the cultivation methods of the martial dao, he needed to maintain a proper balance, keeping the entire situation under control and absolutely not allowing any risks of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already passed on the martial dao to those close to him, and Li Xuan believed that in a few months, they would know whether anyone was unable to cultivate the introductory techniques, lacking the aptitude for the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Endless Great Mountain, a team of over a hundred people was traversing the dense forest, continuing their exploration.</p><p></p><p>"If there are any masters in this world, they must be in the Endless Great Mountain," the young lord of the Ministry of War, Gongzi Zhizhu, declared confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!" the young lord of the Ministry of Rites agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The group of top scions from the capital, who had joined forces, all expressed their agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Endless Great Mountain was boundless and endless, with no one knowing what lay at its end, and no one able to cross it completely.</p><p></p><p>If there were any masters in this world, they must be hidden within the Endless Great Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Commandery was closest to the Endless Great Mountain, so Xu Yan must have found a master there.</p><p></p><p>The group was fully equipped, with leather armor, powerful crossbows, insect-repelling and detoxifying agents, and their escort was composed of experts at the peak of their abilities, including some supreme masters.</p><p></p><p>Although the Endless Great Mountain was dangerous, with ferocious beasts roaming about, their strength was more than enough to hunt down any such beasts. </p><p></p><p>With the insect-repelling and snake-repelling agents, as well as the renowned antidotes that could counter the venom of any poisonous insects or snakes, and the protection of the leather armor, they were confident they would not be harmed.</p><p></p><p>The scions were kept in the middle, while the escorts cleared the path in front, sweeping away the thorns and undergrowth, driving away the snakes and insects.</p><p></p><p>Some carried powerful crossbows, ready to attack any threats that appeared.</p><p></p><p>At night, they found a place to rest.</p><p></p><p>The next day, they continued their journey, heading specifically towards the high mountain forests, as they believed masters would be hidden in such remote locations.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Endless Great Mountain, a piercing howl echoed, followed by silence.</p><p></p><p>A huge fire-maned wolf lay dead on the ground, and a figure in gray robes was crouched on its neck, draining its blood.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan had been there, he would have been shocked to find that this fire-maned wolf was more than twice the size of the ones in the Evil Flame Forest.</p><p></p><p>Yet this powerful fire-maned wolf had now perished.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." </p><p></p><p>The gray-robed figure let out a series of coughs, raising his head with blood-stained lips. As he coughed, drops of blood fell from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"The beast's blood is tainted, it can only temporarily suppress my injuries."</p><p></p><p>A hint of color appeared on the man's pale face, but it quickly faded, leaving him deathly pale once more.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed with a cold, malicious light as he looked back towards the path he had come.</p><p></p><p>"This time I couldn't kill Blood Without Heart, but just you wait. When I return to the Inner Realm, you will all be in for a nightmare!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Without Heart said, then looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Once I cross the Iron Barrier Mountain, I'll be in the Borderland. You never expected me to flee to the Borderland, did you?</p><p></p><p>"In the Borderland, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated. One cannot sense, refine or absorb spiritual energy, and the spiritual energy is turbulent and cannot be taken into the body, making it impossible to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Once injured, coming to the Borderland will not only fail to heal the wounds, but the injuries will only worsen, eventually leading to death.</p><p></p><p>"But for me, Blood Without Heart, I only need to consume spirit blood to recover and strengthen myself!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Without Heart's eyes gleamed with cruelty, excitement and bloodlust.</p><p></p><p>"There are no martial artists in the Borderland, and the strongest can only reach the Seventh Rank, unable to surpass that. Although the spirit blood may not be as potent, the quantity is plentiful.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of people - even if they are just ordinary folk, I can not only restore my strength, but also break through!"</p><p></p><p>A look of exhilaration appeared on Blood Without Heart's face.</p><p></p><p>In the Borderland, he would be an invincible existence, akin to a god to the people there.</p><p></p><p>Killing and devouring without end, who could stop him?</p><p></p><p>As many as came, he would kill them all, sacrificing them to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Self.</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, he could not do this, as excessive slaughter would easily draw attention and lead to being hunted down.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had only killed a few dozen cultivators, yet he had already encountered an encirclement and nearly perished.</p><p></p><p>"The Borderlands, this is the place where I, Xue Wuxin, have risen up!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's eyes burned with fanaticism. How many people were there in the Borderlands? </p><p></p><p>Surely there must be over a hundred million people, right?</p><p></p><p>As long as he sacrificed and consumed one-tenth of them, he would be able to break through the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through the Grandmaster realm, he could return to the inner domain and take his revenge!</p><p></p><p>"Although the spiritual energy in the Borderlands has dissipated, if I rely on consuming the essence of blood, I may still be able to strengthen myself, even though the drawbacks are significant. But what does it matter?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin hatched a plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He would cultivate a group of people, have them kill and sacrifice for him, and once these people grew strong, he would then consume them, allowing him to obtain higher quality blood essence.</p><p></p><p>And he wouldn't even have to do it himself!</p><p></p><p>No one doesn't want to strengthen themselves.</p><p></p><p>"In the Borderlands, I will be a god, and they will all become my loyal believers, following me back to the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin grew more and more excited as he imagined the scene of him leading his followers and slaughtering his way back to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>Overcome by emotion, he suddenly started coughing, his complexion becoming even paler.</p><p></p><p>"No good! The effect of beast blood is too poor, I must consume human blood!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin looked up, his eyes turning blood-red. </p><p></p><p>He moved, his body soaring into the air, flying out of the Iron Barrier Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The group searching for a master had already traveled five hundred miles, but they still had not found one.</p><p></p><p>During the journey, they had encountered and killed an old tiger, feasting on it with great relish.</p><p></p><p>"Look, the towering peak in the distance, with its steep and treacherous cliffs. There might be a master in seclusion there. Our next destination shall be that mountain!"</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Ministry of War pointed at the mountain ahead.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was visible, but the distance was not close.</p><p></p><p>After a day and a night of traversing the dense forest and crossing the ravines, they finally reached the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"How do we get up there?"</p><p></p><p>The mountain peak was steep and treacherous, not an easy climb.</p><p></p><p>Several masters skilled in lightness techniques volunteered to go up, but after a long while, they returned, having found no reclusive master.</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But they quickly regained their spirits and continued on.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a break."</p><p></p><p>"That scoundrel Xu Yan, where did he encounter the master?"</p><p></p><p>"That hateful fellow!"</p><p></p><p>The group sat down on an open hillside.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed senior, please accept this junior's salute!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed excitedly and knelt down, calling out loudly.</p><p></p><p>The others followed the sound, only to see a figure flying in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The figure was flying somewhat unsteadily, but there was an indescribable elegance to its movements in the air.</p><p></p><p>A master!</p><p></p><p>They had finally encountered a master!</p><p></p><p>The group was filled with excitement and fervor.</p><p></p><p>What else could be flying in the air if not a master?</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the esteemed senior master!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I am the son of the Ministry of War's Grand Secretary, I humbly request that you take me as your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The group called out excitedly and fervently.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's injuries were acting up, and he was flying unsteadily, looking for a place to recover, when he suddenly heard the loud calls in the distance. His spirits were immediately lifted.</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Barrier Mountains, a remote and desolate wilderness, yet there are people here? And a large group at that!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed with excitement and bloodlust.</p><p></p><p>He saw the group kneeling on the hillside, over a hundred of them.</p><p></p><p>"Most of them are at the Ninth Rank of cultivation, with a small number at the Eighth Rank, and the strongest few are nearly at the Seventh Rank.</p><p></p><p>"Are these the top experts of the Borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"Those young ones look ordinary, but they are young, their blood should taste quite good."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin took one glance and saw through the cultivation levels of the entire group.</p><p></p><p>"The son of the Ministry of War's Grand Secretary? A distinguished identity, no wonder there are so many Borderlands experts guarding him. These Borderlands people, unaware of the existence of cultivators, are truly worshipping me as a deity!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed to find a place to rest, as consuming the blood of these people would allow his injuries to recover somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He let out a hearty laugh, his mood greatly improved, and flew directly towards the hillside.</p><p></p><p>The group on the hillside, including the guards, heard the laughter and were greatly elated, thinking the master seemed very pleased, and that the prospect of becoming his disciples was promising.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the esteemed master!"</p><p></p><p>They all excitedly and reverently kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good, you have arrived at the perfect time!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>The group on the hillside, hearing this, were overjoyed. The master said they had arrived at the perfect time, which meant their opportunity was secured!</p><p></p><p>They finally had the chance to become powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a frigid aura enveloped the group, and everyone couldn't help but shudder, looking up in horror.</p><p></p><p>Threads of icy cold energy, like spider silk, were emanating from the master, instantly flying towards them.</p><p></p><p>They felt a sharp pain in their chests, looking down to see the spider-silk-like threads burrowing into their hearts, as if they could see the blood being drawn out and transmitted to the master.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were weakening, their vision darkening, as if they could feel their life essence being drained away.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Help! Spare us!"</p><p>"Esteemed master, please have mercy!"</p><p>"Demon... demon!"</p><p></p><p>The peak experts cried out in agony, utterly powerless to resist, watching helplessly as their blood was continuously siphoned, their hearts withering and their consciousness fading.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

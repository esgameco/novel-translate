        <h1>Chapter 457</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Great Yan realm, Meng Chong stayed at the Dongyang Martial Academy, appearing idle except for guiding Zi Yun's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Given his notorious reputation, ordinary powerful figures didn't dare approach him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Myriad Treasures Alliance has chickened out?" Meng Chong felt somewhat disappointed that the Alliance hadn't come to seek revenge after so long.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother has also become famous throughout the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Among the five brothers, only third junior sister and fourth junior brother had no renown in the Divine Realm. </p><p></p><p>However, in the Qinghua realm, they were universally known as the founders of the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I imagine that before long, third junior sister and fourth junior brother will also become famous throughout the Divine Realm - no, throughout heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Fang Hao's formations and artifact forging, or Su Lingxiu's alchemy, they were destined to shake the world and change the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao were merely developing in the Qinghua realm. Once the Qinghua Sect emerged in the Divine Realm, it would surely shock countless powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Meng, I've used up all the pills. May I purchase some more?" Zhou Qingshuang arrived, her expression still cold and aloof as ever.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glanced at her and said, "The problem with your soul requires specially targeted pills to resolve. The pills I have, though effective, are not enough for a complete cure. No matter how many you take, it won't be enough."</p><p></p><p>He also needed to keep some pills in reserve for emergencies, and couldn't sell them all to Zhou Qingshuang.</p><p></p><p>"Where might I be able to obtain such pills?" Zhou Qingshuang asked hopefully. </p><p></p><p>The pills were truly miraculous, far superior to any divine medicines currently available in the Divine Realm's martial world.</p><p></p><p>"My junior sister concocted them," Meng Chong paused, then continued, "My junior sister is quite busy lately and doesn't like to be disturbed, so I won't tell you where she is for now. When my junior sister has time to see people, I'll let you know."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang looked visibly disappointed, but didn't dare to press further.</p><p></p><p>"When my junior sister has time, she'll certainly be willing to see you. My junior sister is very interested in rare and difficult conditions," Meng Chong added.</p><p></p><p>He was telling the truth. When he had messaged Su Lingxiu about Zhou Qingshuang's condition, she had been very curious. It was just that she was currently busy with the matter of the Heaven and Earth Divine Furnace and temporarily had no time to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks!" Zhou Qingshuang said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter," Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun stood to the side, vigilantly watching Zhou Qingshuang with eyes that seemed to guard against a thief. Zhou Qingshuang remained cold and aloof, showing no signs of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she truly felt no embarrassment, otherwise she wouldn't have continued chatting idly with Meng Chong under the pretext of seeking martial guidance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's attendant, the old woman, hurriedly walked over with a hesitant look.</p><p></p><p>"What is it? Just speak plainly, Young Master Meng is not an outsider!" Zhou Qingshuang said.</p><p></p><p>"This concerns secret matters of the royal family. Meng Chong and I should not listen. We are outsiders after all. Meng Chong, let's step aside," Zi Yun said hurriedly, pulling Meng Chong to leave.</p><p></p><p>What nonsense about not being an outsider - this princess had ulterior motives! Zi Yun thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not one to gossip excessively. Zhou Qingshuang was merely being polite, but he still needed to avoid suspicion. He was about to leave with Zi Yun.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the urging look in the princess's eyes, the old woman hurriedly spoke: "Princess, Jiang Buping, the abandoned son of the Jiang clan from the Taikun realm, has had his soul tainted by indestructible qi. Not only has he not lost his mind, but his power has become incredibly strong. He may have a way to solve the princess's problem."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Qingshuang's cold face showed surprise for the first time. With her emotional fluctuation, her soul power also began to stir, faintly emanating strands of icy qi.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, who was about to leave, immediately stopped and turned his head to look.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying Jiang Buping's soul was tainted by indestructible qi, yet not only did he not lose his mind, but his power grew stronger?" Zhou Qingshuang asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Princess. This news has already spread throughout the Divine Realm. Moreover, some major powers are preparing to join forces to steal Jiang Buping's secret. Some have already approached Great Yan. This is an opportunity for you, Princess," the old woman said solemnly with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the details," Zhou Qingshuang said, seeing that Meng Chong also seemed interested.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Princess!" The old woman explained the details of Jiang Buping's situation, including his incredibly powerful soul techniques, and how some major powers were preparing to join forces to obtain this secret.</p><p></p><p>"This is unusual. If one truly wants to obtain a method to resolve my soul issue, they should bring treasures to seek guidance. Using force to coerce is inappropriate!" Zhou Qingshuang said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Princess, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Since Jiang Buping has such power, even if powerful figures join forces, they absolutely cannot obtain the results they want. And if Jiang Buping escapes, those powers that acted against him should prepare for retaliation."</p><p></p><p>Having heard of Jiang Buping's deeds, Zhou Qingshuang immediately thought of Meng Chong and that Sword God Xu Yan. How could such powerful prodigies be easily ambushed and killed?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened from the side, cold light flashing in his eyes. Some major powers in the Divine Realm were preparing to join forces against his fifth junior brother?</p><p></p><p>They were courting death!</p><p></p><p>"What does Young Master Meng think?" Zhou Qingshuang looked towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Unless Meng Chong was willing to act, there was likely no hope.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gave a cold laugh and said, "A bunch of nobodies, thinking they can ambush and kill my junior brother? The martial way my junior brother cultivates slaughters souls. Under my junior brother's attacks, the Divine Realm's soul defense methods are nothing but paper!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang and the old woman looked shocked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was Meng Chong's junior brother?</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was Meng Chong's senior brother? The three fierce characters who had risen in the Divine Realm were fellow disciples?</p><p></p><p>"So he is Young Master Meng's junior brother. No wonder he is so powerful," Zhou Qingshuang said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes showed curiosity, "I heard that the Taikun Jiang clan's genius had already been crippled. How did he rise again? How could he recover after his soul was tainted by indestructible qi?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang was curious and asked without thinking, not expecting Meng Chong to answer since it involved secrets.</p><p></p><p>But Meng Chong smiled and said, "Mere indestructible qi is nothing. The martial way my master passed to my junior brother directly incorporates the indestructible qi into the soul's transformation. It's impossible for you to obtain a solution from my junior brother. You can't cultivate it. Only my junior sister can solve your problem."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang and the old woman were shocked again. Just how powerful was Meng Chong's master to be able to solve the problem of indestructible qi?</p><p></p><p>How could anyone afford to offend the disciples of such a powerful figure?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for enlightening me, Young Master Meng. I have urgent matters to attend to and must take my leave," Zhou Qingshuang said, hurriedly leaving with the old woman.</p><p></p><p>They had to stop Great Yan from getting involved, or the consequences would be unimaginable. </p><p></p><p>With the fierce Meng Chong still in Great Yan, how could they dare to ambush his junior brother? Meng Chong would surely not let it go. Though Great Yan was strong, they had to consider the severe consequences of Meng Chong taking action.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled and took out a communication talisman to contact Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, do you need your senior brother to step in?"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, second senior brother. My Extreme Soul Martial Way is ready to show its edge in this opportunity. Even if I can't win, I can still escape."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll wait for you in the Taikun realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put away the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>He had stayed in Great Yan for some time now.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was about time to leave and continue traveling through the divine realm, while waiting for the Treasure Alliance to come seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're leaving?" Zi Yun said with a look of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to stay in Da Yan, then go to the Qinghua Realm," Meng Chong said, stroking her hair. "Go together with Zhou Qingshuang. With your master's jade token, you don't need to worry about safety."</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Zi Yun nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Tianming, Yun Yan'er, are you afraid, so you spread news to outsiders, wanting to use the hands of the many powerful figures in the divine realm to eliminate me?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping listened to the discussions of the martial artists around him, all about how his soul had been contaminated by the indestructible qi, yet he hadn't lost his mind and had recovered, becoming even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The various powers and many strong figures in the divine realm were already tempted, wanting to obtain this so-called secret.</p><p></p><p>Besides Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er, no one else would have spread this news. </p><p></p><p>As for the Jiang clan of Taikun, they would rather keep the secret to themselves than spread it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how many fools who don't know what's good for them come to ask me for some secret technique," Jiang Buping sneered.</p><p></p><p>He crossed the realm gate and left, heading to the next realm. His destination was the Taikun Realm!</p><p></p><p>He would travel through realm after realm, finally reaching the Taikun Realm to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er would flee, Jiang Buping wasn't worried. The divine realm was only so big - where could they escape to? With his breakthrough in strength, immortal sovereigns were almost like clay chickens and pottery dogs in Jiang Buping's eyes. Even if they had cultivated soul defense techniques, they would be no match for him.</p><p></p><p>For Taicang martial artists, Extreme Soul martial arts had an absolute advantage over those of the same level, like attacking from a higher dimension.</p><p></p><p>The soul was both difficult to harm and difficult to defend. Once one could specifically attack the soul, given the weakness of soul defense in Taicang martial arts, there was almost no resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping?"</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Buping crossed through the realm gate, he saw several powerful figures standing in all directions, their auras intertwined, controlling heaven and earth, with powerful pressure sealing off all directions.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a top-tier immortal sovereign, carrying soul-protecting divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"We won't make things difficult for you. We just need you to pass on to us the secret technique for not being affected by the indestructible qi. We promise that when you go to the Taikun Realm to demand an explanation in the future, we will support you!" one immortal sovereign said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping revealed a disdainful smile. "Are you worthy?"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, your soul technique may be powerful, but do you really think that with your strength alone, you can resist the several of us? We have also cultivated soul techniques and have soul-protecting artifacts. Even if our soul techniques are not as strong as yours, it's impossible for you to defeat us!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>The auras of the several immortal sovereigns erupted, a faint glow surrounding their heads, protecting their souls from attack.</p><p></p><p>"Mere clay chickens and pottery dogs like you dare to threaten me?" Jiang Buping's expression turned cold, his Extreme Soul Divine Spear in hand.</p><p></p><p>"Mere immortal sovereigns dare to come ambush me? Who gave you the courage? Today, I'll let you know that what I've cultivated is not some soul technique, but the Extreme Soul martial way!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an intense killing intent surged from Jiang Buping's body.</p><p></p><p>The long spear in his hand radiated a fierce sharpness, but this sharpness was only aimed at the soul and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, several immortal sovereigns and many true king sovereigns were watching the battle.</p><p></p><p>The news of several top-tier immortal sovereigns ambushing Jiang Buping here had already spread, so many powerful figures had come to watch.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Buping revealed his sharpness, even from afar, those true king sovereigns felt a sense of soul terror the moment they saw that long spear.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul martial way? What kind of technique is this? Why have we never heard of it before?"</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the reason why Jiang Buping is not affected by the indestructible qi?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the several immortal sovereigns watching the battle became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>The sharpness Jiang Buping was now displaying gave them a feeling that he could destroy their souls with a single spear strike!</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn fool!"</p><p></p><p>The several top-tier immortal sovereigns ambushing Jiang Buping also had solemn expressions, feeling a strong sense of crisis. They didn't dare to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a wave of their hands, heaven and earth burst with light, and a sharp radiance appeared in midair, emanating a cold and fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, let's see how you block this attack from us!"</p><p></p><p>This sharp radiance was a soul-killing secret technique jointly cast by the several immortal sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Petty tricks!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping disdainfully pointed his spear, and starlight burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Divine ability: Star Extinction!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, that sharp radiance in midair also shot towards Jiang Buping, piercing into his body.</p><p></p><p>The several immortal sovereigns who had attacked revealed joyful expressions. Could Jiang Buping not block this attack?</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>However, one of the immortal sovereigns had a shocked expression. His figure erupted with a dazzling light, layer upon layer of light screens covering him.</p><p></p><p>A small mirror-like divine artifact appeared at his brow.</p><p></p><p>A soul-protecting divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he saw points of starlight appearing. His soul felt a sense of annihilation. He hurriedly activated the defensive artifact with all his might while also activating his soul technique.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, help me!"</p><p></p><p>The other immortal sovereigns also had great changes in expression. They all made their moves, pouring out their power to strengthen that immortal sovereign's defense.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The mirror at his brow shattered. A long spear radiating starlight seemed to thrust out from void space, breaking through layer after layer of defense and piercing into his soul.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The spear light burst forth, opening a large hole in his soul. Moreover, the hole in his soul rapidly expanded, his soul dissolving in a short time!</p><p></p><p>Ah! A shrill scream echoed through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>All who heard it felt their hair stand on end. What kind of torment could make someone let out such a miserable scream?</p><p></p><p>And the one who let out the scream was actually a top-tier immortal sovereign!</p><p></p><p>All defenses under this one spear strike were like paper, unable to withstand a single blow!</p><p></p><p>Thud! A corpse fell from midair. Its soul had already been annihilated, leaving only an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>"How are you unharmed?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining attackers now had great changes in expression, looking at Jiang Buping in shock.</p><p></p><p>Their joint soul secret technique attack had clearly pierced into Jiang Buping's body. Why did he not appear injured at all?</p><p></p><p>"Your so-called soul attack techniques are not even like mosquito bites to me!" Jiang Buping sneered.</p><p></p><p>"One down. It's your turn now!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to one of the attackers as he thrust out his spear.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: God Slayer!</p><p></p><p>That immortal sovereign only felt a sharp spear piercing towards his soul. A strong sense of mortal danger arose.</p><p></p><p>Roar! He let out a great shout. At this critical moment between life and death, he directly used a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>His essence blood burned, and a layer of blood color appeared on his soul. His aura became powerful and gloomy at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The other attackers this time did not help with defense, but frantically attacked, sending attack after attack towards Jiang Buping!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

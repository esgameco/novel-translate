        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two half-step Grand Masters and two Perfected Masters came to surround and attack. Xu Yan was not the least bit afraid, as his sword light surged and his sword intent permeated the battlefield, enveloping it in an aura of solemnity and killing.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The two half-step Grand Masters had solemn expressions. This person's strength was extremely powerful, and they could not afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>A vast oppressive force surged out, vaguely resembling the might of the heavens descending.</p><p></p><p>This was the aura of Grand Masters, but since they were only half-step Grand Masters, they were ultimately weaker compared to true Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even so, they were still not opponents that Sect Master cultivators could match.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword light rippled, as if it was about to shatter at any moment. His figure stumbled back, seemingly on the verge of collapse, revealing a huge opening.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity had arrived!</p><p></p><p>The two Sect Master cultivators, their eyes flashing with ruthlessness, suddenly charged forward, their attacks fierce and brutal, their Sect Master aura erupting to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A dragon's roar resounded, and Xu Yan slapped his left palm, causing two golden giant dragons to surge forth, charging towards the two Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The two half-step Grand Masters' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of battling them, he still had the spare energy to pretend to reveal an opening and lure them in to strike?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>One of the half-step Grand Masters, wielding a long saber that gleamed with frigid light, rushed over violently, intending to save the two Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>However, a dragon's roar sounded, and the terrifying dragon aura, as if it could make all living beings prostrate, immediately shook the two Sect Masters' minds, causing them to sway.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>They sank in their hearts, realizing the danger, and frantically activated their cultivation techniques, trying to shake off the dragon's influence, but it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden dragons struck, instantly exploding and crushing them to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Bang! At the same time, the violent attacks of the two half-step Grand Masters broke through Xu Yan's sword light, and he quickly shifted his position to evade.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the battle, they didn't even have time to pick up the two black-robed figures, whose bodies exploded and fell onto the surface of the lake, scattering their spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>After killing the two Sect Masters, Xu Yan let out a breath, and his gaze gradually became more ruthless.</p><p></p><p>It was time to kill the half-step Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that the two would escape during the fierce battle with the half-step Grand Masters, so he had set up a false opening to lure them in and annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's your turn!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword light rippled, and the sword intent of the mountains and rivers descended upon them.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, we have no enmity with you. Who are you?" asked one of the half-step Grand Masters in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to know who I am, then first tell me which faction you belong to," Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>The two half-step Grand Masters were furious. "What the hell, you don't even know which faction we're from, and you want to kill us? You're being too presumptuous!" "You're looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>The two surrounded and attacked him from left and right, and with a thunderous sound, the lake water surged up into the sky, scattering like droplets containing terrifying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"My spirit tickets!" Xu Yan was enraged. The spirit tickets that had fallen into the water were all gone. There should have been tens of thousands of spirit crystals there. How heartbreaking!</p><p></p><p>"You destroyed my spirit tickets, so you must die!" Xu Yan glared fiercely at the half-step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers instantly descended, and in a moment, a golden dragon was coiling within the mountains and rivers, a dragon's roar resounding! Mountain and River Dragon Roar!</p><p></p><p>The half-step Grand Master felt the dragon's roar shaking his mind, as if he had suddenly entered a world of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" He was horrified.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this? Roar! He let out an angry bellow, and the aura of the half-step Grand Master erupted to the extreme, as a water column thundered and spun, trying to break out of the descending crisis.</p><p></p><p>His mind had just escaped the mountains and rivers when he saw a sword light that annihilated everything, a ruthless and murderous aura that seemed to bury all living beings.</p><p></p><p>And he was one of those living beings! Poof! His body instantly split apart, and everything on him fell into the water, his flesh continuously shattering until he turned into flying ash, as if buried in the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"I'll make you destroy my spirit tickets!" Xu Yan was furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Plop!</p><p></p><p>The remaining half-step Grand Master was now covered in cold sweat, his eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Slain by a single sword strike? What a terrifying sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Flee! That was his first thought, and his figure moved, quickly fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!" Xu Yan's figure flashed, instantly giving chase.</p><p></p><p>The half-step Grand Master was extremely powerful and not slow in speed, but Xu Yan was even faster.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a tall building. It was the Peerless Pavilion! "Grand Master of the Peerless Pavilion, help! Someone is killing people at the Thousand Star Lake!"</p><p></p><p>The half-step Grand Master felt the ruthless aura behind him, as if death was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the Peerless Pavilion trembled.</p><p></p><p>Many Sect Master cultivators took to the skies, looking towards the one fleeing in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"That's a half-step Grand Master?" </p><p></p><p>"Who is that person, actually chasing and attacking a half-step Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Hum! An aura resembling the might of the heavens suddenly emerged from the Peerless Pavilion, and a figure in blue appeared in the hazy distance, stepping out.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master of the Peerless Pavilion, please save me! This lawless villain disregards the Grand Masters and is causing carnage at the Thousand Star Lake!" the half-step Grand Master cried out in relief.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master can't save you!" Xu Yan didn't care about the Grand Master's arrival, he just wanted to kill the person first! Roar! His figure flashed, already above the opponent's head.</p><p></p><p>With the speed of lightning, how could the other party compare? Mountain and River Dragon Roar!</p><p></p><p>One sword strike descended, the mountains and rivers manifesting, the dragon's roar resounding, instantly overwhelming and burying all living beings with its sword intent!</p><p></p><p>"You!" The half-step Grand Master was horrified, frantically unleashing his full strength to try and withstand this sword strike. As long as he could block it, the Grand Master would arrive, and the opponent would not be able to kill him.</p><p></p><p>He exerted his utmost, even if it meant sustaining heavy injuries, he had to block this sword strike. </p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan's sword strike was meant to kill him without any chance of survival! He would not give anyone the opportunity to save him.</p><p></p><p>These two half-step Grand Masters were not as strong as Yin Hong, lagging behind by quite a margin.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan's sword heart was enlightened to the Perfected stage, and he had also comprehended the myriad phenomena of the mountains and rivers, his strength having increased significantly compared to when he fought Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>The sword strike descended.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers collapsed, burying all living beings, and that half-step Grand Master was entombed within.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master of the Peerless Pavilion, save..." </p><p></p><p>His voice grew weak and finally fell silent.</p><p></p><p>His body instantly shattered and disintegrated into flying ash under the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>On the rippling water surface, spirit tickets were floating, belonging to that half-step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, collecting the spirit tickets on the water.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cultivators of the Peerless Pavilion were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>A half-step Grand Master had just died like this? And even after the Grand Master of the Peerless Pavilion appeared, he had resolutely killed the person.</p><p></p><p>This battle had caused a great commotion, shaking the Thousand Star Lake, and all the cultivators were looking at the young man who was happily stacking up the collected spirit tickets and putting them away.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Peerless Pavilion had already appeared, and yet at this time, he actually...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Was he still busy picking up the spirit tickets? After Xu Yan finished picking up the spirit tickets, he was about to return to the small island, as there were still things to plunder inside.</p><p></p><p>The commotion from the battle was not small, if someone else got there first, wouldn't all his efforts be in vain?</p><p></p><p>"You're just going to leave like that?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the indifferent voice of the Peerless Grand Master resounded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the other party, feeling a chill in his heart, "So powerful, much stronger than the Grand Master my master killed, is this the foundation of the Peerless Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"Since I've killed them, why stay? I still need to go get back what belongs to me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't win, he could just run away, there's no shame in that.</p><p></p><p>When he becomes stronger, he'll come back and kill this Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>All the warriors in the Peerless Pavilion swallowed hard, this young man is so arrogant, he doesn't even take the Peerless Grand Master seriously.</p><p></p><p>This is the Peerless Grand Master, the existence of the Peerless Pavilion, many powerful experts don't dare to act recklessly because of her.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Grand Master comes, they still have to abide by the rules.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of the Thousand Star Lake, you are not allowed to fight and kill, don't you know?" </p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master's tone remained indifferent.</p><p></p><p>There was not much emotional fluctuation, it was impossible to tell if she was happy or angry.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, and then said, "Even if I knew, they took my things, I would still fight."</p><p></p><p>All the warriors were now covered in cold sweat, this is really arrogant, even if he knows, he would still fight?</p><p></p><p>Does he not fear the Peerless Grand Master at all?</p><p></p><p>With these words, even if the Peerless Grand Master wanted to let him go, it would be impossible now.</p><p></p><p>"What did they take from you?"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master's tone was still indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit crystals and spirit medicines, anyway, all their things are mine."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the reason, you fought and killed people, polluting the Thousand Star Lake, you must give an account."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master's tone became stern.</p><p></p><p>"I admit to killing people."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was dissatisfied and said, "But polluting the Thousand Star Lake, I don't admit to that. I turned them all to ash, which has already scattered in the wind, not a drop of blood fell into the lake, how can it be polluting the Thousand Star Lake?"</p><p></p><p>The warriors: ......</p><p></p><p>You're so reasonable, you directly turned them into ash, not a drop of blood fell into the lake, so it didn't pollute the Thousand Star Lake! Even the Peerless Grand Master was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, you killed people in the Thousand Star Lake, you must give an account!"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"How annoying, if you want to fight, just do it directly, stop nagging. I still need to go back and plunder... get back what's mine, if someone else takes it, are you going to compensate me? You woman, you're just too nagging, I'm leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very impatient.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to hurry back to plunder the courtyard, if someone else got there first, he would suffer a big loss!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>All the warriors were now scared to death, they felt a suppressive aura, the Peerless Grand Master seemed to be angry!</p><p></p><p>The anger of a Grand Master, how terrifying is that? Especially the Peerless Master, a top-tier Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>However, as the one who angered the Grand Master, they were shocked to find that the other party, after speaking, directly ignored the angry Peerless Grand Master and disappeared into the sky in a flash.</p><p></p><p>That speed was unimaginably fast! With a thunderous momentum, it instantly descended, scaring all the warriors, they almost prostrated themselves on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master was almost furious, he actually turned around and left, completely ignoring her, the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>She moved to chase after him, but hesitated for a moment, suppressing her aura, and turned back to the Peerless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>All the warriors wiped the cold sweat from their foreheads and hurriedly left the Peerless Pavilion, also puzzled, why didn't the Peerless Grand Master chase and kill him?</p><p></p><p>Did she really let that young man go?</p><p></p><p>"Who is that young man?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"You think, could it be Xie Lingfeng from the Sword Saint Cliff? His sword dao is so strong, and he's so young..."</p><p></p><p>Someone asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Possible."</p><p></p><p>The other warriors suddenly realized, perhaps they knew why the Peerless Grand Master spared the young man.</p><p></p><p>"That would make sense, Xie Lingfeng is a genius of the Sword Saint Cliff, she treasures him, if the Peerless Grand Master bullies him, the Sword Saint Cliff won't let it go easily."</p><p></p><p>"Right, and I heard that Xie Lingfeng seems to be the only son of the current Sword Saint Xie Tianheng, the strength of Sword Saint, the Peerless Master is not his match."</p><p></p><p>The warriors discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>As for the culprit Xu Yan, he had returned to the place where the battle just took place, and picked up all the remaining spirit tickets on the water surface.</p><p></p><p>He looked back, a little puzzled: "That Peerless Grand Master, not chasing after me? She's so easy to talk to?"</p><p></p><p>He was a little surprised in his heart, the magnanimity of this Peerless Grand Master is really broad, he lost face in front of her, but she didn't seem to care at all?</p><p></p><p>"This Peerless Grand Master, I've saved my life. If she had chased and killed me, when I break through, I'll come back and kill her, and then plunder the Peerless Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan suddenly felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>If the Peerless Grand Master had chased him, they would have become enemies, and he could rightfully come back for revenge and plunder the Peerless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Pavilion is very rich after all!</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, not dwelling on the Peerless Pavilion, but excitedly looking towards the courtyard in the small island.</p><p></p><p>"There should be treasures stored in there, right?"</p><p></p><p>Excitedly coming to the small island, he entered the courtyard and started plundering.</p><p></p><p>"The next target, the Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already decided, after plundering the courtyard, he would set out for the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>To discuss martial arts, to discuss the Dao of martial arts, to browse the library of the Seven Star Academy, understand the inner domain martial arts, and absorb the essence for himself, integrate the myriad laws into his own Dao!</p><p></p><p>In the top-level courtyard of the Peerless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go kill that arrogant bastard!"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes pulled her to sit down, gently stroking her heaving, turbulent chest, and said, "Master, if you really kill him, we'll lose the Peerless Pavilion too.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you just injure him, the consequences will be very serious."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master sneered and said, "Am I afraid of Xie Tianheng?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, you may not be afraid, but Young Master Xie hasn't offended our Peerless Pavilion, killing a few people, as he said, not a drop of blood fell into the lake, it didn't pollute the Thousand Star Lake."</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes continued to console her.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still so angry, I want to go give him a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master got angrier and angrier, what kind of attitude was that?</p><p></p><p>What did he mean by "nagging"?</p><p></p><p>And calling her a "woman"!</p><p></p><p>Outrageous!</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes held her back and said, "Master, how can you catch up to him now? Young Master Xie's movement technique is profoundly mysterious, his speed is so fast, even ordinary Grand Masters can't match him.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you had chased him then, you might not have caught up. If you offend Young Master Xie, and he holds a grudge, that won't be good!"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master was still furious, angrily saying, "It's all your fault, you told me not to act, otherwise I could have taught him a lesson just now!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, it's all the disciple's fault."</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes admitted her mistake.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

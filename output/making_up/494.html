        <h1>Chapter 494</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned from the Great Wilderness with a look of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to break through to the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's sword techniques, various divine abilities, and his dao body, upon entering the Heaven and Earth realm, although his strength won't match a Supreme Being, he should be able to slay a Divine Lord."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a rough estimate of Xu Yan's strength after his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan was no ordinary martial artist, but a true prodigy. With his powerful sword techniques and various divine abilities, he would be able to slay a Divine Lord.</p><p></p><p>And with the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword divine ability, ordinary Supreme Beings would find it difficult to harm Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Once Xu Yan reached small accomplishment in the Heaven and Earth realm, he would not fear even Supreme Beings. Upon reaching great accomplishment, he would have the power to slay Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Heaven and Earth realm, crushing Supreme Beings and sweeping away all opponents would be effortless.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan is quite interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Wu Tiannan, who was in secluded cultivation. Ever since learning that his martial arts guide was in the Dao Realm, Wu Tiannan had realized his own weakness.</p><p></p><p>He was now desperately cultivating, and had changed his usual behavior, actively seeking guidance when encountering martial arts questions.</p><p></p><p>"He's reached the Heaven Fusion realm already, that's quite fast!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Wu Tiannan truly lived up to his great fortune, like a child of destiny.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the changes in heaven and earth, the faster his cultivation speed became.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the Dao Realm, "Interesting, this was left behind by Tai Cang, to nurture a new lord of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide had a close relationship with Tai Cang, otherwise he wouldn't have received such generous gifts from Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reached out his hand and grabbed a divine artifact from Fang Hao's Qimen Academy. With a casual wipe, the artifact became thin as paper.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a wave of his hand, patterns appeared on the paper. In an instant, the patterns of the heavenly laws from the Tai Cang Book were all imprinted on the paper.</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand again, and the paper fell into Wu Tiannan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend it well."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Cang Book was no longer of much use, as it could no longer make someone the lord of heaven and earth. After all, the current world was no longer Tai Cang, but the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Since the Heavenly Dao appeared, this world had already changed.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Cang Book was now just a powerful heavenly secret manual, unable to make one the lord of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Since it was left behind by Tai Cang, and Wu Tiannan had become a child of destiny with deep connections to himself, he might as well use the Tai Cang Book to guide him.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Great Wilderness had already greatly increased. Xu Junhe had broken through to the Divine Ability realm, and there were now many more Divine Element realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the Heavenly Dao had already spread into the Spirit Realm. Tian Zi was in the process of transforming the Spirit Realm, giving the creatures and numerous martial artists there the concept of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>They all understood how to comprehend and cultivate the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Most of the shackles on Tian Zi had already been broken.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists in the Spirit Realm below the Master level began to convert to the Great Wilderness martial arts. Those above the Master level, due to comprehending the Heavenly Dao, no longer had purely Tai Cang martial arts foundations.</p><p></p><p>But neither were they Great Wilderness martial arts. If they could find a balance between the two, they could comprehend the Heavenly Dao to increase their strength, without the limitations of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Refinement realm was no longer the limit.</p><p></p><p>Law Condensation Celestial Venerables would soon be born in the Spirit Realm, which meant that martial artists in the Spirit Realm would soon devoutly comprehend the Heavenly Dao. This trend was unstoppable and would be extremely rapid, changing the martial arts concepts of Spirit Realm martial artists in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The realm lords in the Dao Realm were unaware of these changes, still pondering how to obtain more authority over heaven and earth, even dreaming of becoming the new lord of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Tian Zi was the spirit of heaven and earth, possessing authority over heaven and earth that no one except Tai Cang could match.</p><p></p><p>Now, transforming into the Heavenly Dao, once it operated the entire world, after Tai Cang's world completed its transformation, even if Tai Cang were reborn, it would not be able to control this world.</p><p></p><p>For Li Xuan, he watched the situation unfold. If he didn't take action, that was fine, but once he did, it would be a matter of raising his hand for the enemy to be obliterated.</p><p></p><p>"The threat from the Immortal Palace has not yet appeared. This Dao Ancestor still has time to continue growing stronger. After another breakthrough, I'll be able to crush the Immortal Palace with one slap!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Anything less than being able to crush the enemy with one slap would affect his image as the supreme Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the Haotian Infinite Indestructible Body. You have broken through to the Haotian Infinite Indestructible Body!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had finally comprehended the Haotian Infinite Indestructible Body, and his physical martial arts had finally reached the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of getting stronger is truly wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's cry rang out.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists looked up to see a true dragon with a blue back and white body rising into the air from somewhere, letting out a roar and coiling in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've become a dragon, I've finally transformed into a true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>An excited, elated voice shouted.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong felt his own power as he coiled in mid-air, his head unconsciously turning towards the Nine Mountains region. Perhaps he could compete for the position of Great Beast King?</p><p></p><p>Roar! He let out one excited dragon cry after another, his dragon might rippling as he coiled in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort came, frightening Yu Xiaolong so much that his dragon body trembled.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I've become a dragon, how can I still be suppressed by her?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong looked confused.</p><p></p><p>He shrank his body and descended, looking puzzled at Ao Yuxue who had walked out of the house.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ao Yuxue had said, although he had transformed into a true dragon, he still lacked the ability to take human form.</p><p></p><p>"You mixed-blood dragon, get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue waved her hand to shoo him away.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was dejected as he turned and left, continuing to consolidate his realm. Once he had fully consolidated it, he could return to the Nine Mountains region and try to compete for the position of Great Beast King?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Yu Xiaolong and shook his head. He was clever, using the methods of great beasts to exchange a drop of true dragon blood from Ao Yuxue, thus transforming into a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>But he was ultimately not born a true dragon, merely evolving his bloodline later, so he lost some of the special abilities of true dragons, such as the ability to take human form.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he would still be suppressed by Ao Yuxue.</p><p></p><p>"Competing with Red Cat for the position of Great Beast King? He's asking for a beating!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head. Although Yu Xiaolong's strength had indeed increased greatly after transforming into a true dragon, and he had a strong deterrent effect on spirit beasts, he was still far from being a match for Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat's strength had increased a lot, and as the first Great Beast, he had some special qualities. If Yu Xiaolong challenged Red Cat, he would likely be beaten badly.</p><p></p><p>"Xin Mengrou has returned to the Supreme Illusory Realm. With my guidance, the Supreme Illusory Realm should be able to merge the Dream Fantasy Dao with the Supreme Dao, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at a certain place in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"That old Xiao Yao fellow, his talent is indeed extraordinary. No wonder he was hailed as the foremost of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at old man Xiao Yao's secluded cultivation location.</p><p></p><p>Old man Xiao Yao was currently comprehending the qi of the Heavenly Dao, and had already made some progress.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still far, far from breaking through his shackles and forging a new path. But at least he had seen hope.</p><p></p><p>This meant that comprehending and cultivating the Heavenly Dao was the correct path.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao's excitement was understandable.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Heroes of Taicang were once famous prodigies in the Taicang realm, all of whom had received personal guidance from Taicang. Although Taicang didn't formally take them as disciples, they could be considered Taicang's students.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was the leader of the Seven Heroes of Taicang, the number one among the second generation of powerful figures. Now, among the Seven Heroes of Taicang, only Old Xiao and one other remained within the Taicang realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the other five, whether they were dead or alive, and where they were, was unknown. Li Xuan naturally didn't care about these matters.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators from the Dao Realm will arrive soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Tahe Realm. The tremors from the falling Shadow Realm were starting to weaken, which meant that cultivators from the Dao Realm would soon arrive, and true dragons would come as well.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's dragon subduing had caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind this. Even if the True Dragon Realm Lord came in person, he could easily handle it, after all, he possessed the Way of Dragon Subduing.</p><p></p><p>Subduing dragons was merely a wave of his hand for him.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue shuffled her feet, timidly walking over with a hesitant expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, "If you have any questions, just ask directly!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue was overjoyed, her expression becoming somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"I have some questions about the Great Demon technique that I haven't been able to figure out. I was hoping Ancestor of the Dao could give me some guidance."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue said with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What questions do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I'm a true dragon, and the Great Demon technique is indeed suitable for me, but when I practice it, I always seem to hit a bottleneck, unable to fully integrate it..."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue explained the problems she had encountered one by one.</p><p></p><p>The True Dragon clan possessed their own unique True Dragon techniques, some of which were innate abilities, born from their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ao Yuxue was an Ice Snow True Dragon, her True Dragon technique was ice-cold thunder, extremely unique. This was her innate True Dragon technique.</p><p></p><p>Apart from innate True Dragon techniques, the True Dragon clan also had True Dragon techniques that could be cultivated. These were all created by the True Dragon ancestor Ao Hong. After all, Ao Hong was the first intelligent being Taicang had encountered, so they naturally communicated with each other, thus creating True Dragon techniques unique to the True Dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>However, True Dragon techniques were not like those of human cultivators, which could continuously improve and raise one's realm. A True Dragon's strength was connected to their bloodline; the higher the bloodline, the stronger they were. True Dragon techniques were more like combat or defensive skills.</p><p></p><p>Similar to human cultivators' martial skills and secret techniques, the Great Demon technique, however, could be cultivated to improve oneself, unrestrained by bloodline limitations. As long as one had sufficient talent and insight, or even enough diligence, they could gradually accumulate strength over time and become stronger.</p><p></p><p>This was why Ao Yuxue was willing to exchange her True Dragon blood for the Great Demon technique from Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>As for Ao Yuxue's confusion, Li Xuan knew some of the reasons. It was mainly because Ao Yuxue's strength was too great, even stronger than the current Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon technique was Red Cat's insight. Although the cultivation direction was clear, it was still constrained by some limitations, making it difficult to surpass Red Cat's current level.</p><p></p><p>After all, Red Cat hadn't yet cultivated more profound levels of the Great Demon technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ao Yuxue was a true dragon. To cultivate the Great Demon technique, she needed some time to settle in, and couldn't master the Great Demon power all at once.</p><p></p><p>"Settle in, don't be in a hurry to achieve results. Thoroughly understand the Great Demon technique from beginning to end, like the Great Demon patterns, start from the first one and slowly integrate it into yourself.</p><p></p><p>"When you fully understand its profundities, you will naturally be able to integrate it. In the path of cultivation, one must avoid being impatient."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue pondered for a moment, then respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since you want to cultivate the Great Demon martial way, then start from the beginning. Refine the Great Demon foundation, settle in sufficiently, and when the time is right, you will naturally break through.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's true spirits or spiritual beasts, different true spirits and spiritual beasts will cultivate different Great Demon techniques.</p><p></p><p>"You are a true dragon. If you understand the Great Demon martial way, you can try to integrate your innate abilities into the Great Demon martial way, and you will cultivate divine abilities unique to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gave Ao Yuxue some guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue was overjoyed. After respectfully withdrawing, she went into seclusion to ponder the Great Demon martial way.</p><p></p><p>"He's about to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards Xu Yan's secluded cultivation place, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Someone with some strength has arrived. What's that beside him? A true spirit? This true spirit is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked towards the direction of the Tahe Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just now, a strange powerful figure had entered the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Coming from the Shadow Realm, which was still trembling now, theoretically, it should have been impossible to pass through the Shadow Realm and descend into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet this person had arrived early, showing that they had a special method to successfully pass through the Shadow Realm without being obstructed by its laws.</p><p></p><p>"Skilled in concealment and lurking, with a special true spirit... This must be someone from the Heavenly Fiend Shadow Realm, and quite powerful. Could they be coming for me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer's strength, though far inferior to Old Xiao's, was clearly specialized in lurking and concealment, with the assistance of a special true spirit, obviously following the path of sneak attacks and assassination.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention a mere Supreme Realm cultivator, even if a Realm Lord came, I could kill them with a single slap!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a surge of energy emerged, ripples spread through heaven and earth, heavenly laws appeared, Dao principles manifested, and the rhythm of heaven and earth became hazy.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao, who had been comprehending the qi of heavenly Dao, instantly appeared in the courtyard, looking with surprise and doubt towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"He's about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently watched as Xu Yan was breaking through to the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Using one's body as heaven and earth, the breakthrough caused anomalies in heaven and earth, as if the heavenly laws sensed the appearance of a new heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Yet they couldn't understand where this new heaven and earth was, or why a new heaven and earth had been born, so anomalies appeared, but only to this extent.</p><p></p><p>If there were a Heavenly Dao present, it would have immediately locked onto Xu Yan's existence, but now it only passively displayed some anomalies, and the range of these anomalies was limited.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies didn't last long before returning to calm, as if the heavenly laws had lost their sense of it.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was amazed and couldn't help but ask respectfully, "Ancestor Li, what just happened?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just some anomalies in heaven and earth caused by a breakthrough. This heaven and earth is incomplete, lacking the Heavenly Dao, which is why it's like this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained casually.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao understood, but was shocked in his heart. How powerful would Xu Yan be after this breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Capable of killing Divine Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Ancestor of the Dao, what realm has Xu Yan broken through to?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was dazed, the name "Heaven and Earth Realm" echoing in his mind. He vaguely understood how extraordinary this realm was.</p><p></p><p>"He's broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly. Xu Yan had broken through to the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

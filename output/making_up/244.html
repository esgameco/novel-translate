        <h1>Chapter 244</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt some regret, even blaming his incompetent son, and the elder of that clan, why did they target this young man in order to curry favor with the Yuashen Sect and the Su family?</p><p></p><p>This has brought such great disaster to the Dai family! Of course, he hated Wen Yong even more. If it weren't for this arrogant wandering cultivator who killed Dai Yingying, would this series of events have happened?</p><p></p><p>In the end, Dai Sheng's face gradually became crazed.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, if he doesn't kill this young man, the Dai family will be doomed!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was cold, and in an instant, like a myriad of swords bursting forth, he attacked Dai Sheng in a torrential wave!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had unleashed the technique of transforming all things into swords after breaking through the Heart Sword Realm!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng roared furiously, his saber light sweeping, countless swords constantly being destroyed, step by step, he charged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>However, the entire Dai family clan land, the houses, grass, and trees all transformed into sharp swords, constantly attacking him, and Dai Sheng's pace of advance was extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>He was even forced to retreat a few steps!</p><p></p><p>The Dai family elders were on the verge of a mental breakdown.</p><p></p><p>And Meng Chong looked up, his heart greatly shaken, is this the most basic sword dao of the Heart Sword Realm? Taking a deep breath, with a loud boom, he smashed open another treasure vault of the Dai family. The Jade Little Dragon rushed in again.</p><p></p><p>The giant golden-armored Meng Chong made the Dai family elders feel utterly hopeless, especially as the grass, bricks, and tiles of the entire Dai family clan land transformed into sharp swords, attacking Dai Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was entangled, unable to break free!</p><p></p><p>"My grandson is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Dai family elders shouted and turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family seems to be doomed!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Dai family elders fled one after another, wanting to preserve some of their own accumulations and join other aristocratic families or sects. The current Dai family seems unable to hold on.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong charged and crashed through, the Dai family ancestral hall becoming a ruin.</p><p></p><p>The treasuries that needed to be found had all been emptied, and he and the Jade Little Dragon had completely absorbed everything in the treasuries.</p><p></p><p>And Dai Sheng had already gone mad, roaring as he constantly attacked Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Dai family clan land was almost completely barren.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of all things into swords had become sparse.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! The Jade Little Dragon flew over and said, "It's almost time, if we drag it on any longer, other powerful experts will arrive!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, his six-zhang golden body shrinking back to his true form, drawing his sword.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon hurriedly crawled into his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, his gaze icy as he looked at Dai Sheng, a powerful aura of the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber constantly coalescing, as if in the heavens and earth, there was only this one sword.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber! The second layer of the Peerless Saber Intent!</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Divine Slash had reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In that instant, Dai Sheng's saber light slowed down, and he was horrified to find that his saber seemed to be out of control.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned back, and that bald and burly young man stood there with his sword raised, as if all the swords in the world were in his hands!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, even he, a Cultivated Spirit Immortal, felt the absurdity of being unable to strike.</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Saber Sovereign Meng Chong, will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong roared and unleashed a slash!</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Divine Slash, unparalleled in its domination, directly slashing at his spiritual soul!</p><p></p><p>The moment Meng Chong struck, Xu Yan also unleashed a sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword manifested without form, and one could not even detect any fierce sword light, yet in that instant, Dai Sheng suddenly let out a miserable scream! His spiritual soul power, while able to resist the Boundless Divine Slash, was unable to withstand Xu Yan's sword at the same time! Whether it was Meng Chong or Xu Yan, when they struck, they attacked the spiritual soul! Especially Xu Yan's sword, after being unleashed, it spread like a parasitic worm along the spiritual soul power, reaching the very core of Dai Sheng's spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Within Dai Sheng's spiritual consciousness, he suddenly saw a violent wind descending, this was the sword intent gale, shredding his spiritual soul, tearing apart his spiritual soul and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain in his spiritual soul caused Dai Sheng to let out a miserable scream, and the control of his saber was instantly lost, all his attacks became ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Flee! He must flee! The strong desire to survive deep in his consciousness made his figure leap into the air, about to escape.</p><p></p><p>This was a self-preservation reaction he had developed after countless battles, when he sensed mortal danger.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Xu Yan teleported, instantly blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng tried to attack, but in his spiritual soul, it was as if an explosion was constantly churning, the excruciating pain made him unable to unleash any attacks.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan slashed out again. "This sword is called the Xun Annihilation Sword, you are the first to die under my newly comprehended Xun Annihilation Sword, and for you, this is also a kind of honor!"</p><p></p><p>The Xun Annihilation Sword of the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers!</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng clutched his head with both hands, in his consciousness, it was as if a sword light was churning, his spiritual soul constantly being torn apart!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck again with another sword.</p><p></p><p>Pu! Dai Sheng's physical body was split in two, the storage bag falling. With a wave of his hand, Xu Yan retrieved the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong slashed over, and in an instant, Dai Sheng's corpse turned to ash! But his spiritual soul was still screaming, slowly disintegrating! Slash! Meng Chong's Boundless Divine Slash tore through his spiritual soul power.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze swept through, not a trace of spiritual soul power remained, completely annihilated! Dai Sheng perished!</p><p></p><p>Originally, with Dai Sheng's strength, even if Xu Yan had comprehended the Xun Annihilation Sword, it would have been difficult to harm his spiritual soul. However, Meng Chong's Boundless Divine Slash had dispersed his spiritual soul's defensive power.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual soul power that had barely withstood the Xun Annihilation Sword, after losing a portion of it, was instantly pierced by Xu Yan's sword into his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Without any spiritual soul defensive techniques, relying solely on spiritual soul power to resist, how could he withstand the divine martial arts that targeted the spiritual soul? Once the spiritual soul was injured, the excruciating pain came.</p><p></p><p>All his responsive abilities had become sluggish.</p><p></p><p>Life and death were already determined!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon swallowed a mouthful of saliva, these two sworn brothers were truly ruthless.</p><p></p><p>They had joined forces to slay Dai Sheng! The Dai family was finished!</p><p></p><p>A renowned second-rate aristocratic family had actually been annihilated just like that!</p><p></p><p>"The situation in Yuzhou is about to change, those third-rate aristocratic families and sects will have to lie low for a while, the days of the wandering cultivators may get a little better." But the Yuashen Sect and the Su family will probably mobilize their forces to try to eliminate Xu Yan as well.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon thought, trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered Xu Yan and Meng Chong's mysterious master, who could just casually slap and kill a Cultivated Spirit Immortal, completely unafraid of the Yuashen Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>The only concern was that it might attract the attention of the top-tier sects and aristocratic families, even the Transcendent Sects, and they might move to eliminate this threatening wandering cultivator, to prevent a repeat of the Blood Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>After slaying Dai Sheng, the Dai family clan land had completely turned into ruins.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dai family members, they had all fled in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The treasuries that could be found had all been emptied, and the other sects and aristocratic families, especially the Yuashen Sect and the Su family's experts, were probably about to arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>If they were surrounded, it would be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong concealed their auras and changed their appearances, instantly disappearing into the night.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after the two left, several figures suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the now desolate Dai family clan land, they were instantly shocked. It had only been a short time, yet the Dai family had already been annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Died?!"</p><p></p><p>"Who destroyed the Dai family?"</p><p></p><p>A cultivated celestial being spoke with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's strength was not weak, at least on par with his own. Since the other party could kill Dai Sheng, could they also kill him? "Is it possible that it was that young man?"</p><p></p><p>Another cultivated celestial being asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Among the several cultivated celestial beings, two of them had particularly gloomy expressions. They were the cultivated celestial beings from the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the two cultivated celestial beings who had learned about Xu Yan's news had ultimately lost their traces and had obviously perished.</p><p></p><p>Now the Dai family, a second-rate aristocratic family, had been destroyed and disappeared from the Jade State in just a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Since the Blood Demon Calamity a million years ago, no aristocratic family had been destroyed. The Dai family was the first aristocratic family to be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cultivated celestial beings present all had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several cultivated celestial beings found the fleeing elder of the Dai family and after questioning him, they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The cultivated celestial beings from the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family were even more terrified!</p><p></p><p>A great hidden danger!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Xu Yan? Where did he come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Dao Peerless Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>"Six-Zhang Golden Armor Giant?"</p><p></p><p>This series of news made the several cultivated celestial beings tremble with fear.</p><p></p><p>Two of them remained silent and quietly left.</p><p></p><p>This matter cannot be interfered with! They doubted their strength was even stronger than Dai Sheng's, and if they were killed, their own families would be completely removed from the ranks of aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>They were only third-rate aristocratic families, after all.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Dai family's destruction quickly spread throughout the martial arts world of the Jade State, like a huge stone thrown into a calm lake, causing ripples.</p><p></p><p>The name of Sword Immortal Xu Yan also spread throughout the martial arts world of the Jade State at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The names of the Six-Zhang Golden Armor Giant and Dao Peerless Meng Chong were also known.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect and the Su family began to discuss how to suppress the hidden danger of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The other spiritual sects and aristocratic families in the Jade State were also evaluating how to face this situation. For those second and third-rate aristocratic families and spiritual sects, the first attitude was naturally not to offend Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>If even the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family could not suppress him, these second and third-rate aristocratic families would be in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this formidable person come from? Could it be that the hidden genius cultivated by our Myriad World Alliance, sent to the Jade State to prepare for the alliance's emergence?"</p><p></p><p>In the secret Jade State headquarters of the Myriad World Alliance, the alliance master exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Too formidable! Reducing a second-rate aristocratic family to a third-rate one was already shocking enough.</p><p></p><p>But in just a short time, this family had been completely wiped out!</p><p></p><p>Slaying the cultivated celestial being Dai Sheng! The left and right protectors of the Jade State division of the Myriad World Alliance also had expressions of shock, saying, "Alliance Master, we must make contact with this Xu Yan, whether or not he is a powerful cultivator secretly trained by our Myriad World Alliance. Since he is a wandering cultivator, he should be on our side.</p><p></p><p>"He has destroyed an aristocratic family and is now at odds with the spiritual sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>"Our Myriad World Alliance is the place where he can establish a foothold. If necessary, we can try to protect him from the powerful cultivators of the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family!"</p><p></p><p>The alliance master took a deep breath and said, "That is natural. However, the one from the Jade Deity Sect is too strong. If he were to take action, I alone might not be his match."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect was the only first-rate spiritual sect in the Jade State, relying on the strength of its Grand Elder, who was at the late stage of Celestial Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The turmoil in the Jade State, we should request a senior from the alliance headquarters to come and stabilize the situation."</p><p></p><p>The left protector said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if the alliance headquarters can dispatch a powerful cultivator."</p><p></p><p>The alliance master nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the southern suburb of the capital city of Zheng, in the courtyard where Fang Hao lived.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Fang Hao's courtyard, there were a pile of failed forging tools scattered around.</p><p></p><p>There were knives, swords, spears, and even puppets.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I forge them?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, with his hair in disarray, was now grabbing his hair with one hand and holding a formation diagram with the other, studying it intently.</p><p></p><p>Three days had already passed.</p><p></p><p>"I may have been forging in the wrong direction. Although these patterns are connected, it is not necessarily required to forge the complete pattern into a single treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Separating them and forging them individually, and then combining them later."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's eyes lit up as he continued to study the formation diagram. "From here, I can see that this part of the pattern can exist independently, and this part can as well.</p><p></p><p>"And this is the core of the pattern."</p><p></p><p>After finding the method, Fang Hao was full of energy again and began forging the treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Knives, swords, and puppets are not suitable. The formation diagram is round, so I'll forge a circular mirror as the treasure."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began forging the first circular mirror.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently watched Fang Hao forge, nodding inwardly. The possibility of Fang Hao forging the formation plate was still very high.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, he was able to distinguish the formation diagram, and was already very close to understanding how to array the formation and how to operate the formation art.</p><p></p><p>"In a few more days, he should be able to get a result!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it took too long and Fang Hao still couldn't forge the formation diagram, it would mean his comprehension and talent were ultimately lacking.</p><p></p><p>Without continuing to watch, Li Xuan turned and returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he sat down.</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Dao Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Fang Hao has already forged the formation plate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan first thought of Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has slain a Great Celestial Being, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Dao Book was all about Meng Chong slaying Great Celestial Beings, and there were several such feedbacks.</p><p></p><p>"What has Meng Chong been doing, that he has killed so many Great Celestial Beings at once?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit confused. Meng Chong couldn't have gone to destroy a certain force, could he?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Golden Dao Book gave another feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Xun Extermination Sword, your Xun Extermination Sword has reached mastery."</p><p></p><p>The Xun Extermination Sword, the sword that slays divine souls!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's Sword Dao of Mountains and Rivers has become even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan and Meng Chong have slain a Celestial Cultivator, you have obtained the second form of the Divine Oblivion!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smacked his lips, they had killed another Celestial Cultivator, although it was a joint effort, it was still quite shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Are they seeking revenge against the Jade Deity Sect or the Su family?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was being pursued by the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family, and this grudge had already been formed. Xu Yan was not the type to swallow his anger, and neither was Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>So it was not impossible that these two master-disciple pairs had joined forces to attack the powerful cultivators of the Jade Deity Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>"No, it must be the Dai family!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly remembered the Dai family. Xu Yan had already killed one Celestial Cultivator of the Dai family, and now they had likely killed the other, Dai Sheng!</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng had pursued Xu Yan before, so he must have been the first target to eliminate.</p><p></p><p>And the Dai family was weak in strength.</p><p></p><p>"They must have destroyed the Dai family!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself. The treasures of an aristocratic family must be extremely abundant, and Xu Yan and Meng Chong must be about to make a big fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Now they won't lack resources, even for Fang Hao's cultivation of the Mysterious Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 66: Xu Yan's Qi and Blood Reach Perfection, Comprehending the Innate Realm Cultivation Method</p><p></p><p>After obtaining his master's permission, Xu Yan returned home once again to teach his parents the martial arts cultivation methods. The foundation of martial arts cultivation naturally starts with sensing the Qi and Blood, and then refining the skin.</p><p></p><p>For this purpose, he deliberately brought back a nine-leaf primordial spirit herb to assist his parents in their cultivation, to help them sense the Qi and Blood.</p><p></p><p>The core protectors of the Xu family currently are Physician Pan and over a dozen elite guards that can be considered elite warriors. These were all secretly cultivated by Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan possesses the strength of a top martial arts master in the jianghu. The remaining dozen-plus guards are all first-class experts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Physician Pan can also refine and concoct nourishing medicines.</p><p></p><p>Since they are core members of the Xu family, Xu Yan also taught them the martial arts methods. Whether they can successfully cultivate and possess the talent is up to their own destiny.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan only taught them the methods of refining the skin, bones, and internal organs, and did not pass on the Qi and Blood Realm cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood Realm is too distant from them.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Eastern River Prefecture, Xu Yan set out for the capital city again to pass on the cultivation methods to his uncle, cousins, and others.</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, Li Xuan was leisurely sitting in a chair.</p><p></p><p>As always, Meng Chong was diligently cultivating, and with the cultivation, his physical body became increasingly strong, his bones already refined to the level of iron bones.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er also came to the door every day to cook, clean, and do other miscellaneous tasks. He was a capable errand runner, so Li Xuan decided to teach him the martial arts skin refining method.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was already a top-tier expert in the jianghu. If he had the talent for martial arts, sensed the Qi and Blood, and refined his skin, his strength would increase significantly, and the speed of completing the skin refinement would not be too slow.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, come over here!" Li Xuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what are your instructions?" Shi Er hurried over and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"You are a clever and diligent person. Well then, I am going out into the world, and I lack an errand runner and someone to do miscellaneous tasks. Are you willing?" Li Xuan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing, I am willing, this is the greatest opportunity for me!" Shi Er exclaimed excitedly, kneeling on the ground with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, pay respects to the master!" he said.</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may rise," Li Xuan nodded and said, "Then I shall impart to you the introductory martial arts method. Whether you can enter the path, depends on your own talent and destiny."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, master!" Shi Er's heart was pounding rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he also had the opportunity to become a martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of martial arts cultivation lies in sensing the Qi and Blood, and then refining the skin. Today, I will teach you the skin refining method. Whether you can enter the path, depends on your own talent and destiny," Li Xuan imparted the martial arts skin refining method to Shi Er. As for the subsequent bone and internal organ refinement, he would teach them after Shi Er could sense the Qi and Blood and complete the skin refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master!" Shi Er was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Go cultivate on your own. Find a room in the courtyard to stay in," Li Xuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Since Shi Er had become a servant, he naturally had to live in the courtyard and be responsible for all the miscellaneous tasks.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Shi Er respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the capital city of the Qi Kingdom, due to Xu Yan's arrival again, the Qi Emperor and his ministers became extremely cautious, as if a huge mountain was hanging over their heads. This suffocating feeling made the Qi Emperor and his ministers even more determined to find a martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>Only by finding a martial arts expert could they remove the mountain hanging over their heads.</p><p></p><p>After imparting the martial arts cultivation methods, Xu Yan did not immediately return to the Eastern River Prefecture, but instead temporarily stayed at the Qi Prince's mansion.</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to break through to the perfection of Qi and Blood," the cultivating Xu Yan was greatly excited. He was only a step away from reaching the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I have almost comprehended the Innate Realm cultivation method. After reaching the perfection of Qi and Blood, it won't be long before I can fully comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After reaching the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, he was one step closer to the second cultivation realm - the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"After the Qi and Blood Realm is fully cultivated, I must strive to complete it within a month."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set this goal for himself.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood surged, growing increasingly powerful. His jade-like bones seemed to radiate with a brilliant luster. The Qi and Blood became increasingly refined and abundant, and the realm of the hundred-zhang Qi and Blood was now within reach.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the Qi and Blood seemed to cross a great divide and suddenly surged, with the Qi and Blood becoming even purer, a towering scarlet dragon of Qi and Blood soaring up to a height of a hundred zhang.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the hundred-zhang Qi and Blood that had surged up transformed into a gigantic scarlet dragon, rising up into the sky like a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's breakthrough caused quite a commotion, alarming Guo Rongshan and the others. Seeing the hundred-zhang dragon rise from Xu Yan's courtyard, they were utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Yan'er's strength has increased again?"</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful!" </p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan and his son were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Kingdom's palace was not far from the Qi Wang Mansion. At that moment, the Qi Emperor looked towards the Qi Wang Mansion, feeling deeply unsettled. Was Xu Yan flaunting his martial prowess?</p><p></p><p>No! </p><p></p><p>His strength had increased?</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the Qi Emperor felt a sense of urgency and knew he must quickly find a martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>In the Crown Prince's Eastern Palace, the Third Prince excitedly ordered, "Quickly, prepare gifts, I must go pay my respects to my revered teacher!"</p><p></p><p>The officials were all shaken, and they immediately drove out the wastrels from their families to seek out martial arts experts.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince could no longer sit still, and on that very day, he led his guards and left the capital to personally seek out martial arts experts.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the capital of the Qi Kingdom was once again in an uproar, with a fervent search for martial arts experts.</p><p></p><p>As for the instigator, Xu Yan, he was immersed in the joy of his breakthrough, feeling the enhancement of his own strength. Only after this breakthrough did he truly appreciate the greatness of his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"When my teacher previously demonstrated the manifestation of the Qi and Blood Realm's peak, that grand and majestic aura, that boundless Qi and Blood, was far stronger than mine now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt somewhat ashamed: "I am still too weak. Even after cultivating the Jade Bones, I am still far behind."</p><p></p><p>His teacher's realm was unfathomable, but the manifestation of the Qi and Blood Realm's peak that he had shown Xu Yan must have been the state of his teacher's own Qi and Blood Realm at that time. Compared to that, Xu Yan still had a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my teacher has always admonished me to be humble and not arrogant. My strength is still not enough."</p><p></p><p>The more he pondered, the more he felt the greatness of his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Although I am not as strong as my teacher, I am certainly no weaker than the ancient geniuses, and may even be stronger. I need not be overly self-deprecating!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan encouraged himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His teacher was like an insurmountable mountain, but as long as he had this belief, he could steadily approach his teacher's heights, and perhaps one day, stand shoulder to shoulder with him.</p><p></p><p>Reining in his Qi and Blood, Xu Yan let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi and Blood Realm is complete, and the cultivation method of the Innate Realm is becoming increasingly clear to me."</p><p></p><p>Entering his room, Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the bed, exhaling deeply. His mind gradually calmed, entering a state of transcendence.</p><p></p><p>The profoundly mysterious insights gradually emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method of the Innate Realm was becoming increasingly clear, like a thread slowly connecting the various aspects together.</p><p></p><p>How to open the Heaven and Earth Bridge, how to refine the Qi and Blood into Innate True Qi, how to absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, and how to establish the Dantian Sea of Qi... </p><p></p><p>The cultivation method became increasingly clear, and the scenes of breaking through the Innate Realm seemed to emerge in his mind - how to absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Open the Heaven and Earth Bridge, sense the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, guide the spiritual energy into the Heaven and Earth Bridge, and establish the Dantian Sea of Qi..."</p><p></p><p>An excited expression appeared on Xu Yan's face.</p><p></p><p>The more he contemplated, the more complete the Innate Realm cultivation method became. The sequence of the breakthrough, the process of cultivation... one by one, they emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally comprehended the cultivation method of the Innate Realm. As long as the Qi and Blood Realm is fully cultivated, I can begin to break through to the Innate Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

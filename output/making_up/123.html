        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 123: Xu Yan: I am Xie Lingfeng</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood proudly with his sword, looking at the slightly disheveled Yin Hong in the distance. He sighed inwardly, "A half-step Grand Master, indeed! He even managed to dodge that."</p><p></p><p>"A half-step Grand Master, is that all?" Xu Yan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Du Yuying and the others heaved a sigh of relief. Although they couldn't achieve victory, they had managed to withstand Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's face was gloomy and dark. He had one hand behind his back, trembling slightly. In that moment just now, he had almost died!</p><p></p><p>That sword strike was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Young man, who are you? You must think carefully before getting involved in this matter. Can you bear the consequences?" Yin Hong said ominously.</p><p></p><p>He knew that continuing the battle would not lead to victory. In fact, he might even end up in a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and said, "What, are you trying to threaten me?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong sneered and looked at the approaching Du Yuying and the others. "The Du family is too deeply involved in this matter. Even Grand Masters don't dare to get involved easily."</p><p></p><p>"You have obstructed me from taking the Du girl. You have offended the influential person behind me. You must think carefully about the consequences. Someone will come to settle the score with you," Yin Hong said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying frowned slightly and said softly, "Young master, don't worry. My Du family will resolve this matter for you."</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong sneered, "Young man, do you think you can rely on the Du family? Being a protector is not that easy. The influential person behind me, the Du family cannot handle them!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying furrowed her brows. For Yin Hong, a half-step Grand Master, to mention an influential person, it was clear that the person behind the scenes was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but be suspicious. Yin Hong and the mastermind behind the attack on her were obviously not the same person.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, muttering to himself, "I'm just trying to earn some spirit stones and spirit herbs. How hard can that be? The person behind this guy is obviously not simple. If they want to cause me trouble, I'll have to be careful wherever I go. There might even be a Grand Master coming after me."</p><p></p><p>He needed to earn the spirit stones and spirit herbs, and he had already escorted Du Yuying here. After a fierce battle, how could he back down now?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he retreated, the other side would not let him off.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you don't need to worry. You can rest at my Du family for a while. After this storm blows over, I guarantee no one will involve you in this matter," Du Yuying said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was not interested. He was here to explore the inner realm, not to ally with any particular force.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong further threatened, "Young man, this matter involves too many people. Although your strength is not weak, I advise you to withdraw. If you insist on getting involved, you will be making an enemy of the influential person behind me. Think carefully about the consequences."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "Threaten me? Are you worthy of that? Is the influential person behind you worthy?"</p><p></p><p>A half-step Grand Master in the Dao of Martial Arts could not directly break through to the Grand Master realm. He must be a waste. How dare he threaten him? Who gave him the courage?</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Xu Yan thrust out his sword, and the mountains and rivers appeared, the dragon's roar resounding.</p><p></p><p>This was the sword dao he had just comprehended - the Mountains and Rivers, Dragon's Roar!</p><p></p><p>Such a good opponent to refine his sword dao, how could Xu Yan let him go?</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's expression changed drastically. He knew the terrifying power of this sword strike. With his folding fan in hand, he unleashed wave after wave of surging tidal forces, while also inwardly gathering his spiritual focus to resist the dreadful influence of the dragon's roar.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the moment the dragon's roar sounded, he felt as if he was being drawn into a world of mountains and rivers, as if he was about to be buried in them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Yin Hong roared angrily, constantly unleashing his full power, the surging tides rolling, allowing him to break free from the mountains and rivers and quickly retreat.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>His robe was slashed open on the chest, and he was furious and alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to threaten me? A half-baked thing, who gave you the courage?" Xu Yan struck out with sword after sword.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar sounded continuously, the mountains and rivers constantly appearing, relentlessly attacking Yin Hong, who was forced to dodge and evade, disheveled and in disarray. His purple robe was almost reduced to rags, and there were fine blood traces on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still a half-step Grand Master. Although he was in a sorry state, he had not suffered any fatal injuries.</p><p></p><p>"I can't continue like this. This young man's sword technique is bizarre, and it seems to be getting stronger the more we fight. If I'm not careful, I might end up falling at his hands!" Yin Hong's heart was filled with trepidation, and he had already developed the intention to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the others were deeply shaken. What kind of sword technique was this, so powerful and seemingly containing some profound celestial mystery, forcing Yin Hong, a half-step Grand Master, into such a sorry state?</p><p></p><p>This was a half-step Grand Master, a terrifying existence far surpassing ordinary Sect Masters. And Yin Hong was said to be one of the best among the half-step Grand Masters, a figure that ordinary Grand Masters could not easily defeat.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, he had lost his elegant demeanor, his hair disheveled, his purple robe reduced to rags hanging on his body, with criss-crossing blood traces visible. Although the wounds were not deep, just shallow blood traces, it was enough to see how perilous Yin Hong's situation was.</p><p></p><p>If he was even slightly careless, he might fall right then and there.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, amazed at Yin Hong, "This guy is really strong. I can't seem to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>After this fierce battle, Xu Yan now knew his current strength level within the inner realm. He was stronger than a half-step Grand Master, but weaker than a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>However, to kill a powerful half-step Grand Master like Yin Hong was not an easy task!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong suddenly unleashed a powerful strike, explosively retreating to put distance between them, ready to flee at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, since you insist on getting involved in this matter, from now on, there will be no place for you in this Great Yue Kingdom, or even in the martial arts world of the inner realm. Anyone who dares to disrupt the plans of the influential person behind me will die without exception, even if you are a Grand Master!" Yin Hong said with a gloomy face, bringing up the influential person behind him as a threat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. The influential person behind Yin Hong must be of extraordinary identity, otherwise he would not have said such words.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a half-baked thing can only rely on his background to scare people. What a waste. The 'influential person' in your eyes, what is that to me? Does he have the qualifications to threaten me?" Xu Yan sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" Yin Hong laughed angrily. "Since you are so arrogant and do not take the influential person behind me seriously, dare you reveal your name?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was proud and disdainful as he looked at Yin Hong. "Why wouldn't I dare?"</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he was pondering, "Brother Xie did say that in the inner realm, I can use his name to resolve any issues. The Sword Sovereign Cliff must be a top power in the inner realm. Can the influential person behind this guy be stronger than the Sword Sovereign Cliff? We'll see how useful Brother Xie's name is this time. I hope he wasn't just boasting."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not afraid of the influential person behind Yin Hong. He just didn't want this to interfere with his initial goals of earning spirit stones and collecting spirit herbs, which were his top priorities upon entering the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he had achieved his foundation and even broken through to the Profound Realm, he would not fear provoking these major powers.</p><p></p><p>But for now, it was not the right time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sheathed his sword, crossing his arms in front of his chest with a cold and arrogant expression. "Listen carefully. I am..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I won't change my name or alter my surname. I am Xie Lingfeng!" </p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's eyes widened as he stared at him intently!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's small mouth slightly parted, her expression one of surprise, with a hint of delight in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er covered her mouth, her eyes wide open, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's going on? What's wrong with them?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>How come upon hearing Xie Lingfeng's name, they all reacted so unusually?</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Yin Hong took a deep breath, calmed himself, and said solemnly with a cupped fist salute, "So it's Senior Xie Lingfeng of Jianxun Cliff. Since Brother Xie of Jianxun Cliff is involved in this matter, the noble person behind me will withdraw from this affair. I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt Xu Yan's words. The intense battle just now had already left him astonished by Xu Yan's sword prowess.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng of Jianxun Cliff was renowned as one of the three youngest grand masters in the inner realm, and the number one among the younger generation in the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>He had the reputation of being the first genius of Jianxun Cliff in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Such formidable strength was worthy of his renowned name!</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Lingfeng was involved, the Du family's matter would certainly be dropped.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong thought to himself, fully aware that his mysterious backer would not incur the enmity of Xie Lingfeng over Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Du Yuying, he inwardly praised, "This woman's beauty is unparalleled, and it is rumored that she has a special constitution, which has even drawn Xie Lingfeng to act on her behalf. What a remarkable Du Yuying!"</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Yin Hong swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was astonished. Xie Lingfeng's reputation was so effective?</p><p></p><p>He was delighted, "Brother Xie didn't lie to me. No matter what happens, as long as I mention his name, it can be resolved. Even this fellow, upon hearing Brother Xie's name, didn't dare to say a harsh word.</p><p></p><p>"He even directly stated that his mysterious backer would no longer interfere in this matter."</p><p></p><p>Watching Yin Hong's retreating figure, Xu Yan muttered to himself, "Wait until I reach the peak of my cultivation, then I'll go and crush you!"</p><p></p><p>"So it's you, Young Master Xie!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's expression was somewhat complex, yet also filled with delight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she recalled many things.</p><p></p><p>The encounter with Xu Yan in Iron Mountain County, "Young Master Xie came for me. That was merely to catch my attention. His need for spirit stones and spirit herbs was just an excuse, a pretext. His true purpose was to escort me back.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Young Master Xie... ?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of a certain possibility, Du Yuying's heart started racing.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er and Yan Kuan also couldn't help but ponder in a certain direction. Could it be that the genius of Jianxun Cliff, Xie Lingfeng, was infatuated with the young miss and deliberately approached her?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cleared his throat and said, "Miss Du, don't forget about the spirit herbs. And look, as soon as I mentioned my name, it seems I've helped resolve some of your family's troubles. Isn't that the case?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xie, Yuying understands. The spirit stones and spirit herbs will not be lacking at all," Du Yuying said softly.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, that's good. Let's hurry on our way then," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This woman's attitude seems a bit off. She just took the spirit herbs and wants to leave!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just by mentioning Xie Lingfeng's name, he had inadvertently helped the Du family resolve a certain matter. He couldn't let this go without any compensation.</p><p></p><p>"I can't just use Brother Xie's name for free."</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan reminded her again, "Miss Du, the troubles your Du family faced seem to have been resolved by me just now. As for the reward..."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying gently gave him a look and said softly, "Yuying will prepare a generous gift to express her gratitude to the Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan heard this and nodded, "Good, good. You can send that generous gift to Brother Xie at Jianxun Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>"Yuying understands!" Du Yuying pouted at him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback, pondering, "This woman, has she misunderstood something? Nevermind, I don't care. As long as the generous gift is sent to Brother Xie."</p><p></p><p>He, Xu Yan, was a man who valued propriety.</p><p></p><p>Since Brother Xie had been so righteous, promising that he could use his name to resolve any issues in the inner realm, and it was because of using his name that he had helped someone, the generous gift of gratitude naturally shouldn't be kept by himself.</p><p></p><p>"When Brother Xie receives this generous gift, he should know that I've arrived in the inner realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying continued on the journey back. Along the way, she poked her head out of the carriage and said, "Young Master Xie, how about coming inside for a chat?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, seeing her beautiful features and gentle demeanor, was instantly energized, but quickly shook his head, "No need, the carriage is too small, it's not convenient!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt a tightness in his heart, "Oh no, my state of mind has become a bit unstable. Just now, I almost got distracted by external things. It must be because my sword dao has progressed too much, and my state of mind hasn't caught up yet.</p><p></p><p>"I must find a place to continue cultivating my state of mind!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Du Yuying could only let it go.</p><p></p><p>The group arrived at a large city. The masters from the city had just gone out to provide aid, and upon seeing Du Yuying's return, they heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"This city is far beyond what Iron Mountain County can compare to!" </p><p></p><p>After entering the city, Xu Yan exclaimed in amazement, then became excited.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he had earned quite a few spirit stones, and even had a good number of seventh-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>The group arrived at the Tianbao Pavilion in the city.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying got off the carriage, and a manager of the Tianbao Pavilion came out to welcome her, "Miss Du, welcome!"</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er," Du Yuying said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss," Cui'er stepped forward and handed a list to the Tianbao Pavilion manager.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit herbs, do you have them all? And issue a spirit token for 10,000 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion manager looked at the list, glanced at Du Yuying with a hint of doubt, and hesitantly said, "Miss Du, these seventh-grade spirit herbs are quite valuable. Are you sure you can afford them?"</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you don't need to worry. Since I, Du Yuying, dared to place this order, I naturally can afford it," Du Yuying said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, please wait a moment," the manager turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Yan spoke up, "Manager, do you have any storage bags here?"</p><p></p><p>He was most eager to get his hands on a storage bag, a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>The manager looked at Xu Yan with surprise. What kind of person was this young man, openly asking for a storage bag?</p><p></p><p>Even for the Du family, not to mention whether they could afford it, just the thought of buying one would be a tremendous expense!</p><p></p><p>"Our branch here does not have any storage bags, but if the young master wishes to purchase one, we can arrange to have it brought in," the manager replied.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression fell, disappointed that he couldn't even take a look at one. Since he wouldn't be staying here long, just getting the reward and leaving, he could only shake his head and say, "Never mind then."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying secretly glanced at him, her heart stirring with certain thoughts, "Young Master Xie seems to really like storage bags. Well, who wouldn't desire such a precious treasure?</p><p></p><p>"Especially for Young Master Xie, an unparalleled genius under heaven!</p><p></p><p>"Even if Jianxun Cliff has storage bags, they are in the hands of grand masters and already claimed. And Jianxun Cliff's rules probably mean that to obtain a storage bag, one can only rely on one's own efforts.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to procure a storage bag for Young Master Xie..."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed inwardly, realizing that obtaining a storage bag would be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

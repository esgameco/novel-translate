            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 98 The Virtuous and Graceful Celestial Mother</p><p></p><p>On the big pit, the young girl excitedly buried the soil into the pit, while below the pit, Zheng the Wealthy was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>By burying someone, they would never commit evil again?</p><p></p><p>This was going to bury him alive!</p><p></p><p>He had also occasionally heard the legend that the Celestial Mother of the Celestial Mother Sect would persuade the evil ones, and they would never commit evil again.</p><p></p><p>So this was the way of persuasion?</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Mother, please spare me, I will truly never commit evil again, I swear!" </p><p></p><p>"You have to believe me, I am willing... willing to castrate myself as an oath, and never commit evil again!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy made up his mind resolutely.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing more important than one's own life.</p><p></p><p>Even if he became a eunuch, it would be better than death!</p><p></p><p>The young girl was surprised, she had buried so many people, but Zheng the Wealthy was the first one who was willing to make such a determination, to castrate himself to show his sincerity!</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>She stopped burying the soil!</p><p></p><p>"It's true!" Zheng the Wealthy gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, the Celestial Mother will believe you this once!"</p><p></p><p>The young girl thought for a while, gritted her silver teeth, and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up then!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy's lips trembled, his face turned pale, and his forehead was covered in cold sweat, but in order to save his life, he could only resort to this tactic.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit regretful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he had known it would be like this, he should have cut off a finger as an oath!</p><p></p><p>"I... I don't have a knife!"</p><p></p><p>"Auntie Zhou, give him one."</p><p></p><p>The young girl spoke.</p><p></p><p>The stout and burly woman threw a dagger down.</p><p></p><p>"You'd better do it quickly, remember not to let the blood spurt out, use your pants to cover it, otherwise you'll lose too much blood and I won't be able to save you!"</p><p></p><p>The young girl reminded him while facing away from the pit.</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy almost cried, silently cursing, "You're really merciful, aren't you!"</p><p></p><p>His hand holding the dagger trembled, and he suddenly realized that due to the medicine he had taken, his hot blood was concentrated, and with this one stab...</p><p></p><p>He dared not imagine it!</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou said in a muffled voice.</p><p></p><p>"Coming, just coming!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy trembled as he reached into his pants, the cold dagger touching the area, but he still couldn't bring himself to do it, about to beg for mercy and offer his hand instead.</p><p></p><p>But Auntie Zhou kicked a stone, which shot out and hit his elbow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a "pop" sound!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah..."</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy let out a miserable scream, his hand coming out of his pants, clutching something.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the scream, the young girl exclaimed excitedly, "Auntie Zhou, throw that thing of his out to feed the dogs, I've heard that without the root, he'll die as a crippled ghost, and this is his own doing to become crippled."</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou waved her hand, a thread flew out and snatched the thing from Zheng the Wealthy's hand, flinging it out the window.</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events startled Zheng the Wealthy, and he even forgot to scream.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, may you not have a good death, you tricked me..."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Zheng the Wealthy started cursing bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The young girl swung the iron shovel, quickly burying soil into the pit, her skilled movements showing she had done this many times before.</p><p></p><p>The soil splashed onto Zheng the Wealthy's face and mouth, blocking his cries.</p><p></p><p>However, one could still see the blood staining the soil that was poured down.</p><p></p><p>The soil on the big pit became less and less, until in the end, Zheng the Wealthy only had a weak moan, the soil already covering most of his body, only his head exposed.</p><p></p><p>"You... you won't have a good death!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng the Wealthy had become weak and powerless.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, today the Celestial Mother has persuaded another evil one to never commit evil again."</p><p></p><p>The young girl smiled coquettishly, diligently filling the soil.</p><p></p><p>The big pit was filled, and Zheng the Wealthy was buried alive underneath.</p><p></p><p>The young girl held the iron shovel, jumped up, and stomped the soil a few times to pack it down firmly!</p><p></p><p>"The evil ones persuaded by the Celestial Mother never commit evil again, how could you be an exception?"</p><p></p><p>After burying Zheng the Wealthy alive, the young girl picked up the iron shovel and left, Auntie Zhou following her with a helpless expression. Zheng the Wealthy's steward had a fawning look on his face and said, "Celestial Mother, everything has been done as you instructed, can you spare me?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I can." </p><p></p><p>The young girl nodded.</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou skillfully took out a thin mask and put it on the steward, instantly transforming him into Zheng the Wealthy's appearance, instructing, "As for what to do next, you don't need me to say more, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I will definitely carry it out." </p><p></p><p>The steward nodded and bowed, wearing Zheng the Wealthy's clothes and impersonating him. In front of the county government office, he knelt down and kowtowed, calling for the Celestial Mother's mercy, swearing he would never commit evil again.</p><p></p><p>He was willing to exhaust his family's wealth, go to the mountains and seclude himself to atone for his sins!</p><p></p><p>The people of the county were all dumbfounded, even the county magistrate was stunned. The mysterious Celestial Mother of the Celestial Mother Sect had found Zheng the Wealthy?</p><p></p><p>And Zheng the Wealthy really stopped committing evil?</p><p></p><p>Under the unbelieving gaze of the county's people, Zheng the Wealthy truly did exhaust his wealth to aid the poor, and with utmost piety, he atoned for his sins, kowtowing step by step, and then left the county city.</p><p></p><p>He said he would go to the mountains to meditate and repent for his crimes!</p><p></p><p>The steward climbed up to the middle of the mountain, seeing no one behind him, finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>His life was saved!</p><p></p><p>But as he looked up, he saw a big pit dug on the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>The stout and burly Auntie Zhou grabbed him with one hand and threw him into the pit.</p><p></p><p>The steward was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The young girl swung the iron shovel, burying soil into the pit with a grunt.</p><p></p><p>"Please spare me, Celestial Mother, didn't you promise to spare me?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl nodded and said, "Yes, the Celestial Mother promised to spare you, what does that have to do with me, Su Lingxiu?"</p><p></p><p>"You are the Celestial Mother!"</p><p></p><p>"I was just now, but not anymore."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued burying the soil as the steward cursed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"You are Zheng the Wealthy's steward, you have committed countless evils, if I don't bury you, how will you not commit evil next time?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Her movements were skilled, and she soon buried the steward. She jumped up and stomped the soil a few times to pack it down firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, where are we going next?"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"To Yunshan County, I heard there's a powerful cultivator there. Hehe, I want to see if that so-called powerful cultivator can match me, Su Lingxiu, or Auntie Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, why did you originally become the Celestial Mother of the Celestial Mother Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou had always wondered about this.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu smiled and said, "The people of the Celestial Mother Sect have good connections and can get a lot of medicinal materials, it's just a title, and I can also utilize their strength. What's wrong with that?</p><p></p><p>"That Kou Ruozhi fellow actually has some skills, he's managed to raise the Celestial Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>"This time going to the Qi State, I'll see if he's done any evil deeds, if he has committed any outrageous acts, I'll bury him too!"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou persuaded, "Miss, you have punished many evil people already, there are endless evil people in this world, you don't have to be too kind, or you might end up getting hurt."</p><p></p><p>"Auntie Zhou, don't worry, I know what I'm doing. This place is too boring to cultivate, I have to find some things to entertain myself."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shouldered the iron shovel and headed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Auntie Zhou sighed inwardly and quietly followed, as long as she was there, her young mistress's antics would not lead to any real danger.</p><p></p><p>In the South River County, the news of the Celestial Mother persuading Zheng the Wealthy to reform and never commit evil again spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The Celestial Mother...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mother went to persuade Master Zheng yesterday not to do evil, and Master Zheng today has dispersed all his family wealth and gone to the mountains to atone for his sins."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother is so merciful!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother's disciples were as excited as if they had been injected with chicken blood, and began to spread the Heavenly Mother's mercy and sacredness.</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity to develop believers.</p><p></p><p>As for how the Heavenly Mother persuaded Master Zheng to never do evil again, </p><p></p><p>no one knew!</p><p></p><p>All they knew was that anyone the Heavenly Mother had persuaded would never do evil again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heard the news from Shi Er about what happened in Nanhe County.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother is truly merciful. She persuaded Master Zheng of Nanhe County to never do evil again, and he even dispersed all his family wealth, went to the mountains to repent, and atoned for his sins."</p><p></p><p>Is this really so miraculous?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became interested. What special ability did that little girl have that could make an evil person never do evil again? </p><p></p><p>And that Master Zheng even dispersed all his family wealth to benefit the people of the county. </p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"How did she persuade him?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er thought for a moment and said, "I heard that the Heavenly Mother, with great compassion and sacred radiance, spoke of the suffering of the common people, and persuaded him to do good and abandon evil..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked doubtful. </p><p></p><p>This was more mysterious than the cultivation methods he had made up.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure that's how it happened?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er scratched his head and said, "That's how it's told in the sect. It shouldn't be false, after all, the evil people the Heavenly Mother has persuaded are not just one or two."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about it, and it did seem to make sense.</p><p></p><p>Could that little girl have the ability to captivate people's hearts?</p><p></p><p>"Where is that little girl now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wanted to see that little girl.</p><p></p><p>"It seems she is on her way to Qiguo?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er said, not very sure.</p><p></p><p>Often, even the high-level members of the Heavenly Mother Sect couldn't keep track of the Heavenly Mother's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. That little girl would most likely come to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu arrived in Yunshan County and directly entered the county yamen.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate and the old man in a hemp robe hurriedly prostrated themselves in salutation.</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully welcome the Heavenly Mother's arrival!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu sat down in the chair, with a solemn expression, and tapped the county magistrate's head with the iron shovel in her hand, asking, "Have you been corrupt? Have you oppressed the common people? Have you exploited the people's resources?"</p><p></p><p>"I report to the Heavenly Mother, no! The people under my jurisdiction are living in peace and prosperity!"</p><p></p><p>The Yunshan County magistrate was almost sweating bullets. Although the Heavenly Mother was just a young girl, the person beside her was formidable.</p><p></p><p>"If you dare to lie to me, I'll bury you!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I wouldn't dare!" </p><p></p><p>The county magistrate heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there is a renowned person here who wants to see our Heavenly Mother?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, he resides in Yunshan County. He is a true master!"</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'll go take a look. If it's fake, I'll bury him!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu picked up the iron shovel and headed towards Li Xuan's residence, with Zhou Shi following her.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate and the others exchanged glances. It seemed the Heavenly Mother might clash with the master.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to go watch, afraid of being implicated if they angered the master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not yet returned to the Qiguo capital.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan had encountered the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect, the little girl who could make evil people never do evil again.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the beautiful young girl in a white dress, holding an iron shovel, and the burly woman beside her, Li Xuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The girl's appearance was quite different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>She shouldn't look solemn and dignified, exuding the lofty and merciful air of the Heavenly Mother, right?</p><p></p><p>What's with the iron shovel?</p><p></p><p>And the robust woman beside her was clearly a martial artist! </p><p></p><p>There were no martial artists in the borderlands, the only explanation was that these two came from the central domain!</p><p></p><p>"This is a Fourth-Grade Martial Artist? In the borderlands, that would be an invincible existence. And this little girl is also a martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>"But she's only at the Seventh-Grade, which is already beyond the peak experts of the borderlands."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered while looking at the two.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was carefully observing the situation next to them, the Heavenly Mother seemed to have come with ill intent just now.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu stared at Li Xuan, greatly shocked in her heart. This is a master? </p><p></p><p>The young man in front of her gave her a sense of unfathomable depth and towering presence, and for a moment, she hesitated and did not make any reckless moves.</p><p></p><p>And beside her, Zhou Shi's muscles were tense, and sweat was beading on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Grand Master? No! Impossible, even a Grand Master wouldn't have this kind of unfathomable aura!"</p><p></p><p>She was in a state of turmoil in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The master of Yunshan County is actually a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>She even had a terrible guess: "Could it be that those people have tracked him down to the borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"No, impossible, how could they come to the borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan played with the jade talisman in his hand and chuckled, "Little girl, are you the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded and said, "Yes, it's me. You are..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked curiously, "I've heard that the evil people you've persuaded never do evil again. How did you persuade them?"</p><p></p><p>That's why he was so interested in this little girl.</p><p></p><p>Now that he's met her, he couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu smiled mischievously and waved the iron shovel in her hand, "It's very simple, I bury them, and then they will never do evil again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was dumbfounded. That's it? </p><p></p><p>Once a person is dead, they naturally won't do evil anymore.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er beside him opened his mouth, with a look of utter disbelief on his face.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and profound method that was being spread around was actually this simple?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Shi Er, and knew that this guy also didn't know the real truth.</p><p></p><p>"That's it?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu looked at him strangely and said, "Yes, that's it. Dig a hole, bury them, and they'll never do evil again. How can a dead person still do evil?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Damn, this is just a case of misinformation and exaggeration. Such a simple thing has been made to sound so mysterious and profound!</p><p></p><p>It made him curious for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the rumors about the girl's medical skills are also just hearsay?</p><p></p><p>"What about your medical skills? Are they also just hearsay?"</p><p></p><p>Judging from the girl's lively and cheerful personality, she didn't seem like the type who could focus on studying medicine.</p><p></p><p>He would have to look for another candidate for his third disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The medical skills are real. I started learning medicine at the age of four, and now at seventeen, my medical skills have reached the pinnacle. There's no one in Qiguo or Wuguo who can match me."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the medical skills were not just hearsay?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became more interested and asked, "Little girl, what's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Suling Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Shi's state was not right, this was unprecedented. The person in front of them must be an extremely powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flying ship passed by a large mountain. The formation sensed treasures and extracted them from the mountain. The process of extracting treasures naturally caused quite a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle suddenly discovered a group of martial artists darting out from both sides of the mountain, all moving to intercept the flying ship's path.</p><p></p><p>Among those who made a move, there was one Realm Lord level expert! The three cultivating individuals including Xu Yan, as well as Fang Hao who was studying artifact refining and formations, instantly erupted with energy and raised their hands to block the attack.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, all four of them had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"People from the Immutable Divine Temple?" Xu Yan said with slight surprise. </p><p></p><p>Besides the Immutable Divine Temple, he couldn't think of any other forces that would be in this area.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this team was led by three Realm Lord level experts, with the rest at Supreme Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>"They've come for the Hongze World!" Canghai Turtle said gravely.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of an Immutable Divine Temple team in this area could only be for the purpose of finding the Hongze World, there was no other reason.</p><p></p><p>"Living beings of a world!" The Immutable Divine Temple experts' voices were somewhat excited as they sensed the aura on the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Capture them and bring them back, there will surely be a great reward!" A Realm Lord level expert waved his hand and ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Three Realm Lords, this is troublesome. Even if we join forces, we can't defeat them!" Fang Hao said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>Although these three Realm Lords were weaker than Blood Madness, there were still three of them. With their current strength, it was impossible to kill them by joining forces.</p><p></p><p>If there was only one Realm Lord, they could certainly kill him. But facing three Realm Lords, they could only avoid their sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>"We can't kill the Realm Lords, but the rest are no match for us!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Immutable Divine Temple people wanted to surround and capture them as soon as they discovered they were living beings of a world showed that there was indeed an irreconcilable conflict with the Immutable Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, avoid the Realm Lords!" Xu Yan raised his hand and pointed, and sword light instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant blue light radiated from Canghai Turtle's body, enveloping the flying ship. With his defensive power, he could resist the attacks of three Realm Lords and keep the ship undamaged.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan made his move, Meng Chong and the other two also attacked. Their targets were naturally the other Immutable Divine Temple beings besides the three Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>How could the Immutable Divine Temple beings with strength comparable to the Supreme Realm withstand the attacks of Xu Yan and the other three? In an instant, one after another was slain.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" A leading Realm Lord expert of the Immutable Divine Temple was furious and suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Canghai Turtle controlled the flying ship to quickly dodge the opponent while covering the entire ship with his defense to block the attack.</p><p></p><p>After being improved by Fang Hao, the flying ship's speed had increased significantly and become much more agile. It charged left and right within the Immutable Divine Temple's encirclement, always avoiding the three Realm Lord level experts.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the flying ship went, one Immutable Divine Temple person after another fell!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the three Realm Lords of the Immutable Divine Temple joined forces to unleash an attack, forming a dark light ring that contracted from all directions, attempting to trap the flying ship within it.</p><p></p><p>"Teleport out!" Xu Yan said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>This light ring deployed by the Immutable Divine Temple was based on immutable qi, condensed into form. Once trapped inside, it would be impossible to break out for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The flying ship suddenly activated its teleportation formation. Before the light ring could fully surround it, the ship shook once and instantly flew out through a gap as the ring was closing.</p><p></p><p>"The Immutable Divine Temple, living in the Immutable Realm, has already developed powerful techniques by cultivating immutable qi," Xu Yan said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"We discovered during the previous great battle that the Immutable Divine Temple's offensive techniques all have characteristics of immutable qi, but they didn't have any particularly outstanding power. That joint sealing technique we just saw, we hadn't seen before. Perhaps it's a new secret technique of the Immutable Divine Temple?" Canghai Turtle nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, let's show them my abilities as well," Xu Yan said, looking back. </p><p></p><p>A group of Immutable Divine Temple people were chasing after them. He smiled slightly, raised his hand and pointed. The surrounding immutable qi instantly transformed into invisible sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Strands of immutable qi, like sword threads, permeated the Immutable Realm, silent and without a fierce killing intent. The sword intent was hidden and not apparent.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, avoid them!" Xu Yan said with a smile after finishing this.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Every time Canghai Turtle saw Xu Yan take action, he was shocked by the wonders of his sword dao.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship began to speed up, and by now the Immutable Divine Temple group had entered the range of the sword intent Xu Yan had laid out.</p><p></p><p>Ah! Ah! Suddenly screams arose. The immutable sword intent emitted an invisible killing force. The sword threads were hidden yet incomparably sharp. In an instant, six or seven out of ten of the pursuers had perished!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!" The three Immutable Divine Temple Realm Lords hurriedly stopped, looking with shock and doubt at the hidden killing force. They were alarmed in their hearts - what kind of sword technique was this?</p><p></p><p>The flying ship flew rapidly through the chaos. Canghai Turtle was somewhat excited and said, "The Hongze World must be in this area of the Immutable Realm, otherwise the Immutable Divine Temple wouldn't have sent people to search for it."</p><p></p><p>"We don't know how many people the Immutable Divine Temple has sent. If there are too many powerful experts, even if we find the Hongze World, we won't be able to occupy it," Meng Chong said with furrowed brows, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"That's true," Canghai Turtle said with some worry. "Let's hope we can find the Hongze World first. Only then will we have a chance."</p><p></p><p>The flying ship's speed increased greatly, and at the same time they closed the formations for seeking and extracting treasures, focusing all attention on finding the Hongze World.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to understand somewhat why the Immutable Divine Temple is invading worlds," Xu Yan said pensively. "When a world is created, it devours immutable qi and calms violent spiritual qi. As a world grows stronger, it must constantly break through the chaos, devouring immutable qi to form a barrier around the world. The power of the Immutable Divine Temple is related to immutable qi."</p><p></p><p>"It's even possible that the leader of the Immutable Divine Temple wants to rely on devouring worlds to complete some kind of transformation and improve himself."</p><p></p><p>"We had that guess back then too, so war was unavoidable. It's just that in the end, the six great worlds were defeated," Canghai Turtle said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic Immutable Realm was vast and boundless, and it was even impossible to distinguish directions. Fortunately, Canghai Turtle had after all lived in the Immutable Realm for long ages, and was relatively familiar with this large area where the Wilderness World was located.</p><p></p><p>After encountering the Immutable Divine Temple team, they did not encounter any more Immutable Divine Temple teams for the next few days.</p><p></p><p>"Where on earth has the Hongze World drifted to?" Canghai Turtle said helplessly. By now the flying ship had already left the Wilderness World far behind and had come out of that area where the Wilderness World was located.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had entered a relatively unfamiliar part of the Immutable Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the journey to seek the Hongze World did not stop. The flying ship continued to fly, and Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping continued to cultivate, perceiving the Immutable Realm and their own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also continued his study of artifact refining, formations, and the extraordinary patterns of the Immutable Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they had not placed finding the Hongze World at the forefront of their minds.</p><p></p><p>At a certain...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the flying boat came to an abrupt stop.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, did you discover something?" Xu Yan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Over there, something's not right!" The Ancient Sea Turtle looked to the left front, his voice somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three looked up. In the distance to the left front, they could vaguely see a large mountain. This mountain was extremely massive and incredibly solid, with traces of age and weathering.</p><p></p><p>An ancient great mountain also meant that it was formed from the remains of an ancient Immortal Spirit after death.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this Immortal Spirit was at the level of a Lord of Heaven and Earth, and among Lords of Heaven and Earth, it belonged to the ranks of the powerful.</p><p></p><p>"What did you discover?" Xu Yan asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>The distance was too far, and the Unchanging Realm was hazy and obscure. Even with his Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, he couldn't see anything special inside that great mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of water!" The Ancient Sea Turtle's voice trembled slightly as he controlled the flying boat to approach the mountain. To guard against powerful Immortal Spirits or strong cultivators from the Unchanging Temple that might be present in the mountain, the flying boat approached slowly and cautiously.</p><p></p><p>As the flying boat drew near, Xu Yan's eyes also saw some special features.</p><p></p><p>"It's inside the mountain," Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of Origin Water," the Ancient Sea Turtle said, both delighted and somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"There are no Immortal Spirits or people from the Unchanging Temple in the mountain. Let's go over quickly," Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle was a water-based Immortal Spirit, so his sensitivity to water auras was extraordinary. The fact that he could sense it from such a great distance showed that this water was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Swish! The flying boat approached the mountain and directly entered through the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The ancient mountain already showed signs of weathering from the passage of time, indicating it had existed for an extremely long time.</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle disembarked from the flying boat and stood before a pool of water inside the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's expression was excited yet somewhat sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>"It really is Origin Water!"</p><p></p><p>The water in the pool was still and clear as a dewdrop, as if the entire pool contained just a single drop of dew.</p><p></p><p>"This is Origin Water?" Xu Yan was astonished. This water was indeed extraordinary, as if a single drop could transform into surging rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is Origin Water. I've only seen one person who could nurture Origin Water!" the Ancient Sea Turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>That person was naturally Hong Ze, the Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ze's vast sea, its source spring was Origin Water!" The Ancient Sea Turtle had a somewhat nostalgic look.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Origin Water here related to Hong Ze?" Fang Hao took out a large jar, preparing to collect the Origin Water.</p><p></p><p>"Besides Hong Ze, there's no one else. When he perished back then, he was devoured by that one from the Unchanging Temple. Some of his remains and power may have scattered, which is why a pool of Origin Water appeared here." The Ancient Sea Turtle sighed sadly.</p><p></p><p>A faint trace of fear involuntarily appeared in his eyes. The psychological shadow left by that scene back then was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, this water is quite useful for you, can it increase your strength?" Fang Hao asked while collecting the water.</p><p></p><p>"It's too little, not much use to me now. I just miss it," the Ancient Sea Turtle shook his head.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, to advance further and become a powerful Lord of Heaven and Earth level cultivator, this small amount of Origin Water was far from enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was already the turtle of the Great Wilderness, and had comprehended the Heavenly Dao, using this to forge his own path forward.</p><p></p><p>And if he could receive guidance from Xu Yan's master, that would be the true great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll take it all. This Origin Water, Senior Sister will surely like it and find great use for it." As Fang Hao spoke, he took out another jar and began collecting the Origin Water.</p><p></p><p>Origin Water was somewhat special. Storage devices like storage pouches couldn't contain Origin Water, but Fang Hao had refined unique storage devices for holding special treasures, so collecting the Origin Water posed no problem.</p><p></p><p>"There are Hong Ze's remains at the bottom of the pool!" Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>As the Origin Water was collected into jars, a pale blue bone fragment was revealed at the bottom of the pool, seemingly a section of rib bone.</p><p></p><p>The bone fragment was emitting tiny water droplets, and this pool of Origin Water had formed from this bone fragment over many years.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bone fragment, the Ancient Sea Turtle was filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>He had followed Hong Ze for long ages. Hong Ze was his big brother, so their feelings were naturally deep.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle picked up the bone fragment and examined it for a long time, then sighed and handed it to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, don't you want to keep it as a memento?" Fang Hao asked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid!" The Ancient Sea Turtle said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned, then understood. He took the bone fragment and put it in one of the jars.</p><p></p><p>Carrying Hong Ze's bone fragment would constantly remind the Ancient Sea Turtle of the scene of Hong Ze's heavenly catastrophe, and he couldn't control the fear in his heart. So although he very much wanted to keep Hong Ze's remains as a memento, he ultimately gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sighed inwardly. It was a miracle the Ancient Sea Turtle hadn't been scared to death back then, with such a timid nature.</p><p></p><p>"With Hong Ze's remains appearing here, Hong Ze's realm must not be far. It should be nearby!" the Ancient Sea Turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>They came out of the mountain and released the flying boat. Standing on the flying boat, the Ancient Sea Turtle began to calculate the possible direction Hong Ze's realm had drifted.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Fang Hao activated the flying boat's treasure-seeking formation to search for treasures in the mountain and retrieve them.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he retrieved a small tree.</p><p></p><p>"This tree should have some use. It can be used to refine pills. I'll bring it back for Senior Sister," Fang Hao put away the small tree.</p><p></p><p>"According to my calculations, because of Hong Ze's remains, this great mountain will be influenced to some degree by Hong Ze's realm, even though Hong Ze's realm has already perished.</p><p></p><p>"Because of the influence from Hong Ze's realm, the direction this great mountain drifted is not far from Hong Ze's realm. Based on my observations and judgment, Hong Ze's realm is very likely in this direction," the Ancient Sea Turtle said excitedly, pointing in a direction.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll find Hong Ze's realm soon." The Ancient Sea Turtle controlled the flying boat, moving forward rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat moved extremely fast, leaving the great mountain far behind. Xu Yan and the other three were also excited. They could finally see another realm besides the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a dead realm, it still held great significance.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the flying boat, gazing into the distance, they continued forward, encountering several small mountains along the way, but none had anything special.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat advanced for about a day and night, but still saw no sign of the realm. Even the Ancient Sea Turtle became dejected.</p><p></p><p>"This shouldn't be. According to my calculations, there shouldn't be any mistake!"</p><p></p><p>"What does a dead realm look like?" Xu Yan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"A dead realm has no radiance, is dark all over, desolate and empty, as if permeated by a sense of death," the Ancient Sea Turtle replied heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Look, isn't that Hong Ze's realm!" Xu Yan raised his hand and pointed to the side front.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

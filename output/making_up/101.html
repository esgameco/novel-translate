            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 101: Su Lingxiu's Insights, the Treasure Trove of Medicine</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu immersed herself completely in comprehending the principles of medicine, spending most of her time in her room organizing her insights and trying to formulate medicinal prescriptions based on the theory of "monarch, minister, assistant, and envoy".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan would occasionally check on her, marveling at how this girl, who had started studying medicine at age 4 and treated patients at 6, had already written out the characteristics and effects of various precious medicines in such a short time, and had even begun to create her own medicinal formulas.</p><p></p><p>"The theoretical aspects of medicine pose no problem for her. The current difficulty lies in how to gain insights into the cultivation methods and enter the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, no matter how much she comprehends about medicine, without a foundation in martial arts, she will be limited in her ability to refine any potent elixirs."</p><p></p><p>The core of the medicine-martial arts cultivation lies not in medicine or martial arts themselves, but in the martial arts. Using martial arts to drive the medical arts - this is the true essence, the fundamental principle.</p><p></p><p>Apart from organizing her insights on medicine, Su Lingxiu also had Stone Two find a human-sized puppet and meticulously marked all the acupuncture points on it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was increasingly satisfied, knowing that once Su Lingxiu succeeded in entering the path of cultivation, she would be able to map out all 720 acupuncture points on the body.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan returns, I'll have him guide this disciple sister. With his insights and imagination, he should be able to assist Su Lingxiu in comprehending the cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind. Su Lingxiu's talent in the Dao of medicine was truly monstrous. It would be a shame if she could not enter the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>While organizing her insights on medicine and formulating medicinal prescriptions, Su Lingxiu was also contemplating the cultivation methods. Compared to her profound understanding of medicine, her insights into cultivation were not as great.</p><p></p><p>But she was not anxious. Once she finished organizing her work on medicine, she would devote herself wholeheartedly to comprehending the cultivation methods. She was confident that with her talents, she would be able to grasp them.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two was somewhat troubled, as he was stuck at the stage of refining the dantian, unable to break through to the stage of "sinews and bones rumbling, qi and blood surging". He could only continue to cultivate diligently, researching how to break through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not intervene, as Stone Two's talent was still acceptable. Breaking through the qi and blood realm was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>A golden light flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the initial stage of the Xiantian Realm. You have reached the Xiantian Realm Perfection."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the initial stage of the Xiantian Realm, and his cultivation speed was remarkably fast, living up to his status as the pioneer of Li Xuan's martial arts legacy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, as his strength had increased once again.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xu Yan finally returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was happy to see his senior disciple back, but decided to hold off on passing down the cultivation methods beyond the Xiantian Realm for now. Instead, he wanted Xu Yan to assist Su Lingxiu in comprehending the cultivation methods of the medicine-martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan were to focus on the advanced cultivation methods, his attention would be divided, and he might not be able to devote enough effort to helping Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's monstrous talent as a Xiantian Realm cultivator, he should be able to help Su Lingxiu comprehend the cultivation methods in a relatively short time.</p><p></p><p>Although the final insights would not be entirely Su Lingxiu's own, as Xu Yan would be assisting her, the cultivation itself would still be hers. Li Xuan believed she should still be able to receive the recognition and feedback from the "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>After the introductions, Su Lingxiu eagerly asked Xu Yan for guidance on her cultivation doubts, remembering Li Xuan's words about seeking help from her senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan readily agreed, and Li Xuan was satisfied, seeing that Xu Yan carried himself with the bearing of a senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>The three disciples then left the courtyard and headed outside the city, where Xu Yan and Stone Two reunited. Su Lingxiu then began to explain the cultivation methods of the medicine-martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened with a furrowed brow, his expression blank, feeling that this cultivation method was beyond his innate talents. Scratching his head, he chuckled awkwardly, "Sister, I'm afraid I won't be of much help."</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, everyone has their own talents," Su Lingxiu replied, not surprised by his reaction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Brother, cultivating the martial way of the physical body, with robust muscles, it's obvious that your talent lies in your physique, not in your head.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Ling Xiu and Xu Yan began to discuss the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The master said, the Dantian martial way is to get close to the spiritual energy of all things, and use the spiritual energy to stimulate the qi and blood... Medicine is wood, and Dantian is fire..."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you have not penetrated the Heaven and Earth Bridge, so you cannot sense the spiritual energy. And this spiritual energy of all things is obviously not the perception of the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, but rather..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at a tree beside them and said, "Sister, try to sense the spiritual energy of the vitality of this tree. The cultivation method may lie within."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was startled, sense the spiritual energy of the tree's vitality? How to sense it?</p><p></p><p>"Put your hand on the tree, use your heart and your will to comprehend and perceive..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu did as instructed, placing her palm on the tree, silently trying to sense it, but gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, the Dantian martial way is naturally inseparable from Dantian and medicine. You should try to comprehend the spiritual energy of all things from the perspective of medicine, and enlighten yourself with the perspective of medicine."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method of the Dantian martial way could not be comprehended in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, even with Xu Yan's assistance, as this cultivation method was not Xu Yan's own cultivation, he could only play a supporting role.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Su Ling Xiu went outside the city with Xu Yan in the morning to comprehend the cultivation method of the Dantian martial way, and in the evening she continued to organize the theory of medicine, pondering the medicinal formulas.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she recorded all her ideas about alchemy.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method was still not enlightened, without a clue, but the medical skills were almost completed.</p><p></p><p>That evening, after returning from the city outskirts and having dinner, Su Ling Xiu was organizing her drafts, a thick stack of them. She checked them one by one to see if there were any omissions, and continued to fill in the new gains.</p><p></p><p>"The Dantian martial way is naturally inseparable from medicine. I have been obsessed with the cultivation method, but have never thought that the integration of medicine and the cultivation method is the true Dantian martial way.</p><p></p><p>"Medicine is wood, Dantian is fire, with wood generating fire, how should I sense the qi and blood of medicine?"</p><p></p><p>In Su Ling Xiu's mind, the elder brother's understanding of the cultivation method and his speculations flashed, and at this moment, she had a vague enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>She didn't rest all night, and the next morning when she came to the outskirts of the city, she expressed all her insights, asking the elder brother for reference.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, do you see this tree? It is wood, and you are fire. Use the spiritual energy of this tree to stimulate your qi and blood fire. As a medical practitioner, go and sense it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Touch its aura, just as you understand the efficacy of precious medicines, go and understand it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was startled, and there was some enlightenment in her mind. She was very familiar with the properties of various medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>She knew the characteristics of each precious medicine, which aspects of treatment they focused on, and she had also collected herbs on the mountain and identified their properties.</p><p></p><p>These medicinal properties were summarized bit by bit by the predecessors. The predecessors also went to perceive and try, to understand the properties of the precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu gently closed her eyes, placing both hands on the tree, carefully perceiving, as if capturing the spiritual energy of the tree.</p><p></p><p>"The human body has acupoints, and the perception of qi and blood can also start from the acupoints. The heart is fire, and the closest to the heart is the Danzhong acupoint..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's breathing changed slightly, and in the process of perception, she felt a warm and lingering flow rising in the Danzhong acupoint.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the qi and blood?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the qi and blood, the most critical step in the cultivation method has been completed.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the qi and blood, it is how to perfect it, how to completely comprehend the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Then it's refining the skin, bones, and viscera.</p><p></p><p>For Su Ling Xiu, refining the skin is relatively easy, after all, she already has a foundation in martial arts. Refining the iron bones and copper bones is also not difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, the ultimate realm of the Dantian martial way is the evergreen bones. You must refine them out. My junior brother and I have the jade bones and the diamond-like diamond bones."</p><p></p><p>After Su Ling Xiu comprehended the qi and blood and the cultivation method, Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, don't worry, I will definitely refine the evergreen bones. I can refine pills, so there won't be any problems!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Ling Xiu thought of Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if Aunt Zhou can find a furnace for me. Without reaching the qi and blood realm, I can only rely on the furnace to refine pills."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was very clear that only by refining pills could she cultivate faster and refine the evergreen bones.</p><p></p><p>For other martial artists, taking too many pills would make their realm appear unstable.</p><p></p><p>However, she cultivates the Dantian martial way, naturally she can grasp the degree well, and she can better refine the pills without easily appearing unstable in her realm.</p><p></p><p>Back at the residence, Su Wen Xiu plunged into the draft of the medicinal formulas.</p><p></p><p>"I need to write down the medicinal formulas, for refining the skin, refining the bones, refining the viscera, and breaking through the bottleneck. The qi and blood realm pill will be called the Qi Blood Pill..."</p><p></p><p>Su Wen Xiu looked through the records of various precious medicines and began to select and combine them.</p><p></p><p>"This medicinal formula has no problem, the effect is to refine the skin, and can accelerate the tempering of the skin membrane. Let's call it the Refining Skin Pill? Is the name too direct?</p><p></p><p>"This medicinal formula should also be fine, let's call it the Tempering Bone Pill.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Refining Viscera Pill... For martial artists to cultivate, the first thing is to sense the qi and blood, so..."</p><p></p><p>"My this medicinal formula can help sense the qi and blood, let's call it the Small Qi Blood Pill."</p><p></p><p>After one medicinal formula was pondered out, Su Ling Xiu suddenly had a burst of inspiration, the theory of medicine, the principles of drug compatibility, became instantly clear and transparent.</p><p></p><p>One medicinal formula after another was combined by her.</p><p></p><p>In her mind, it was as if a complete set of Dantian Medical Classics had emerged.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Xuan squinted his eyes, looking at the window of Su Ling Xiu's room, the light shining out, she was probably organizing and compiling the medical theory again, another sleepless night.</p><p></p><p>What was gratifying was that Su Ling Xiu had basically comprehended the cultivation method of the Dantian martial way. She had initially sensed the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the third disciple had stabilized, and the Dantian martial way system was about to be opened up.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>Golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled, had Meng Chong broken through? Or did Xu Yan have a new insight?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu, from the Dantian medical theory you compiled, has comprehended the Dantian medical method and compiled the prototype of the Dantian Medical Classics. You have obtained the Dantian Medical Classics."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the feedback from the golden finger was from Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly stood up from the chair, overjoyed in his heart. This third disciple girl, he had not spoiled her in vain. In the way of medicine, she truly had a monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't even entered the martial way, but relying on her monstrous talent, she had created medicinal formulas and compiled the prototype of the Dantian Medical Classics.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan had completely mastered the Dantian Medical Classics, this was not just a prototype, but a complete one, including alchemy, treatment, medicinal formulas and so on, all perfected.</p><p></p><p>The medical system within the Dantian martial way was no longer just empty theory, but had substantial results!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to look at the introduction of the three realms of the Heavenly Cultivator on the stone wall. Although the cultivation of the Martial Dao Heavenly Cultivator was different from the Divine Consciousness Realm, he could draw an analogy and perhaps thoroughly comprehend the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The first realm is to gather the spirit... Condense and gather it, the primary thing is to sense one's own spirit..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly recalled that when he had previously destroyed a treasure location in the Hidden Palace, he had felt his spirit invigorated when approaching the Stone Secluded Grass in the stone chamber, and the effect of the Stone Secluded Grass was to nourish the spirit.</p><p></p><p>"That peak Grand Master must have been cultivating the Stone Secluded Grass, relying on the Stone Secluded Grass to sense and condense his own spirit..."</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Heavenly Cultivators in the Inner Realm probably all used similar methods to condense their own spirit.</p><p></p><p>They relied on external objects, lacked the cultivation method of the Heavenly Cultivator, and were also subject to certain restrictions in the Inner Realm, unable to completely break through the Martial Dao Heavenly Cultivator realm.</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Heavenly Cultivators were in a state where they had sensed their own spirit and condensed their own spirit, but were unable to gather it together.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the divine might of the Half-Step Heavenly Cultivators seemed not quite substantial, appearing rather ethereal.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the reasons behind this, Xu Yan's eyes lit up, and he had a vague enlightenment, the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm gradually becoming clearer in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, I have gained some insights, you may rest."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat down cross-legged and began to ponder the enlightenment he had just experienced, delving into the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Du Yuying quietly stepped back and sat on the ground, her eyes quietly watching the contemplating Xu Yan, her heart pounding, her jade-like face flushing from time to time, lost in her own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The introduction of the three realms of the Heavenly Cultivator appeared one by one in Xu Yan's mind, and the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm also manifested in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Gathering the spirit, sensing one's own spirit... And the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness is within my heart, in my sword intent, in my profound enlightenment; to condense the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness, I have already comprehended, and to refine the will of Heaven and Earth into Divine Consciousness, what is the will of Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>"The Heavens and Earth are vast, while humans are insignificant, by resonating with the Heavens and Earth, one can know the changes of the Heavens and Earth, the sword intent transforming into mountains and rivers, the Heavens and Earth are within... My will is the will of Heaven, and the will of Heaven is in my heart."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm gradually became clear in Xu Yan's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>How to condense and refine the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness, how to transform the will of Heaven and Earth into one's own will, as well as how to open the Mud Pill Palace and nourish the Spiritual Platform, all gradually became clear.</p><p></p><p>From the Profound Enlightenment Realm to the Divine Consciousness Realm, this was a huge leap.</p><p></p><p>And the foundation of cultivating the Divine Consciousness Realm was primarily to open the Mud Pill Palace and nourish the Spiritual Platform, for when the Mud Pill Palace is opened, one's own soul will converge in the Mud Pill Spiritual Platform.</p><p></p><p>Condense the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness, transform the will of Heaven and Earth, refine the singular, and transform it into Divine Consciousness! Where the Divine Consciousness reaches, it is the will of Heaven! The will of Heaven cannot be defied! The power of the Divine Consciousness Realm has already transcended the realm of divine might suppression, far beyond the reach of the divine might of minor Heavenly Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan contemplated, the clearer the Martial Dao cultivation method became, and the more he marveled at the profundity of the Divine Consciousness Realm, for in a single thought, the enemy could be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had been staring at Xu Yan the entire time, and the more she watched, the more it seemed that a spiritual aura was enveloping Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As if he was... cultivating the Dao? This word suddenly popped up in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension of the Martial Dao cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm was not something that could be achieved overnight. Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the ground, his aura becoming profound, the spiritual energy converging around him.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, sword intent would emerge, and sometimes a gentle breeze would blow, as he immersed himself completely in the contemplation of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan emerged from his contemplation, he exhaled deeply, his heart filled with excitement, for he had already comprehended the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>Having thoroughly understood the cultivation method, as long as he could perfect the Profound Enlightenment Realm and accumulate his own foundation, he could then open the Mud Pill Palace, nourish the Spiritual Platform, and condense the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness, breaking through to the Divine Consciousness Realm in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost there, it won't be too far away!" Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Within a year, he could reach the perfect Profound Enlightenment Realm? And then after half a year of accumulating his foundation, when he broke through to the Divine Consciousness Realm, he could further refine and transform himself.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed was already extremely rapid.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, it won't even take a year."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Consciousness Realm was a tremendous advancement, and only after entering the Divine Consciousness Realm could one truly unleash the profound mysteries of the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>And he should also contemplate the Heart Sword Realm, to understand how to break through the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>To transform all things in Heaven and Earth into a sword! What an incredibly powerful realm of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Consciousness Realm, after refining the Martial Dao Divine Consciousness, my will is the will of Heaven, and where the Divine Consciousness reaches, can it transform all things into a sword? I should also take some time to deeply cultivate my own Dao of the Sword, to comprehend the cultivation of the Heart Sword Realm, and how to break through the Heart Sword Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The matter here is done, Miss Du, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood up and said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, who had been lost in her thoughts, had a slightly flustered look in her eyes, her jade-like face flushed, and she hurriedly responded in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Tomb of the Heavenly Cultivator had yielded many harvests.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had perfected her own deficiencies, while Xu Yan had broken through to the initial stage of the Profound Enlightenment Realm, and had also understood the three realms of the Heavenly Cultivator and comprehended the cultivation method of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>As they exited the Tomb of the Heavenly Cultivator, Xu Yan waved his hand, completely burying the entrance to the tomb chamber.</p><p></p><p>This place had returned to its ordinary state, a lonely mountain in the wilderness, and it would be difficult for outsiders to believe that the grave of a renowned Martial Dao Heavenly Cultivator was buried here.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, he was the Blood Demon, slaughtering countless lives.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, he was the Demonic Sect's Demonic Master, his demonic might spreading far and wide.</p><p></p><p>Born in obscurity, buried in the wilderness, this was also his final resting place.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Du Yuying left the Tomb of the Heavenly Cultivator, walking through the mountain forests.</p><p></p><p>This place was located in the Yan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, let me escort you back to the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a pleading voice came from ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Please, don't take my granddaughter, spare my granddaughter!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, and the two of them quickened their pace, arriving at the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>There, they saw two women dressed in thin veils, their slender figures barely concealed by the sheer fabric.</p><p></p><p>An old man was shielding a young girl behind him.</p><p></p><p>The girl was only around fifteen or sixteen years old, petite and beautiful, her expression one of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The old man was actually a Martial Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>But the two women in thin veils were Grand Masters!</p><p></p><p>"It is an honor for your granddaughter to be offered to the Ice Lord. Seeing that your granddaughter has excellent talent and is quite charming, the Ice Lord will surely be delighted to play with her for several days, so I'll spare your life. Now scram!"</p><p></p><p>One of the women waved her hand, directly sending the old man flying.</p><p></p><p>She reached out and grabbed the young girl.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa!" the girl cried out, her face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The old man got up, glaring furiously, his aura erupting, ready to fight the Grand Masters to the death.</p><p></p><p>"Your Ice Lord has already killed so many young girls, and now my granddaughter has fallen into her hands. How could she possibly survive? I'll fight you to the end!"</p><p></p><p>The old man was filled with grief and indignation.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Lord, the master of the ice lake, had every year captured numerous young maidens and taken them to the Ice Palace, none of whom had ever returned alive.</p><p></p><p>She was an evil demon! The old man never imagined that his own granddaughter would be targeted.</p><p></p><p>"If you wish to die, then I shall oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>One of the veiled women sneered at the old man.</p><p></p><p>A mere Martial Dao Master was nothing to them, Grand Masters who could easily extinguish his life with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>A palm strike lashed out, the bone-chilling power of ice sweeping forth.</p><p></p><p>The old man let out a roar, knowing full well that he was doomed, yet still determined to fight to the end.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no retreat, only a relentless advance, like a moth rushing into the flames.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Yan easily deflected the attack of the veiled woman, furrowing his brows and saying, "Release her!"</p><p></p><p>He was not the type to meddle in other people's affairs, but seeing the old man's doting love for his granddaughter, and how he was willing to fight to the death for her, it touched something deep within him.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he thought of his own mother.</p><p></p><p>She had also doted on him and indulged his search for powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The two veiled women's expressions changed, and they suddenly looked at Xu Yan and Du Yuying with gleaming eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, if you wish to save her, you can come with us to see the Ice Mistress."</p><p></p><p>This young man was handsome and powerful, exactly the kind of person the Ice Mistress needed.</p><p></p><p>Recently, they had just found two handsome young men with master-level cultivation, but the Ice Mistress was not entirely satisfied, feeling their strength was too weak to withstand her torment. And they were not particularly good-looking either.</p><p></p><p>But this young master before them fit the bill perfectly, and the Ice Mistress would undoubtedly be delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This Ice Mistress was clearly no good, a true calamity, and it would be convenient to go and kill her.</p><p></p><p>The veiled women threw the young girl to the old man, coldly saying, "You should thank this young master."</p><p></p><p>The old man caught his granddaughter, overcome with gratitude, and quickly knelt down, pulling his granddaughter with him. "Thank you, noble sir, for saving our lives! May I ask your esteemed name?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The old man was stunned. Xu Yan? The Sword Immortal Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>He swallowed hard. He had thought that if this young man went to see the Ice Mistress, he would surely die.</p><p></p><p>But it was Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, be careful of the Ice Mistress, she is extremely dangerous," the old man warned gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How dangerous is she?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of this powerful figure called the Ice Mistress.</p><p></p><p>He looked inquiringly at Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying also shook her head.</p><p></p><p>The old man wanted to say more, but the two veiled women glared at him, "Say another word and we'll kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please be very careful," the old man dared not say more. He had his granddaughter kowtow a few times, then left with her.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, with his ability to slay peak Grandmasters, the Ice Mistress, no matter how strong, would not be his match," the old man thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Those two Ice Palace envoys had actually brought Xu Yan back with them - this was going to cost the Ice Mistress her life.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, they don't know Xu Yan's reputation."</p><p></p><p>The old man was greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Palace envoys usually only appeared to capture young women, and after capturing someone, they would just return to the Ice Palace, never caring about the affairs of the martial world, nor paying attention to it.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Xu Yan could openly give his name, and the other party did not know that he was the Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>"Please, come with us, young master," the two veiled women said, leading Xu Yan and Du Yuying away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained calm. With his current strength, even a Minor Saint would be no match for him. With the might of the Xun Wind Sword Intent, it would be impossible for them to resist.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Ice Mistress was, she was at most a Half-Saint. </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was also unafraid, fully confident in Xu Yan's abilities.</p><p></p><p>The two veiled women were delighted, having found such a handsome young master. The Ice Mistress would surely be overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>And in addition to the young master, there was also a breathtakingly beautiful woman - the Ice Mistress would be very pleased with that as well.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that this beauty would be toyed with to death by the Ice Mistress.</p><p></p><p>On the lake, a grand ice palace stood tall. On the palace, the Ice Maiden sighed as she kicked away a man who had been lying on top of her, his body withered and drained of vitality.</p><p></p><p>"He's completely useless, and not even good-looking."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Ice Mistress, a handsome young master has come, and with him a beautiful woman," a joyful voice reported.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden looked up, her eyes immediately brightening at the sight of the handsome young man and the stunning beauty.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in her eyes, the faint wrinkles at the corners revealing themselves...</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands, at the entrance of a water gate on a high peak, the outline was gradually solidifying.</p><p></p><p>The contours of the gate were becoming clearer, as if it was about to open.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Spirit Realm is about to open," </p><p></p><p>On the peak where the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was located, several figures stood.</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple hat had a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, the Gate of the Spirit Realm is opening. Should we take the opportunity to enter?"</p><p></p><p>One person asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to enter, you can, but..." </p><p></p><p>The man in the purple hat paused, then continued, "You'll either be a humble servant, despised like a pig or dog, or you'll die!"</p><p></p><p>The person's expression became grave. "Pavilion Master, is that truly the case?"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to doubt the Pavilion Master's words.</p><p></p><p>"For those from the Inner Realm to enter the Spirit Realm, it is indeed like that. I only hope that this time, the opening of the Spirit Realm Gate is not to find me."</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple hat sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" </p><p></p><p>The others looked at the Pavilion Master in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I am revered and exalted. But if they come for me, then I will be a servant, awaiting their orders. If I am rewarded, I should be happy, but if I am punished..."</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple hat did not continue.</p><p></p><p>The others fell silent as well.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and the Spirit Realm had some history, but ever since the Demon Lord's incident, the contact had not been as frequent. Only the Pavilion Master knew the inside story.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spirit Realm fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>The massive gate stood tall, as if the entire peak had been absorbed into it.</p><p></p><p>The rippling gate gradually opened to the sides.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood up, his hand gripping the hilt of his sword, his expression grave as he looked at the distant, gigantic gate.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, shall we hide and watch?" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun felt somewhat nervous.</p><p></p><p>Although they had the Jade Token, it might not necessarily be safe. What if the opponents were enemies of the Jade Token's owner?</p><p></p><p>They might just kill them on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry," Meng Chong's expression remained calm. "We'll just observe from here. As long as we don't provoke them, even if they want to kill, let's see if they can withstand my Absolute God Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun felt that made sense. Just watching from afar, how could they come to kill them? Surely they could at least take a look.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spirit Realm slowly opened, revealing a gap.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Ripples spread, as if a spring breeze sweeping across the land. The snow around the massive gate instantly melted and vanished.</p><p></p><p>The dense spiritual energy and active heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms gushed out from the gap.</p><p></p><p>A figure stepped out from the Spirit Realm Gate, something in the palm of their hand. </p><p></p><p>After stepping into the Inner Realm, a pearl-like object flew out from their palm, shooting towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The person immediately followed after the pearl, disappearing into the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The opened Spirit Realm Gate then slowly closed, but did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

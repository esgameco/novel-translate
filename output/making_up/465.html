        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among the powerful observers watching the battle, there was an unkempt, somewhat slovenly old man who didn't attract any attention. But at this moment, the old man's lips were moving as he grumbled to himself:</p><p></p><p>"Blood Extreme's remnant soul? Tai Kun is truly useless. He didn't even kill Blood Extreme thoroughly, allowing him to come back to life. Going after Jiang Feng's descendant like this, he's up to no good.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Kun's successor is also useless. Jiang Feng's kid looked promising, but turns out he's blind too, not even realizing Blood Extreme was hiding here..."</p><p></p><p>The old man continued grumbling, but then looked at Jiang Buping with a puzzled expression. </p><p></p><p>"This young man seems unusual. What kind of martial arts is that? Soul secret technique? Doesn't seem like it. Strange!"</p><p></p><p>He scratched his head and stroked his chin. "A martial art even I can't understand certainly isn't from Taicang. But he's not from outside this world either, and doesn't seem to be one of those things from that damned Divine Palace..."</p><p></p><p>The more the old man looked, the more he felt layers of mystery were hidden here. He sensed something wasn't quite right with the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then he slightly raised his head to look at a certain big guy in one direction.</p><p></p><p>"How odd. This kid's martial arts are also strange. His physical body is terrifyingly strong, and he can even transform into a giant. Definitely not Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not from that damned Divine Palace either. Surely it can't be that the Divine Palace... No, it's impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly thinking of a possibility, he immediately shook his head to deny it: "Impossible. If they hadn't died, there's no way they would have stayed quiet for so long. That guy from the Divine Palace wouldn't be so quiet either..."</p><p></p><p>The old man looked at Jiang Buping, then at Meng Chong. "These two kids, could they be connected somehow? From the same school?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the old man was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"How strange. Forget it, no use thinking too much. Let's just see how that bastard Tianshas handles things. Even if this world collapses, so be it. I'm too lazy to care about these messy affairs anymore."</p><p></p><p>The old man finally shook his head and stopped dwelling on it.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, two powerful auras clashed, causing the world to shake and the winds to surge. Even Immortal Heavenly Lords felt fear from the fierce energy.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, you bastard, how dare you challenge your superiors? Are you worthy? You want to kill me? Are you worthy?" Jiang Tianming's expression was ferocious as he held a long sword with a reddish blade.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's gaze was cold, but he sneered contemptuously, "Jiang Tianming, do you think relying on a remnant soul is enough to resist me? Today we'll settle things between us. I, Jiang Buping, have come to kill you, kill her, kill some people - whoever stands in my way will die!"</p><p></p><p>Remnant soul?</p><p></p><p>When Jiang Buping said this, everyone was stunned. No wonder Jiang Tianming had become so strong - he was relying on a remnant soul? And if just a remnant soul was this powerful, how strong must the original being have been? Jiang Tianming was slightly stunned, secretly alarmed that Jiang Buping had discovered this.</p><p></p><p>How did he find out? "Senior Blood Extreme, how does this little bastard know?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming looked towards Blood Extreme's soul within his body.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is unusual. You likely can't handle him on your own. Hand over control of your body to me, or you'll certainly die!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's expression was extremely solemn at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Even you can't guarantee you can kill the little bastard?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's expression grew even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"His martial arts are abnormal, seemingly specialized in killing souls. Even I need to be cautious. If you don't want to die, you should know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's tone was cold.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, I'll do whatever you say, as long as we can kill that little bastard!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint blood-colored light emanated from Jiang Tianming's body. Then an even more powerful aura erupted. The blade of the long sword in his hand gleamed with a blood-red cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Take my strike!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming suddenly made the first move. A blood-red sword light streaked across the sky, slashing towards Jiang Buping in a way that surpassed the understanding of the observing Immortal Heavenly Lords.</p><p></p><p>With one slash, the observers seemed to see a vast sea of blood, as if looking at a blood-colored purgatory. And from this purgatory, a blood-colored sword light slashed out.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression didn't change as he thrust out his spear. Cold light gathered at a single point. In everyone's eyes, it was as if they saw a spear light piercing open a path through the sea of blood, piercing through the blood-colored purgatory, stabbing towards the end of that sword light.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: God Slayer!</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was shocked at this moment. As his form shifted, circles of blood-colored light like quicksand appeared, enveloping this remnant soul of his.</p><p></p><p>This was a defensive technique.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he swung his sword to slash out. The blood sea purgatory let out a roar, like the wailing of vengeful spirits, as if countless vengeful spirits were wielding swords to kill, pouncing towards Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"When did the Taicang world develop techniques specialized in killing souls? This isn't right, it's not as simple as just techniques. It's like a completely different martial way, focused on killing souls..."</p><p></p><p>"Could this kid be the future new master of the Taicang world? Otherwise how could he be so freakishly talented?"</p><p></p><p>The more Blood Extreme fought, the more shocked he became. His soul constantly felt an intense crisis, as if one careless moment would lead to being pierced by a spear.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the soul-killing martial way was incredibly sharp. Even with his abilities, he felt it was difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Tianming's soul was already trembling, his face pale. His expression was filled with fear and regret, his fighting spirit gone, replaced only by boundless terror and remorse.</p><p></p><p>The slovenly old man watched the great battle, his expression growing more and more astonished. The martial arts Jiang Buping displayed were beyond his understanding, like a completely new martial way.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was a martial way that had never existed in the world before.</p><p></p><p>"How strange. Who taught this kid's martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>The old man wondered curiously.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked towards the battle, staring at that remnant soul for a while before furrowing his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This remnant soul is very powerful, far surpassing the Immortal realm. And it's a soul from the Netherworld. Could it be remnants of a Netherworld expert who once invaded the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The fact that remnant soul could resist Jiang Buping's Extreme Soul martial arts divine ability for so long was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Tianming is about to reach his limit."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>The battle grew more intense. The observing experts now understood why Spear Demon Jiang Buping was so powerful, able to singlehandedly kill all his enemies with just one spear when surrounded by many Immortal Heavenly Lords.</p><p></p><p>That incredibly powerful soul-killing strike was something no Immortal Heavenly Lord could withstand!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of soul secret technique is this, to be so incredibly strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's not as simple as just a soul secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiang Buping thrust out his spear. Cold light blossomed, transforming into countless specks that directly covered Jiang Tianming's body. These specks of cold light seemed unstoppable as they entered Jiang Tianming's body.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored purgatory-like attack had also swept over, but Jiang Buping's expression didn't change. He swept his spear, and with a thunderous sound, tore open a gap in the blood-colored purgatory. His form flickered as he escaped from the blood-colored purgatory.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Tianming let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>A soul half-emerged from his physical body, its face full of fear and terror as it begged: "Jiang Buping, I was wrong, I won't dare again, please spare me!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't attack again. As long as you spare me,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll do anything you want. Cloud Mist is yours, everything is yours. Please, I beg you, spare me! I'll never dare to do it again!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's soul was shaken, his emotions had collapsed. He no longer had his usual lofty and confident demeanor of having everything under control.</p><p></p><p>"This is what you deserve!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping coldly smiled and thrust his spear again.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Clusters of blood-colored light like a swamp appeared in front of Jiang Tianming's body. Another voice sounded: "Boy, you can deal with this soul as you wish, but this body belongs to me. Let's call it quits here - you've had your revenge, there's no need to continue fighting!"</p><p></p><p>"I will destroy both his soul and body. You have no right to negotiate!" Jiang Buping said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, do you really think I can't deal with you? I just didn't want to harm this remnant soul!" Blood Extreme said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever tricks you have, just use them!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, fine, fine. You ignorant boy, you really think I'm easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme roared in anger. With a loud boom, at this moment, Jiang Tianming's body radiated a blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>A vortex like the depths of hell appeared on Jiang Tianming's body, pulling and devouring his soul, constantly dragging it in.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Jiang Tianming let out a miserable cry, but at this moment, he burst out with his soul power.</p><p></p><p>"You dare break your promise?" Jiang Tianming raged.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, you can't survive. Sacrifice your soul to me and I can avenge you. Otherwise, your death will be in vain. Face reality," Blood Extreme said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have much time. Think carefully. If you voluntarily sacrifice your soul, you can still retain a trace of consciousness to see me kill your enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's expression struggled. "Can you really kill that bastard?"</p><p></p><p>"There's a 70% chance."</p><p></p><p>"Only 70%?"</p><p></p><p>"Your soul is ultimately too weak, and the quantity is not enough. Otherwise, it would be more than 70%."</p><p></p><p>The eyes on Jiang Tianming's soul turned blood-red at this moment, revealing a manic look. He glanced at Jiang Buping with a hateful gaze and suddenly called out: "Smoky, come here!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mist hesitated slightly, then flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Tianming."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming looked at Blood Extreme and said, "What about if you add her?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good, good. I will fulfill your wishes. Let your two souls intertwine, igniting your resentment..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme laughed heartily and reached out to grab. The blood-colored hell swept towards Cloud Mist.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Mist's expression changed drastically. She moved to flee, but in an instant, she was enveloped by the blood-colored hell.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, please, save me! I was wrong, it wasn't my intention. It was him, he made me do it!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mist suddenly begged Jiang Buping for help.</p><p></p><p>"Smoky, you bitch, you actually beg that bastard for help?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming roared madly.</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault! Jiang Tianming, if you had listened to me, how could we have ended up like this?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mist started cursing angrily too.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, angry curses of resentment rang out. In the end, all the hatred and grudges were directed at Jiang Buping. From within the blood-colored hell, two pairs of vicious eyes seemed to want to devour him alive!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression remained calm as he silently watched. He didn't even try to stop Blood Extreme from performing this secret technique or prevent him from blood refining Jiang Tianming and Cloud Mist.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored hell poured into Jiang Tianming's body. Amidst the rolling blood light, the figure of a blood-colored monster appeared, radiating resentment, gloom, and bloodthirst that shook heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It had three heads. The middle head was blood-red with blurry features and crimson eyes. One could even hear the rumbling of surging waves, as if blood waves were surging.</p><p></p><p>The left head appeared ethereal - it was Jiang Tianming, formed from his remaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The right head was formed from Cloud Mist's remaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Die, die, die... Kill, kill, kill... Bastard, little bastard..."</p><p></p><p>The resentful voices of Jiang Tianming and Cloud Mist echoed through the heavens and earth. The watching powerful experts felt their hair stand on end, fear rising in their hearts. They even unconsciously took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but it's certainly some technique from the Netherworld."</p><p></p><p>"It's very powerful. Can Jiang Buping resist it?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul of a powerful Netherworld expert! If Jiang Buping was defeated, this monster would probably devour the blood essence of many martial artists and blood refine the entire Taikun Realm!</p><p></p><p>"I haven't used the Blood Hell Killing Form for who knows how many years. Although it's not even one-thousandth of its peak strength, it's enough to kill you, boy!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's sinister laugh rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took a step forward. In an instant, the battlefield was covered in a blood-red color. Surging blood waves appeared out of thin air. In just a moment, Jiang Buping was already in the midst of this blood hell tempest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The tempest raised huge waves. A force of stagnation seemed to appear in heaven and earth, along with a terrifying corrosive energy that permeated the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Swish! One after another, figures identical to Blood Extreme appeared. The resentful voices of Jiang Tianming and Cloud Mist kept ringing out, their resentment filling the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The shabby old man took half a step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Blood Hell Killing Form. One of the three great killing techniques of the Netherworld's Blood Path. Ever since Taikun beat Blood Extreme to death, we haven't seen it again. Who would have thought that Taikun was useless - Blood Extreme didn't even die completely and can now use this technique again.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's too weak now, that Jiang Buping kid still can't resist it."</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, from within that blood hell, a cold light flashed. An extremely sharp killing intent seemed about to tear apart the blood hell.</p><p></p><p>Even separated by a vast distance, all the Immortal Celestial Lords felt their souls involuntarily tremble with fear at this moment, as if sensing a severe threat.</p><p></p><p>They unconsciously retreated a few steps, their expressions solemn.</p><p></p><p>"If you weren't using this technique as a remnant soul, with my current strength, I might have to retreat a bit. But you're just a remnant soul - thinking you can threaten me is just wishful thinking!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's voice rang out from within the blood hell.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful you once were, now you're just a remnant soul. A mere remnant soul dares to try to threaten me? Who gave you the courage? Today, you've made an enemy of me, Jiang Buping. You're doomed - not even a trace of your remnant soul will survive!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's angry voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The blood hell became even more terrifying. However, at this moment, a cold light flashed through the blood hell.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The blood hell froze for an instant, then began to collapse. All the resentment, killing intent, and gloom started to disappear.</p><p></p><p>Finally, everyone saw Jiang Buping holding a long spear, which had pierced the middle head of the blood-colored monster. Cracks were appearing all over the monster's body, and blood-colored smoke was rising as it began to dissolve.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's expression changed drastically, her voice slightly trembling, "Second senior brother, are they chasing you because of me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head, "Junior sister, what are you thinking? They don't know you are my junior sister, it's just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Lingxiu heaved a sigh of relief, she had been too nervous and had forgotten about this.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying seemed to have thought of something, "Are you saying that they hired Meng Shushu to find the spiritual medicine treasure trove, because of the spiritual medicines in that place?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, what's wrong?" Su Lingxiu asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, they want to use a sixth-grade spiritual medicine to lure you out, because they think..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying did not continue.</p><p></p><p>But Su Lingxiu understood the reason, her expression darkening.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his bald head, "Junior sister, just tell us what's going on, don't hide anything. They are not that formidable, the eldest senior brother has already killed many of them, and the grand master has killed three."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was silent for a moment, then said, "Actually, I don't know what force they belong to, I only know they are from a dark force, as for what they are called and why they want to capture me, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, "Junior sister, you don't know what force they belong to?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, she continued, "But I guess it might be related to my father, only... I don't know who my father is, I don't even know his name."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Su Lingxiu's expression became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment. Su Lingxiu didn't even know who her own father was. After a long while, he comforted, "Junior sister, your teachers are like fathers to you. You have your master and I and the eldest senior brother, no one can bully you!"</p><p></p><p>"I know, I'm no longer alone and helpless," Su Lingxiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly, Su Lingxiu's background sounded a bit melodramatic. Could her father be some extraordinary figure?</p><p></p><p>Since they had already mentioned the black-robed people and her enemies, Su Lingxiu no longer concealed anything and told the whole story.</p><p></p><p>"They should be looking for the sixth-grade spiritual medicine, their purpose is to lure me out. They don't know that my mother has already passed away, no matter how many spiritual medicines there are, they can't bring her back.</p><p></p><p>"My mother was actually a grand master cultivator, but after giving birth to me, her body deteriorated day by day, and she passed away when I was ten years old. I've been living with my grandfather... or rather, my maternal grandfather."</p><p></p><p>According to Su Lingxiu, she had never known her father, and her mother never mentioned him. She even took her mother's surname. Her mother's vitality seemed to have been consumed after giving birth to her, and her health declined day by day until she passed away when Su Lingxiu was ten.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had studied medicine diligently, all for the sake of her mother. But her mother ultimately passed away when she was ten. After that, she had been living with her grandfather.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, there had been an attack by a grand master cultivator who wanted to capture her, but they had underestimated Su Lingxiu's grandfather's strength and were killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's grandfather had realized the seriousness of the problem, so he took Su Lingxiu and Zhou Ying to hide. But a grand master from the force the black-robed people belonged to came to attack them.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had hidden under Zhou Ying's guidance, waiting for her grandfather to return. But when her grandfather came back, he was already near death, and after hastily telling Su Lingxiu to hide, he perished.</p><p></p><p>After that, Zhou Ying had led Su Lingxiu to flee to the remote border regions.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, your grandfather was a grand master?" Meng Chong asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>The silent Zhou Ying then spoke, "The old master's name was Medical King Su Zhen, he was skilled in medicine and healing all kinds of cultivator injuries. The old master was preparing to join the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to seek their protection, but he didn't make it in time."</p><p></p><p>"To treat Miss, the old master had used up all the connections he could, obtaining many spiritual medicines, and had settled the accounts with those people."</p><p></p><p>"So there was no powerful cultivator to help at the time," Zhou Ying said, referring to Su Lingxiu's mother as "Miss".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with admiration, no wonder Su Lingxiu's medical skills were so exceptional, her origins were indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu's mother, why her vitality was constantly declining after giving birth to her, Li Xuan had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had exceptional talent and a special physique. It was precisely because of this special physique that it had caused her mother's vitality to be greatly damaged, leading to her eventual death.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the black-robed people are after Su Lingxiu because of her physique? Or is it related to her birth father? Her birth father might really be an extraordinary person, another melodramatic family history," Li Xuan mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>But these were not important. Su Lingxiu was now his disciple, and she had cultivated the Dantian Martial Dao. No matter what her background was, she was his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Whoever dared to bully his disciple would be beaten to death!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at Zhou Ying, wanting to ask something but hesitating. Zhou Ying frowned and said, "Just ask whatever you want to ask."</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, sister's grandfather was a grand master, and her mother was a master, so why are you so weak?" Meng Chong asked awkwardly, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying didn't feel embarrassed at all, "My talent is poor. My family was ruined, it was the old master and Miss who adopted me since I was young. Due to my poor aptitude, the old master used his connections to get a sixth-grade spiritual medicine to help improve my physique.</p><p></p><p>"I've been taking spiritual medicines to nourish myself since I was five years old, constantly improving my aptitude. If there were no mishaps, I would also have the potential to become a grand master."</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Meng Chong understood, then said, "I heard that the Heavenly Dew Marrow can enhance one's talent. When Miss refines some medicinal pills, you can continue to improve your talent."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what the black-robed people's purpose was in capturing Su Lingxiu, since they were enemies, they had to be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, don't worry, the black-robed people's identity won't be hidden for long. What can a dark force do? Ultimately, there will be people who know about them. When the time comes, my eldest senior brother and I will go and raid their stronghold!" Meng Chong said with a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"Their strength is actually quite formidable, we still need to be careful. As for revenge, I'm not in a hurry. When my strength is sufficient, I can naturally find them all and bury them!" Su Lingxiu clenched her fists.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Zhou Ying, not asking anything. He could tell that Zhou Ying was hiding something. Regarding Su Lingxiu's background and the black-robed people's purpose, she probably knew some things.</p><p></p><p>Since she didn't say anything, even keeping it from Su Lingxiu, there must be some concerns.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong brought back a large amount of spiritual medicines, Su Lingxiu immersed herself in researching medicinal pills again, constantly combining new pill formulas based on the properties of the spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>For example, pills suitable for Meng Chong's cultivation of the Flesh Dao. The Flesh Dao cultivation focused on tempering the flesh, so the medicinal pills would emphasize refining the flesh, opening the meridians, and nurturing the golden body. The spiritual medicines used would be those with properties focused on the flesh.</p><p></p><p>According to the lord-minister...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Relying on the theories of the Zuo Shi, Su Lingxiu diligently researched and developed the elixir formula.</p><p></p><p>For the first time using spiritual medicines to refine the elixir, she dared not be the slightest bit careless. She first practiced with ninth-grade spiritual medicines, and after becoming adept at elixir refinement, she would then raise the grade of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>The flame burned beneath the elixir furnace, Su Lingxiu's expression solemn, her hands enveloped in raging spiritual flames, and with the addition of the spiritual fire stone, she began the first batch of elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, this attempt failed.</p><p></p><p>The elixir turned out lumpy.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was made from spiritual medicines, even if it was lumpy, its effects were far stronger than those refined from ordinary medicines.</p><p></p><p>The red cat was greatly excited. </p><p></p><p>It licked up two of the failed elixirs and felt a bit bloated, lying at the doorway to digest.</p><p></p><p>After two failed batches, the third batch of elixir succeeded, twelve elixir pills, emanating a misty fragrance, with a faint luster on the surface of the pills.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, this is a Strengthening Elixir, you can try it and see if it's effective!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu excitedly handed the elixir to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly excited, as he also wanted to break through to the Great Solar Golden Body Perfection as soon as possible, so that he could then go and defeat the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>After taking one elixir pill, he began to refine it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a glance and knew the result. The Strengthening Elixir was indeed a ninth-grade spiritual medicine elixir with a powerful effect, but for Meng Chong who cultivated the Great Solar Golden Body, the effect would be ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physical body had already reached a level almost comparable to a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, how is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had an expectant look on her face.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and said, "The effect is average, but for other martial artists, the effect should be amazing!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pondered, the characteristics of various spiritual medicines flashing in her mind. She planned to upgrade the Strengthening Elixir, as her Second Senior Brother's physique was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary elixirs would not have much effect on him.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, don't worry, I will refine elixirs that are suitable for your cultivation for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Just do your best, I can cultivate without elixirs as well."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not too eager about it.</p><p></p><p>He gave the remaining Strengthening Elixirs to Zhou Ying and Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Xuan decided to display a trick, and a elixir formula emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Golden Body Elixir! "The Dao of Elixir is vast and profound, do not be limited to herbs and plants, do not restrict yourself. Today, I will demonstrate for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, not even standing up.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and several spiritual medicines flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully, this time I will demonstrate the Void Elixir Refinement Technique, and refine a batch of Golden Body Elixir!"</p><p></p><p>With a slap of his hand, in the void, it was as if an elixir furnace appeared, formed from the condensation of true qi.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual medicines were thrown into the void elixir furnace, and raging elixir flames instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, the spiritual medicines were melting, extracting the essence, refining away the impurities, the essences of the various spiritual medicines fusing together, undergoing a transformation.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden light emerged, and in the void elixir furnace, twelve faintly golden elixir pills appeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu did not blink an eye, her heart greatly shocked, this Void Elixir Refinement was truly profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"I've just started, I'm still so far away from the realm my Master is at."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Body Elixir was successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan casually waved his hand, and the Golden Body Elixir flew to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly accepted it, "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>After taking one Golden Body Elixir, a surge of potent medicinal power instantly infused into his physical body, and a faint golden glow appeared on Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Body Elixir is an elixir for cultivators of the Physical Martial Dao, you two are not Physical Martial Dao cultivators, do not casually consume it, or you will harm your physical bodies and foundations, which would be a loss."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan warned Shi Er and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he breathed a sigh of relief. This Void Elixir Refinement Technique consumed too much, it was not something a Xiantian Realm cultivator could display. His strength was a hundred times that of his peers, yet even he almost lost control when using the Void Elixir Refinement Technique.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"I almost crashed and burned."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan secretly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If the elixir refinement had failed, as the peerless high-level master, he would have been in an awkward situation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, relying on his strength a hundred times that of his peers, as well as the Void Elixir Refinement Technique that he seemed to have innately grasped, he was able to successfully refine the Golden Body Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this Void Elixir Refinement Technique..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was greatly excited, massaging her Master's shoulders while looking at him expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is too low, even if I teach it to you, you won't be able to cultivate it. First master the Qi and Blood Elixir Refinement, and when your strength has improved, then we can consider the Void Elixir Refinement Technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan realized that if he taught the Void Elixir Refinement Technique to Su Lingxiu now, she would not be able to cultivate it, nor could she use it as a foundation to comprehend even higher-level elixir refinement techniques.</p><p></p><p>So he decided not to teach it to Su Lingxiu for now.</p><p></p><p>When she had refined the Qi and Blood Elixir Refinement to the pinnacle, and broken through the Xiantian Realm, he would then teach her the Void Elixir Refinement Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master, don't worry, I'll break through the Xiantian Realm very soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu felt her Master's words made sense, she couldn't be too ambitious.</p><p></p><p>With the spiritual medicines, she could refine many more elixirs, and since she cultivated the Elixir Dao Martial Dao, she didn't need to worry about the elixirs damaging her foundation.</p><p></p><p>In this way, her cultivation speed would skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu used the elixir furnace to refine the Golden Body Elixir, the first batch naturally failed, and these failed elixirs were all food for the red cat.</p><p></p><p>After taking the Golden Body Elixir, Meng Chong went to the small mountain peak outside the manor and began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi delivered a jade box, and Su Lingxiu carefully stored the Heavenly Dew Marrow and sixth-grade spiritual medicines in the jade box, even burying it underground.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Su Lingxiu continuously refined elixirs, researched elixir formulas, and cultivated the martial dao, constantly consuming spiritual medicines, refining more and more elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood Elixir was a necessity, and the quantity was the most.</p><p></p><p>Refining the Qi and Blood Elixir with spiritual medicines, the effect was amazing, whether it was Zhou Ying or Shi Er, with the aid of the elixirs, their cultivation speed increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In addition, some of the Qi and Blood Elixirs were rewarded to Kou Ruozhi and the members of the Changqing Hall.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu used spiritual medicines, combined with precious medicines, to refine elixirs that could assist in the cultivation of the Refine Skin, Refine Bone, and Refine Viscera stages, for those just entering the martial dao to use.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Qi and Blood Elixir, there was also the Nurture Qi Elixir, a Xiantian Realm elixir that could nourish true qi and rapidly recover consumed true qi, as well as increase the cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>However, the Nurture Qi Elixir was not of much use to Meng Chong and Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Some of the refined elixirs were sent to the Donghe Prefecture Xu Family, delivered to Xu Junhe, for him to distribute as he saw fit.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan called Su Lingxiu over.</p><p></p><p>It was time to pass on the Elixir Dao Martial Classic to her.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Elixir Dao Martial Classic, Su Lingxiu's martial dao cultivation advanced further, the types of elixirs she could refine also increased, and her elixir refinement speed became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood Elixir Refinement Technique had become extremely proficient, ninth-grade spiritual medicine elixirs almost never failed.</p><p></p><p>As for eighth-grade spiritual medicine elixirs, the success rate was over 60%.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the elixir furnace was used to assist the refinement, the success rate of eighth-grade spiritual medicine elixirs would be close to 90%.</p><p></p><p>There was a bit of writer's block here...

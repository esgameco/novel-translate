        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu," the woman in plain clothes said softly as she approached.</p><p></p><p>"You've come at the right time. This is for you, to thank you for your help last time. If you ever have any trouble, I can lend you a hand."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a jade token and handed it to the woman.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you're too kind. Please keep the jade token."</p><p></p><p>The woman's eyes seemed to hold a smile.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't want it!" Xu Yan pushed the jade token back into her hand.</p><p></p><p>He didn't like owing favors to others, and since he no longer needed it, he naturally wouldn't keep it.</p><p></p><p>The woman felt a little regretful, but she didn't insist that Xu Yan take it. Instead, she took out a bag and handed it to him, saying, "This is a gift for you, Young Master Xu. There are 300,000 spirit crystals inside, as well as some stored spirit medicines at the Tianbao Pavilion that you can retrieve at any of their branches."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in puzzlement, "A gift?"</p><p></p><p>This was quite a generous amount - 300,000 spirit crystals, plus valuable spirit medicines. He wondered why she was thanking him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you killed the Killing Skeleton, so I've come to thank you. The Killing Skeleton had been terrorizing my Wushuang Hall for a long time, and we had a bounty on him. Now that you've killed him, you've avenged those from my Wushuang Hall who lost their lives to him. So I naturally want to express my gratitude to you."</p><p></p><p>The woman seemed very relieved and satisfied that the Killing Skeleton had been killed.</p><p></p><p>"The Killing Skeleton again?" Xu Yan was delighted. It seemed this Killing Skeleton was greatly hated. Although he hadn't been able to obtain any spirit crystals from him, only a skeleton staff, the bounty he received for killing him was a windfall.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't be polite." Xu Yan readily accepted the gift.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, where are you going?" the woman asked with a smile after Xu Yan had taken the items.</p><p></p><p>"To take over Canglan Island," Xu Yan replied frankly.</p><p></p><p>"Then if I want to contact you, how should I do it?"</p><p></p><p>"You can go to Canglan Island, or have Xie Brother relay the message," Xu Yan said after a moment of thought.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, if you have the time, please come to the Wushuang Hall for a visit," the woman said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a look when I have the time," Xu Yan replied evasively.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed to temper his mind, so there didn't seem to be a need to go to the Wushuang Hall. As for the beautiful woman? Beautiful women were not as interesting as the Dao of the Sword!</p><p></p><p>After the woman left, Xu Yan and the others continued on their way to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Killing Skeleton to be worth so much. Killing him has really made me a fortune!" Xu Yan marveled.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched. That woman from the Wushuang Hall was clearly just coming to give gifts. The excuse about the Killing Skeleton killing people from the Wushuang Hall was just a pretext.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wushuang Hall was not as powerful as the Sword Sovereign Cliff, it was still one of the top forces, with deep backing and many supporters. Not even the Fiend Extermination Venerable would dare to easily provoke the Wushuang Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Wushuang Grand Master was also a peak Grand Master, whose strength was not much weaker than the Fiend Extermination Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Both Du Yuying and the woman in plain clothes were rushing to give Xu Yan benefits. Xie Lingfeng was amazed - as the genius of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, the unique son of Xie Tianheng, he had never received such treatment.</p><p></p><p>He could only sigh that the truly extraordinary prodigies were welcomed wherever they went, especially by women.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the caution of the other party, afraid that one person would come, unable to deal with Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be a little worried, Xu Yan's strength was indeed strong, that was the power of his outburst, ordinary martial artists could hardly resist.</p><p></p><p>And the great Cheng Zongshi, the strength is far from that of the middle-level Zongshi, once they can withstand Xu Yan's attack, then it would not be so easy for Xu Yan to defeat the other party.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party is two people!</p><p></p><p>He and Hu Shan retreated while transmitting sound to Xu Yan, "Brother Xu, can you handle it? If not, let's retreat for now, and I'll have a Zongshi from Juesongyue come to assist."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, don't worry, these are just two good people who came to bring money."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan transmitted the sound back.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed people are all quite rich, and this is also a great Cheng Zongshi, naturally they are even richer. Killing these two people would be a windfall!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, not to mention, the matter of you seizing our spiritual medicine territory, tell me, where is Su Lingxiu?"</p><p></p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, "Want to know? It depends on whether the money pouches you have are heavy enough!"</p><p></p><p>"So you do know where the person is?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's voice was icy, full of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"I've already said, if you want to know, you'll have to show me your money pouches, see if they're heavy enough, take them out and let me take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>First lure the money pouches over, so that when the big battle starts, the force won't be too strong, and both the person and the money pouches won't be completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are two great Cheng Zongshi, he also dares not to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men's aura burst forth, the might of the great Cheng Zongshi, stirring the spiritual energy of the surrounding heaven and earth, like a storm, forming around the two of them.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure surged, like the might of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression tightened, no wonder they are great Cheng Zongshi, their strength is far beyond that of the middle-level Zongshi and below.</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton's strength is indeed very strong, but compared to these two great Cheng Zongshi, it is still lacking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the two Zongshi before him are obviously at the top of the great Cheng realm.</p><p></p><p>"Stirring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, as if controlling the might of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, although not as good as the Tong Xuan realm, but in harmony with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the profound power of heaven and earth, is also somewhat approaching."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's eyes lit up, the two great Cheng Zongshi, stirring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, forming a storm-like aura, the might is terrifying, such a scene, in his mind, evoked the image of the Tong Xuan realm's harmony with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the profound power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, his understanding of the Tong Xuan realm has greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan feels that he is almost able to fully comprehend the cultivation method of the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as he calms down and contemplates carefully, he will be able to understand the profundity of the Tong Xuan.</p><p></p><p>If he were to fight with the two before him, the harvest would certainly not be small.</p><p></p><p>The two great Cheng Zongshi, it seems that they have formed two heavenly and earthly storms, the might is terrifying, the martial artists on the Cangjiang all looked over in shock.</p><p></p><p>Great Zongshi experts? The nearby Zongshi martial artists are even more shocked, able to stir the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, like a heavenly and earthly storm, at least a great Cheng Zongshi expert.</p><p></p><p>And not just one! That's the direction of Canglan Island?</p><p></p><p>There have long been rumors that the former island lord of Canglan Island, Yin Hong, was killed in the Seven Star Academy, and Canglan Island was handed over to the Sword Deity Xu Yan. Could it be that the great Cheng Zongshi are coming to target Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>No one dares to approach, they can only watch from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are indeed a genius, but if you don't want to die, just tell us where she is, otherwise you will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men split to the left and right, forming a pincer attack.</p><p></p><p>"No one can get any information from me, Xu Yan, without paying a price. If you want to know, bring out your money pouches. Otherwise, you can forget about knowing anything. Do you really think you two can kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered, disappearing from the original spot in an instant, and the next moment he was dozens of miles away, before the black-robed men could chase after him, his figure returned to the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly lightning! The speed is unimaginably fast.</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed men couldn't help but focus their gaze, if Xu Yan really wants to escape, they would have a hard time chasing him down.</p><p></p><p>"I've already said, bring out the money pouches, and everything will be fine!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, if you break your word, you will have no place in the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men compromised.</p><p></p><p>The whereabouts of Su Lingxiu is of great importance, as long as they can obtain the whereabouts of Su Lingxiu, the rest can be put aside for now.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Xu Yan's reputation is impeccable, you can rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Muttering in his heart: "As long as I kill you, who knows I broke my word? As long as no one knows, my reputation will still be impeccable!"</p><p></p><p>"Here!"</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed men took out the money pouches and threw them to Xu Yan, their curved knives flashing with light, as if they wanted to strike while Xu Yan was catching the money pouches.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan waved his hand, and a golden little dragon flew out, wrapping up the two money pouches, without letting down his guard at all, the black-robed men couldn't find an opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed in his heart, the money pouches were in his hands, he opened them and took a look, only to have his expression change.</p><p></p><p>"You two poor fellows, as great Cheng Zongshi, is this all the spirit stones you have? This trash pill, who cares about this kind of junk?</p><p></p><p>"Only two eighth-grade spiritual herbs, do you deserve the reputation of great Cheng Zongshi?</p><p></p><p>"This is an insult to me!"</p><p></p><p>Great Cheng Zongshi, but the result is only a few spirit tickets, totaling no more than ten thousand spirit stones, and as for those two pill bottles, Xu Yan didn't even care about them.</p><p></p><p>What kind of trash is this! The spiritual herbs are only two eighth-grade ones!</p><p></p><p>The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment! The two black-robed men were stunned for a moment, then their bodies started trembling with anger, the storm around them became more and more violent, the might becoming stronger and stronger, even showing signs of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Huge waves were stirred up on the Cangjiang.</p><p></p><p>They are great Cheng Zongshi, what a status, how could they carry a large amount of spirit tickets on them, it's just some healing pills, one spiritual herb, just in case. </p><p></p><p>With their strength, they can exchange the needed spirit stones at any Spirit Treasure Pavilion, why would they need to carry a large amount of spirit tickets on them?</p><p></p><p>This is a special treatment only for great Cheng Zongshi and above.</p><p></p><p>But this little guy actually insulted them like this! "You should die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The storm swept across, two figures, wrapped in overwhelming might, came rushing in from the left and right, the Cangjiang surging into huge waves, crashing down from the air.</p><p></p><p>The two fierce sword lights burst forth in the storm, pouring out from the huge waves.</p><p></p><p>When the great Cheng Zongshi strike, it is earth-shattering! Roar! The sound of dragon roars echoed, eighteen golden giant dragons burst forth, rushing towards the surging waves, as if the golden dragons were riding the water, smoothing the raging waves!</p><p></p><p>Sword lights rolled up layer upon layer, the mountains and rivers descended, the dragon roar resounded.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers, dragon roar!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan dared not to be careless, since the money pouches were already in his hands, and they were just two poor great Zongshi, there was no need to hold back.</p><p></p><p>He struck with full force, facing two with one!</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

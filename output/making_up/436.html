        <h1>Chapter 436</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fled from a city while cursing, with two Immortal Venerable Lords chasing after him to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"I almost succeeded. I need to be more careful next time. The Treasure Alliance is really lying in wait for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fled rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He had just been about to completely loot the Treasure Alliance's branch in this city, but discovered Immortal Venerable Lords lying in ambush, so he could only flee.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, stop running!" </p><p></p><p>One of the Immortal Venerable Lords shouted with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"You Treasure Alliance already know I didn't kill that person, yet you still insist on hunting me down. Since you're unwilling to reconcile, don't blame me, Meng Chong."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered. By now, the Treasure Alliance must know he wasn't the killer.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you looted our Treasure Alliance branch. How can we let this matter go just like that!"</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous. Wasn't it your Treasure Alliance that targeted me first? Wrongly accused me first? You should compensate me, shouldn't you? That was compensation for your false accusations!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Venerable Lords snorted coldly and continued their frenzied pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked back and shook his head. His speed suddenly increased dramatically, and he soon shook off his pursuers.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the Longcloud Realm anymore."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed. The Treasure Alliance had already sent two Immortal Venerable Lords. It was foreseeable that if they still couldn't catch him, the next step might be Yan Shan coming personally.</p><p></p><p>Or they might send multiple Immortal Venerable Lords. Once he appeared, he could easily be surrounded.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I've accumulated quite a few treasures. I'll leave the Longcloud Realm. Once I break through, I won't fear the Treasure Alliance's Immortal Venerable Lords anymore."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>After putting on a wig and disguising himself, he prepared to leave the Longcloud Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With my current appearance, I wonder if I can fool the Immortal Venerable Lords at the realm gate?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"With my control over my physical body, they definitely won't be able to detect the changes I've made. Meng Chong is bald, but I have this head of thick hair. No one would think I'm Meng Chong."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong decided to go directly to the Longcloud Realm's gate to cross over and leave.</p><p></p><p>If the defenses were truly strict and there was a risk of exposure, he would change course and cross the wilderness to leave.</p><p></p><p>With this plan in mind, Meng Chong set off towards Longcloud City, where the realm gate was located.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, passing through several cities, the bounty on him increased again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, everyone entering the cities was carefully scrutinized.</p><p></p><p>"The Treasure Alliance is really wealthy and generous!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>As expected of the Divine Realm's number one merchant alliance, the bounty was so high that even he was tempted.</p><p></p><p>As he neared Longcloud City, Meng Chong became more cautious. To prevent his escape, the Treasure Alliance would definitely conduct strict searches in Longcloud City.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, all the major powers in the Longcloud Realm had gotten involved.</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape. Today is the day you die!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then came the sounds of battle. A young man was fighting while fleeing, looking very miserable. He was already injured.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really have to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Song You, as long as you're alive you're a hidden danger. Only when you're dead will we be at ease."</p><p></p><p>"Don't dream of escaping the Longcloud Realm. Even if you manage to leave by luck, as long as you're in a realm where the Treasure Alliance is present, we'll quickly find your trail."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised an eyebrow. Judging by their attire, the warriors surrounding and trying to kill Song You seemed to be from a subordinate force of the Treasure Alliance. Warriors from this force had previously been searching for his own whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's related to the Treasure Alliance, I might as well intervene."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered.</p><p></p><p>His eyes scanned the surroundings. There were no Immortal Venerable Lords hiding, nor any ambushes. This pursuit was not a trap.</p><p></p><p>The three people fighting were all at the peak of True King Venerable Lord realm. Song You's strength was not weak among True King Venerable Lords, but he was still outmatched fighting one against two.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was injured, clearly having gone through several battles and been surrounded multiple times without a chance to heal.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong suddenly attacked, his fist blasting out and directly obliterating one of the people chasing Song You! This sudden turn of events stunned the other warrior pursuing Song You.</p><p></p><p>Song You was also dumbfounded, cold sweat breaking out on his face, but then he became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was not an enemy!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, how dare you interfere in our Song family's..."</p><p></p><p>The remaining warrior retreated while shouting threateningly, though his voice betrayed his fear.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, he realized the attacker was a bald young man with an extremely muscular build.</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed in shock: "You- you're Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>His heart began to tremble. To think it was Meng Chong who had intervened. This man was a god of death! No one but Immortal Venerable Lords could match him.</p><p></p><p>True King Venerable Lords were like little chicks in his hands, obliterated with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Flee! At this moment, he no longer dared to threaten using the Song family name.</p><p></p><p>This was someone who didn't even fear the Treasure Alliance, let alone a mere subordinate force of the Treasure Alliance.</p><p></p><p>When Meng Chong attacked, he had already removed his wig, restoring his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>Another punch blasted out, instantly obliterating the fleeing warrior!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Song You was stunned. Those were peak True King Venerable Lord realm warriors, yet they were obliterated with a single punch each? There were rumors that Meng Chong had killed dozens of True King Venerable Lords who had surrounded him, but he thought it was an exaggeration that grew with each retelling.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had witnessed it, given how Meng Chong could obliterate True King Venerable Lords with a single punch, it wasn't just dozens - he could probably sweep through hundreds of True King Venerable Lords!</p><p></p><p>This was already comparable to an Immortal Venerable Lord, right? If he had this kind of strength, how could he worry about not avenging his great grudge?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, Song You thanks you for saving my life!"</p><p></p><p>Song You gratefully bowed.</p><p></p><p>"You've offended the Treasure Alliance too?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't offended the Treasure Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Song You shook his head and said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then why? The people chasing you are a subordinate force of the Treasure Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"The Song family wasn't originally a subordinate force of the Treasure Alliance. I used to be a member of the Song family, and was even the young family head..."</p><p></p><p>Song You's expression became dejected as he explained the whole story.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened in amazement. Song You's experience was somewhat similar to his own past experience.</p><p></p><p>Song You was the son of the former head of the Song family, a top family in White Wood City. He used to be highly respected.</p><p></p><p>However, a hundred years ago, his parents participated in suppressing a disturbance in the Heavenly Abyss, and unexpectedly perished.</p><p></p><p>The position of family head was then seized, and he was even expelled from the Song family. They even secretly tried to assassinate him. If Song You hadn't been away from White Wood City at the time, he likely would have been killed.</p><p></p><p>The death of his parents was somewhat suspicious. After all, his father was an Immortal Venerable Lord - how could he perish so easily?</p><p></p><p>So he began to secretly investigate, and even privately appealed to the family elders. Who would have thought the elders seemed to be involved as well.</p><p></p><p>Now, everyone in the Song family was involved, and the elders who had supported his parents had all died in various "accidents" one by one.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until three years ago that Song You finally found a clue. </p><p></p><p>"My parents..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"His death is likely related to the masked man!" Song You said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Masked man?" Meng Chong took out two masks - a Tiansha mask and a Diying mask. "Which mask was it?"</p><p></p><p>Song You was stunned, looking at Meng Chong in shock, momentarily suspecting he was in league with the masked men. </p><p></p><p>He pointed at the Diying mask and said, "This mask!"</p><p></p><p>Then he cautiously asked, "Brother Meng, this is..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I killed the owners of these masks!" Meng Chong said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>Song You sighed in relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"I sympathize with your situation. Moreover, the Song family now is not the Song family of the past..." Meng Chong patted Song You's shoulder, causing him to wince as if he was about to fall apart.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, Brother Meng?" Song You's eyes lit up. Was Meng offering to help him?</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you must take revenge yourself. Only revenge taken by your own hands is truly satisfying," Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Song family of Baimu City was affiliated with the Wanbao Alliance, whose headquarters in the Changyun region was in Baimu City. All signs indicated that the deaths of Yan Shan and his disciple were connected to the Song family, who had framed him.</p><p></p><p>The Song family had already become a hidden force of Tiansha and Diying.</p><p></p><p>"I want to take revenge myself, even if it costs me my life. But with my current strength, I would only be throwing my life away without achieving any vengeance!" Song You said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"Although I consider my talent decent, breaking through to the Immortal realm is too difficult. Without great opportunity and luck, I fear it's hopeless in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"How many geniuses more talented than me have been stopped before the Immortal realm? Let alone me now, without any backing or guidance, and not exceptionally gifted.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Song family would never allow me to break through to Immortal. They would do everything to kill me. If not for Brother Meng's rescue this time, I likely wouldn't have escaped."</p><p></p><p>Song You grew more desperate and dejected as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded. Though Song You looked young, he was at least over a hundred years old. With his talent, without resources or guidance, unless he suddenly encountered great luck and opportunity, he had no hope of breaking through to the Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm in this life.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal realm was an insurmountable barrier for many True Kings and Heavenly Venerables. </p><p></p><p>Countless former geniuses of great powers ultimately stopped before the Immortal realm, unable to take that step.</p><p></p><p>Those who could break through to Immortal were one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, even if I broke through to Immortal, I couldn't kill the main culprit," Song You sighed.</p><p></p><p>The current head of the Song family was an Immortal Heavenly Venerable. For an ordinary Immortal Heavenly Venerable to kill another was nearly impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, in your situation, revenge is not impossible. If your own strength is insufficient, you can borrow external power," Meng Chong said thoughtfully, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng must be joking. The Song family is affiliated with the Wanbao Alliance and has an Immortal Heavenly Venerable. Where could I borrow external power from? Who would be willing to offend the Wanbao Alliance and make an enemy of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable for my sake?" Song You shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask you, are you truly willing to give your life for revenge?" Meng Chong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course! If I can have my revenge, what does death matter? In my situation, I could be killed any day. To die without avenging myself would be even more worthless."</p><p></p><p>Song You spoke with a resigned look.</p><p></p><p>He thought clearly - if dying could bring revenge, it would be worth it!</p><p></p><p>"Good. Since you have such resolve, I'll give you some guidance!" Meng Chong said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Some guidance?" Song You was puzzled. No amount of guidance could help him break through to Immortal, let alone take revenge single-handedly, right?</p><p></p><p>"To take revenge, you must borrow external power. Ordinary external power is beyond your reach, but you may be able to borrow the power of the Wanbao Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong narrowed his eyes and began instructing Song You on how to take revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, how can I borrow the power of the Wanbao Alliance?" Song You was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Shanhe, the leader of the Wanbao Alliance, has an only son. If his son were killed, or even seriously injured, how would Yan Shanhe react?"</p><p></p><p>"He would go mad and kill the attacker, no matter who it was."</p><p></p><p>"So, you attack Yan Shanhe's son, and use the Wanbao Alliance's power to destroy the Song family!"</p><p></p><p>"How could that work?" </p><p></p><p>Song You was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't imagine that Meng Chong's guidance would be to attack Yan Shanhe's son! Moreover, wouldn't attacking Yan Shanhe's son just get him killed faster? How would it relate to the Song family?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed. This Song You was too foolish - he didn't even know this method of revenge? This was how he himself had taken revenge before.</p><p></p><p>Though the Wanbao Alliance wasn't the Wu Kingdom, since the Song family was a subordinate power, this would still be considered rebellion. How could the Wanbao Alliance not be enraged? Moreover, the Song family had only joined the Wanbao Alliance a hundred years ago and wasn't truly trusted. Song You was also the son of the former family head - there was much that could be done with this.</p><p></p><p>For example, expelling and pursuing Song You could be an act, to distance themselves from the Song family when attacking Yan Shanhe's son.</p><p></p><p>If handled properly, how could Yan Shanhe believe this had nothing to do with the Song family?</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Yan Shanhe's son has the potential to break through to Immortal Heavenly Venerable. He's Yan Shanhe's weak spot - whoever touches him will die.</p><p></p><p>"You attack Yan Shanhe's son and implicate the Song family. Make it seem like you were deliberately expelled by the Song family, that your parents' deaths were faked, that your Song family organization is planning something big, and that the target in Changyun is the Wanbao Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong carefully instructed Song You on how to implicate the Song family, how to accidentally leak secrets, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"The Song family only joined the Wanbao Alliance a hundred years ago. Do you think they could become a core power of the Wanbao Alliance? Could they be fully trusted by the Wanbao Alliance?" Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Song You was stunned. Could revenge really be taken this way?</p><p></p><p>Looking at Meng Chong, he was dumbfounded. This muscular young man didn't seem like someone with many tricks up his sleeve or a cunning schemer. How could he come up with such an unbelievable method of revenge?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, you're brilliant!" Song You said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's settled then. This can be done. The Song family will be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Song You was now fired up, eager to attack Yan Shanhe's son immediately.</p><p></p><p>But then he deflated, saying, "Brother Meng, Yan Shanhe's son must have guards. They're surely not weak, and I suspect there may even be an Immortal Heavenly Venerable protecting him in secret!"</p><p></p><p>After all, with a dangerous person like Meng Chong around, Yan Shanhe must have greatly increased the protection of his son.</p><p></p><p>"That's a small matter. I already have a grudge with the Wanbao Alliance. I'll lure away the Immortal Heavenly Venerable to create an opportunity for you," Meng Chong said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"But my strength is still lacking," Song You said with a bitter expression. Even using secret techniques, it would be difficult to kill Yan Shanhe's son. Forget killing - he couldn't even injure him!</p><p></p><p>"Fine, I'll give you one more hand then," Meng Chong sighed. This Song You's strength really was lacking a bit. Without external assistance, he couldn't accomplish this task.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

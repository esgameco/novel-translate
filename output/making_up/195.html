            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This strike exhausted the entirety of Cold Man's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was an attempt at mutual destruction!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly snorted, slashing out with a sword, causing mountains and rivers to appear, enveloping that strike.</p><p></p><p>Within the mountains and rivers, a gentle breeze blew, caressing the icy long blade. Cold Man's spiritual consciousness was completely extinguished in that breeze.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of that strike had not dissipated.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it wanted to pierce through the mountains and rivers, continuing its onslaught.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The life-and-death sword wheel spun, grinding against the long blade, completely annihilating its might, causing the long blade to shatter and fall.</p><p></p><p>From then on, not a single enemy was left, all of them were killed!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed the white-robed blue-faced man from the Canglan River, as well as another corpse, bringing them back to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>He threw the bodies onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew around Xu Yan, that was the newly comprehended sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call this sword intent the 'Gentle Wind Sword Intent'," Xu Yan thought excitedly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also revealed a smile, this battle was good, allowing Xu Yan to comprehend the sword intent ahead of time, this was a sword intent that directly targeted the spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, your Gentle Wind Sword Intent has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>The system feedback came the moment Xu Yan comprehended the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The Gentle Wind Sword Intent was comprehended from the Xun trigram of the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>This battle came suddenly and ended quickly, it didn't even attract much attention.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the night gradually fell.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the lights were dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat went back to sleep, while Xie Lingfeng and the others were all filled with boiling blood, fully immersed in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The might of the Penetrating Mystery was truly immensely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to comprehend the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, summarizing the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had all her thoughts invested in the martial dao, she wanted to become strong, to face any danger alone, without relying on her master and senior brother's protection.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was also stimulated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was preparing to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was similarly stimulated, also beginning to prepare for a breakthrough to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone was immersed in cultivation, even Xu Mu, who had never been very diligent in cultivating the martial dao, was making a rare effort.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained carefree as always, as for the troubles brought by Su Ling Xiu, he didn't take them to heart.</p><p></p><p>As many as come, he would kill as many.</p><p></p><p>As for the hidden secrets behind this, he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>This battle on Canglan Island seemed to have not caused any waves in the martial dao world, as if no one knew about it.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of four Half-Step Heavenly Beings and dozens of peak Grand Masters seemed to have not caused any ripples.</p><p></p><p>Only those who knew the inside story understood Canglan Island's strength.</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Palace of the Great Yue, in the Imperial Study.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor sat silently, seemingly waiting for news.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>A palace servant entered.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Changqing Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor asked in a deep voice, his spirit suddenly stirring.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Garment Guard, the Heaven's御 Guard, the Divine Halberd Army, and other elite forces of the Great Yue, were all prepared. Once Canglan Island was destroyed, he would immediately order them to march to the Great Wilderness and completely eliminate the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The two servants and the old Prince have not sent any news."</p><p></p><p>The servant lowered his head and said.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor slumped in the chair, his expression instantly withering, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>No news meant the result was obvious.</p><p></p><p>In order to destroy the Great Yue, the powerful experts dispatched this time were far beyond the previous ones, especially with four Half-Step Heavenly Beings! One of them was the foundation of the Great Yue, that old Prince.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Great Yue Emperor waved his hand, dismissing the person, and at the same time prepared to withdraw the Heaven's Garment Guard, the Heaven's御 Guard, and other elite forces that were ready to attack the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>He could not let any information leak out.</p><p></p><p>If this attack was related to the Great Yue, it would certainly invite retaliation from the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's expression was dejected. What he needed to do next was to stabilize the situation in the Great Yue and find a way to establish good relations with the Great Wilderness. For this, he steeled himself and found an excuse to establish commercial ties with the Great Wilderness, completely ceding the Yunfeng Prefecture to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Lanping and Yunfeng Prefectures were both ceded to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Great Yue, the other forces that participated in the operation also became low-key.</p><p></p><p>They all began to shrink their spheres of influence.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the inner domain of the martial dao world had quietly changed.</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Palace of the Yan Kingdom, the Yan Emperor's expression was calm as he looked at the old eunuch below and asked, "Uncle, is he really dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Your Majesty, no one survived!" the old eunuch nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then issue an order, saying that the Uncle has gone into seclusion and is no longer involved in court affairs. From today on, the Black Mysterious Guard will answer to me..."</p><p></p><p>The Yan Emperor's eyes held no sorrow, but rather a sense of relief. Although the imperial house had lost a true pillar, he could now truly be the Emperor of the Yan Kingdom! The situation in the Yan court changed in a single day, and the Yan Emperor now held absolute power.</p><p></p><p>In a small mountain village, the Magic Child was carving a piece of wood in his hands when a figure slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a red robe, with a blue mask on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Child's hand paused, and he looked up at the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a hint of surprise, he said, "They're all dead?"</p><p></p><p>If the White Robe was not dead, the one coming would be the White Robe, not the Red Robe.</p><p></p><p>"They failed," the Red Robe with the blue mask said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"How many?" the Magic Child asked, his expression becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"The White Robe, Cold Man, and two others, one from the Great Yue and one from the Yan Kingdom, as well as dozens of peak Grand Masters."</p><p></p><p>The Red Robe's tone gradually became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Heavenly Beings?" the Magic Child struggled to utter those four words.</p><p></p><p>With such a lineup, aside from true Martial Dao Heavenly Beings, who could have annihilated so many powerful experts? Yet not a single one escaped! Four Half-Step Heavenly Beings, if they had not encountered a true Martial Dao Heavenly Being, there was no way they could all have been killed, let alone dozens of peak Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>The only ones with such terrifying strength would be true Martial Dao Heavenly Beings!</p><p></p><p>The Red Robe spoke in a deep voice, "Why would there be Martial Dao Heavenly Beings in the inner domain? The rumor is that the Demon Master came from the Spiritual Domain's gate. You are the Demon Master's true confidant, you understand the secrets better than anyone."</p><p></p><p>The Magic Child fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have flashbacks to his childhood, when he went to the mountain to collect medicinal herbs and saw a man lying on the ground, covered in blood and barely breathing.</p><p></p><p>He crushed a precious spiritual herb and poured it into the man's mouth, then called his parents to bring the man back. </p><p></p><p>This act changed the trajectory of his life.</p><p></p><p>That man taught him the martial dao, took him around to kill martial artists, and established the Demon Sect, until the man mysteriously disappeared one day, and the Magic Child returned to this small mountain village.</p><p></p><p>"Magic Child, don't you want to become a true Martial Dao Heavenly Being? The Demon Master has already disappeared, whether he entered the Spiritual Domain's gate or died, don't you have any thoughts about it? </p><p></p><p>"Do you really want to die an old man in this mountain village?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Robe spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child raised his head and let out a sigh, saying, "If he has returned to the Spiritual Realm's gate, he might take me with him. Since there is a Martial Dao Celestial in the Inner Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Azure-Faced man immediately understood the Demon Child's meaning. If there really was a Martial Dao Celestial on Canglan Island, then the disappearance of the Demon Lord might be related to him. "With our power, we cannot contend against a Martial Dao Celestial. At the peak of the Inner Realm's Grand Masters, they have already reached the pinnacle of the Martial Dao. Who doesn't want to advance further?"</p><p></p><p>You Red Absolute relied on what to take that step, having a clear understanding in your heart. The Five-Colored Stone Lingering Grass nourished your spiritual will, allowing you to take that step.</p><p></p><p>"If there is a path beyond the Grand Masters, but it is controlled by someone, you say that all the Grand Masters in the world know about it, what would they think?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child said with a piercing gaze.</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Azure-Faced man took a deep breath and said solemnly, "In the end, we have to take this step. Apart from this, there is no other way. We shall use the martial artists of the Inner Realm to threaten that Martial Dao Celestial."</p><p></p><p>"I will take action, and the other Half-Step Celestials in the Inner Realm will also act, especially those who are old and about to reach the end of their lifespan."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child lowered his head and continued carving the statue.</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Azure-Faced man turned and left, saying, "I will await the Demon Child's arrival at any time!"</p><p></p><p>After the Red-Robed Azure-Faced man disappeared, the Demon Child finally stopped his carving, his gaze profound, and the figure of someone full of heroic spirit and looking down on the world emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Blood Spirit, did you die at his hands? You said you were a Refining Spirit Celestial, an existence at the pinnacle of Celestials, and you boasted that you would take me with you to break into the Spiritual Realm's gate..."</p><p></p><p>In this Inner Realm, no one understood the Demon Lord better than him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Azure-Faced people's forces, along with some powerful figures like the Demon Child, were brewing a storm, gathering all the Grand Masters in the world to threaten Canglan Island. Of course, Li Xuan was completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew, he wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, what could the Grand Masters in the world do to him?</p><p></p><p>On the peak of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood with his hands behind his back, overlooking the vast Canglan River, with Xu Yan respectfully standing by his side.</p><p></p><p>After a period of settling, the Xun Wind Sword Intent had been perfected, and Xu Yan's sword dao had also improved, not far from the complete mastery of the Sword Heart.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his comprehension of the Penetrating Profound realm was becoming deeper and deeper.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from the small success of the Penetrating Profound realm.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you have already reached the Penetrating Profound realm. Do you have any insights regarding what is beyond the Penetrating Profound realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Today, he was going to pass on the fourth realm of the Martial Dao to Xu Yan, the Martial Dao laws beyond the Penetrating Profound realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, above the Grand Masters is the Martial Dao Celestials, and the Martial Dao Celestials cultivate their spiritual consciousness. Is it the same for what is beyond the Penetrating Profound realm?" Xu Yan respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"The three realms of the Martial Dao - Qi and Blood, Innate, and Penetrating Profound - are ultimately about cultivating the mysteries of the human body. Using the flesh and blood, one grasps the power of the Penetrating Profound.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth realm of the Martial Dao cultivates the mysteries that transcend the human body, cultivating the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness!" Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>How to cultivate and connect the realm beyond the Penetrating Profound, Li Xuan had thought about it since Meng Chong almost died at the hands of that "Senior Wu".</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the other party had been possessed, Li Xuan had an idea, and it was this that triggered him to start compiling the cultivation method for the fourth realm of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had guessed, above the Grand Masters, they cultivate the Spiritual Soul! Only by possessing the Spiritual Soul can one have the power of possession.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Hidden Pavilion's Master or the Azure-Faced people, they were all Half-Step Celestials, and they had not refined the Spiritual Soul, only cultivating a powerful spiritual body, not yet transforming into the Spiritual Soul.</p><p></p><p>Although it was so, taking the Half-Step Celestials as a reference, Li Xuan could also roughly deduce that the Spiritual Body cultivated by the Martial Dao Celestials, whether it was called the Spiritual Body or the Spiritual Soul, was still relatively weak, not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Spiritual Soul also has gradations of strength and weakness.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Penetrating Profound, Li Xuan had already determined the cultivation direction - to cultivate the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness. This is a crucial realm, and after realizing that above the Grand Masters, they might be cultivating the Spiritual Soul.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, in order to maintain the superiority of the Martial Dao he had compiled, had racked his brains to make it as profound as possible, while still being self-consistent and seamlessly connected to the Penetrating Profound.</p><p></p><p>After continuously slaying the Half-Step Celestials, Li Xuan had great confidence in this.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness?" Xu Yan was extremely excited, focusing intently, not wanting to miss even a single word.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan solemnly began to speak, "Open the Mud Pill Palace, nourish the Spirit Platform, refine the Spiritual Consciousness; the form of the Spiritual Consciousness is the foundation of the Primordial Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>The fourth realm of the Martial Dao, the Spiritual Consciousness Realm! The cultivation of the Spiritual Consciousness Realm lies in opening the Mud Pill Palace, nourishing the Spirit Platform, and refining the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness on the Spirit Platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had carefully considered this set of theories, initially worried that the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness refined in the Spiritual Consciousness Realm would not be strong enough.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing the Half-Step Celestials, he found that the Spiritual Consciousness Realm still maintained a powerful advantage.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to explain the Spiritual Consciousness Realm, "The form of the Spiritual Consciousness is like the True Self, comprehending the Heaven and Earth on the Spirit Platform, refining the will of Heaven and Earth into my will, refining the form of the Spiritual Consciousness, this is the foundation of the Primordial Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>After a lengthy explanation, Li Xuan raised his hand to point out the location of the Mud Pill Palace and said, "The fourth realm of the Martial Dao, opening the Mud Pill Palace, nourishing the Spirit Platform, if the Mud Pill Palace is not opened, the soul and spirit have no place to sense, the Spirit Platform has no place to be built, naturally everything is just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the first step is to open the Mud Pill Palace, nourish the Spirit Platform, refine the Spiritual Consciousness, the form being the True Self.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the will of Heaven and Earth as my will, refining the form of Heaven and Earth as the spiritual form; my will is the will of Heaven, my form is the form of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Consciousness reaching where the will of Heaven reaches, the will of Heaven cannot be violated!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened intently, his heart filled with longing, murmuring, "The will of Heaven is my will, the form of Heaven is my form; I refine the Spiritual Consciousness like the will of Heaven, the will of Heaven cannot be violated!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he seemed to see that his Spiritual Consciousness reaching where, would be like the will of Heaven descending, with no one able to resist or defy it!</p><p></p><p>Those who resist will be destroyed, those who defy will be executed, all in a single thought! How powerful is this! The Martial Dao Celestials are merely spiritual pressure, suppressing the consciousness of martial artists, but the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness is like the will of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Those who violate the will of Heaven can be executed with a single thought! Under the Spiritual Consciousness, all are like ants!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shaken. He felt that even if he had completely mastered the Penetrating Profound, if he encountered a Spiritual Consciousness Realm cultivator, he would be hard-pressed to resist, almost unable to contend against them.</p><p></p><p>Unless his Sword Intent had become strong enough to resist the Martial Dao Spiritual Consciousness!</p><p></p><p>But what if the other party had also comprehended the Sword Intent?</p><p></p><p>The cultivator of the Spiritual Consciousness Realm, their mastery of the Sword Intent, how powerful would it be? Xu Yan realized that the Spiritual Consciousness Realm was a watershed, a huge transformation and leap, so even if the Penetrating Profound was strong, it could not contend against the Spiritual Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Penetrating Profound is in harmony with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, possessing the profound power of Heaven and Earth, but can it resist the will of Heaven? No, it cannot!</p><p></p><p>The Penetrating Profound can resist and attack the Martial Dao Celestials, but it can hardly resist the cultivator of the Spiritual Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Yan suddenly felt that the so-called Martial Dao Celestials were so weak, unworthy of the title "Celestial".</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Sword Intent surged, as if it wanted to merge with Heaven and Earth, as if it wanted to represent the will of Heaven. Mountains and rivers appeared, as if it wanted to transform into the form of the entire Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, there was a surge of enlightenment, and the Martial Dao laws of the Spiritual Consciousness Realm one by one emerged, the more he contemplated, the more profound and unfathomable he felt it to be.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful it seemed.</p><p></p><p>My will is the will of Heaven, my form is the form of Heaven!

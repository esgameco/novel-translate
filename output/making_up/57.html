            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 57 Compiling the Cultivation Method for the Second Disciple</p><p></p><p>After listening to Shi Er's explanation, Li Xuan shook his head and lightly laughed, "Merely a few thousand li, and you call it an endless great mountain? That's just the perspective of the common folk!"</p><p></p><p>He revealed his image as a superior person.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shi Er's body trembled, and his breathing became heavier.</p><p></p><p>"He is truly an extraordinary superior person! In his eyes, we are just common folk. What we see as an endless great mountain is nothing to him!"</p><p></p><p>His heart was burning with excitement. If he could get some guidance from this superior person, perhaps he could also transcend the common folk?</p><p></p><p>"Senior is right, it is only because we ordinary people are weak and unable to overcome it that we call it an endless great mountain!" Shi Er said humbly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has shocked the capital of Qi State, collapsing the worldview of the officials. Your mysterious aura has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious aura instantly increased by more than double.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Shi Er's expression changed, and he bent his waist even lower, his attitude becoming increasingly respectful and fervent.</p><p></p><p>An extraordinary person!</p><p></p><p>In this instant, the person sitting in the chair gave him a feeling of mystery, grandeur, and profundity, as if he was a reclusive superior person who did not exist in the world.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pleasantly surprised that his mysterious aura could be further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could feel that after using the mysterious aura, he had become more enigmatic and had an even more extraordinary person's aura.</p><p></p><p>He was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>Permit Yan, his disciple, had already gone to the capital of Qi State to show off.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, signaling Shi Er to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan called out.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are your instructions?"</p><p></p><p>The bald young man Meng Chong hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan picked up a nine-leaf primordial spirit herb and said, "Cut off a piece and go cook it in chicken soup!"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't had chicken soup cooked with nine-leaf primordial spirit herb for a long time, and he was a bit craving for it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the nine-leaf primordial spirit herb and went to continue cooking.</p><p></p><p>Having disciples to serve him, this was a carefree and comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan lay back in the chair, squinting his eyes, and began to ponder what cultivation method he should pass on to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Refining skin, refining bones, refining organs, reaching the qi and blood realm... This set of cultivation methods was compiled for Permit Yan. Passing it on to Meng Chong is obviously not suitable. I need to create a new cultivation method to achieve great results.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the martial dao, refining skin, bones, and organs is necessary, but the cultivation method can be different.</p><p></p><p>"When Permit Yan cultivated, he only knew some crude martial arts of the jianghu, at the third-rate level? Meng Chong has a robust physique, with innate strength beyond that of ordinary people, so although he is only a first-rate jianghu expert, he can still contend with the pinnacle jianghu experts...</p><p></p><p>"Since Meng Chong's talent lies in his physical body, I shall start from this aspect and compile a new cultivation method to see if he can cultivate it successfully.</p><p></p><p>"If he can cultivate it successfully, in the future when I take in disciples, I will have a direction to follow."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to start from Meng Chong's talent and compile a new cultivation method to try. If Meng Chong could cultivate it successfully, he would have a clear direction for when he took in disciples in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the food is ready!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had finished cooking.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's culinary skills were actually not bad, perhaps because he had learned to cook and serve others from a young age while training in martial arts away from home.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Permit Yan, it was still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you still need to improve your culinary skills a bit. When your senior brother returns, you can learn from him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong touched his bald head, looking a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, I will pass on to you the martial dao method. For today, you may rest and ponder."</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Li Xuan left a sentence and then returned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fang Bingong's martial arts technique was gone.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was filled with anticipation. His master, a great person, was going to teach him what kind of martial arts technique?</p><p></p><p>In the room, Li Xuan held a pen and was writing a draft of the martial arts technique on paper.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'll make a distinction. Xu Yan cultivates pure martial arts, while Meng Chong cultivates a branch of martial arts that focuses on the physical body, with the cultivation of the physical body as the main focus.</p><p></p><p>"This can be called the Martial Arts of the Physical Body.</p><p></p><p>"But the Martial Arts of the Physical Body does not discard the core of martial arts. It just focuses on the cultivation of the physical body, with all one's strength manifested in the powerful physical body.</p><p></p><p>"So what I'm going to teach Meng Chong is to try to open up a new school within martial arts - the Martial Arts of the Physical Body!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was naturally bald, with knotted muscles and a burly build. His talent was clearly manifested in his physique.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a flash of inspiration struck Li Xuan, and he decided to try to open up a new school within martial arts, focusing on the cultivation of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>If successful, it would provide a reference direction for future disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of martial arts lies in refining the skin, bones, and internal organs. The orthodox martial arts start with refining the skin, while the Martial Arts of the Physical Body is the integration of the three, cultivated simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"Orthodox martial arts can refine jade-like bones, while the Martial Arts of the Physical Body refines diamond-like bones, not inferior to jade bones, but different.</p><p></p><p>"And the starting cultivation method of the Martial Arts of the Physical Body should be the Golden Bell Covering?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought. Now he was a warrior with complete qi and blood. He had already mastered the martial arts techniques at the qi and blood realm, so editing the foundation of martial arts and the cultivation methods at the qi and blood realm would be much better than blindly composing them from scratch.</p><p></p><p>The key was how to choose the starting cultivation of the Martial Arts of the Physical Body.</p><p></p><p>"Or the Iron Cloth Armor? Or the Golden Bell Covering, with the qi and blood like a bell, without any leaks...</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering. This corresponds to the cultivation at the qi and blood realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Bell Covering I'm editing does not have the concept of a covering door. To break the defense, one can only rely on overwhelming strength to shatter the golden bell defense. Don't even think about finding any covering door.</p><p></p><p>"This is the impenetrable golden bell."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought back and forth about the starting level cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Bell Covering!</p><p></p><p>"Next, I should edit the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering... It's a bit brain-racking. Refining the skin, bones, and internal organs in one cultivation, the difficulty is very high...</p><p></p><p>"This is not orthodox martial arts after all, focusing on special talents. The difficulty being a bit higher is normal. For those with such talents, the difficulty won't be that great.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I'll do it this way. First, sense the qi and blood, which is unchanging. Then the qi and blood return to the internal organs, flow into the bones, and return to the skin... forming a cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Activate the internal organs, stimulate the qi and blood, shake the bones, impact the skin... from the inside out, or from the outside in, cultivate the three in one, refining the golden bell of the physical body...</p><p></p><p>"When the foundation realm's golden bell of the physical body is successfully cultivated, the golden bell will resonate, and the qi and blood will transform into an impenetrable golden bell covering the entire body... This will then enter the qi and blood realm of the Martial Arts of the Physical Body."</p><p></p><p>With the reference of the qi and blood realm techniques, Li Xuan found it much smoother to edit the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this technique is still a bit rough and not very detailed, even with the reference of the qi and blood realm techniques. It would still require Meng Chong to deeply comprehend and refine the actual cultivatable technique from this technique.</p><p></p><p>So when passing the technique to Meng Chong, Li Xuan would still advise him to focus on comprehension and understanding, rather than just following the surface of the technique.</p><p></p><p>The form is not important, the comprehension and understanding are the key.</p><p></p><p>"With Meng Chong's mindset, his insight should not be lacking. He should be able to comprehend and cultivate it successfully, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan still had confidence in Meng Chong. In Meng Chong's eyes, Li Xuan was an extraordinary master, and he would definitely believe in and devote himself to comprehending the technique Li Xuan passed down.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

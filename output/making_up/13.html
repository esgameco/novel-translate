            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 13: Comprehending the Cultivation Technique (Seeking to Read On)</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yanming comprehended one of the cultivation techniques, his entire being was invigorated.</p><p></p><p>"I can't be impatient. The next cultivation technique can also be quickly comprehended. It's now time to cook, so I should relax my mind, calm my spirit, and wholeheartedly immerse myself in cooking.</p><p></p><p>"Discard the distracting thoughts about cultivation, and focus on the present moment!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put down his cultivation and walked with a light step, his entire spirit and energy appearing different.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was clear, and he felt a sense of ease, openness, and brightness.</p><p></p><p>"The Master's every word and action holds deep meaning. Now I finally understand the true meaning behind the Master's words, 'With no woman in the heart, the cultivation is as if guided by a divine being.'</p><p></p><p>"I was truly slow-witted."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and lamented inwardly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze held a hint of confusion. Why did his foolish disciple seem to have some good news today?</p><p></p><p>His steps were light, his expression content, and his entire being had become lively, no longer carrying the previous depressed and deferential demeanor, but returning to the carefree and spirited state of a young man.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he feels he has made progress in his cultivation? Sensed the flow of his qi and blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I just made that up. How could he really sense the flow of his qi and blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, as long as he can relax his mindset and feel at ease, it's not a bad thing. At least I don't have to worry about him being suppressed for too long, to the point of his mental state collapsing."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan decided he should encourage his foolish disciple, letting him relax more and maintain a good mental state, so that his long-term cultivation wouldn't end up with him gaining nothing and becoming mentally troubled.</p><p></p><p>So during the meal, Li Xuan spoke up, "Your state today is good. Keep it up, and you will make progress!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Xu Yan replied, his heart filled with excitement. He had indeed grasped the right understanding!</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that he had been so slow-witted.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that he truly comprehended the deeper meaning behind his Master's words.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded, pleased that his foolish disciple was so obedient to his teachings.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight suddenly struck Xu Yan's mind, and he instantly comprehended the true meaning of another cultivation technique!</p><p></p><p>"I understand now!</p><p></p><p>'The qi and blood forged like a dragon, refining the golden body' means refining the qi and blood like a dragon, coiling it around the entire body and bones, continuously circulating and cycling, in order to break through and refine the golden bones!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the method of refining the golden bones was comprehended by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"'Clarifying the mind, cultivating the true essence, the qi and blood forged like a dragon, refining the golden body' - now I understand!</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood are nourished within the bones, refining down to the marrow. And outside the bones, the dragon-like qi and blood coil and intertwine, internally and externally combining, in order to further refine the bones.</p><p></p><p>"Thereby refining out the golden bones."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes shone with excitement, his fists clenched tightly. "Indeed, it requires re-comprehending and re-understanding. If the Master had directly pointed it out, even if I knew the words, I would not have been able to comprehend the true meaning and thus unable to refine and break through.</p><p></p><p>"Only by comprehending the true meaning within the cultivation techniques myself can I truly understand it!"</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, his qi and blood surging, Xu Yan began the bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>Focusing his mind, entering a state of oneness with the world, he carefully sensed the flow and circulation of his qi and blood, finding the deficiencies and flaws within.</p><p></p><p>"The second rib is not refined enough, the left wrist joint has refinement issues, the knees have weak spots..."</p><p></p><p>As he examined his qi and blood through clarifying the mind and cultivating the true essence, Xu Yan quickly discovered the areas lacking in his bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already achieved the refined copper bones, the bones throughout his body were not uniformly hard, still having some relatively weaker areas.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xu Yan began refining them again, ensuring all his bones were refined to the same level of strength, without any weak spots.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally completely and uniformly refined his copper bones, without the slightest weakness anywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Now I truly have refined copper bones perfected!"</p><p></p><p>"Next, I shall refine the golden bones. I have already comprehended the method of refining golden bones, so I will definitely be able to refine them out!"</p><p></p><p>"It can't take more than a month, at most. In no more than a month, I will refine the golden bones!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Refine the golden bones!" </p><p></p><p>"After refining the bones, it's time to refine the internal organs. You must reach the initial stage of cultivation within a year, or else your talent is too poor to become my disciple."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>One year was actually quite fast.</p><p></p><p>The speed of refining the internal organs would certainly be slower than refining the bones.</p><p></p><p>The master said, when refining the internal organs initially, one must be careful not to harm the vital organs.</p><p></p><p>And the delicate internal organs, in the initial tempering, would certainly not progress quickly.</p><p></p><p>He must seize the time to temper the golden bones, so that he can catch up and reach the initial stage of cultivation within a year.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan had a strong determination in his heart. Although the master gave him a year's time, he could not truly wait until the end of the year to reach the initial stage! </p><p></p><p>The earlier he reached the initial stage, the better it would be, and the master would also be happier!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to refine the bones, as his qi and blood transformed into wisps of mist, constantly seeping into the bones, slowly and with little quantity, but this was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>As the qi and blood slowly seeped into the bones, the familiar tingling sensation reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gritted his teeth, silent, his gaze unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his entire skeleton had been permeated by a wisp of qi and blood, which continued to seep inward, wanting to penetrate the bone marrow.</p><p></p><p>"You can begin now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath, and in an instant, the qi and blood throughout his body surged, transforming into giant dragon-like forms, coiling around his skeleton, the qi and blood trembling, constantly squeezing and circulating around the bones.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood that had seeped into the bones were also continuing to seep in, nourishing the bones. With the internal and external integration, Xu Yan finally discovered that the originally stagnant bone refinement had begun to change.</p><p></p><p>With the tempering, the bones began to emit faint golden hues.</p><p></p><p>Golden bones!</p><p></p><p>After persisting for less than half an hour, Xu Yan felt he had reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>So he stopped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he only felt hungry.</p><p></p><p>"The consumption of refining the golden bones is actually so great!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Those supplementary medicines are no longer effective enough, unless it's thousand-year-old ginseng or nine-leaf primordial fungus..."</p><p></p><p>However, the thousand-year-old ginseng and nine-leaf primordial fungus had all been consumed.</p><p></p><p>"I've only slightly broken through the limit of copper bones, and I'm still far from completing the first tempering of golden bones, yet I've already enhanced so much.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to perfect the golden bones, how powerful would I become?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sensed his own improvement, and was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method taught by the master was truly powerful and profound.</p><p></p><p>"The master said that the golden bones must go through nine cycles of qi and blood transformation. I haven't even completed one, yet the strength of my bones has increased by at least 30%. If I were to complete one cycle of qi and blood transformation..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not dare to imagine how powerful he would become.</p><p></p><p>Golden bones buried underground for thousands of years would not decay, still shining golden, harder than steel.</p><p></p><p>This shows the immense power of golden bones.</p><p></p><p>"As for this qi and blood transformation, it must become increasingly difficult. If I don't have precious medicines to assist me, how can I complete it quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"I should go home for a visit, to search for precious medicines, time is of the essence!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that his talent was not as good as the ancient prodigies. Without the aid of precious medicines, he might have difficulty quickly completing the bone refinement and reaching the initial stage of cultivation within a year.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the sumptuous feast on the table, knowing that this foolish disciple would be going home again.</p><p></p><p>"I should remind him again to be discreet, not to reveal himself... This foolish disciple is obedient, so after I remind him, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the one-year period is up, I can be relieved."</p><p></p><p>"The fierce beasts in the evil forest must also be dealt with. This foolish disciple is really lucky, he hasn't encountered any danger going back and forth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his own luck was not as good. The first time he went out with a group, he was the only one who managed to escape back.</p><p></p><p>After that, he didn't dare take the risk or gamble on his luck, but could safely pass through the evil forest.</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, please support me ^_^</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

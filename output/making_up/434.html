        <h1>Chapter 434</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. The fact that Tianshadiying directly dispatched two Nine-Leaf Tiansha showed how much they valued him, and also demonstrated their determination to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Nine-Leaf Tiansha?!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's gaze turned cold, his aura growing stronger. Even though the opponents were more powerful, he showed no fear or hesitation. On the contrary, his fighting spirit was high.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, very good. To kill me, Luo Zhan, two Nine-Leaf Tiansha have come. Could it be that you think you've hidden deep enough that my Hundred Battles Hall can't find you? If you want to kill me, then try it! Let's see if you can bear the wrath of Hundred Battles Hall after killing me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Zhan showed no intention of backing down. He was even prepared to fight to the death. Even if he died, he would make the enemy pay a price.</p><p></p><p>His secret technique for a desperate fight was ready to be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>Warriors of Hundred Battles Hall never fear battle. The stronger the enemy, the higher their fighting spirit!</p><p></p><p>One of the Nine-Leaf Tiansha said in a gloomy voice: "Luo Zhan, you think too highly of yourself. We two are here to kill Xu Yan. You're not worthy of us taking action against you. Step aside."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's face instantly turned red, like a pig's liver. His breathing became heavy, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Humiliation!</p><p></p><p>This was humiliation! Two Nine-Leaf Tiansha had come to attack, but they were after Xu Yan, not him?</p><p></p><p>The contempt in their tone showed they didn't take him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan felt like his face was being stepped on. Anger burned fiercely within him. He, a mighty Immortal Lord, was actually being looked down upon.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, he wasn't even as good as Xu Yan, who hadn't even reached the Immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>This was too much!</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill Xu Yan? Are you worthy? Get past me first!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan roared.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he wouldn't back down now. Otherwise, his face and his dignity would be trampled to dust!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Luo Zhan in surprise. Facing two powerful experts, he didn't retreat at all and was willing to fight for him?</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, never owe anyone favors. There's no need to involve Luo Zhan in this!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan tried to persuade him: "Brother Luo, they're not here for you. There's no need for you to get involved. You should leave!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan said firmly: "Tianshadiying is too overbearing. Even if I die, I will not back down!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, thinking Brother Luo was truly a man of passion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo, there's really no need. These two may not be able to do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to persuade.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying has schemed against my Hundred Battles Hall. We already have a grudge. Don't worry, young brother Xu. I, Luo Zhan, will definitely hold them off. You go first!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was determined to fight.</p><p></p><p>The Nine-Leaf Tiansha were too overbearing, completely ignoring him. If he retreated now, where would his face be? He had to save face even if it meant death!</p><p></p><p>"Luo Zhan, if you seek death, we'll grant it to you. Do you really think Hundred Battles Hall can do anything to us?"</p><p></p><p>One of the Nine-Leaf Tiansha said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A cold aura instantly surged, and in just a moment, this area of space was under their control. The power of the laws of heaven and earth descended.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A gloomy light enveloped the surroundings, directly using powerful force to seal off this area of space.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan let out a low growl, his aura erupting, but he was suppressed. He couldn't wrestle control of this space from them.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. The strength of these two Nine-Leaf Tiansha was no weaker than Emperor Dayue.</p><p></p><p>That cold aura permeated the space. The two Nine-Leaf Tiansha joined forces to control this area, as if making this space solidify.</p><p></p><p>A powerful force of heaven and earth gathered here, forming a restricted area.</p><p></p><p>This was to completely seal off this space, preventing him from escaping.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged. Sword intent surged around him, and the Mountain River Divine Form also appeared, ready to tear open this restricted area and escape at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"With the sharpness of my Heaven-Severing Sword, tearing open the restriction is a matter of moments. It's enough for me to escape."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan estimated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo is also resisting their power, taking on part of it. If I escape, they won't necessarily have to kill Luo Zhan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>If he escaped, the two Nine-Leaf Tiansha would surely chase after him, and Luo Zhan would be safe.</p><p></p><p>Even facing two Nine-Leaf Tiansha, Xu Yan wasn't worried at all. Even if he couldn't escape, he still had his master's jade talisman, which was enough to ensure his safety.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, don't think about escaping."</p><p></p><p>One of the Nine-Leaf Tiansha seemed to see through Xu Yan's intentions and said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a divine artifact appeared with a hum and merged with the surroundings. Suddenly, a layer of light covered down, enveloping this area of space.</p><p></p><p>"You even used such a divine artifact. Tianshadiying, you really think highly of Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was inwardly alarmed but said with a cold smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though he was angry, he had to admire that Tianshadiying had gone to great lengths to kill Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They even used such a divine artifact that could seal off an area of space.</p><p></p><p>Such divine artifacts were extremely precious, and only Immortal Lords could use them. Every time such a divine artifact was used, it was to seal invaders from the Abyss in an area, preventing them from scattering and killing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Tianshadiying used such a divine artifact to deal with Xu Yan showed that the power behind Tianshadiying must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Not all major forces possessed such divine artifacts that could seal off an area of space.</p><p></p><p>Only forces at the level of great realms could possess them and forge them.</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful force like Hundred Battles Hall didn't have many such divine artifacts, and each one was in the hands of the top echelon of Hundred Battles Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, don't think about escaping today. Don't put up any useless resistance."</p><p></p><p>One of the Nine-Leaf Tiansha spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother Xu, I'll use a secret technique to activate the divine artifact in my hand. It can tear open a gap, but only for a moment. Seize the chance to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan took a deep breath, his expression determined, as he transmitted to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. The secret technique Luo Zhan was using must come at a great cost. After using it, even if he didn't die, he would be crippled.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo, there's no need to go to such lengths. I, Xu Yan, still have some trump cards. Two Nine-Leaf Tiansha are not enough to threaten me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to owe anyone favors. Once he owed a favor, he would have to find a way to repay it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the Nine-Leaf Tiansha were powerful and had used a divine artifact to seal off this area, he still had his master's jade talisman, which could easily kill them.</p><p></p><p>The power of the divine artifact's seal was limited. Against his master's jade talisman, it was nothing but paper.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A cold aura surged in this area of space, and a fierce killing intent gathered. The two Nine-Leaf Tiansha were preparing to attack.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had already sealed off this area and were stronger than Xu Yan, they still joined forces to launch a killing blow.</p><p></p><p>This showed how much they valued Xu Yan and their determination to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was about to say something when suddenly, a</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A figure descended.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the light barrier sealing off heaven and earth dissolved, and the world returned to normal. The power wielded by the two Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was shocked beyond belief. Who was this powerful expert? Even the two Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers looked on with astonished eyes at the person who suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer appeared to be a young man, holding a jade ruyi scepter in his hand. He had an elegant and carefree demeanor, mysterious and extraordinary, as if he did not exist within heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Xu Yan was startled for a moment, then bowed respectfully with joy.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was shocked. Xu Yan's master? </p><p></p><p>Although someone as prodigious as Xu Yan must surely have a powerful backer, seeing him now was still incredibly shocking. What level of expert was this? Beyond the Immortal Realm? Perhaps even far surpassing the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>For the Celestial Killers to try assassinating such an expert's disciple was simply courting death!</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Tracing the martial arts connection with Xu Yan, he took a step and used his divine ability to traverse space in an instant, arriving at Xu Yan's location in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, Xu Yan was facing an assassination attempt at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The two Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers, whose strength was no less than that of an Immortal Sovereign like Da Yue Huang, had even used a treasure to seal off a portion of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This showed how seriously they regarded Xu Yan, and that they were determined to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, quick, let's go!" The two Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers were terrified.</p><p></p><p>The divine artifact sealing off a portion of heaven and earth had shattered the instant the other party arrived, yet the other party hadn't even displayed a hint of power.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying expert this was! The two Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers moved to flee.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan merely glanced at them indifferently, and the Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers who were about to escape suddenly froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Before Luo Zhan's shocked eyes, the two frozen Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers turned to ash and scattered in an instant as a breeze blew past.</p><p></p><p>Not even the ashes remained - they had completely vanished into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan felt his heart trembling, his whole body shaking slightly as he stared with wide eyes full of shock.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, two top Immortal Sovereigns had been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>What kind of terrifying expert was this? And the Celestial Killers had plotted against this terrifying expert's disciple - weren't they afraid of provoking him and having their entire organization uprooted?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, provoking this terrifying expert was the Celestial Killers' goal all along?</p><p></p><p>If such a powerful being took action, no force in the Divine Realm could resist.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of how the Celestial Killers had infiltrated various major factions, they would inevitably drag those factions into this.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Luo Zhan seemed to understand the Celestial Killers' purpose.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't understand was - were the experts backing the Celestial Killers really so confident they could match this terrifying being?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Celestial Killers underestimated this expert's strength!" Luo Zhan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't know what Luo Zhan was thinking. Seeing him standing there stunned with shock, he paid him no mind.</p><p></p><p>With his hands clasped behind his back, he strolled forward leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Mere Nine-Leaf Celestial Killers - he could completely annihilate them with just a glare from his Heavenly Dao Eyes.</p><p></p><p>To him, they didn't even count as ants.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why have you come?" Xu Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Just came to take a look around, and to pass on to you the martial arts methods beyond the Heaven and Earth Realm," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master truly has everything under control," Xu Yan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had just comprehended the martial arts methods of the Heaven and Earth Realm, and his master already knew. Clearly his master had a thorough grasp of his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>"How strong is Master exactly?" Xu Yan couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. I will cultivate diligently and comprehend the martial arts methods as soon as possible," Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He followed closely behind his master, watching his master's relaxed and unrestrained gait, free and unfettered, just like when they first met in that small mountain village, with that same carefree ease.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly following the natural way of the Dao!" Xu Yan thought to himself. His master's every movement was an illustration of what it meant to follow the natural way of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>"It's too profound. Even at my current level, I still can't truly understand what it means to follow the natural way of the Dao," Xu Yan felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not far from the Void-Breaking Realm, yet following the natural way of the Dao still seems so distant to me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew he still had a long way to go before he could reach his master's level.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, do you have any questions about martial arts?" Li Xuan asked as he walked.</p><p></p><p>At his current level, with his understanding of martial arts, especially having comprehended the Taicang Heaven and Earth, he could explain any martial arts questions Xu Yan had.</p><p></p><p>This was true confidence! He had moved beyond the stage of making things up or bluffing.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I do have some questions..." Xu Yan was delighted at this rare opportunity, and began to voice the doubts in his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently, occasionally nodding. The corners of his mouth twitched slightly - he had thought he could answer all his disciple's questions now, without having to give vague and mystical responses.</p><p></p><p>But he had underestimated! </p><p></p><p>There were actually some questions that even with his current martial arts realm, he couldn't give a proper answer to, and could only respond vaguely and mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"...Do you understand now, disciple?" Li Xuan asked after giving his explanations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered thoughtfully, "Master, I think I understand somewhat."</p><p></p><p>"Good, contemplate it well. There is no end to the martial way. The further you progress, the more each person's martial insights will differ.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want you to simply follow in my footsteps, disciple. Rather, I hope you can blaze a new trail based on the path I've tread," Li Xuan instilled in his disciple the concept of forging his own martial way.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Xuan gave Xu Yan some more guidance on martial arts, especially divine abilities, passing on to him more complete divine ability manuals.</p><p></p><p>He also passed on the method for the Heavenly Dao Eyes to Xu Yan, though he wasn't in a hurry for Xu Yan to cultivate it. After all, he already possessed the Heavenly Dao Eyes himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan then began to recount his experiences roaming the Divine Realm, including meeting Mei Wu again, as well as treasures like the Seven Wondrous Divine Flowers.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Li Xuan's mouth twitched. Xu Yan was really something - Mei Wu probably hated their master-disciple pair to death now!</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit of pressure. Mei Wu is very powerful. With my current Heaven and Earth Realm strength, can I match her?"</p><p></p><p>However, within the Taicang Heaven and Earth, Li Xuan wasn't afraid. Moreover, Mei Wu's true body couldn't enter the Taicang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>A mere power avatar was nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan had even set his sights on Mei Wu's treasures, planning to swindle some more treasures from her.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures of an expert like Mei Wu are all extraordinary. Since we've already offended her so thoroughly, there's no need to be polite," Li Xuan mused to himself. He supported Xu Yan's actions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Seven Wondrous Divine Flowers had played a role in Xu Yan's rapid comprehension of the Heaven and Earth Realm martial methods.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, I will now pass on to you the martial methods beyond the Heaven and Earth Realm," Li Xuan said, stopping atop a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

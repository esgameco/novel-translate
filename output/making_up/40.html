            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 40 Finally Leaving the Newbie Village (Seeking Readers)</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath and finished explaining the innate realm cultivation method he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, do you remember it all?"</p><p></p><p>The innate realm cultivation method was the first one he had put a lot of thought into, with more complete theories and frameworks compared to the foundation realm's skin, bone, and organ refinement.</p><p></p><p>He had also pointed out the locations of the Heavenly-Earth Bridge and the Dantian Sea of Qi.</p><p></p><p>Such a detailed cultivation method should make it easier for Xu Yan to comprehend and succeed in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I remember it all!" Xu Yan replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"For the innate method, ponder over it carefully in your spare time, but do not neglect the cultivation of the blood-qi realm, nor should you aim too high.</p><p></p><p>"Stay grounded!" Li Xuan reiterated sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand. I will absolutely not attempt to cultivate the innate method before my blood-qi is perfected," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." Li Xuan nodded, then said, "Here are four lines that expound on the innate realm, you should memorize them as well."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan perked up, excited.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly-Earth Bridge transcends the mundane, swallowing and exhaling spiritual energy to return to the primordial. The true qi is boundless and endless, propelling the qi to ascend to the azure sky."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recited, word by word.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly-Earth Bridge transcends the mundane... propelling the qi to ascend to the azure sky?" Xu Yan murmured, repeating the lines. He felt like he had gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the innate realm was not far from him!</p><p></p><p>"In your spare time, ponder over it further. When your blood-qi is perfected, you will be able to break through to the innate realm," Li Xuan said, looking at his disciple.</p><p></p><p>He could not know when Xu Yan would comprehend the innate realm method he had imparted. </p><p></p><p>However, he believed that with Xu Yan's keen perception and exceptional imagination, as well as his unwavering faith in the martial arts he had taught, he would surely be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time I take on another disciple to try.</p><p></p><p>"The disciple must have good perception and a wide imagination, only then can they comprehend the made-up cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The blood-qi realm martial arts cultivation method was now complete. If he passed it on to a new disciple, would he also receive feedback?</p><p></p><p>Would the new disciple be able to cultivate it successfully?</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan had an intuition that the new disciple must cultivate the newly compiled methods to gain greater feedback.</p><p></p><p>He believed this intuition would not be wrong.</p><p></p><p>So, to take on a new disciple, he would need to compile another set of methods.</p><p></p><p>The realm could remain the same, but the cultivation methods must be different!</p><p></p><p>"With the experience gained, compiling them will be relatively easier, the only problem is finding a suitable disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people definitely won't do, their perception is poor, and their imagination is weak.</p><p></p><p>"They will surely fail to cultivate successfully."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the absorbed Xu Yan, fully aware that if not for this foolish disciple's exceptional perception, strong imagination, and unwavering faith in the martial arts he had taught, he would not have been able to cultivate successfully and activate Li Xuan's golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the requirements for a disciple's talent could not be low.</p><p></p><p>"Qi State is so vast, I'm sure I can find a second suitable disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find one in Qi State, he could go to Wu State.</p><p></p><p>"I could also select a few suitable people, not take them as disciples, but as servants. Teach them the blood-qi realm cultivation method and see the results.</p><p></p><p>"If the servants are not suitable, I could take them as named disciples instead.</p><p></p><p>"As a reclusive expert, I can't just casually take on disciples, can I?</p><p></p><p>"So, servants it is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>He was unsure whether the martial arts methods he had already cultivated could be successfully cultivated by others.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could, there might be certain requirements for their aptitude.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from later cultivators might not be as high.</p><p></p><p>This was an intuition that had arisen in Li Xuan's heart, and he believed it was related to his golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to obtain greater...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The greater feedback comes from taking on disciples and creating new cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>So, it's time to leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at his disciple, who was still pondering the techniques of the Innate Realm, and said, "Disciple, pack your bags, it's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"I, too, should go out and take a look around," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're not going into seclusion anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've taken on a disciple, it's time to engage with the world. Besides, where can one not go into seclusion? </p><p></p><p>'The greatest seclusion is in the bustling city!'"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke in a profound manner.</p><p></p><p>"The greatest seclusion is in the bustling city?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured, suddenly enlightened. His master is truly a hidden cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Where can one not go into seclusion? </p><p></p><p>For a true expert, any place can be a place of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Even the clamorous streets and alleys can be a place of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded excitedly and began to pack his belongings.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many things. </p><p></p><p>Apart from a few sets of clothes, it was mostly just the gifts he had prepared for his master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was playing with a jade ruyi scepter in his hand, growing fonder of it by the day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A horse-drawn rickety wooden cart emerged from the forest.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the cart, playing with the jade ruyi scepter, looking back at the gradually receding dense forest and deep mountains, sighing with emotion. After traversing all this time, he had finally walked out of the great mountains.</p><p></p><p>He had walked out of the small village.</p><p></p><p>By now, the sky was growing dark.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan led the horse, his steps light and silent. His Ethereal Crane Body Technique had made significant progress.</p><p></p><p>"Master, ahead is Yunshan County. Shall we stay in Yunshan County or go directly to Donghe Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stay in Yunshan County for a while," Li Xuan said after a moment of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Let's see if there are any suitable disciple candidates in Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Yunshan County was just a small county with a population of only a few tens of thousands. That evening, the county's residents suddenly saw a horse-drawn cart entering the county.</p><p></p><p>Two young men, one leading the horse, the other sitting in the cart. </p><p></p><p>The young man in the cart was dressed plainly, but he was playing with a jade ruyi scepter in his hand, flawless in appearance, clearly of great value.</p><p></p><p>A beggar squatting by the roadside stared at the person in the cart for a long time, his face filled with excitement. He gave a signal to a middle-aged man running a stall nearby.</p><p></p><p>The stall owner silently nodded and closed up his stall, disappearing into a small alley, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>This entire scene was observed by Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>But he remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Concealing one's wealth is for the weak.</p><p></p><p>The Kingdom of Qi was too weak in military power, there was no one who could pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were powerful cultivators, they would not look down upon the jade ruyi scepter and other items in his possession.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have a shop in the county and have purchased a courtyard. Shall we go there?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, you can make the arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>These trivial matters were naturally left for the disciple to handle.</p><p></p><p>In the county's core area, in front of a small courtyard, Xu Yan stepped forward and knocked on the door. Soon, a servant came out.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master? Young Master, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>The servant, seeing it was Xu Yan, immediately had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, find other accommodations."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Young Master, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>The servant said obsequiously, about to step forward to take the reins, but Xu Yan ignored him and led the horse into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this small county residence is rather simple..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter."</p><p></p><p>The servant looked at the Li Xuan sitting in the cart, momentarily taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Master?</p><p></p><p>The young master of a wealthy family has been deceived again?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

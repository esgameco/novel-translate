        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the Changqing Pavilion called for help or not, once the Changqing Pavilion fell, the two would take action and rescue the core figures.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were dozens of peak grand masters, although the two had not broken through to the Celestial Realm, they were still capable of rescuing the people in front of dozens of peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of their confidence.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the two changed expressions and moved, stepping out of the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Half-Step Celestial! Such a powerful expert had arrived, and was heading straight for the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"It's the old immortal from the Hidden Tower!"</p><p></p><p>One of them said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Hidden Tower is a hidden force, its reach has become too long."</p><p></p><p>The other said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The two were very coordinated, about to set out for the Changqing Pavilion, perhaps the people in the Changqing Pavilion would call for help? The people absolutely could not fall into the hands of the Hidden Tower.</p><p></p><p>But the two immediately changed expressions, facing a formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>A dry corpse-like figure silently appeared, and around him, the mosquitoes withered and died, even the large tree outside the Tianbao Pavilion was gradually withering.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Half-Step Celestial experts of the Tianbao Pavilion surged with energy, enveloping the Tianbao Pavilion, resisting the invisible withering force, and a sizzling sound constantly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Their powers clashed, and the withering force seemed to want to dry up everything.</p><p></p><p>"Withered Calamity Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"You two should not interfere."</p><p></p><p>The Withered Calamity Sovereign said in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"You want to stop us two?"</p><p></p><p>"I can hold you off for a while."</p><p></p><p>The Withered Calamity Sovereign said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The two Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion fell silent. The Withered Calamity Sovereign was one of the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns, and if the other one had not died, the Withered Calamity Sovereign would be the strongest among the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the most experienced Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>The three currently renowned Demon Sovereigns in the Inner Realm were latecomers, the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign was just a junior, and compared to the Withered Calamity Sovereign, the gap was too wide.</p><p></p><p>And it was rumored that the Withered Calamity Sovereign was the disciple of the Demon Patriarch! Under the Demon Patriarch's leadership, the Demon Sect was once so powerful, stirring up the winds and clouds of the Inner Realm, killing countless warriors, and was the biggest threat to the dynasty before its collapse.</p><p></p><p>Time and again, many forces joined forces to eliminate the Demon Sect, but they could only temporarily suppress the arrogance of the Demon Sect, not completely eradicate it.</p><p></p><p>After the dynasty collapsed, the Demon Sect went berserk, which was the darkest period in the martial arts world of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, the Demon Patriarch disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sect split, and the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns formed their own factions. Under the counterattack of the major forces, they gradually declined, but even so, the Demon Sect in the Inner Realm is still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now there are only eight Demon Sovereigns, as the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign has been slain by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The rumor that the Withered Calamity Sovereign was the disciple of the Demon Patriarch, whether true or not, was enough to show his strength and his extraordinary status among the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"The Hidden Tower's Master, is one of the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns?"</p><p></p><p>One of the Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Hidden Tower is the Hidden Tower, the Demon Sect is the Demon Sect, I have a slight acquaintance with him, that's all."</p><p></p><p>The Withered Calamity Sovereign said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The two Tianbao Pavilion members' expressions changed, wanting to take action, but the Withered Calamity Sovereign was extremely powerful, and could hold them off for a while.</p><p></p><p>In this short time, the people in the Changqing Pavilion would either die or be captured.</p><p></p><p>Finally, using the might of the Tianbao Pavilion to intimidate the Withered Calamity Sovereign and the Hidden Tower's Master was obviously not very useful, otherwise the Withered Calamity Sovereign would not have intervened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The three who were confronting each other all changed expressions, suddenly looking towards the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower's Master erupted with an extremely powerful aura, had he encountered a powerful enemy?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was a Half-Step Celestial expert in the Changqing Pavilion? Was this the foundation of the Changqing Pavilion's power? The two Tianbao Pavilion experts changed expressions, why had they not detected the Half-Step Celestial in the Changqing Pavilion all this time?</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The three were suddenly horrified, a terrifying aura emerged from the Changqing Pavilion, and with the appearance of this aura, the Hidden Tower's Master's aura disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The seven peak grand masters who had come with him also disappeared! They were dead!</p><p></p><p>A Half-Step Celestial had died! And without an intense battle, just in an instant, life and death were already decided!</p><p></p><p>What a powerful existence could do this, instantly slaying a Half-Step Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a true Celestial Realm expert? The three no longer cared about the confrontation, they all saw the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why would there be a Celestial Realm expert in the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Danger!"</p><p></p><p>The Withered Calamity Sovereign's heart trembled, he realized the seriousness of the situation, the Hidden Tower's Master had been killed, and he and the Hidden Tower's Master were on the same side.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, about to flee.</p><p></p><p>But a gentle voice was heard: "Since you've come, don't leave!"</p><p></p><p>A young man holding a jade scepter, carefree and aloof, with a mysterious and unfathomable aura! Boom! A gray aura burst forth from the Withered Calamity Sovereign, and his figure began to transform, trying to unleash a secret technique to escape.</p><p></p><p>With the young man's appearance, he seemed to see a great terrifying existence, the aura of death almost enveloping him!</p><p></p><p>He must flee! The Withered Calamity Sovereign was decisive, immediately unleashing his trump card secret technique, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was calm, raising his hand and striking down.</p><p></p><p>Annihilating Sword Qi combined with a lethal strike!</p><p></p><p>No matter how the other party used secret techniques or transformed their figure, they could not escape this lethal strike!</p><p></p><p>In the horrified gaze of the two Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion, the young man's palm struck down, and even though the Withered Calamity Sovereign had unleashed his trump card secret technique, he was still utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>The corpse fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness had already dissipated, only the physical body remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>There was not a single trace of injury.</p><p></p><p>This was the most terrifying part, directly annihilating the consciousness!</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying martial art!</p><p></p><p>After easily slaying the Withered Calamity Sovereign, Li Xuan looked at the two Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion calmly, "I do not use realm to oppress others, do you two have any thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Celestial of the Tianbao Pavilion suddenly broke out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>This was a great terrifying existence, absolutely a Celestial Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>At the moment of the strike, although it was not directed at them, they still felt a chill in their souls, as if their spiritual consciousness was about to be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please don't misunderstand, our Tianbao Pavilion has no ill intentions, our Tianbao Pavilion has always followed the principle of not interfering in the martial arts world's conflicts, we have come only to witness the great events of the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior, please don't misunderstand, our Tianbao Pavilion and the Changqing Pavilion have a pleasant cooperation, there is no conflict or impropriety, we hope the senior can see this clearly!"</p><p></p><p>The two Half-Step Celestial hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, they were relieved that they had upheld the principles of the Tianbao Pavilion and did not attempt to annex the Changqing Pavilion or use force against it, otherwise they would have been dead by now.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the hand, he had slain a Half-Step Celestial.</p><p></p><p>How many Half-Step Celestial would be enough for him to kill? It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>A true Celestial Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Celestial Being, and just now the senior said that he does not use realm to oppress others, so when he killed Kuque and the Yinlou Pavilion Master, he did not display his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Was it just a martial art technique at a level below the Celestial Being realm? What a terrifying martial art technique, that it could slay the spiritual consciousness without harming the physical body at all.</p><p></p><p>Such an attack is the most difficult to defend against! "From ancient times to the present, any mighty force has collapsed because of its own arrogance, failing to recognize itself and the enemy, and betraying its own principles.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you, the Tianbaoge, can recognize yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's tone was calm, but the warning and admonition towards the Tianbaoge was not at all concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the senior is right!" </p><p></p><p>The Tianbaoge experts hurriedly and respectfully nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan grabbed with his hand, and the corpse of the Kuque Demon Monarch fell into his grasp. He flashed and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard of the Changqing Pavilion, Suling Xiu looked at the corpses of the Yinlou Pavilion Master and the others, her eyes reddening. The arch-enemy was dead! She picked up an iron shovel and gritted her teeth in resentment: "Although I couldn't kill you with my own hands, I will still grind your bones to ashes to vent my hatred!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying also drew his sword, ready to join Suling Xiu in slashing the corpses of the peak grand masters into pieces to feed the dogs!</p><p></p><p>"Girl, what are you doing?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had returned, throwing the corpse of the Kuque Demon Monarch to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to chop him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!" </p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others nodded, expressing their support for Suling Xiu's actions. The arch-enemy was right in front of them, how could they not grind their bones to ashes to vent their hatred?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the master had just left for a while and brought back another corpse.</p><p></p><p>This mummified person must also be at the half-step Celestial Being realm without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan said, "These people, their spiritual consciousness has perished, but their physical vitality has not been extinguished, and their cultivation still exists. Wouldn't it be a pity to destroy them?"</p><p></p><p>"For your research use, as a medicinal cultivator, how can you not know about the changes in the bodies of cultivators? You should preserve these corpses, dissect and examine them, research the mysterious changes in the physical bodies of cultivators after cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Grinding the bones to ashes can only relieve your hatred for the moment. Treat them as research subjects, dissect them, disassemble them, or even reassemble them. This way, you can not only vent your hatred, but also gain insights."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was stunned, looking at the nine corpses, two half-step Celestial Beings and seven peak grand masters. Although their spiritual consciousness had perished, their physical vitality had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master. I understand!" </p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu became excited, as Xu Yan's words had opened a new window for her.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Preserve the corpses well. I hope you can gain some insights and further understand the mysteries of medicinal cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>He secretly hoped that Suling Xiu could gain some harvests from this, so that the medicinal martial dao could be further improved and elevated.</p><p></p><p>That's why he didn't completely incinerate the corpses, but left them for Suling Xiu to dissect or conduct other research, so that she could gain insights and perfect the medicinal martial dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, how can one be called a medical practitioner without understanding the changes and mysteries within the bodies of cultivators?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!" </p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was excited, hurriedly preparing spiritual medicines and concocting preservative elixirs to maintain the vitality and cultivation of the corpses.</p><p></p><p>She instructed Shi Er and Kou Ruozhi to move the corpses to a secret chamber, and Suling Xiu quickly combined a formula to refine a nourishing elixir, which she then placed inside the corpses.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair, resuming his leisurely and carefree demeanor. Slaying a half-step Celestial Being was as easy as crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, do you have any questions?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where did the Yinlou Pavilion Master's powerful aura come from? The martial dao divine technique you used was only aimed at the spiritual consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>"The human body has three souls and seven spirits, which are the abode of the spiritual consciousness. When the soul perishes, everything becomes void, leaving only the physical body, which will also decay and disappear.</p><p></p><p>"What I severed was the soul!" The martial dao divine techniques have their own mysteries. What you have personally comprehended is what belongs to you. This is the Dao that I have always emphasized - transmitting the Dao, not the techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and slashed out a strike in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilating Soul Slash!</p><p></p><p>He wanted Xu Yan and Meng Chong to feel this slash, and use it as a foundation to comprehend similar martial dao divine techniques on their own.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands and will not disappoint the master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had some enlightenment in his heart, but could not fully comprehend it yet. Mastering the martial dao divine techniques was not something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>"After breaking through to the Penetrating the Mysteries realm, spend more time contemplating the martial dao divine techniques," </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong next to him also seemed to have gained some insights, as Li Xuan's Annihilating Soul Slash was related to the Dao of the Sword that he cultivated.</p><p></p><p>However, they were still far from fully comprehending the martial dao divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not directly transmit the Annihilating Soul Slash or the One-Strike Annihilation, as he did not want Xu Yan and Meng Chong to be confined within the frameworks of these two martial dao divine techniques. </p><p></p><p>He wanted them to comprehend their own unique martial dao divine techniques, which could perhaps surpass the Annihilating Soul Slash and One-Strike Annihilation in power and mystery.</p><p></p><p>When the feedback from the "golden finger" came, he would then master the new martial dao divine techniques, and his strength would surely rise again.</p><p></p><p>In the Changqing Pavilion, Suling Xiu was busy with Shi Er, Kou Ruozhi, Meng Shushu, and Zhou Ying, while Xu Yan and Meng Chong were in the corner, each deep in contemplation, trying to comprehend the master's martial dao divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe heaved a sigh of relief. With the senior's such powerful strength, what did it matter if all the major forces attacked? Fifty peak grand masters were nothing!  He had already started planning the next step of the Changqing Pavilion's development and expansion.</p><p></p><p>The pace of the Great Desolation could be accelerated now, no longer needing to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor of the Tianbaoge, the two half-step Celestial Beings, while sipping tea, had their gazes fixed on the Changqing Pavilion, and their hands holding the teacups were slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Kuque Demon Monarch, whose strength was not inferior to theirs, or even a bit stronger, had just died with a snap, without any resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>This scene had left an indelible shadow in the hearts of the two half-step Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>A single wave of the hand, and the spiritual consciousness was instantly extinguished, without the slightest ability to resist. </p><p></p><p>Although they were half-step Celestial Beings, they did not know how to defend their spiritual consciousness. That slash was almost unblockable, and even true Celestial Beings might not be able to resist it!</p><p></p><p>"He's here!" </p><p></p><p>One of them suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"After the incident in the Great Yue Kingdom, the situation is likely to change."</p><p></p><p>The two looked up to see dozens of peak grand masters, emanating a powerful aura, surrounding the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

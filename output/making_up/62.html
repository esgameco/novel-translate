            <p>Chapter 62: The Heart Like the Great Sun, Its Meaning Self-Evident</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods that require sunbathing to practice are not good methods, as they limit the path of the disciples. They must be corrected.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the issue of the cultivation method for the disciple to comprehend, Li Xuan only needed to quietly observe.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into deep contemplation and decided to practice in the evening.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, he took a horse stance and began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I sense the qi and blood anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Without the warm sunlight on his body, Meng Chong found that he could not sense his qi and blood at the start of his practice.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have misunderstood the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath and focused inwardly, carefully sensing his own body.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he finally sensed the qi and blood, but the sensation was weak, and the refinement process was extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it faster to cultivate under the sun?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression changed slightly, and he too fell into contemplation, as Meng Chong's practice in the evening was clearly much weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. Could it be that the Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy truly requires cultivation under the sun to be more efficient?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>He carefully recalled the Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy technique he had created, but there was no mention of the need to cultivate under the sun.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be in the name of the technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how Meng Chong resolves this problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to let it be. After all, when teaching his disciples, he would just provide the techniques he had created and let them comprehend the theories on their own. The success of the cultivation depended entirely on the disciple's own understanding.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to activate his qi and blood to refine his body, carefully observing the changes. The weak qi and blood were being refined at an extremely slow pace.</p><p></p><p>"What could be wrong? It can't be that I need to cultivate under the sun. There must be something I haven't grasped."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong meticulously examined the cultivation method, word by word.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy must be related to the Great Sun. If it's not necessary to cultivate under the sun, then..."</p><p></p><p>"No, the Great Sun never disappears. On rainy days, it's obscured by the clouds, and at night, it temporarily sets..."</p><p></p><p>"So the Great Sun always exists."</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight struck Meng Chong's mind, and he began to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that it's about comprehension and meaning. I haven't grasped the meaning of the technique. That must be my deficiency."</p><p></p><p>What is the "meaning" of the Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the qi and blood circulated from the bones to the viscera, the heart beating, refining the heart with the qi and blood. A warm sensation arose, and the qi and blood flowing out from the heart became more concentrated and pure.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong felt that he had grasped the "meaning" of the Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy.</p><p></p><p>"The meaning of the Great Sun Golden Bell Canopy is naturally the meaning of the Great Sun. Although the Great Sun in the sky is not present, the Great Sun in my heart is unchanging..."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Meng Chong felt as if he had opened a window and seen the great sun shining in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"My heart is like the Great Sun, burning within myself. Its meaning is self-evident, resonating with the Great Sun in the sky..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong entered a profound state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>His heart began to beat rhythmically, and streams of qi and blood seemed to burst forth, pulsing through his heart and circulating among the various viscera.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if the beating in his body was not a heart, but a great sun.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the image of the midday sun shining in the sky appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His heart and the great sun seemed to resonate with each other.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>His heart was beating, and with each beat, it seemed to burst forth a surge of vital energy, circulating through his viscera, then flowing through his bones and membranes, and then back to his bones and heart...</p><p></p><p>A complete cycle had appeared.</p><p></p><p>As he resonated with the image of the great sun, his breathing had unknowingly become rhythmic, and his heartbeat had grown even stronger, his blood and qi becoming hotter and more intense.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he felt that his whole body was burning hot, with the blood and qi permeating throughout, and the sensation of his bones and muscles aching and numb becoming increasingly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he felt that his own body was like a giant bell, with the flesh, membranes, bones, and viscera all forming a rounded shape.</p><p></p><p>The great sun's golden bell cover!</p><p></p><p>"I have finally comprehended the cultivation method!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed in his heart, as he now only felt that his physical body and constitution were constantly strengthening.</p><p></p><p>Rounded like a great bell!</p><p></p><p>"I can already feel a sense of a golden bell-like physique!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited, and at this moment, he had already forgotten about the passage of time, continuing to cultivate without stop.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been closely observing Meng Chong, and the keen senses of a martial artist allowed him to clearly perceive the changes in Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>"His breathing has become rhythmic, his blood and qi are strengthening... his blood and qi are rounded, permeating throughout his body, with the internal and external unified, a golden bell-like physique..."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had grasped the cultivation method of the great sun's golden bell cover.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was in the midst of cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>"This physical constitution is actually visibly strengthening, my disciple is truly suited for cultivating the path of the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physical constitution was continuously growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>"When taking in disciples, one must have a specific focus, and cultivate the disciples according to their innate talents, as they will then more easily comprehend the cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that he had found the standard for taking in disciples.</p><p></p><p>Each new disciple is a new cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>He could not possibly create dozens or hundreds of new cultivation methods and new systems.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the requirement for disciples must be that they have extraordinary talents, capable of fitting the creation of new cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Within a month, will Meng Chong be able to enter the initial stage of cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's talents were undoubtedly monstrous, otherwise he would not have been able to successfully cultivate the completely fabricated cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method that Meng Chong was cultivating, although it was also fabricated, at least had a reference, and Li Xuan was also now a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Meng Chong's talents were truly in the path of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"I should also tell Meng Chong about the divisions of bone refinement, the bone refinement of the physical body path is the Diamond Vajra Bone, surpassing the Jade Bone. I hope he can refine this randomly fabricated Diamond Vajra Bone.</p><p></p><p>"If Xu Yan could refine the Jade Bone, Meng Chong should be able to refine the Diamond Vajra Bone, right?</p><p></p><p>"But he will still need some assistance, just like how Xu Yan relied on battling the Fire-Maned Wolves to break through the Jade Bone."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began planning Meng Chong's subsequent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong could refine the Diamond Vajra Bone, once he entered the martial dao, he would also gain feedback. With the Jade Bone and Diamond Vajra Bone combined, what changes would occur?</p><p></p><p>It would undoubtedly become even stronger!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it made him excited.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's entry into the martial dao is just a matter of time, next I should prepare some martial techniques and cultivation methods for him.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has the palm, so Meng Chong can have the fist...</p><p></p><p>"As for body movements, the old rule, I'll draw an Eight Trigrams diagram and explain it to him, letting him comprehend it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, I also need to further perfect the subsequent physical body martial dao system."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was clear, and he entered a state of contemplation, beginning to consider how Meng Chong should cultivate after entering the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The physical body martial dao is a system within the martial dao, mainly focusing on the physical body, but it is not just about brute physical strength. Li Xuan needed to perfect it, making the physical body martial dao equally powerful.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

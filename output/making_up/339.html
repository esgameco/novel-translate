        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dai family was thrown into complete chaos. The elders of the clan were frantically fleeing, and the other Dai family warriors were also desperately escaping, not daring to linger even for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Those who had been lofty and high above were never prepared for the day when someone would come to kill them. Their venerable ancestor who had cultivated spiritual powers was actually killed! At this moment, all thoughts of the treasures in the vaults, the dignity of the noble family, and the family's glory had been cast aside.</p><p></p><p>Each of them only regretted that they had not worked hard enough to cultivate their body techniques and escape speed. When the terrifying Qingtianjiao corpse appeared, they were shocked and frightened, but did not have the mind to flee, after all, they had the venerable ancestor who had cultivated spiritual powers to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when the venerable ancestor who had cultivated spiritual powers emerged, he suppressed the Qingtianjiao corpse.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that the terrifying young man slew their venerable ancestor who had cultivated spiritual powers with just a few sword strikes.</p><p></p><p>He even instantly killed several great celestial elders! The remaining elders were so frightened that their souls fled, and they disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The entire Dai family was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Those Dai family outer disciples, guards, and servants were all dumbfounded. The lofty Dai family elders and young masters were all frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>They also hurriedly followed and ran away.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the entire Dai family estate was in disarray.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and flee, the calamity of clan annihilation has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and flee, the Dai family is finished!"</p><p></p><p>"Son, hurry and flee, hide, the Dai family is finished!"</p><p></p><p>Cries and wails echoed throughout the clan estate, and the panic only grew, as the calamity of clan annihilation was right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As a result, more and more people were fleeing.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, after looting the Dai family's treasury, he directly left, not even bothering to search for the other treasuries and valuables of the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>He had assassinated and killed the Dai family's cultivator of spiritual powers. If Dai Sheng were to return, he would definitely be no match for him! Therefore, while Dai Sheng had not yet returned, he quickly made his escape, taking a considerable amount of treasures from the treasury.</p><p></p><p>The anger he had built up from being chased by Dai Sheng had also been vented.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not suffer any losses! Although he had been chased once, he had also destroyed the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>As he departed, Xu Yan's sword light swept across the surroundings, and everything turned to ruins in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If the people in the Dai family estate had not almost all fled, he would have likely killed many of them.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! His figure flashed in the sky, and Xu Yan left elegantly.</p><p></p><p>The jade little dragon wrapped around Xu Yan's wrist was completely dumbfounded. It had been terrified when Xu Yan went to destroy the Dai family, and the result was that Xu Yan had actually accomplished it.</p><p></p><p>He had slain a cultivator of spiritual powers! Although it was through a sneak attack, that was a cultivator of spiritual powers, how could he have done it just through a sneak attack?</p><p></p><p>Yet, Xu Yan had accomplished it.</p><p></p><p>The jade little dragon was now somewhat doubtful, Xu Yan's cultivation of the martial dao seemed to be a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not a cultivator of spiritual powers, he possessed a spiritual force similar to that of a cultivator of spiritual powers, and it seemed to be even more profound and special than spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>It could not understand the profundity of it.</p><p></p><p>"You have destroyed the Dai family and killed their cultivator of spiritual powers. Dai Sheng must be furious, and the Yushen Sect and the Su family may also dispatch cultivators of spiritual powers to try to suppress you!" the jade little dragon said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter, they won't be able to catch me. After I break through further, I will definitely annihilate them and turn their treasures into resources for my cultivation," Xu Yan said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>This harvest was huge, he had taken over one of the Dai family's treasuries, and the treasures stored in it were beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the vast treasury itself, the storage bags alone numbered more than twenty.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the precious scriptures, spiritual artifacts, and other treasures packed in the vast treasury.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't killed so many people, he would have even more storage bags full of treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother and junior sister, they won't lack resources and foundations for cultivation anymore, and junior sister won't lack spirit medicines and elixirs to refine," Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>There was no faster way to accumulate a foundation than to take over a noble family's treasury.</p><p></p><p>This time, after returning to the inner realm, he did not need to hurry back to the spirit realm again, as he had enough spiritual materials, and his parents and the others' cultivation could also rapidly improve.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Dai family, Xu Yan put on a carefully prepared set of clothes, activated his true qi, changed his appearance, and even grew a few strands of beard on his chin.</p><p></p><p>His stature also became more burly and robust.</p><p></p><p>His entire person, from his build, appearance, to his aura, had all undergone changes.</p><p></p><p>To return to the inner realm, he would have to pass through the gate to the spirit realm. He would conceal his identity and return to the inner realm to avoid his tracks being exposed, after all, there were guardians at the gate to the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su family had been chasing him for so long, but they had not revealed that he was from the inner realm. It could be that the guardians at the gate to the spirit realm were not involved in these disputes, or they were under some restrictions.</p><p></p><p>It could also be that the information was isolated, and they did not know about the affairs outside.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reason, the fact that the guardians at the gate to the spirit realm had not revealed that he was from the inner realm was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>But when he returned to the inner realm, he did not intend to use his real identity.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he would fabricate the identity of a cultivator from a spirit sect.</p><p></p><p>As for which spirit sect cultivator, the spirit realm was so vast, the guardians could not possibly know about all the forces.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to wear clothes with the insignia of a spirit sect.</p><p></p><p>This was also something Shen Haizhou had revealed, about the differences in the attire of spirit sects and noble families. Other scattered cultivators who did not understand the intricacies would find it difficult to impersonate disciples of spirit sects or noble families.</p><p></p><p>Of course, instances of scattered cultivators impersonating others had occurred before, and it was not unheard of, but the fates of those scattered cultivators were usually not good.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, scattered cultivators would never dare to impersonate disciples of spirit sects or noble families.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strode confidently towards the gate to the spirit realm, ready to return to the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the turmoil in the Dai family, how Dai Sheng would go mad, he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong had long since fled Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was on his way to a certain place when a message suddenly came. Xu Yan had appeared there.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and crushed a pearl on his body - a mother-and-child pearl! And the shattering of this pearl transmitted the message that the Dai family was facing a crisis!</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's expression changed drastically. A crisis in the Dai family? Who would attack the Dai family?</p><p></p><p>He could not understand who would attack the Dai family at this time!</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he had no time to go after Xu Yan for revenge. His figure moved, and he rushed back to the Dai family in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, Dai Sheng had never thought that the one attacking the Dai family was Xu Yan. In his eyes, although Xu Yan's strength was not weak, he could not bring a crisis to the Dai Family.</p><p></p><p>There was still a cultivator of spiritual powers guarding the clan.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng rushed back to the Dai family, and some well-informed forces had already learned that the Dai family had been attacked, and their clan estate was severely damaged.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou, who had been closely monitoring the Dai family's movements, was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Too fierce!" Based on the current information, the Dai family's cultivator of spiritual powers had been killed! Slain by Xu Yan! Shen Haizhou was covered in cold sweat. A cultivator of spiritual powers, yet he had been killed just like that? He had thought that even if Xu Yan resorted to a sneak attack, he could only injure the cultivator of spiritual powers, not kill him.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had directly killed him! "When was the last time a cultivator of spiritual powers fell in Yuzhou? This first fallen cultivator of spiritual powers was defeated by a weaker opponent through sheer strength!" The Yushen Sect and the Su family must be unsettled now, right?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou wiped his brow and set out to return to his clan's territory. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't let Dai Sheng know that he had secretly leaked the information to Xu Yan, otherwise Dai Sheng might go mad and kill him, regardless of his status as the eldest young master of the Shen family. Even if he didn't kill him, he would still go mad and demand compensation from the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>When the Shen family returned, they would only have two choices: one, pay compensation to appease the dispute; two, kill Dai Sheng! Whichever way, it would trigger a series of changes in the situation.</p><p></p><p>To ensure his own safety, Shen Haizhou decided to return to the clan's territory and hide for a while. After confirming that the news had not been leaked, he would come out again to enjoy life! Dai Sheng saw the devastated clan territory, with most of the buildings already destroyed, and an entire treasury completely emptied.</p><p></p><p>His uncle, the Refining Celestial Immortal who guarded the clan's treasury, had also been killed.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng, his eyes bulging with rage, roared, "Who did this? Where is the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>When Dai Sheng returned, the elders of the Dai clan immediately found their backbone, and one by one they came back crying.</p><p></p><p>"It was the Azure Sky Flood Dragon! No, it was that young man!"</p><p></p><p>"He killed our great uncle! He killed several of our clan elders."</p><p></p><p>"My Dai clan has suffered heavy losses, and from now on, we will fall to the status of a second-rate family!"</p><p></p><p>Only Dai Sheng, a Refining Celestial Immortal, remained. The Dai clan had fallen from a second-rate family to a third-rate one.</p><p></p><p>Unless Dai Sheng could break through to the middle stage of the Refining Celestial Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The strength and status of a family clan was also related to the resources for cultivation and the right to speak.</p><p></p><p>The Dai clan elders wailed as they told Dai Sheng the whole story.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was almost about to explode with anger.</p><p></p><p>It was that young man! How dare he come and destroy the Dai clan's territory?</p><p></p><p>And he even sneak-attacked and killed his own uncle?</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was furious, gritting his teeth as he said, "I'm going to grind him to dust!"</p><p></p><p>He was about to turn around and go find Xu Yan, determined to kill him!</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you can't go! If you leave, and that vicious person comes back, what are we going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you can't go!"</p><p></p><p>The clan elders hurriedly persuaded him.</p><p></p><p>If Dai Sheng left, and that murderous person came back, would they even be alive?</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng, who was about to leave, suddenly stopped in his tracks, panting heavily, his eyes bloodshot. However, what the clan elders said made sense.</p><p></p><p>If he left, that despicable young man might come back and completely destroy the Dai clan!</p><p></p><p>"Notify the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, the person they are pursuing is very dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Once this news spread, the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family would certainly take it seriously and do their utmost to eliminate the danger in its cradle!</p><p></p><p>The attack on the Dai clan and the death of their Refining Celestial Immortal spread quickly throughout the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>The entire martial arts world of the Jade State was shaken! A Refining Celestial Immortal had fallen!</p><p></p><p>The last time a Refining Celestial Immortal had fallen in the Jade State was how many years ago? Thousands of years, perhaps? And the martial artist who had attacked the Dai clan and killed their Refining Celestial Immortal was the young man from the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's tomb, the one the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family were pursuing.</p><p></p><p>The gaze of the martial arts world had converged on the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Celestial Immortals of the Jade Spirit Sect gathered, and everyone had a grave expression. They had thought he was just a small wandering cultivator, but they never expected this person to be so fierce, having killed a Refining Celestial Immortal of the Dai clan.</p><p></p><p>Although it was done through a sneak attack, it still showed his methods and strength. He absolutely could not be allowed to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>"This child must die, or he will become a great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Jade Spirit Sect said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Contact the Shu Family, and together we will search for this child. Issue a kill order, and spare no effort to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Jade Spirit Sect had extremely grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>This scene was also unfolding in the Shu Family.</p><p></p><p>Since the Blood Demon Incident, the Spiritual Sects and the Aristocratic Families had no longer taken these potentially threatening wandering cultivators lightly. They would do their utmost to completely eliminate them, only then could they breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Blood Demon had been allowed to grow strong because of the arrogance of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families, and this had led to a great disaster later on.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Jade State was relatively weak was related to the Blood Demon Incident. In a great battle in the Jade State, the once mighty and long-established Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families had been reduced to ashes. The entire martial arts world of the Jade State had been terrified, and the gate to the Spiritual Realm had been opened, allowing the Blood Demon to escape into the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, the appearance of Xu Yan had cast a shadow over the hearts of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, fearing a repeat of the Blood Demon disaster.</p><p></p><p>In a certain mountain in the Jade State, the Jade State branch of the Myriad Worlds Alliance was hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, this wandering genius is too powerful, exactly what our Myriad Worlds Alliance is lacking."</p><p></p><p>An excited Myriad Worlds Alliance cultivator spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Jade State branch of the Myriad Worlds Alliance was a middle-aged man with a scholarly appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Send orders to all Myriad Worlds Alliance members in the Jade State, do everything possible to find the whereabouts of this genius before the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's expression was solemn. "If necessary, I will personally take action!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Myriad Worlds Alliance were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, to have destroyed the Dai clan and killed a Refining Celestial Immortal, even if it was a sneak attack, it was still shocking! They all couldn't help but think of that one existence that had made the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon! The Demonic Patriarch of the Blood Demon Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Our Myriad Worlds Alliance will not follow the path of the Blood Demon, and we will surely succeed in carving out a place under the heavens for wandering cultivators, standing on equal footing with the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not concerned about the reactions of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, or the commotion in the martial arts world of the Jade State. At the moment, he was heading towards the location of the gate to the Spiritual Realm, preparing to return to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spiritual Realm was not far away.</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly furrowed his brow, as an old woman in front of him was staring at him.</p><p></p><p>A mid-stage Great Celestial Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was Jing Popo, the Tranquil Grandmother of the Water Star Palace. After Jiao Ming and Ping'er had not returned for a long time, Tao Jinyan, in her anger, also began to suspect whether something had happened. Could it be that her womanizing husband had left some methods to protect that bastard child? Or perhaps Jiao Ming and Ping'er had encountered some accident on their way to the Inner Realm? Unable to wait any longer, Tao Jinyan had sent Jing Popo to the Inner Realm to bring the bastard child back.</p><p></p><p>Jing Popo was on her way to the gate of the Spiritual Realm when she suddenly furrowed her brow, looking at the person also heading towards the gate of the Spiritual Realm, whose purpose also seemed to be going to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on the person's clothes, looking at the emblem on the chest, wanting to see which Spiritual Sect this cultivator belonged to.</p><p></p><p>However, Jing Popo's brow furrowed, this was not the emblem of any Spiritual Sect she had ever seen recorded.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the emblem embroidered on the chest had a somewhat crude feel to it.</p><p></p><p>A mere wandering cultivator, daring to impersonate a Spiritual Sect? Jing Popo came from the Water Star Palace, and while the Water Star Palace was a second-rate Spiritual Sect in the Spiritual Realm, the Luo State where it was located was far superior to the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>Aside from lacking a late-stage Refining Celestial Immortal to guard it, the other Refining Celestial Immortal cultivators of the Water Star Palace were more numerous and stronger than those of the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Jing Popo was an elder-generation Celestial Immortal cultivator, with extensive experience in the martial arts world. Impersonating a Spiritual Sect cultivator was not something she had not encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators, if they did not carefully examine and scrutinize, might not be able to detect the flaws. However, Jing Popo's eyesight was exceptional, so even though Xu Yan had forged the Spiritual Sect emblem on his clothes to look very authentic, he was still seen through by her at a glance!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 255</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Another force formed by scattered cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family were furious when they discovered the hidden force of the Eternal Alliance, a gathering of scattered cultivators. They even suspected that Xu Yan and Meng Chong were able to evade their search because they were assisted by the Eternal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the Eternal Alliance, the Alliance Master and the others were deeply troubled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were truly skilled at hiding. The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family had mobilized all their forces, yet they still couldn't find them!</p><p></p><p>As a result, the well-hidden Eternal Alliance was exposed.</p><p></p><p>The only consolation was that the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family only thought the Eternal Alliance was just an organization of gathered scattered cultivators, no different from the past.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families of the Jade State had taken action to completely eliminate the Eternal Alliance. </p><p></p><p>They would not allow any scattered cultivator organization with a certain degree of power to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the martial arts world of the Jade State fell into chaos, even erupting into a battle between Cultivated Spirits and Heavenly Beings.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Jade State did not affect the manor.</p><p></p><p>It was like a secluded land, unaffected by external interference.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already started to study the fifth page of the Taicangshu, while also depicting the laws of heaven and earth, letting his four disciples ponder over them.</p><p></p><p>To lay the foundation for going beyond spiritual powers, using the laws of heaven and earth as his own.</p><p></p><p>Also to lay the foundation for comprehending spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Spiritual Shadows are about to break through the hundred thousand mark."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly discovered that the Martial Dao Spiritual Shadows were just one away from breaking through the hundred thousand mark.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate martial artists were becoming more and more numerous, truly entering a stage of rapid development.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a few days, the Spiritual Shadows broke through the hundred thousand mark.</p><p></p><p>"Your Martial Dao Spiritual Shadows have broken through the hundred thousand, and you have obtained the Divine Martial True Body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted. The Divine Martial True Body was formed by the condensation of a hundred thousand Spiritual Shadows. It was a manifestation, yet not like a manifestation. The Divine Martial True Body was connected to his main consciousness and was completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Divine Martial True Body possessed nine-tenths of his own strength! "This is much stronger than the Spiritual Shadows. If the enemy is on par with me, but I have the Divine Martial True Body, it would be like two against one, and I would surely win!"</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in an excellent mood.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through the first minor success of the Indestructible Golden Body, and your Indestructible Golden Body has reached the first stage of perfection."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Meng Chong's breakthrough, Su Ling Xiu also broke through to the minor success of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has broken through to the minor success of the Divine Consciousness Realm, and your Pill Dao and Martial Dao Divine Consciousness Realm is now perfected."</p><p></p><p>The feeling of strength increasing was truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Among the four disciples, the weakest one was currently Fang Hao, but he was also about to break through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan summoned Fang Hao and pointed out to him things like treasures to be refined for convenient communication and transmission.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual domain communication techniques were relatively backward.</p><p></p><p>Although the Mother-Child Pearls could transmit some information, it was rather simple, like which child pearl was broken, representing what.</p><p></p><p>As for more detailed communication methods, they could only use a spiritual swallow, similar to the flying messenger of the inner domain. However, this communication method still had the risk of interception.</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual swallow was fast, it was not instant, especially for cross-state communication, which might take several days.</p><p></p><p>Even within a single state, from south to north, although the spiritual swallow was fast, it would still take more than a day.</p><p></p><p>There was also the risk of being intercepted along the way.</p><p></p><p>The cost of cultivating the spiritual swallow was also not low. Constructing a communication system was very resource-consuming.</p><p></p><p>Even second- or third-rate Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families could not establish too extensive a communication system, only able to use it within their own territories.</p><p></p><p>The Mother-Child Pearls were used by Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families for emergency communication, such as when a pearl was broken, indicating a crisis or a call for help.</p><p></p><p>Since there were already refinements of talismans, formations, and prohibitions, how could communication treasures be lacking?</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan pointed out to Fang Hao to refine communication-related items, so that they could communicate conveniently.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could not achieve instant communication throughout the Spiritual Domain, at least they should have the ability to communicate within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan's guidance, Fang Hao was delighted and began to ponder the refinement of communication treasures.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Blue Scaled City in the Jade State,</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu stood in the air, with the left and right protectors of the Jade State branch of the Eternal Alliance behind him.</p><p></p><p>"You two are also scattered cultivators, yet you are willing to serve the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families? Do you really think the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families will treat you as their own?"</p><p></p><p>Yu, the Alliance Master, said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>In front of the three of them were two Cultivated Spirit scattered cultivators, who were also somewhat renowned in the Jade State. However, during the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family's search for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, they had recruited these two.</p><p></p><p>Now, the two of them were the Foreign Affairs Elders of the Jade Divine Sect! After discovering the Eternal Alliance, an organization of scattered cultivators, the Jade Divine Sect gave them a chance to prove their loyalty, and if they succeeded, they would truly become Elders of the Spiritual Sect, Martial Cultivators of the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>So, the two of them had apprehended members of the Eternal Alliance, which led to Yu, the Alliance Master, appearing to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>"Scattered cultivators have no future, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families are the right path. This Spiritual Domain is just like that, don't delude yourself that you can change the situation of the Spiritual Domain."</p><p></p><p>One of the Cultivated Spirit scattered cultivators said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of people like you that we scattered cultivators can never rise up!"</p><p></p><p>The left protector said fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>The Cultivated Spirit scattered cultivator sneered, "How mighty was the Blood Demon in the past, and how did it end up? Do you think you can match the Blood Demon of the past?"</p><p></p><p>"You're the one talking nonsense! If it weren't for the betrayal of some people, how could the Blood Demon have changed its nature? How could it not have secured a place for us scattered cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>The right protector roared and rushed forward.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Master, these scattered cultivator scums should be killed!"</p><p></p><p>As the right protector struck, the scattered cultivator's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivated Spirit mid-stage, how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked in his heart and was about to flee.</p><p></p><p>Scattered cultivators, due to the lack of cultivation resources and even mediocre cultivation techniques, were mostly stuck at the initial stage of Cultivated Spirit, even after breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Their strength was generally weaker than the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families' Cultivated Spirits.</p><p></p><p>A Cultivated Spirit mid-stage scattered cultivator was truly extraordinary, perhaps even inheriting some legacies.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a white light flashed, and the right protector's expression changed drastically as he frantically retreated.</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu punched out, and with a thunderous sound, it collided with the white light, causing his figure to sway slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression was grave as he looked at the two figures in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Divine Sect Grand Elder, the Number One Expert of the Jade State, Zhu Liang!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect Grand Elder, Zhu Liang, had white light surging around him, his spiritual power undulating like ripples in the air.</p><p></p><p>He looked coldly at the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>"Are Xu Yan and Meng Chong your people?"</p><p></p><p>A scattered cultivator actually had the strength of the Cultivated Spirit late-stage, which was quite remarkable! </p><p></p><p>It seemed this scattered cultivator organization had grand ambitions.</p><p></p><p>"So what if they are? And so what if they aren't?" </p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master sneered.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no need for explanation - the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family had undoubtedly determined that Xu Yan and Meng Chong were related to the Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's true or not, you all must die today!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang stepped forward step by step, a white light surging up and soaring into the sky, his might terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's see if you, Zhu Liang, have what it takes!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master let out a low roar, not daring to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>A blue light surged from his body, a long saber appearing in his hand as he stepped forward to meet Zhu Liang.</p><p></p><p>The left and right protector deities had grave expressions - the Alliance Master's aura was weaker than Zhu Liang's, and they were likely no match for Zhu Liang, yet they could not assist each other.</p><p></p><p>The other person who had come with Zhu Liang had his spiritual energy locked onto the two of them from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Shu Zheng!" </p><p></p><p>The left protector deity said grimly.</p><p></p><p>Shu Zheng, the patriarch of the Su Family, was at the peak of the Refining Spirit mid-stage, just a step away from the Refining Spirit late-stage.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot allow you to stay, let's attack together and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Zheng looked at the two Refining Spirit wandering cultivators and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Patriarch Su!" </p><p></p><p>The two Refining Spirit wandering cultivators hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the left and right protector deities were both in the Refining Spirit mid-stage, facing the three-pronged attack, they were forced into a retreat.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the aristocratic families were inherently stronger than the wandering cultivators, and with the patriarch of the top-tier Su Family leading the charge, defeating the two of them was no problem, let alone with the two Refining Spirit initial-stage cultivators assisting.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Alliance Master had completely fallen into a disadvantageous position, being pressed and attacked by Zhu Liang, and had already sustained injuries.</p><p></p><p>"A mere wandering cultivator dares to defy his superiors and offend the might of the aristocratic families, do you not know your crime!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said coldly as he attacked.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master was very frustrated at this point - he had already anticipated that Zhu Liang's strength was superior to his, but he had never imagined it would be to such a degree.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was the number one expert of the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>What frustrated him even more was that the Millennium Alliance had been doing well, but then Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who came out of nowhere, destroyed the aristocratic families and slew the Refining Spirit cultivators, forcing the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family to the brink of madness, launching a massive search across the Jade State, but failing to find Xu Yan and Meng Chong, and instead exposing themselves.</p><p></p><p>He could not continue fighting, or he would surely die. The Alliance Master transmitted a message to the left and right protector deities, seeking an opportunity to flee, while frantically retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can escape?" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said unhurriedly, his fists and palms shining with white light, turning into endless streaks of light that battered the Alliance Master, worsening his injuries.</p><p></p><p>The left and right protector deities were also extremely frustrated - they wanted to flee as well, but Shu Zheng's strength was too formidable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>The right protector deity took a deep breath, suddenly unleashing a full-powered strike towards one of the wandering cultivators, ignoring Shu Zheng's attack.</p><p></p><p>The left protector deity gritted his teeth and charged forward, single-handedly resisting Shu Zheng's attacks, no longer caring about the other wandering cultivator's attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivator turned pale, alternating between defending and frantically retreating, but his strength was far inferior, and he quickly sustained heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>The right protector deity, as if he had gone mad, kept attacking relentlessly, determined to kill him.</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivator's face changed drastically, hastily fleeing and hiding behind Shu Zheng, allowing the right protector deity to seize the opportunity to escape!</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the left protector deity, he fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>The left protector deity kept coughing up blood, severely injured, but managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Wandering cultivators are all useless trash!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Zheng coldly looked at the injured wandering cultivator who had hidden from the right protector deity's attack, speaking coldly and disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>He did not pursue the left and right protector deities, but instead turned his gaze to the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>This Refining Spirit late-stage wandering cultivator deserved to die! In the Jade State, aside from Zhu Liang, their aristocratic families and sects did not have a single Refining Spirit late-stage cultivar.</p><p></p><p>Any second or third-rate aristocratic family facing them would be in danger of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Even the top-tier sects and aristocratic families, although they could withstand the attack, would still have to worry about being picked off one by one. Shu Zheng's figure moved, and he charged towards the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Alliance Master's face changed drastically - the left and right protector deities had fled quickly, but Shu Zheng did not pursue them, instead coming to attack him!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master roared, a surge of blood energy rising, and in an instant, he unleashed a secret martial art technique from his arsenal, a sword slash that broke through the white light.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam swept across, forcing the attacking Shu Zheng to retreat slightly, and the Alliance Master fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and Shu Zheng gave chase.</p><p></p><p>A Refining Spirit late-stage wandering cultivator in the Jade State, and a powerful figure of a wandering cultivator faction, this meant they had great ambitions and would likely take action against the aristocratic families and sects at any time.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Demon Calamity, the aristocratic families and sects had become extremely sensitive to these wandering cultivator factions, especially those with powerful experts and geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Once such a wandering cultivator faction was discovered, they would immediately unite to strike them down, lest they grow stronger and threaten the position of the aristocratic families and sects.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master fled frantically, with Zhu Liang and Shu Zheng in hot pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"This is dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master's heart sank as he looked back, his face turning green.</p><p></p><p>Not only was Zhu Liang's strength superior to his, but his speed was also faster. He gritted his teeth and frantically activated his cultivation technique, trying to widen the distance.</p><p></p><p>But the distance between them only kept getting shorter!</p><p></p><p>"Go to the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, the Zheng Kingdom does not participate in martial arts conflicts, and without a supreme sect's order, they will not rashly act against wandering cultivator factions.</p><p></p><p>"Hide in the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, Zhu Liang and Shu Zheng won't dare to unleash a massacre there, and I may have a slim chance of survival!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master's thoughts raced, and he bit his teeth and fled towards the capital of the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, halfway there, Zhu Liang was about to catch up, his attacks coming from afar.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master once again used a secret martial art technique, his speed suddenly increasing, quickly widening the distance, but his injuries were only getting worse.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe Zhu Liang will use a secret martial art technique just to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master thought angrily.</p><p></p><p>But when there was still a thousand miles to the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, Zhu Liang seemed to have seen through his intentions, his speed suddenly surging, turning into a white light and chasing after him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"The secret techniques of the aristocratic sects are not all self-damaging!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Although the consumption was massive, it would not harm himself, and this type of secret martial art technique, while relatively weaker in power, was sufficient to catch up to the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master's face turned green, cursing inwardly, and with a low roar, a dense blood-colored light surged from his body as he directly burned his essence blood to unleash his trump card secret technique.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly expanded, turning into a beam of blood light and disappearing into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's brow furrowed, and then he let out a cold laugh, "Burning essence blood, greatly damaging oneself, let's see where you can hide!"</p><p></p><p>In the manor, Fang Hao was excited.</p><p></p><p>Looking at a white talisman in his hand, with mysterious restrictive formations and array patterns, and smooth as jade in the center, the words he had written on the other side of the talisman had immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've refined it."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's call this the Communication Talisman."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

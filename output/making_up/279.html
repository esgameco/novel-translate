        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou was shaken, the supreme cultivator of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect had arrived! Zheng Kingdom, with Zheng Emperor leading a group of royal powerhouses and several major ministers, all took to the skies and rushed towards the borders of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>These were supreme cultivators, not mere true inheritors like Cui Huayu. Zheng Emperor and the others dared not show any negligence!</p><p></p><p>Apart from Zheng Kingdom, the major spiritual sects and powerful families of Yuzhou also emerged, going to welcome the arrival.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual domain, after all, was under the dominion of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect!</p><p></p><p>The territory of Yushan Sect and the Su Family, originally belonging to the Wanshi Alliance, now hastily went into hiding. Fortunately, apart from the Shen Family's powerhouses, no one else knew their identities.</p><p></p><p>And the Shen Family also secretly heaved a sigh of relief. If the Transcendent Spiritual Sect were to know that they had colluded with the scattered cultivators, they might be expelled from the ranks of the powerful families.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the establishment of every spiritual sect and powerful family in the spiritual domain must be recognized by the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Once expelled, they would no longer be a powerful family, no longer enjoy the treatment of a powerful family, and the territories they possessed would be instantly occupied by the other spiritual sects and powerful families.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Patriarch!" </p><p></p><p>Zheng Emperor and the others all prostrated on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Even from a distance, there was a sense of suffocation. Gazing ahead, there was a figure that was stirring up the winds and clouds as it approached.</p><p></p><p>Was this the might of a supreme cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Huang Liang nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal the aura of a supreme cultivator at all, holding a long spear in his hand, with wind and clouds surging around him.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Patriarch of the Sect!" </p><p></p><p>With the Yushan Sect destroyed, the leader of the spiritual forces in Yuzhou had become the Shen Family. Shen Tai, a late-stage Refining Spirit cultivator after Zhu Liang, led a group of Yuzhou spiritual sect and powerful family Refining Spirit cultivators to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang nodded.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was sharp and his expression was indifferent as he coldly asked, "Where are Xu Yan and his teacher?"</p><p></p><p>"We do not know their whereabouts, Patriarch." </p><p></p><p>Shen Tai bowed his head.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Emperor spoke up, "Patriarch, although Xu Yan and the others have hidden their tracks, they must still be in Yuzhou."</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang nodded and said, "Tell Xu Yan and his teacher that they are to kneel before me in three days, or else they will die."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerhouses felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The supreme cultivator had made his move, Xu Yan and his teacher were doomed! Many people's minds flashed back to the scene of Luo Xinting being killed in the battle of geniuses. To have provoked the intervention of a supreme cultivator from the Thousand Martial Hall, it was truly shocking!</p><p></p><p>Likely the supreme cultivator's arrival was because of Xu Yan's teacher.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang stepped forward, heading towards the capital of Zheng Kingdom to reside.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the various spiritual sects and families in Yuzhou all departed, spreading the news throughout Yuzhou, ensuring that it reached Xu Yan's ears.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Chenzhou, one of the eighteen states of the spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Peak stood tall for three thousand zhang, the highest peak among the continuous mountain ranges and the core of the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>But the interior of the Stone Peak had been hollowed out.</p><p></p><p>In the center was a vast square, and around the square were halls, pavilions, and secret chambers carved along the stone walls.</p><p></p><p>This was the headquarters of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The news from Luozhou had shaken the Wanshi Alliance, and many powerhouses gathered to discuss their next course of action.</p><p></p><p>The news that Yue Changming had been defeated and suppressed by the supreme cultivator Huang Liang of the Thousand Martial Hall had also been transmitted.</p><p></p><p>In a grand hall, the powerhouses were gathered.</p><p></p><p>One burly man among them had a furious expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Liang!"</p><p></p><p>His face flushed red, and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"I must kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the head of the hall, the refined and scholarly Grand Alliance Master Tan Wenlin sighed, "Yue Changming, the Moon Shining in the Sky. I had heard of your great reputation in the past, when I was at the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you had perished in the Myriad Star Calamity, but unexpectedly you had survived. </p><p></p><p>"With your talent, you should not have been defeated by Huang Liang."</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin said with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>The burly man angrily said, "Brother Yue was once suppressed in his spiritual body by the despicable old man of the Thousand Martial Hall, otherwise Huang Liang would not have been his match!"</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Luozhou Alliance has been nearly destroyed, Huang Liang's arrogance is intolerable. Let me go and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man stood up.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin pondered for a moment, his expression grave as he said, "Da Niu, be careful. Huang Liang is a supreme cultivator after all, the foundation of the Thousand Martial Hall cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>Da Niu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin's expression became serious as he looked at the Wanshi Alliance powerhouses present, saying, "Brothers, Luozhou Alliance has suffered heavy losses, and the branch alliances in the other states are likely also exposed. The spiritual sects will soon take action.</p><p></p><p>"Since we can no longer remain hidden, it is time for the Wanshi Alliance to emerge and greet the supreme cultivator of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect!</p><p></p><p>"The time has come for the Wanshi Alliance to make its appearance, and we shall meet the supreme cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance powerhouses all spoke up, "The Master is right, it is time for our Wanshi Alliance to emerge!"</p><p></p><p>"I've had enough of this!"</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual sects have been too tyrannical, our Wanshi Alliance must carve out a place for ourselves!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin pressed his hand down, and the hall immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"We need powerhouses to guard the branch alliances. You all shall depart immediately and instruct them to occupy a state. Chenzhou shall be the territory of our Wanshi Alliance!</p><p></p><p>"Even if we cannot secure a place for the scattered cultivators in the eighteen states, Chenzhou must be under our control.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Yuzhou branch, it shall remain hidden for now and we won't send any powerhouses there. Da Niu, you shall go and guard Luozhou."</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin began to deploy the tasks.</p><p></p><p>After the tasks were assigned, the Wanshi Alliance powerhouses all departed the headquarters, heading to their respective state branch alliances.</p><p></p><p>"Da Niu, I know you hate Huang Liang and the Thousand Martial Hall, but Huang Liang is a supreme cultivator after all. Even if you can defeat him, killing him may be difficult. Do not take unnecessary risks, and do not let your injuries be too severe.</p><p></p><p>"The blood of our Wanshi Alliance brothers in Luozhou cannot be in vain. Go and destroy the Qiming Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin said solemnly as he saw Da Niu off.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry. I, Da Niu, know what I'm doing. I will guard Luozhou, I will destroy the Qiming Sect, and the blood of my Wanshi Alliance brothers will not be shed in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Huang Liang does not die, I will severely wound him. </p><p></p><p>"Whether it's for avenging Brother Yue or for the hatred from the academy back then, I will not let him off easily!"</p><p></p><p>Da Niu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin patted his shoulder and said no more.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Six Luminaries of the Myriad Stars, once renowned and even surpassing the geniuses of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, how many of them were still alive today? Da Niu was one of them, but his ranking among the Thirty-Six Luminaries was relatively low.</p><p></p><p>Da Niu left, heading straight for Luozhou to ambush Huang Liang and destroy the Qiming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin stood there, pondering silently. In the past, the Thirty-Six Luminaries of the Myriad Stars were known to all, revered by the scattered cultivators throughout the spiritual domain. But now, how many scattered cultivators still knew of the Thirty-Six Luminaries?</p><p></p><p>Even the Blood Demon, who had once swept through the spiritual domain and destroyed the spiritual sects and powerful families, how many scattered cultivators still knew of his deeds?</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual sects!"</p><p></p><p>The traces of history had nearly been erased by the spiritual sects. Only they, the survivors, knew what had happened in the past. But even if they spoke of it now, how many scattered cultivators would believe that there were once genius cultivators who surpassed the geniuses of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Where is the Prodigy of the Spiritual Sect?</p><p></p><p>How many wandering cultivators would believe that there was once a person who had left a shadow in the hearts of the Spiritual Sect's aristocratic families?</p><p></p><p>Probably, they would all think it's absurd.</p><p></p><p>"The mightiest prodigy, not one of the Thirty-Six Heroes, but the Demonic Patriarch of the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He felt heavy-hearted. Could he, Tan Wenlin, accomplish what the once so powerful Demonic Patriarch had failed to do?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Luozhou Alliance has been destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was quite surprised after receiving the message from Yu Gao.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the Myriad Worlds Alliance, wanting to secure a place for the wandering cultivators, would not be too weak in strength. But the Gui State Alliance had just emerged, and it had already been crushed, almost completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance's master and other powerful experts had died in battle, with only a few people escaping and fleeing to Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate experts have come to Yuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Then he angrily said, "Qian Wu Palace's Huang Liang, with such a big mouth, actually boasted that we should kneel and worship him in three days, or else we will die!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes flashed with a cold light. This Huang Liang was going too far on the path of seeking death.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous! Qian Wu Palace, I will trample it underfoot!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a furious expression.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming walked out of the house. After recuperating, his injuries had recovered quite well, and his cultivation had not fallen, but due to the exhaustion of his spiritual foundation, his strength was not as strong as before.</p><p></p><p>But to have survived was already a great fortune.</p><p></p><p>He no longer dared to ask for too much.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Liang is extremely powerful, his spear's might is like the grand power of heaven and earth, we cannot be careless!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. The might of a single spear, like the grand power of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the ultimate experts of the Spiritual Sect have already mastered the power of the laws of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>But then he thought again, that shouldn't be the case.</p><p></p><p>If they could truly wield the power of the laws of heaven and earth, even with a light touch, Yue Changming would have no chance of escape, not even a sliver.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Huang Liang to come here and die. How dare a mere ant call himself an ultimate expert, what a joke!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was excited.</p><p></p><p>Was the master going to act again?</p><p></p><p>He immediately sent a message to Yu Gao, asking him to spread the news and let Huang Liang come to his death.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming no longer tried to persuade them. When the ultimate experts have become mere ants, what is there to persuade? If they are truly no match, then they will all die together! Looking at Xu Yan and the others, none of them were worried, but rather excited, as if waiting to see the scene of Huang Liang, this mere ant, being slapped to death.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu didn't even take Huang Liang's matter to heart and began to explain the upcoming treatment to Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"Your spiritual foundation is exhausted, the difficulty in restoring it is quite great, mainly because I don't have the special spiritual herbs to activate your foundation.</p><p></p><p>"But there is a way, I can refine a Blood Vitality Reviving Pill to activate your spirit, replenishing the exhausted foundation.</p><p></p><p>"As long as your spirit is activated and the foundation is restored to some extent, you just need to cultivate, and you can recover your spirit to its peak."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was shocked. Could his spirit truly be restored? However, he soon felt a sense of gloom. If it was just this one time his spirit was crushed, perhaps he could recover. But in his youth, his spirit had already been damaged and fragmented.</p><p></p><p>Now that his spiritual foundation was completely exhausted, how could he recover it?</p><p></p><p>"My spirit has been damaged and fragmented since my youth, and now it has completely collapsed, losing its foundation. This old injury, I'm afraid it cannot be activated and restored."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head. "I've finally come out to treat someone, if I can't cure you, won't that make me look incompetent? Don't worry, even though your spirit has been damaged for a long time, the problem is not big, it can still be restored."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was astonished. "Can it truly be restored?"</p><p></p><p>If he could restore his spirit, he might not be impossible to reach Huang Liang's level of strength.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded, then said, "But you'll need some spiritual foundation."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Yue'er beside her, she said, "Sister Yue'er is a spiritual being, of the same bloodline as you, we need her essence blood to refine the Blood Vitality Reviving Pill!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming immediately rejected the idea. "No! I cannot let Yue'er be harmed because of me!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, it's fine, this little bit of damage doesn't matter to Yue'er!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming's attitude was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu sighed helplessly. "You old fool, I can restore your spirit, do you really think I can harm Yue'er's spirit? You should just trust my pill-refining skills."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming opened his mouth but had no words. Su Lingxiu's words made a lot of sense!</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Lingxiu took a bit of Yue'er's essence blood, gave her a pill to replenish the loss, and then prepared to refine the pill to restore Yue Changming's spirit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Huang Liang's group was heading towards the capital of Zheng Kingdom, a figure suddenly rushed over in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor asked from afar.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a powerful expert from the Zheng Imperial family.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, there is news of Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Speak!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, Xu Yan's teacher told someone to pass on a message to Your Highness, saying that he is outside the capital, and telling you to..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator who delivered the message suddenly paused, his forehead beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Eager to take credit, he had not realized that the words Xu Yan's teacher had him convey were highly disrespectful towards the ultimate expert.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang frowned. "Speak the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>The man took a deep breath, steadied himself, and repeated the message in the same tone as the messenger. "Tell Huang Liang to come here and die. How dare a mere ant call himself an ultimate expert, what a joke!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he felt relieved, muttering to himself, "This is the original message, not something I said. Surely the ultimate expert won't blame me."</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang let out a mocking laugh.</p><p></p><p>With a thrust of his spear, a spear beam shot out, instantly killing the messenger.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor and the others were covered in cold sweat, inwardly cursing the messenger, thinking he deserved to die for imitating the tone. "Good, good, good. We'll see who is the ant, the ignorant fool. I was going to give you a chance to live, but you insisted on seeking your own death, so I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang laughed angrily and rushed towards the capital of Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor and the others hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>The news had also spread, and cultivators from the major Spiritual Sects' families were rushing to the outskirts of the Zheng Kingdom capital, eager to witness the earth-shaking battle! To see the might of the ultimate expert! Although the battle of the prodigies had seen Xu Yan's teacher unleash shocking power, no one believed he could match the ultimate expert of the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were doomed.</p><p></p><p>"The ants are coming!"</p><p></p><p>In the manor, Su Lingxiu was preparing to refine the pill, when Li Xuan raised his head and said calmly, "The ants are coming!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

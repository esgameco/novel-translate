        <h1>Chapter 432</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The youth in purple robes pondered and said:</p><p></p><p>"It can be understood that way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But if one is already extremely strong, to the point of being invincible, why would they still be considered weak?" The purple-robed youth looked puzzled. "How strong does one need to be to be considered strong?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly. The purple-robed youth had called him "senior", which was a good start. It showed that the other party acknowledged his immense strength! Acknowledged him as an incredibly powerful senior!</p><p></p><p>"How strong? The trail I've blazed becomes the legend that later generations seek to follow. Yet before me, there were no predecessors. </p><p></p><p>"Thus, one can feel the loneliness of being invincible."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth scratched his head and hesitantly asked: "Are you talking about yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled without answering, fully displaying the mysteriousness of a master.</p><p></p><p>In the small stone house, they chatted casually, with Li Xuan occasionally boasting a bit, but stopping short, fully demonstrating his profound inscrutability. </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth seemed to have not chatted with anyone for a long time, especially casual conversation with a powerful figure. As they talked more and more, he occasionally almost let something slip, but stopped himself in time and changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan didn't obtain too much information, he roughly figured out that the purple-robed youth was very powerful, and somewhat special, but his mentality was indeed that of a youth, occasionally showing extreme curiosity.</p><p></p><p>At times he also gave the impression of being inexperienced in the ways of the world. As long as he grasped the right measure and slowly persuaded him, he would surely be able to find out the information he needed to know.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't be too obvious about it. Although the purple-robed youth was somewhat inexperienced, he remained vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also gradually guessed that the purple-robed youth was sealed here to prevent him from being discovered by enemies.</p><p></p><p>The person who arranged all this was extremely powerful, and had a very close relationship with the purple-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>"As old as heaven and earth, he has some special connection with this world. Even with my current level and the Eye of the Heavenly Dao, I still couldn't see through it all. The person who arranged all this is too strong.</p><p></p><p>"Although I couldn't see through it all, I've guessed some things. If my guess is correct, this is quite unusual.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicang world once had a master. The only one who could arrange all this would be the master of the Taicang world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the small stone house, Li Xuan walked leisurely through the wilderness and arrived at the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was deep as he looked towards the once-sealed Heavenly Pit. With a wave of his hand, the power of the Dao surged, completely repairing the Heavenly Pit of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pit of the Spirit Realm was small and not difficult to repair. With Li Xuan's current strength and understanding of the Taicang world, he could naturally do it easily.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm hasn't changed much, except that the low-level scattered cultivators are no longer so humble, and the structure of the major forces hasn't changed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked through the Spirit Realm. The Wanshi Alliance had already become one of the top powers in the Spirit Realm, and the demon race established by Chijiao had become the third race in the Spirit Realm besides humans and sea spirits.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the blue sea, he returned to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Although I didn't get much information, there has been some progress."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair and picked up the Taicang Book to read. Although he had completely memorized the Taicang Book, he still read it with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"Let him stew for a while."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Jiang Buping absorbed the Indestructible Qi to cultivate an indestructible spirit. Your Extreme Soul Martial Arts has advanced to the Heaven and Earth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed. The Extreme Soul Martial Arts had also advanced to the Heaven and Earth Realm, greatly increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping successfully cultivated with the Indestructible Qi again, directly feeding back to advance the Extreme Soul Martial Arts to the Heaven and Earth Realm. Now I alone am equivalent to two Heaven and Earth Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Body was also at the Heaven and Earth Realm, which meant that when facing enemies of similar strength, he could fight two-on-one and win completely!</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Ancestor's true form is advancing a bit slowly, not yet reaching the Heaven and Earth Realm. That Chijiao fellow should be more diligent."</p><p></p><p>If the Demon Ancestor's true form also advanced to the Heaven and Earth Realm, it would mean he could fight three-on-one against enemies of similar strength!</p><p></p><p>"The demon race in the Divine Realm hasn't been established yet, but it shouldn't be too far off."</p><p></p><p>Chijiao's current strength was still weak, lacking some confidence to establish the demon race in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, once Chijiao's strength reached the Void-Breaking Realm, he would have enough confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is in chaos again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Those Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow people were quite capable, causing chaos in another realm and sparking a great war.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of development, it wouldn't be long before the entire Divine Realm would be plunged into war, and outside enemies were also very likely to invade through the Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>"No powerful figures have stepped in to intervene. It seems some people also want to see if they can benefit from the unification of heaven and earth, or rather, is the unification of heaven and earth actually a plot for the position of master of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly realized that the unification of heaven and earth was probably a plot for the position of master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how much they calculate, they can't calculate that I won't be the master of heaven and earth, and others can't be either. It would be in name only, meaningless."</p><p></p><p>With the Taicang Book in his hands, no one could match his understanding of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>Even if a so-called master of heaven and earth appeared, it would only be false, completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to pass on the martial arts methods above the Heaven and Earth Realm to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>On Li Xuan's spirit platform, his primordial spirit held the Golden Book of the Great Dao. Now as he opened the Golden Book of the Great Dao, the martial arts methods above the Heaven and Earth Realm were already written in it.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Heaven and Earth Realm, one can be comparable to the master of heaven and earth, also belonging to transcending heaven and earth. After transcending heaven and earth, the use of the Golden Book of the Great Dao will also be enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although at this moment, his primordial spirit held a pen in one hand, this pen was very heavy, and he couldn't use it to write martial arts methods in the Golden Book of the Great Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Even at the Heaven and Earth Realm I can't use this pen. After breaking through another realm, I should be able to use it."</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Body walked out from the spirit platform and sat down in the chair. Li Xuan took a step and instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Long Cloud Realm, the winds were rising and clouds surging. The Hundred Battles Hall had issued a duel challenge, inviting Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow to battle! With the Hundred Battles Hall's action, the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow organization emerged in the martial world, with many martial artists discussing in shock what kind of organization this was!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In front of a certain sect in the Long Cloud Realm, Luo Zhan led ten True King Celestial Venerables to descend.</p><p></p><p>"I, Luo, have come to arrest the villains of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, not to target your sect. You can rest assured, our Hundred Battles Hall never wrongly accuses people. I'm sure you as the sect leader are clear about our credibility on this point.</p><p></p><p>"Your sect's second elder, fifth elder, and third core disciple are all members of Earth's Shadow. If you're sensible, you'll surrender quietly."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's aura erupted, his battle intent surging as he directly pointed out the hidden Earth's Shadow members.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader and other elders were stunned. They wanted to argue, but found that those named by Luo Zhan had all committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They felt their scalps tingle and a chill run through their hearts. Someone who had been in the same sect with them, someone they knew as well as they knew themselves, was actually a spy for the mysterious force known as Tianshadiying? What terrified them even more was that, in order to avoid capture and leaking information about Tianshadiying, this person had decisively chosen to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly a death soldier! And such a person had been hiding within the sect, even becoming an elder in a core position. If they harbored ill intentions, what kind of terrible blow could they deal to the sect? It could even bring about the sect's destruction!</p><p></p><p>"Detain everyone associated with them!" the sect leader angrily ordered.</p><p></p><p>When this news spread, it shook the Changyu Realm. All the major factions became restless. </p><p></p><p>No great power would tolerate spies infiltrating their sect, so all the major factions began taking action, investigating their sects in an effort to root out any hidden Diying members.</p><p></p><p>In Baimu City.</p><p></p><p>"Are there spies in my Wanbao Alliance as well? Is my disciple's death related to this? Find out everything for me."</p><p></p><p>By now, Yan Shanhe understood one thing - his disciple was not killed by Meng Chong! With Meng Chong's strength, if he had taken action, no one would have been able to return alive, let alone just losing an arm! However, although he now knew the killer of his disciple was not Meng Chong, the grudge between them could not be resolved.</p><p></p><p>So, Meng Chong must die!</p><p></p><p>"What a clever scheme, to plot against me, Yan Shanhe. Using others to do the killing, is that it?" Yan Shanhe's gaze was ice cold.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying, extending their reach into the Wanbao Alliance - this is a provocation!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance also launched into action.</p><p></p><p>Although Diying's infiltration and disguise abilities were profound, under the personal scrutiny of the Immortal Venerable, not all Diying members could escape detection.</p><p></p><p>So in a short time, all the major factions had rooted out infiltrated Diying members.</p><p></p><p>All at once, Tianshadiying's forces in the Changyu Realm suffered significant losses. And the root cause of all this was just one mistaken action by the Eight-Leaf Tiansha.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" In the Jiushan Realm, Tian Seventeen's face turned black with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Rang acted on his own initiative, not going to kill Xu Yan himself, but instead recklessly deploying an operation!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was furious.</p><p></p><p>Wu Rang was the name of the Eight-Leaf Tiansha in the Changyu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what should we do now?" the Tiansha of Hengfeng Mountain asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Seventeen wore a Seven-Leaf Tiansha mask, his status in Tianshadiying was not simple. This mask was just to conceal his true identity.</p><p></p><p>"I will arrange this matter. It's time for Xu Yan to die!" Tian Seventeen said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Will you take action personally, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen shook his head and strode away.</p><p></p><p>While the major factions in the Changyu Realm were experiencing minor turmoil due to Tianshadiying, Xu Yan had already arrived at the Tuowu Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! With one sword strike, all the surrounding witch puppets were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, so strong, who is he?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"So it's him. Judging by his strength, he seems even more powerful than Hong Ting!"</p><p></p><p>"The number one below the Immortal Realm - that's what Luo Zhan said."</p><p></p><p>In the Tuowu Heavenly Cave, some martial artists discussed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan walked step by step towards the depths of the Tuowu Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to meet that Tuowu Witch.</p><p></p><p>Those attacking him now, although possessing Tuowu witch power, were clearly not pure. They were either witch puppets of Tuowu or servants transformed by some kind of power infiltration. They couldn't even be considered true descendants.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this Tuowu Witch knows Meiwu!" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Does Tuowu Witch have any treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wanted to lure Meiwu here, but he needed to grasp the right balance. What if Meiwu felt that entering the Heavenly Cave without enough strength to deal with him wasn't worth it, and decided not to come?</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do is let Meiwu know that I'm searching for treasures similar to the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, that I desperately crave such treasures and am willing to take risks. That way, she should set up treasures to lure me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was plotting in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen Tuowu witch puppets opened hundreds of eyes between their chests and abdomens, emitting strange light.</p><p></p><p>"This evil gaze is indeed somewhat bizarre, able to erode one's will, but it's too weak." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. These hundred-eyed evil lights had no effect on him at all.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was sword intent, the Wisdom Sword realm, dragon prestige intent, or other martial techniques, they could easily resist the Tuowu witch's evil eye power.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A sword strike lashed out, black sword light annihilating everything. In an instant, these witch puppets were destroyed to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists behind Xu Yan were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like Xu Yan's strength is not inferior to an Immortal Venerable. What kind of martial technique has he cultivated? It's too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan really does kill enemies without leaving corpses!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched as Xu Yan walked step by step towards the depths of the Tuowu Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Yan going to find the Tuowu Witch ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a real Tuowu Witch, with extremely bizarre hundred eyes. Even ordinary Immortal Realm cultivators can't resist it. Isn't Xu Yan afraid of being corrupted by the evil eye light and becoming useless?"</p><p></p><p>"All peerless geniuses are this arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan killed another dozen or so witch puppets, and was not far from the core area of the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you're very arrogant." A cold voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood calmly with his sword, looking at the figure that appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Tuowu Witch?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you call my name?" The Tuowu Witch laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and pressed down with a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword appeared, and he unleashed the Sword of Mountains and Rivers, directly destroying the other's attack.</p><p></p><p>"I want to experience just how powerful the Tuowu Witch's hundred-eyed evil light really is!" Xu Yan said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet in the Immortal Realm, yet possessing such strength. To think the Taicang world produced a genius like you? I most enjoy corrupting geniuses, so I'll grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu Witch was astonished.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Hundreds of eyes opened between his chest and abdomen, evil gazes looking at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's heart tightened. The Tuowu Witch's evil eye light was far beyond what those witch puppets could compare to. Even he felt a bizarre power, as if it was trying to erode his will.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The image of mountains and rivers appeared, and Xu Yan stood proudly, staring directly at the Tuowu Witch's evil eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really have a hundred eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"One, two, three..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan actually started counting, a sight that nearly infuriated the Tuowu Witch!</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant brat!"</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu Witch's face was extremely gloomy. Never had anyone dared to disregard his evil eyes like this. This was the first!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Eyes also appeared on his cheeks and forehead.</p><p></p><p>Each eye had a different expression - sorrowful, angry, excited... The bizarre power grew stronger, even emitting an evil light.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was now enveloped in this evil light!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

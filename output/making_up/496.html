        <h1>Chapter 496</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Another Wanbao Alliance warrior, with a terrified expression, turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!" </p><p></p><p>Red Cat sneered, moving swiftly to block the opponent's escape route.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no way to escape, the Wanbao Alliance expert gritted his teeth, steeled his resolve, and let out an angry roar. It seemed as if he was going to fight Red Cat to the death, but instead he suddenly lunged downward, unleashing a powerful aura. His attack was actually aimed at Jade Little Dragon on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon: ???</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was also stunned. What was this guy doing? Shouldn't he be fighting Red Cat to the death? Why was he trying to kill Jade Little Dragon instead?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he knew Jade Little Dragon was the Second Demon King, and planned to take this opportunity to kill him, so that even if he died he'd take someone important with him? Aow! Jade Little Dragon wanted to cry but had no tears. He let out a dragon's roar, his form instantly shrinking and transforming into a streak of green light that vanished from the spot in an instant. </p><p></p><p>In such a rushed moment, and having just been beaten badly by Red Cat, he had no way to withstand such a powerful attack and could only dodge.</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance warrior's eyes were bloodshot as he directly used a secret technique that greatly depleted his vital essence. In an instant, he attacked Jade Little Dragon again.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I die, I'll drag you demons down with me to avenge the fallen true dragon!" the Wanbao Alliance warrior shouted madly.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon nearly coughed up blood in anger. Although he was a true dragon, he had no connection whatsoever to the True Dragon Clan. If he died, the True Dragon Clan wouldn't even spare him a glance, let alone seek revenge for him!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this Wanbao Alliance warrior didn't know any of this.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that he was certain to die today. </p><p></p><p>And this true dragon had clearly been injured, which must have been done by the demon race. If a true dragon fell in demon territory, how could the True Dragon Clan let it go? They would surely seek revenge against the demons. This way, even though he would die, he'd have the true dragons avenge him.</p><p></p><p>If word of this got out, he could leave his mark in martial arts history and become a legend.</p><p></p><p>In this life-or-death crisis, the Wanbao Alliance warrior had a flash of inspiration. His mind was extremely clear. Rather than fighting the Great Demon King to the death and ultimately being killed, it was better to take a different approach. Even if he died, he could have true dragons avenge him, so his death wouldn't be in vain!</p><p></p><p>"Quick, stop him!" </p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon's face had turned green. What kind of madman was this?!</p><p></p><p>Croak! Little Ha opened his mouth, and in an instant a demonic energy enveloped Jade Little Dragon, pulling him over and avoiding the fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance warrior wanted to continue his attack, but Red Cat no longer gave him the chance.</p><p></p><p>A violent blade light instantly descended, engulfing him within.</p><p></p><p>When the blade light dissipated, that warrior had not perished, but was covered in wounds and collapsed on the ground, completely unable to resist or escape.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" </p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon, having regained his senses, raised his claw to kill the man.</p><p></p><p>Smack! But Red Cat slapped him to the ground with a tiger paw.</p><p></p><p>"We can't kill him yet!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon was extremely frustrated. He had thought Red Cat was letting him personally finish off the opponent, but that wasn't the case!</p><p></p><p>"Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat chuckled and said, "Since these two are from the Wanbao Alliance and appeared here, can you guess where they were headed and who they were after?"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon was stunned for a moment, then understood. The Wanbao Alliance experts had made a breakthrough and thought they were capable now, so they were planning to seek revenge against Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>"The Great King is mighty!" </p><p></p><p>The demon generals and commanders cheered, with Wind Spirit Tiger shouting the loudest.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was very pleased. To become a demon general or commander, one must be quick-witted. This batch of demon generals and commanders could be considered qualified.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was even more satisfied with Wind Spirit Tiger's performance. It was clear he had benefited from Red Cat's previous guidance, as his mind was much sharper than before.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go back for a while. You two stay here and keep things stable, presiding over the demon race!" Red Cat said, looking at Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!" Little Ha called out, indicating he wanted to go back too.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, let's go together."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat nodded, then made arrangements for demon affairs, leaving Jade Little Dragon, the Second Demon King, to continue presiding over the demon race.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! After a violent tremor, Dao rhymes emerged and spiritual energy surged. A storm of spiritual energy erupted from the fallen Shadow Realm, sweeping across the entire Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth manifested, and the power of these laws was growing stronger. Dao rhymes spread with the laws to the other 37 realms of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was in the process of merging with the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire world began to change.</p><p></p><p>And with this storm of spiritual energy, as Dao rhymes spread throughout the Divine Realm, the martial arts limits in all realms except the Taihe Realm would be broken through.</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists who were stuck at bottlenecks would also break through to new realms in this moment of surging spiritual energy and emerging Dao rhymes.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, a group of Immortal Venerable martial artists would appear in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many who had been stuck before the Immortal realm, honing themselves in the Refining Truth realm for long ages, would also have a portion break through their shackles and achieve Immortality amidst this great change!</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Realm entered a new era, a group of Tianhe realm martial artists had already gathered to discuss going to the Qinghua Realm to seek revenge for their humiliation against Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>In a deep forest, Tian Seventeen was hiding, extremely cautious, afraid that someone from the Qinghua Realm would come to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a patch of mist appeared, and a shadow-like figure silently materialized before him.</p><p></p><p>"My Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's expression instantly became solemn as he hurriedly bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue was like a shadow, seeming as if he could vanish at any moment. His voice was also elusive, making it impossible to determine its source.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan, and what is the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen respectfully replied, "My Lord, Xu Yan is in the Qinghua Realm. He also brought that true dragon back to the Qinghua Realm. The specific circumstances are unknown for now, as the Qinghua Realm is sealed off and no information can get out."</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm, is it?" Yin Jue murmured to himself, then said, "I need to make a trip to the Qinghua Realm, but I can't go directly. I need you to create some commotion."</p><p></p><p>If there really was a Realm Lord level expert in the Qinghua Realm, even with the assistance of the Mist Beast's true spirit, he risked exposing himself. Therefore, he needed to create some disturbance in order to better infiltrate.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my Lord. I know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen pondered briefly, then had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Some Immortal Venerables in the Divine Realm have broken through their limits and entered the Tianhe realm. Many of them have grudges against Xu Yan and intend to seek revenge for their past humiliation. If we give them a push from behind to join forces and harass the Qinghua Realm, challenging Xu Yan, it could create an opportunity for you, my Lord."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue nodded and said, "Let's do that then. Seventeen, your ability to handle matters is quite good. Otherwise, Lord Tianshai wouldn't have sent you to the Divine Realm to be in charge of this important task."</p><p></p><p>"You flatter me, my Lord," Tian Seventeen said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"The Shadow Realm won't remain stable for long. We must complete this task before martial artists from other forces enter the Divine Realm. Act quickly." </p><p></p><p>With that, Yin Jue's figure vanished without a trace, as if he had never been there.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's heart...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sighing, in the entire Shadow Realm, besides the mysterious and unfathomable Lord of the Shadow Realm, only two or three people possessed such marvelous and hidden techniques.</p><p></p><p>"It's Lord Yin Jue!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen made this judgment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For the Supreme One to dispatch Lord Yin Jue himself showed how much importance was placed on the person behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to take action."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen began to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Divine Realm, several Tianhe Realm martial artists gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, have you thought it through? Do you really want to go find Xu Yan and Xue to wipe away the humiliation?" one martial artist asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we must go!" </p><p></p><p>One person said coldly: "Are you willing to endure such great humiliation? Don't you want to break through the shackles in your hearts and eliminate Xu Yan's influence on yourselves?</p><p></p><p>"Now the Divine Realm and Dao Realm are entering unification. We all have the opportunity to reach even higher realms. Even the Divine Venerable Realm is not unattainable. </p><p></p><p>"However, if the influence Xu Yan left on our minds is not eliminated, it will inevitably have a major impact on our cultivation. Are you willing to be forever stuck in the Tianhe Realm? Just like before, when we were unable to advance in the Immortal Realm and could only wait bitterly for the Heavenly Ladder to open, for a chance to enter the Dao Realm? Whether it's to wipe away the shame or to break through mental barriers and reach higher realms, we can't back down anymore!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he became increasingly angry, his face flushed red and his breathing heavy.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other Tianhe Realm martial artists immediately started breathing heavily as well, the scene from the Miao Boundary flashing through their minds.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan alone had rebuked the many Immortal Venerable Lords, suppressing them so they didn't dare to breathe, and could only smile obsequiously.</p><p></p><p>Since breaking through to the Immortal Realm, which one of them hadn't been a lofty figure holding sway over the world? When had they ever suffered such humiliation?</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that scene back then didn't affect their minds, it would be utterly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. Whether it's to wipe away past shame or to break through mental barriers, we must find Xu Yan and demand an explanation. Otherwise, we'll never be able to escape his shadow for our entire lives!"</p><p></p><p>Soon others began to agree.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible hand was manipulating everything. One after another, Tianhe Realm martial artists gathered, all to seek justice from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As more and more people gathered, everyone's courage grew. Their strength was already far beyond what it used to be - how could they still be afraid of Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had all been at the peak of the Immortal Realm for many years, only unable to break through due to the limits of martial arts in the Divine Realm. That's why they were able to break through so quickly after the upper limit was removed.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan to have such freakish strength at such a young age was already unbelievable. It was impossible for his strength to have increased dramatically again in just a few short years.</p><p></p><p>Besides, Xu Yan had returned to the Qinghua Realm when the Divine Realm underwent great changes. The Qinghua Realm may not necessarily be able to break through the upper limit of the Immortal Realm now.</p><p></p><p>"With just these people, the momentum is still not great enough," Tian Seventeen pondered. "We should also bring in the Wanbao Alliance. Meng Chong is also in the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Tian Seventeen began to push things behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, while the Tianhe Realm martial artists were discussing the date to join forces and go to the Qinghua Realm to wipe away their shame from Xu Yan, the powerful members of the Wanbao Alliance unexpectedly offered a high price, inviting the group of Tianhe Realm martial artists to support the Wanbao Alliance after arriving in the Qinghua Realm! The martial artists naturally agreed readily - if they could suppress Xu Yan, suppressing Meng Chong would be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>As news spread of the grand group of Tianhe Realm experts preparing to head to the Qinghua Realm, many Immortal Venerable Lords also joined in.</p><p></p><p>This was of course orchestrated by Tian Seventeen behind the scenes. It's worth noting that both Xu Yan and Meng Chong had offended many factions when they retaliated against the Heavenly Fiends and Shadow Realm before.</p><p></p><p>Now that an opportunity had presented itself, how could they not participate?</p><p></p><p>Soon after, powerful figures from the Cloud Peak Sect of the Taikun Realm also joined in. Their target was Jiang Buping!</p><p></p><p>Back then, they had been forced to admit defeat and submit due to Jiang Buping's strength. Now the new sect master and several elders had broken through to the Tianhe Realm - it was time to wipe away that shame!</p><p></p><p>"The Jiang family hasn't taken any action."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it again, he felt it was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Jiang family was the family of Jiang Feng, the Lord of the Taikun Realm, in the Divine Realm. And Jiang Buping was also a descendant of Jiang Feng. The Jiang family wouldn't act rashly now - they needed to wait for people from the Dao Realm to arrive before making a decision.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jiang Buping was a rare supreme genius produced by the Jiang family, and would certainly be favored by the older generation of the Jiang family in the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>If they were to target Jiang Buping now, it would surely incur the wrath of the older generation of the Jiang family in the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Qinghua Realm and find Xu Yan to wipe away our shame!"</p><p></p><p>The grand procession, like an army setting out to punish a heinous criminal, marched imposingly towards the Qinghua Realm, continuously building momentum and exerting pressure along the way.</p><p></p><p>In the crowd, a young man carrying a long saber on his back walked silently, occasionally looking ahead with bloodshot eyes full of violent intent.</p><p></p><p>The saber on his back was wrapped tightly in leather, concealing even the hilt.</p><p></p><p>Although the accompanying martial artists were somewhat puzzled by the young man carrying the saber, rather than storing it in a storage bag, the martial world was full of people with strange habits, so merely carrying a saber wasn't particularly unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, find an opportunity to hunt and kill Immortal Venerable Lords to refine the Blood Prison Demon Saber. The more blood refinement, the stronger this saber becomes. With this saber, you'll be able to resist Jiang Buping's soul techniques. This is an extremely powerful secret technique of the Blood Demon Way!" </p><p></p><p>A voice sounded in the young man's soul.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Ancestor. I understand," the young man replied.</p><p></p><p>"Good. You have the potential for great things. You're not comparable to that useless boy from the Jiang family!" Blood Extreme said approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Jiang Tianming made him feel a bit of pain for the part of his soul that had perished because of him.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, that boy called Jiang Buping was also his enemy!</p><p></p><p>As the grand procession of experts continued, more and more Immortal Venerable Lords joined along the way. Although most came just to watch the excitement, it still made for an incredibly imposing sight, even grander than when they had surrounded and tried to kill the True Dragon before.</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable Lord who had just left the procession, intending to go back and take care of some matters before continuing on to watch the excitement, was suddenly stabbed in the chest by a bright crimson long saber.</p><p></p><p>His essence blood began to drain away, even giving off a bloody aura, as if his blood had begun to boil in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Puff! An Immortal Venerable Lord fell just like that. The young man withdrew his saber, disposed of the shriveled corpse, then once again tightly wrapped the bright crimson long saber in leather.</p><p></p><p>The occasional disappearance of a few Immortal Venerable Lords from the group going to confront Xu Yan didn't attract any attention. After all, it was understandable that some people might not continue on with the group.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue, hidden within the crowd, looked towards that young man with slightly furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld Blood Demon Way? Which Blood King's methods are these? Or perhaps a Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue stared at the young man thoughtfully. "The seed of a Blood Demon substitute - which Blood Lord has infiltrated, wanting to cultivate a substitute in the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Since it was a Blood Lord manipulating things behind the scenes, Yin Jue had no intention of interfering. His mission was to hunt and kill Xu Yan's master. As for the Netherworld's infiltration, naturally other experts would handle that.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

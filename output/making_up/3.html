        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 3 Diligent Training of Xu Yan</p><p></p><p>"The horse stance is set, adjust your breathing, calm your mind, focus your intent on the dantian, sense your own qi and blood..."</p><p></p><p>Under Li Xuan's guidance, Xu Yan took the horse stance and adjusted his breathing, trying to sense his qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed him, "The key to my cultivation method lies in the words 'comprehension' and 'intention', not in form. You must calm your mind, forget about yourself and the external world, and carefully contemplate to find the 'intention' within..."</p><p></p><p>Since this was all made up anyway, and there were no actual techniques to impart, Li Xuan couldn't very well teach Xu Yan calisthenics - that would be too undignified. </p><p></p><p>So he could only have Xu Yan take the horse stance and sense his own qi and blood. Whether he could sense it or not depended on his innate aptitude.</p><p></p><p>It was not an issue with the cultivation method Li Xuan was imparting.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you can sense the qi and blood depends entirely on your comprehension - if you can grasp the 'intention' within. Once you sense the qi and blood, you can try to mobilize them to refine your entire body, entering the stage of skin refinement..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed Xu Yan in the cultivation seriously.</p><p></p><p>"This is the foundation of the martial dao. The saying goes, 'the teacher opens the door, but cultivation is up to the individual.' You must cultivate diligently, contemplate deeply. Rest when you're tired, balance work and rest, don't be too hasty."</p><p></p><p>"The more impatient you are, the harder it will be to sense the qi and blood. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied, "Yes, Master. I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, continue your cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned and left, happily pocketing Xu Yan's initiation gift.</p><p></p><p>"The nine-leaf primordial herb is a precious medicine. I'll cook some and try it out!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan took out a small knife and carefully sliced off a piece of the nine-leaf primordial herb. He then went to the chicken coop, caught a chicken, and slaughtered it, starting a fire to cook the herb and chicken together.</p><p></p><p>"Since this disciple is cultivating here, it's necessary to provide him meals. He brought such a generous gift, it would be too heartless not to feed him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself. </p><p></p><p>While cooking the meal, he glanced over at Xu Yan, who was still in the horse stance, but now swaying and about to give in.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Xu Yan could no longer hold the stance and had to rest. This was his third time resting.</p><p></p><p>"I can fool him for now, it's not like I'm intentionally deceiving him - he came to me of his own accord."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, not bothering with Xu Yan. For the time being, he wouldn't be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan's arrival had shown Li Xuan a chance to leave the small village safely, perhaps even passing through the Wicked Aura Forest. </p><p></p><p>He had already planned his escape route. Once he left the village, he would head to the State of Wu. Far from the State of Qi and the Eastern River Commandery, even if Xu Yan realized he had been deceived, he would have no way to use his background to target Li Xuan!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan resumed the horse stance, calming his mind to sense his qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood reside within the body, circulating throughout. How to sense and mobilize them? Master said, the key is in 'comprehension' and 'intention', not in form..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued trying to sense his qi and blood, but aside from his aching legs from holding the stance, he couldn't sense anything resembling qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be discouraged, it's only been a short time. Persist, and you will surely gain results!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan encouraged himself inwardly, his gaze resolute as he continued the horse stance, trying to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The chicken soup was ready.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over, seeing Xu Yan still in the stance, and didn't disturb him, eating the soup himself.</p><p></p><p>"The nine-leaf primordial herb, a rare and precious medicine in the world. Eating it prevents a hundred diseases, keeps one from graying or aging... I wonder if that's exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, Li Xuan felt his spirit unusually refreshed and lightened, as if the effects were real.</p><p></p><p>"There's a bit left, I'll give it to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, he approached Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"How's it going?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan broke the stance, somewhat dejected. "Master, I still haven't been able to sense it."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Qi and blood." </p><p></p><p>"It's alright, on the path of martial arts, the key is persistence, the key is resolute will!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanan comforted.</p><p></p><p>He laughed inwardly: "Definitely can't sense the qi and blood, I was just making that up. If you could actually sense the qi and blood, wouldn't that make you a monster?"</p><p></p><p>"You have one more year. Are you hungry now? Go eat."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, hearing this, suddenly felt hunger in his abdomen, and gratefully said, "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"This is chicken soup cooked with nine-leaf ganoderma, drink it, it's not a bad nourishing medicinal diet."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt moved in his heart. The nine-leaf ganoderma was his initiation gift, but the Master had used it to cook soup for him to drink. The Master didn't seem to care about the initiation gift at all. Just as the Master had said, him being able to come here must be predestined!</p><p></p><p>While eating the meal and drinking the chicken soup, Xu Yan asked, "Master, how long does it generally take to sense the qi and blood and complete the introductory cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"This varies from person to person."</p><p></p><p>"Master, for the fastest ones to complete the introduction, how long did it take them?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan rolled his eyes inwardly. According to the cultivation method he had just made up, they would never be able to complete the introduction in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"If I set the introduction standard too low, and he doesn't cultivate anything, won't that raise suspicions? I have to set the standard for geniuses a bit higher."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself, and then said, "In ancient times, geniuses could complete skin refinement in 5 days, bone refinement in 10 days, and organ refinement in 15 days, then proceed to have thunderous sinews and bones, qi and blood like a fierce storm, and successfully complete the introduction."</p><p></p><p>"About a month in total."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes widened, greatly shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Skin refinement in 5 days?</p><p>Introduction in a month?</p><p></p><p>Is this the standard of genius in the Master's eyes?</p><p></p><p>"Can I really complete skin refinement in 5 days? Today I can't even sense the qi and blood, completing skin refinement in 5 days, that's probably impossible. Am I not talented enough?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly felt very anxious.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been observing Xu Yan's expression the whole time. Feeling the anxiety is good, so he continued, "Of course, this is the standard of ancient geniuses, one in ten thousand. You don't need to be in a hurry. As long as you can complete the introduction within a year, you will be qualified in my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"So in the Master's eyes, completing the introduction in a year is only considered qualified!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze became determined as he solemnly said, "Master, don't worry, your disciple will definitely complete the introduction within a year, and will not let down your painstaking efforts!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted his shoulder, with a look of contentment, and said, "Since you have this awareness, it's not in vain that I made an exception to accept you as my disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sense of urgency in his heart became stronger. He quickly finished eating, stood up and said, "Master, I'm going to cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>"I must work hard in cultivation, and absolutely cannot let down the Master's painstaking efforts!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left determinedly, continuing to do the horse stance to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"This foolish boy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and sighed. He didn't want to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he accepted the initiation gift and fabricated the cultivation method to teach Xu Yan, Li Xuan knew he had no way to turn back. He could only continue down this path.</p><p></p><p>It was already dark.</p><p></p><p>Before going to sleep, Li Xuan went out to take a look, and saw Xu Yan still practicing the horse stance, truly diligent.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit reluctant, afraid of tiring him out, he said, "Cultivation requires a balance of work and rest. If you exhaust yourself, it will actually harm your foundation. When it's time to rest, you should rest!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master," Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, closed the door, and went back to his room to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Seeking votes, seeking collection, seeking to be followed ^_^</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

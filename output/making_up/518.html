        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat, realizing he had made a mistake! His senior sister was far from the elegant and quiet appearance she presented on the surface. When it came to brutality, she was no less fierce than him! "Of all people to provoke, why did it have to be senior sister!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping looked at the screaming White-Robed Divine Lord and shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Is this senior sister's unique burial technique?"</p><p></p><p>Watching Su Lingxiu's special burial method, it wasn't simply burying someone in the soil, but continuously scattering their soul and life force into the earth.</p><p></p><p>Once the life force and soul were completely dispersed, only an empty shell would remain, which would quickly decay and eventually turn to dust.</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you to be frivolous and arrogant. Did you really think this young lady had no temper?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued to pound the man while filling in the soil, her technique skilled and extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The White-Robed Divine Lord's screams grew weaker, his skin sagging as he aged rapidly, like a candle flame in the wind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the White-Robed Divine Lord's eyes were filled with despair and fear as he looked up at the young woman filling in the soil above him. She seemed like a demonic witch - where was that pure and flawless aura of natural grace now? He regretted why he had targeted this young woman, but when he first saw her, her peerless beauty and unique temperament had deeply attracted him!</p><p></p><p>Bang! Everything went dark as the soil completely covered his head.</p><p></p><p>His life force was draining away, and his weakened soul was also dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu finished filling in the large pit, jumped up and stomped on the soil a few times, then clapped her hands with an excited expression, as if she had just done something she enjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Putting away the shovel, Su Lingxiu continued on her journey in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Coming!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping hurried to catch up. The soil where the Divine Lord had been buried became rich with vitality. In no time at all, lush green grass sprouted and began to grow rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it transformed into spirit herbs, and continued to evolve.</p><p></p><p>The buried Divine Lord was not only dead, but in a short time, even his bones had become nutrients for these spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Before long, this area would grow many divine herbs, including some that could nourish the soul.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the location Blood Extreme had mentioned, Su Lingxiu looked down and said with a smile: "That Blood Extreme is truly cunning and good at hiding. He stayed right here without leaving, and that Supreme from the Jiang family didn't even discover him."</p><p></p><p>This was where Jiang Feng had confined Blood Extreme's remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Extreme was no longer in his original confined position, he hadn't left. He had hidden beneath the original confinement spot, concealing himself inside a stone.</p><p></p><p>This stone was hidden under thick layers of soil, concealing its unique properties. Even a Supreme would not be able to detect the stone's special nature through the thick soil.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's remnant soul was hiding inside the stone, relying on its special properties to conceal himself. This was why the Supreme from the Jiang family had been unable to find him.</p><p></p><p>However, this couldn't escape Su Lingxiu and Jiang Buping's notice.</p><p></p><p>"To be on the safe side and prevent him from self-destructing, we should use some techniques."</p><p></p><p>Fine green needles appeared in Su Lingxiu's hand. These needles were full of vitality, yet could merge with all things in nature without leaving a trace.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, the fine needles instantly sank into the ground, piercing the soil around the stone. The remnant soul of Blood Extreme inside the stone remained completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, let me directly confine his soul. Once confined by me, he won't be able to self-destruct even if he wants to."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, just watch senior sister's technique!"</p><p></p><p>A jar appeared in Su Lingxiu's hand. She opened the lid and turned the jar upside down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In an instant, the vitality of the fine needles piercing the soil around the stone dissipated. At the same time, the stone had already entered the jar.</p><p></p><p>"This is another application of my Life and Death Reversal Divine Technique. What do you think, junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu tilted her head back, looking quite proud.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, this divine technique is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the stone inside the jar moved, and a thread of blood-colored light cautiously probed out.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Extreme, you've been caught. Just stay put obediently."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Blood light surged out from the stone, revealing Blood Extreme's appearance. Unlike the other part of Blood Extreme's remnant soul, this soul fragment had a faint trace of purple.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was shocked. He had hidden so deeply, yet was still discovered.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to that part of my soul?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme then asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>Although the part of his soul he had sent out was stronger in soul power than this part, the true core was this portion of his soul.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed when that part of his soul was captured, but didn't know what method the other party had used to prevent that soul fragment from self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>Even later on, his connection to that part of his soul seemed to be blocked, as if it had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This had made him feel relieved. Although losing that part of his soul was a heavy loss that damaged his foundation, at least this remnant soul had been preserved.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he was caught completely unaware and now found himself trapped in this jar, with a feeling that he couldn't self-destruct!</p><p></p><p>This greatly alarmed Blood Extreme.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. You'll be able to reunite with that part of your soul soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a giggle.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Blood Extreme in the jar, it was as expected - Blood Extreme's core soul had also undergone transformation from the Primordial Purple Light.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if this part of the soul disappeared, the Blood Extreme in the other jar would be able to sense it and even be affected.</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist. This might be an opportunity for you."</p><p></p><p>Having achieved her goal in coming to the Taikun Realm, Su Lingxiu was eager to return, after all, Blood Demon's soul was still waiting for her.</p><p></p><p>After capturing Blood Extreme's core soul, Su Lingxiu suddenly had an idea of how to trick Blood Demon, and she believed Blood Extreme would be willing to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Qinghua Realm, Su Lingxiu immediately entered a secret chamber and placed the two jars together.</p><p></p><p>"You finally came."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the core soul captured, the other remnant soul became excited.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme, however, felt his heart sink. The part of his soul he had sent out seemed to have developed consciousness beyond his original awareness.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, he had been betrayed by the other part of his soul.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu didn't immediately merge the two Blood Extremes together. Instead, she began to study the core soul of Blood Extreme, especially the part related to the Primordial Purple Light.</p><p></p><p>She even wanted to try if she could extract a trace of the Primordial Purple Light.</p><p></p><p>After several days of research, Su Lingxiu found that she couldn't extract the Primordial Purple Light. Even if she refined this part of Blood Extreme's soul, she couldn't obtain the Primordial Purple Light. However, she could acquire some of its essence, which might be what Jiang Feng needed.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had no intention of refining Blood Extreme's soul. Instead, she used this as a reference to concoct pills with some of the Primordial Purple Light's essence, using the laws and principles of heaven and earth as the main ingredients.</p><p></p><p>After finishing her research, Su Lingxiu hurriedly set off for the Great Wilderness. By this time, Tianzi had already begun to capture Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The incoming soul force.</p><p></p><p>Inside the soul-storing jar, a ball of blood light had already accumulated. This was the soul force of a Realm Lord-level powerhouse, far beyond what Blood Extreme, a mere minor Realm Lord, could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"How is it going?" Su Lingxiu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Almost there. The blood soul is reaching its limit. That Blood Demon fellow should stop transferring soul force over soon," Tianzi replied, also very excited.</p><p></p><p>While Su Lingxiu and Tianzi were figuring out how to trick Blood Demon, the situation outside the realm had already changed. The five Blood Lords of the Netherworld Realm who were in a standoff suddenly retreated, ending the confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu and the other six also withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie, Jiang Feng and the others glanced at Tianshai silently.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai and Mei Wu had secretly negotiated. Everyone understood this, but exactly what agreement Tianshai and Mei Wu had reached was unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, the interests of the Cang Realm cannot be compromised. We will not back down," one of the Realm Lords said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai smiled and said, "Everyone, a crisis is coming. Mei Wu and the others are not weak. Although the Demon Realm is already broken, it still has some fighting power. If necessary, by exhausting the power of the Demon Realm, we may be able to turn the tide of battle."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Tianshai said gravely, "I understand that you all don't want to be subordinate to others, but what's the point if the realm no longer exists? Of the 300 realms in the Dao Domain, I Tianshai occupy several. I'll give up two of my realms to cooperate with the Demon Realm, without harming your interests."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng and the others fell silent. Although Tianshai had given up his own territory to Mei Wu and the others, it still changed the balance of power in the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The condition I reached with them is that at the critical moment, they will instantly activate the power of the Demon Realm to block the enemy."</p><p></p><p>"They've lost their realm and need a place to settle. Is it too much for Tianshai to give up two realms? If you think I, Tianshai, will gain greater support because of this, you can also offer up territory to trade with the Demon Realm lords."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai looked at the Realm Lords and said.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Demon Realm lords have such resolve, it's only right to give them a place to live," Jiang Feng said with a smile, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie also said nothing and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Realm Lords tacitly approved of Tianshai's actions. After all, if Tianshai gained the support of Mei Wu and the other six, becoming too powerful, these Realm Lords could also unite to counter him.</p><p></p><p>All the Realm Lords returned to the Dao Domain.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai smiled and strode towards the distant Demon Realm. Some details still needed to be discussed.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu seemed eager to enter the Cang Realm. Was there someone she hated to the bone in the Cang Realm? "Xiao Yao? You've gained another enemy," Tianshai thought silently.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, since we've reached an agreement, we will definitely support you. Time is of the essence. We want to enter the Cang Realm now," Mei Wu said solemnly as soon as Tianshai arrived at the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Anytime is fine, but I need to change my conditions," Tianshai said gravely, looking at the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You want to go back on your word?" The faces of Mei Wu and the other six darkened.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Tianshai shook his head and said, "My goal, Tianshai's goal, is to become the Lord of the Cang Realm. Even if I can't fully control all the authority of the Cang Realm, I must control at least 70%. Only then will I have more confidence to deal with the coming crisis."</p><p></p><p>Yan Mo frowned and said, "The Cang Realm is special. Are you sure you have the ability to become its Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm 80% confident. Originally, I planned to scheme slowly, but now there's no time. I can only use other methods to control the realm's authority. As long as you're willing to help by distracting some people for me."</p><p></p><p>"Also, the Demon Realm is not to be used to resist external enemies, but to crash into the Cang Realm when necessary!"</p><p></p><p>As he said the last part, Tianshai's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Mei Wu and the other six changed.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, have you gone mad?" Li Mo exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Only by unifying the realms can one control the realm's authority. I, Tianshai, have this ability."</p><p></p><p>Crashing the Demon Realm into the Cang Realm was no small matter. One misstep could even cause damage to the Cang Realm. If that happened, it would be even harder to deal with the coming crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, this is no trivial matter. We need to confirm that you really have this ability before we can help you. And the conditions for helping you also need to be renegotiated," Mei Wu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai raised his palm, revealing a purple orb emanating a unique Dao aura. Inside the orb, light flowed and changed, with Dao patterns surrounding it, as if it were a miniature version of a realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Mei Wu and the others focused their gazes. This purple orb was extraordinary, and seemed to have an unusual connection to the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is my trump card. Do you understand now?" Tianshai said, putting away the orb.</p><p></p><p>"I see. So the backup plan of Senior Cang has fallen into your hands?" Dun Wu said with some envy.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, we'll proceed as you say. But in addition to the minor realms, we also need to establish that the Cang Realm will accommodate our Demon race!" Mei Wu said solemnly. "The Cang Realm must have a place for the Demon race!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai nodded and said, "As the Lord of the realm, I naturally won't reject the Demon race. This is also beneficial for strengthening the realm. I agree!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's do as you say," Mei Wu and the other six nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's start the preparations. Guide the Demon Realm closer to the Cang Realm, and wait for my control," Tianshai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Mei Wu and the others agreed.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai began making arrangements in the Demon Realm, while Mei Wu and the other six started preparing for the transfer to the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Cang Realm, they needed the realm's token to guide them. Otherwise, such a large number of demons would be rejected by the Dao patterns of the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the battle between realms, some changes had been made to the Dao patterns of the Cang Realm to prevent invasion by external enemies.</p><p></p><p>This could not be accomplished overnight.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, where is Xu Yan?" Mei Wu found Tianshai, who was making arrangements, and asked with hidden killing intent on her face.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai raised an eyebrow, "You have a grudge against him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have a deep hatred for him and his master!" Mei Wu said through gritted teeth. At this moment, she showed no trace of her usual seductive demeanor, only a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to seek revenge on Xiao Yao and his disciple, you can wait a bit longer. I also need to have a word with him," Tianshai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao? Xu Yan's master is Xiao Yao?" Mei Wu said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Tianshai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, just you wait!" Mei Wu gritted her teeth. That bastard was quite capable. The sword that had invaded her body still hadn't been expelled, but it also hadn't shown any activity. It seemed to have lost its effect, or perhaps she had suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My good disciple, Xu Yan has broken through."</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the small accomplishment of the Heaven and Earth realm, and you have reached the great accomplishment of the Establishing the Way realm!"</p><p></p><p>My strength has increased again.</p><p></p><p>Great accomplishment of the Establishing the Way realm.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, the Not Transforming Divine Palace should no longer be a threat to me, but if I were to fight, I wouldn't be able to maintain the invincibility and power of a Dao Ancestor. I can't just kill with one slap."</p><p></p><p>To maintain the image and invincibility of a Dao Ancestor, I must break through to the Creation realm to truly have confidence.</p><p></p><p>For a mighty invincible Dao Ancestor to battle an enemy for dozens of rounds would ruin his image. It must be that no matter how strong the enemy is, when they come before this Dao Ancestor, they are killed with just one slap.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can the supreme and invincible image of the Dao Ancestor be secured.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite lively."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched as Tian Sha, Mei Wu and others descended upon the Divine Realm, and couldn't help but sigh that Old Man Xiao was indeed worthy of being the leader of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang, able to attract the attention of so many powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>"Di Ying has reached the Nine Mountains Realm and is lying low. Is he waiting for an opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Nine Mountains Realm. Even Red Cat hadn't detected Di Ying's presence, but Di Ying also showed no intention of making a move. As expected of one skilled in sneak attacks and assassinations, he absolutely would not do anything that could potentially reveal his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could exterminate an ant with just a breath, he wouldn't blow that breath. He was cautious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"He is a qualified assassin!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expressed his approval.</p><p></p><p>A beam of white light flew down from the sky, heading straight for the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, Wu Tiannan finally broke through to the Divine Venerable realm, becoming a Divine Venerable martial artist.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Divine Venerable realm, his cultivation speed slowed down, and he would not be able to break through to the Supreme realm in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"The fortune of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Tai Cang valued and favored this disciple Yu Yao quite a bit, actually giving her such a treasure, a treasure of heaven and earth's fortune.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, Tian Zi looked up towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>He muttered: "That little girl Yu Yao, I knew Tai Cang would give her that thing. Hehe, if Tai Miao knew, she'd be heartbroken again, wouldn't she?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Tai Miao's heartbroken appearance, Tian Zi couldn't help but gloat.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao, who was in seclusion, suddenly frowned, withdrew the Heavenly Dao energy, and walked out. As his aura surged, a graceful figure swiftly approached.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, Tian Sha, Ao Lie and the others are coming to seek revenge on you. What exactly did you do to make them so angry? You should quickly hide in the outer realm for now."</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao sighed as soon as she saw Old Man Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was confused, "What do you mean? I, Old Xiao, have long since stopped managing affairs and have been wandering around. When did I make enemies with them?" </p><p></p><p>Then he angrily said: "What? Do they think they can bully me because I haven't made a move in a long time? Fine, fine, fine, I want to see just how capable this Tian Sha is!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he frowned again and said: "Why do you look so seriously injured?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao frowned and sighed: "I was careless and suffered a sneak attack. I've been recovering until now but haven't fully healed yet!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao pondered thoughtfully. He recalled what Wu Tiannan had said about Yu Yao fleeing to the inner realm and coincidentally meeting Wu Tiannan, thus leading Wu Tiannan onto the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Who made the move?"</p><p></p><p>"Di Ying, but the mastermind may be Tian Sha. Perhaps Tian Sha found out about the treasure Master gave me and wants to seize it."</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Then she said seriously: "Xiao Yao, this matter is no small affair. Besides Tian Sha, Ao Lie, Mei Wu from the Demon Magic Heaven and Earth, and others are also involved. How can you alone fight against them?</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you return to the Dao Realm before they arrive and find Senior Tai Miao and the others? Only then can we suppress Tian Sha and his group."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao frowned, "I can understand Tian Sha targeting me, but what's the deal with Ao Lie and Mei Wu? Especially Ao Lie, I don't recall having any grudges with him, and we even had some friendly relations in the past."</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao frowned and said: "You really don't know? Your disciple Xu Yan subdued a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's mouth twitched. What a misunderstanding this was. How the hell am I qualified to be Xu Yan's master?</p><p></p><p>"Then there's no need to pay attention to them. They're just a bunch of clowns, and they've already arrived in the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao became calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>He even looked forward to Tian Sha and the others being killed with one slap!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe Realm, a powerful aura emerged, and the majesty of the Realm Lord spread. Even across the vast distance, the Realm Lord's might still transmitted over.</p><p></p><p>This was intimidation, giving Old Man Xiao a warning.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, will you come meet me?"</p><p></p><p>The voice transmitted through the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao directly ignored it and looked at Yu Yao, saying: "Your injuries haven't healed..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Qinghua Sect was alerted, and those in cultivation walked out, including Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had just come out of his closed-door cultivation when he saw that graceful figure he had been thinking of day and night. He thought he was hallucinating and unconsciously rubbed his eyes, then his eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>"Sister!"</p><p></p><p>He directly pounced over and hugged Yu Yao.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's mouth twitched. He couldn't bear to watch. Wu Tiannan, a grown man, was acting like a child right now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how long had Yu Yao lived?</p><p></p><p>And how old was Wu Tiannan?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Old Man Xiao's gaze became a bit strange. He never thought Yu Yao would be this kind of person!</p><p></p><p>"Tiannan!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao also looked surprised, then her eyes showed a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>"You've finally grown to this stage!"</p><p></p><p>Her tone was gentle and gratified.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was so excited he forgot himself. Holding Yu Yao's hand, he chattered on and on, recounting his experiences over the years and his feelings of longing.</p><p></p><p>"What a sour smell!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. He looked at Wu Tiannan, then at Yu Yao. "An older woman is worth gold bricks. How much older is this Yu Yao than Wu Tiannan?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how much older she was than Wu Tiannan, but Wu Tiannan had embarked on the path of martial arts because of her, and now he was already a Divine Venerable realm martial artist!</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, leader of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang, since when have you become so timid?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha's voice transmitted over.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao continued to ignore it, but this voice finally interrupted Wu Tiannan's chatter. Now he realized that his sister's injuries hadn't healed! Wu Tiannan couldn't sit still anymore. Seeing Su Lingxiu, he hurriedly pleaded: "Miss Lingxiu, Tiannan requests that you treat my sister's injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Academy Head Wu, you're too kind!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked excited. The pills she had just refined could finally be put to use. She could test their effectiveness on this Realm Lord level powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Yao realized that the people in this courtyard seemed a bit unusual, especially Xiao Yao's attitude. Something seemed off.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha, Mei Wu, Ao Lie and other powerful figures gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go over directly. That bastard Xiao Yao has definitely gone into hiding!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tao Realm Lord was eager to avenge his son and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"After all, he's the leader of the Seven Heroes of Taicang. We should be polite first before resorting to force. If he doesn't come, it will be good to suppress his momentum a bit," Tianshe said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Three times is the limit. If he doesn't come after we call once more, let's go over there ourselves. We'll see if this Xiaoyao really dares to face us," said Meiwu impatiently. She couldn't wait to tear Xiaoyao to pieces, though of course the prerequisite was to force him to remove the sword from her body first.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Tianshe, she urged, "Call him for the third time now!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Tianshe nodded and sent his voice echoing through the laws of heaven and earth: "Xiaoyao..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish speaking, Meiwu suddenly erupted with a boom, her aura exploding with murderous intent as pink light illuminated the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>Startled by this sudden change, Tianshe instinctively prepared to defend himself, afraid Meiwu might suddenly attack him.</p><p></p><p>"Who? Who dug up my jade bamboo? They must die!" Meiwu's face was now twisted with rage, her killing intent surging to the heavens. </p><p></p><p>Her form flickered and she transformed into a streak of pink light, shooting straight towards the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tianshe and the others were stunned. What had happened? Yanmo, Liwu, and Jumo were also dumbfounded before suddenly realizing something. Their expressions changed - had Meiwu's treasure been stolen?</p><p></p><p>Who would be so bold? That was Meiwu's most prized possession. Anyone who dared to touch it would face her relentless pursuit and killing intent, a fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>Tianshe frowned and looked questioningly at Yanmo, but before he could get an answer, his expression suddenly changed as he stared sharply towards the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tianshe Realm had been robbed!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you little brat! I will fight you to the death!" Meiwu's voice, filled with murderous rage, faintly echoed over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan!!!</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts were stunned. How was it Xu Yan again? What exactly had he done? Could it be that Meiwu's seduction had failed and she had actually been taken advantage of? The group of experts all looked at each other in bewilderment. Only Tianshe's face was extremely gloomy as he said coldly, "Good, very good. Lord Xiaoyao of the Xiaoyao Realm, I didn't expect you to be so shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is in the Dao Realm? Perfect, let's capture him and see what that bastard Xiaoyao can do!" Ao Lie's eyes lit up when he heard this, and he immediately turned to head towards the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The other realm lords hesitated briefly before also turning back towards the Dao Realm. They were intensely curious about Xu Yan - where did he get the courage to directly offend a realm lord?</p><p></p><p>He actually stole Meiwu's greatest treasure? The Wu Realm had Supreme Realm experts guarding it, and not just a few. Since Xu Yan could steal Meiwu's treasure, could their own treasures also be stolen? Thinking of this, one after another became restless.</p><p></p><p>Yanmo, Liwu, and Jumo's expressions also changed drastically as they hurriedly returned to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao, very good, very good!" Tianshe said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, guard this place. Do not let anyone come out of the Shadow Realm!" Tianshe commanded sternly.</p><p></p><p>The group of Supreme Realm experts all felt a chill in their hearts and respectfully replied, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme experts who had accompanied the realm lords all gathered to seal off the entrance to the Shadow Realm leading to the Taihe Realm. Ao Ming led the Four Divine Beasts among them.</p><p></p><p>The group of realm lords who had just descended to the God Realm were now hurriedly rushing back to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What did Big Senior Brother do?" Meng Chong asked in confusion, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu's rage-filled voice, transmitted through the laws of heaven and earth, echoed throughout the entire God Realm. The name Xu Yan once again shocked many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu is still more capable of making a name for himself!" Xie Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to the Qinghua Realm for a long time now, and was not far from breaking through to the Void Realm. But Xu Yan had already started offending Supreme Realm experts. </p><p></p><p>The gap between them had not narrowed, but was actually growing larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter," Li Xuan said with a light smile. Xu Yan had merely moved some of Meiwu's treasures, that's all. A trivial thing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao looked at Old Man Xiao, then at Meng Chong and the others, her face full of confusion. For some reason, her intuition told her that everything here was not planned by Xiaoyao. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan may not actually be his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan asked the young girl before him to treat his injuries. Yu Yao didn't think much of it at first, after all her injuries were no ordinary ones. When she had fled into the Inner Realm before, she had been so weak that she could barely resist even Inner Realm Grandmasters, relying on Wu Tiannan to avoid being hunted down by them.</p><p></p><p>Even after such a long period of recuperation, she still hadn't fully recovered, and it was uncertain if she could ever fully recover.</p><p></p><p>However, this was Wu Tiannan's goodwill after all, so she didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>"You've been injured to your essence, and have also suffered backlash from the power of the Dao. Your foundation is shattered. The fact that you've recovered to this extent is thanks to the treasures on your body, as well as being nourished by the power of a realm..." Su Lingxiu said after examining Yu Yao's injuries.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao was very surprised to hear this. Su Lingxiu could judge her injuries so accurately, which showed she was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't realize your injuries were so severe. Why didn't you come to me back then?" Old Man Xiao asked, looking surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Why trouble you with such matters?" Yu Yao sighed. Of the Seven Heroes of Taicang, only she and Xiaoyao remained now, and their teacher had also perished.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao sighed, his expression complex and somewhat sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>When Wu Tiannan heard this, he became very anxious. "Miss Lingxiu, is there any way to treat this?"</p><p></p><p>If not, he would have no choice but to ask the Ancestor of the Dao for help.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be a big problem. I've just refined a pill that might be able to cure it," Su Lingxiu said as she took out a light purple pill.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Yao and Old Man Xiao saw it, they were shocked. This pill clearly wasn't simple, seeming to contain some sort of mystical essence.</p><p></p><p>"Take it and see what effect it has," Su Lingxiu said, handing the pill to Yu Yao.</p><p></p><p>"This is too precious," Yu Yao said, her expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this is only the first stage refined pill. There may be room for improvement later. You can consider yourself an experimental subject. Go ahead and take it," Su Lingxiu said, her eyes flashing with a hint of cunning. "If you feel bad about it, you can give me some compensation. I don't need treasures, but I am interested in small world masters and would like to study one."</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao didn't think much of it and immediately agreed, "Alright, that's fine!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan opened his mouth, couldn't help but scratch his head, and said, "Miss Lingxiu, you must be careful." He knew that Su Lingxiu's research tended to be rather unusual.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu giggled, "Dean Wu, you can rest assured, nothing will happen."</p><p></p><p>After taking the pill, Yu Yao's face showed shock. Her injuries were recovering, and although they couldn't be fully healed immediately, the miraculous nature of this pill was evident. It could even treat injuries to the essence of a small world master like herself, showing just how precious it truly was. It was definitely a supreme treasure!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meiwu's nearly insane voice faintly echoed through the laws of heaven and earth: "Xu Yan, where are you running to? I'm going to cut you into a thousand pieces!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

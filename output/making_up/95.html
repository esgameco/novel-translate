        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 95 Shenlie Duxu, the Art of Forging Blades (Seeking Monthly Votes)</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had another epiphany, fusing the art of Yifen Huanwei (Shifting and Transforming) with the Qinghong Body Technique, and he had cultivated a new body technique.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was gazing into the distance when suddenly, a figure appeared beside him!</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, what body technique is this?" Meng Chong was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>It was too fast, silent and untraceable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "Junior Brother, I call this body technique 'Heavenly Thunder Flash', just like a flash of heavenly thunder, leaving no trace, impossible to capture."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Thunder Flash?!" Meng Chong murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Heavenly Thunder Flash!" Xu Yan's figure disappeared in an instant, vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were standing so close, Meng Chong didn't detect any signs from Xu Yan before he unleashed the Heavenly Thunder Flash. It was as if he had disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"This body technique is too powerful!" Meng Chong exclaimed in admiration. His elder brother's comprehension was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure reappeared, and he asked, "Junior Brother, shall I teach you the Heavenly Thunder Flash?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Meng Chong shook his head and said, "Elder Brother, I cultivate the Martial Dao of the Flesh Body, and although the Heavenly Thunder Flash is swift, I don't think it suits me."</p><p></p><p>He scratched his bald head and chuckled sheepishly, "I prefer a powerful body technique, fast and fierce, but I won't be able to achieve what you have with the Heavenly Thunder Flash."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood. As their master had said, everyone's comprehension is different, and the best is the one that suits oneself.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Junior Brother, you can also try to comprehend a body technique of your own."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood on the Zhen Trigram and said, "Junior Brother, if you want a powerful, fast and fierce body technique, you should continue to ponder on the Thunder and Lightning."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt that it made sense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan habitually took out the ancient leather book and read it every day, hoping that one day he might suddenly have an epiphany, just like Xu Yan, who would suddenly comprehend something on his own.</p><p></p><p>A golden light suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He was delighted, as the golden finger feedback indicated that either Meng Chong had broken through to the peak of the Blood Qi Realm, or Xu Yan had broken through to the initial stage of the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended a new body technique called Heavenly Thunder Flash from the Bagua you compiled, and he has mastered it completely!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Thunder Flash!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had grasped the Heavenly Thunder Flash body technique, as if it had been innate to him.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful body technique!" Li Xuan exclaimed in awe. With this technique, he could not only escape but also defeat his opponents.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly disappeared from the chair. The struggling Shi Er beside him remained unaware.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's figure appeared, looking at his two disciples below, as Xu Yan was guiding Meng Chong on how to comprehend his own body technique. Meng Chong seemed to have some insights.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instantly returned to the chair. From the time he left to the time he came back, Shi Er remained oblivious.</p><p></p><p>"My second disciple is also about to have an epiphany. I wonder what powerful body technique he will comprehend next!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited and anticipating it.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is truly the senior disciple, the pioneer of my Martial Dao. In the future, I can have him guide and help improve the comprehension abilities of the disciples I take in."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, acknowledging that in terms of comprehension and imagination, Xu Yan was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yunshan County, a figure shimmering with jade-like golden light, exuding an imposing aura, thundered through the mountains and forests in a flash of golden light, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not broken through to the Xiantian Realm yet, and although he had comprehended a body technique, he could not soar into the sky and vanish in a moment like Xu Yan's Heavenly Thunder Flash.</p><p></p><p>However, the speed at which he was dashing was still incredibly fast. He was like a thunderbolt sweeping across the ground, with an overwhelming might.</p><p></p><p>"I've comprehended it!" Meng Chong's mind was filled with the insights of his body technique.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through to the Xiantian Realm, he would be able to truly unleash this technique, thundering across the sky with unparalleled ferocity.</p><p></p><p>While slightly slower than the Heavenly Thunder Flash, this technique perfectly suited Meng Chong's style, being powerful, fierce and domineering.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure paused and returned to the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, I've already decided on the name for my body technique - 'Furious Thunder Crossing the Void', like a furious thunderbolt crossing the sky!"</p><p></p><p>Furious Thunder Crossing the Void!</p><p></p><p>"Our realms are still low, and our comprehension of the Bagua is also about the same. We can no longer progress further. Now, we must focus on cultivating and advancing our realms!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I must break through to the Xiantian Realm as soon as possible," Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through to the Xiantian Realm could he fully unleash the might of his Furious Thunder Crossing the Void technique!</p><p></p><p>He was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was reading the ancient leather book when a golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed, knowing that this must be Meng Chong comprehending a new body technique.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the body technique Furious Thunder Crossing the Void from the Bagua you compiled, and he has mastered it completely!"</p><p></p><p>Furious Thunder Crossing the Void!</p><p></p><p>"This technique suits Meng Chong perfectly. He is a bold and straightforward disciple, like a golden-armored Arhat. This body technique has a domineering aura that matches him well!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Furious Thunder Crossing the Void, true to its name, may not be as swift and untraceable as Heavenly Thunder Flash, but it is still incredibly fast, like a furious thunderbolt crossing the sky, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Thunder Flash + Furious Thunder Crossing the Void, you have obtained the Divine Thunder Crossing the Void!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"I finally have a Martial Dao that belongs to my master alone!"</p><p></p><p>It was not easy!</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Crossing the Void is an incredibly powerful Martial Dao technique.</p><p></p><p>It is like a divine thunderbolt that can traverse the void and the nothingness, crossing through space.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it can traverse the void.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is an extremely high-level attainment that can only be achieved at the pinnacle of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With Li Xuan's current strength, he was naturally far from being able to traverse the void and cross through space.</p><p></p><p>However, when unleashed, it would be even swifter than Xu Yan's Heavenly Thunder Flash, and more domineering than Meng Chong's Furious Thunder Crossing the Void, possessing the might of divine thunder.</p><p></p><p>"What excellent disciples I have! I am invincible, all thanks to you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>In his joyous mood, he raised his hand and sent a true qi that transformed into a small thunderbolt, throwing it into Shi Er's body to accelerate the refinement of his dantian.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this would have the effect of pulling up the seedling, it was not a problem at all, as Shi Er's talent was just like that, and there was no issue of affecting his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er suddenly felt as if his dantian was surrounded by threads of thunder and lightning, and while it was painful, the speed of his dantian refinement increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to complete the dantian refinement. I can enter the Martial Dao within a month!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Qi Realm seemed to be not far away!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instantly disappeared from the chair, his figure like a divine thunderbolt, appearing before Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were startled. When had their master arrived?</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had briefly sensed an aura of divine might.</p><p></p><p>"With your current realms, your comprehension of the Bagua is also about the same. Do not be too obsessed with it. Just follow your heart, and as your realms improve and your vision expands, new insights will naturally arise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan swept his gaze and noticed that the Bagua diagram had been erased.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Xu Yan and Meng Chong's Bagua comprehension had reached a certain point.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke in a stern teacher's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, when I sparred with Hu Shan, I found that my swordsmanship seemed to rely more on brute force rather than showcasing my true abilities, so I would like to learn the Dao of the Blade."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already prepared for this, intending to find an appropriate time to teach Meng Chong the Dao of the Blade that he had carefully devised.</p><p></p><p>So he asked, "What do you think the Dao of the Blade entails?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong paused, then fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao that the master teaches is the Dao, not just techniques. So the Dao of the Blade that he teaches me must be..." Meng Chong drew the large cleaver he carried, "Is the Dao of the Blade about killing the enemy, about ferocity, about savagery?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood with his hands clasped behind his back, exuding the aura of a revered master. "My disciple, what you have described is merely the brutality of the blade, not the Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the Blade is not confined to ferocity or savagery.</p><p></p><p>"The blade can part the heavens and earth, can sever the cosmos. With me, none can defeat me!</p><p></p><p>"Standing in the heavens and earth, I alone rule the world. Even faced with a myriad of enemies, I shall advance unhindered!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart surged with excitement, his face flushing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Parting the heavens and earth, severing the cosmos, with me none can defeat me?" </p><p></p><p>He murmured these words, and the more he did, the more majestic it sounded. This must be the true Dao of the Blade, its immense power.</p><p></p><p>"Please, master, teach me!" Meng Chong said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao can only be comprehended, not taught. I will open the door for you, but whether you can understand and enter is up to you alone."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at him with profound eyes.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath and respectfully said, "I understand, I will not disappoint you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!" Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"To enter the Dao of the Blade, there is a foundation, just as with the Dao of the Sword, only those with a clear sword heart can truly enter the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"And to enter the Dao of the Blade, one must awaken the Blade Soul!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly at the end.</p><p></p><p>Awaken the Blade Soul?!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was taken aback. He had thought that to enter the Dao of the Blade, one needed a clear blade heart, corresponding to the clear sword heart.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out to be about awakening the Blade Soul?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan beside him was also surprised.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of his disciples, Li Xuan knew they had thought the Dao of the Blade required a clear blade heart, just as the Dao of the Sword required a clear sword heart.</p><p></p><p>He chuckled inwardly, "The cultivation method I've devised is not so easily guessed."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is the Blade Soul?" Meng Chong asked, somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>If entering the Dao of the Blade required a clear blade heart, he could perhaps emulate his senior brother's approach and maybe achieve it.</p><p></p><p>But this awakening of the Blade Soul was completely unfamiliar to him.</p><p></p><p>What is the Blade Soul?</p><p></p><p>"The Blade Soul, simply put, is to imbue the blade with a soul."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in a deep voice, "This is a state of mind where the blade is like my own body. Though the blade is sharp, it will not harm me.</p><p></p><p>"All the blades in the world will sing for me, all will submit to me...</p><p></p><p>"It is similar yet different from the clear sword heart."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into contemplation. It sounded so profound. He looked at the blade in his hand, a fine weapon, yet he did not feel it was "like my own body".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "The awakening of the Blade Soul is the foundation of the Dao of the Blade. Whether it is a large blade, a small blade, a long blade, or a short blade, you can wield them at will, and dominate the world."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was stunned. He liked using the large cleaver, its imposing and powerful aura. But how could he display the dominating might of the world with a short blade?</p><p></p><p>Is this the difference between blade techniques and the Dao of the Blade?</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he seemed to glimpse that dominating might of the world, a single slash that could shatter the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>His heart surged with excitement, his eyes filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"I must awaken the Blade Soul, I must enter the Dao of the Blade!" </p><p></p><p>His breathing quickened, "Master, how do I awaken the Blade Soul?"</p><p></p><p>"To awaken the Blade Soul, aside from self-realization and the profound search for your own Blade Soul, there is another method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already prepared how to awaken the Blade Soul.</p><p></p><p>Whether Meng Chong could succeed or not, that would depend entirely on him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is the method?" Meng Chong asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being completely clueless and trying to comprehend the profound on his own, it would be better to grasp the method.</p><p></p><p>"The method is to cultivate the Blade!" Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was taken aback, "Cultivate the Blade? How?"</p><p></p><p>There were talks of cultivating blades in the jianghu, but that was just about maintaining treasured blades. The cultivation of the Blade that the master spoke of was clearly not that simple!</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate it with your body, your heart, your intent, your very self..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly, "The blade never leaves your side, cultivate it with your body, your heart, your intent - the blade is me, and I am the blade.</p><p></p><p>"Nurture its qi and blood, nurture its mood, nurture its comprehension...</p><p></p><p>"Until one day, when you feel a connection between your heart and the blade, when your heart and the blade are as one, when my heart is the blade's heart, my soul is the Blade Soul -</p><p></p><p>"That will be the moment you draw your blade, and the Blade Soul awakens!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was deeply shaken. Cultivating the Blade could be so profound?</p><p></p><p>"The blade and I in harmony, my heart and the blade as one, my heart is the blade's heart, my soul is the Blade Soul..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong murmured to himself. </p><p></p><p>The more he repeated it, the more he was amazed. The Dao of the Blade is truly powerful and profound.</p><p></p><p>Just the awakening of the Blade Soul is so unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>As he repeated it, his heart grew more and more excited, his blood seeming to boil.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely cultivate the Blade and awaken the Blade Soul!" </p><p></p><p>He said with unwavering determination.</p><p></p><p>"Then begin the cultivation of the Blade from today."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, sheathing the large blade at his waist, gripping the hilt with one hand.</p><p></p><p>But how exactly does one cultivate the Blade? </p><p></p><p>He felt a bit lost, and could only look to his master for guidance.</p><p></p><p>"First, nurture the Blade with your qi and blood. Imbue the treasured blade with your vital energy, cultivate it with your body, your heart, your intent - this all depends on you.</p><p></p><p>Nurturing the qi and blood is easier, but the heart and intent are entirely up to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath. </p><p></p><p>He channeled his qi and blood into the treasured blade, carefully nurturing it, and tried to find a way to cultivate it with his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke again, "Do not forget your cultivation. Cultivating the Blade must not interfere with your cultivation, for that is the true path. </p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, even if you succeed in cultivating the Blade, if you have neglected your own cultivation, it will all be for naught.</p><p></p><p>"The Blade cultivated thus will only be temporary."</p><p></p><p>He must prevent Meng Chong from getting obsessed with just cultivating the Blade and neglecting his own cultivation. That would be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p></p><p>Awakening the Blade Soul is secondary, cultivation is the primary goal.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Blade is a long process, entirely dependent on your heart. If your cultivation realm is not sufficient, then cultivate until you reach the Xiantian realm. Persevere, and you will reap the rewards. But if you neglect your cultivation, it will all be for nothing."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice boomed like thunder, making Meng Chong's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly snapped back to his senses, his forehead beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, Master has enlightened me. Otherwise, I would have become obsessed with it and neglected my own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>He respectfully said, "Thank you, Master, for your guidance. I will definitely not neglect my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, focus on your cultivation and raising your realm, that is the most important thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With that, his figure vanished from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan, who was also at the Xiantian realm, could not detect the slightest trace of him.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

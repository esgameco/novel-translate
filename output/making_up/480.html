        <h1>Chapter 480</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The old man Xiao took a deep breath and said.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who exactly was so shameless as to boastfully utter a name that even the Taicang world could not bear!</p><p></p><p>"My master is probably still in the Qinghua Realm," Xu Yan said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This old man was extremely powerful, and his appearance here might be related to Ao Yuxue being ambushed. With the current turmoil in the divine realm and great changes in the world, the mastermind behind it all could possibly be this person.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan was not afraid of this. No matter how strong this person was, he would be like an ant compared to his master.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm, eh? This old man will remember that," Old Man Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall that Wu Tiannan had mentioned the Qinghua Realm before. Could they be referring to the same person? Could it even be that the same person was behind both Meng Chong and Jiang Buping, those two prodigies? Thinking of this, Old Man Xiao was startled.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party seemed to be boasting, to have nurtured such prodigies, their strength must be incredibly formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Is the turmoil in the divine realm and the collapse of the realms related to you?" Xu Yan asked solemnly after some thought.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao smiled and said, "If this old man says it's related to me, what will you do? And if I say it's not related to me, what then?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said seriously, "As far as I know, all of this is being plotted by Tianshadiying. If it's related to you, then you must be one of Tianshadiying's people.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have a grudge against Tianshadiying. If you're one of their people, then naturally there's a personal feud between us!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was stunned for a moment, then laughed out loud, "Aren't you afraid this old man will kill you right here?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you try, you won't be able to kill me," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was taken aback. Xu Yan's expression didn't seem to be lying, but rather very confident. He couldn't help but think of Xu Yan's mysterious master.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. I'm becoming more and more curious about your master!" </p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, he smiled and said, "Young man, you're too conspicuous. You've defeated Ao Yuxue, and her status in the True Dragon clan is not simple. Your troubles won't be small.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the True Dragon clan, that bastard Tiansha is very shameless. Be careful he doesn't personally come after you for the Dragon Subduing technique.</p><p></p><p>"In short, you'll be targeted by many powerful experts. Although the Dao Realm doesn't have 300 realm lords, there are many supreme martial artists, and the forces in each realm are even more complex.</p><p></p><p>"Beings that used to exist outside this world now reside here. By subduing a dragon, you've offended not just the True Dragon clan, but all true spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Even people from the Netherworld and Demon-Witches will have their eyes on you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was unconcerned and said, "They are merely stepping stones. Those who oppose me, Xu Yan, and try to covet what's mine should be prepared to be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Dragon Subduing technique, who can just casually cultivate it? And bullying the weak with strength is not an issue - no one is greater than my master!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao felt he couldn't continue the conversation.</p><p></p><p>This was too arrogant, too confident, especially the confidence in his master. He completely disregarded all the powerful experts in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you still have time to strengthen yourself, but not much. With the collapse of the Dao Realm Stairway, the Shadow Realm is being pulled down and will fall into the Divine Realm, becoming the place where the Dao Realm and Divine Realm merge.</p><p></p><p>"Once the fall is complete and the world's Dao rules stabilize, people from the Dao Realm will descend to the Divine Realm - those at the Heaven Fusion Realm, God Venerable Realm, and even Supreme Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, powerful experts from the True Dragon clan will definitely descend," Old Man Xiao warned after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "That's good then. I can also go adventuring in the Dao Realm. The Divine Realm is boring now, the Immortal Heavenly Venerables are too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Xu Yan sighed and looked up at the group of Immortal Heavenly Venerables, saying disinterestedly, "They're so weak, it's not even fun to kill them!"</p><p></p><p>Damn! Old Man Xiao could hardly stand it anymore.</p><p></p><p>This young man's arrogance knew no bounds!</p><p></p><p>"How much do you know about the powerful experts outside this world?" Xu Yan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I know a bit," Old Man Xiao replied, puzzled. Why was Xu Yan asking about experts from outside the world? Could his master be from outside? </p><p></p><p>No! That's impossible. How could experts from outside easily enter? Besides, if such a powerful person wanted to enter, he would have sensed it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Since the great battle back then, the Dao rules of the Taicang world had been adjusted. Outsiders could no longer enter the world undetected.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful one was, the harder it was to hide.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about Meiwu?" Xu Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Xiao's expression changed slightly. He looked at Xu Yan in surprise and said, "Young man, you haven't been bewitched by that seductive woman, have you? Listen to this old man's advice - that woman is all looks and no substance. Once you fall for her, the consequences will be unthinkable!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very surprised. This old man was so wary of Meiwu? "You're overthinking it. How could Meiwu's mere seduction techniques affect me? It's just that she hates me to death now. If we meet in the future, she'll definitely want revenge, so I wanted to learn more about her in advance."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was stunned. Meiwu hated Xu Yan to death? "How did you offend her?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled, "It's nothing much. I just tricked her a few times. Actually, Meiwu is quite nice. She gave me the Seven Wonders Divine Flower and a jade bamboo."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out the jade bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was a bit confused. For a moment, he couldn't tell if Meiwu and Xu Yan were enemies or lovers.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Green Spirit Jade Bamboo. Although it's a young shoot, it's incredibly precious. Meiwu was willing to give you one?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled, "That's why I said Meiwu is actually quite nice."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao clicked his tongue, but still warned, "Try not to provoke Meiwu. That woman is not easy to deal with. The fact that she survived that incident back then shows how powerful she is.</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu is one of the strongest in the Demon-Witch world, with the power to devour souls. She's very troublesome. Even if I encountered her, I would have to be very careful..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Old Man Xiao suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Meiwu had been inexplicably enraged, completely different from her usual seductive demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had attempted to break into the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"Could Meiwu's rage be related to this kid?" Old Man Xiao wondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, no threat at all," Xu Yan said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was speechless, becoming increasingly curious about Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I'll be going back to see my master. If you're not in a hurry, you can come with me," Xu Yan said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Old Man Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Xu Yan look towards where the Taimo Sect was, at those two familiar graceful figures.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>In one step, he appeared before the two women.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!" Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were excited, their faces flushing red, almost unable to resist throwing themselves into Xu Yan's arms.</p><p></p><p>The Taimo Sect Master and others were stunned, looking at Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, then at Xin Mengrou. Since Xu Yan was acquainted with these two women, he was obviously familiar with Xin Mengrou as well.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xin, long time no see!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Xin Mengrou with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She had actually already broken through to the Immortal realm. The speed was beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Among those who had entered the Divine Realm together initially, many had not yet broken through to the Refining Truth realm, let alone the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>So far, among the people from the Spirit Realm, only three had broken through to the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Cai Linger, and Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger possessed the bloodline of the Sea Spirit Emperor, which had already been activated. Plus, she was following her master. Breaking through to the Immortal realm so quickly was understandable for her.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan also seemed to have something special about him.</p><p></p><p>As for Xin Mengrou, it was unexpected. It seems she must have had some fortuitous encounters to break through so rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming and Yue'er were also very close to the Immortal realm. They would likely break through soon.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu is too kind," Xin Mengrou sighed and said, "From the Spirit Realm to the Divine Realm, Young Master Xu has been unstoppable as always!"</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, Xu Yan's rise to power had been unimaginably fast. From becoming famous throughout the Spirit Realm to being unrivaled in the Spirit Realm, it took only a short time for him to suppress all the powerful experts there.</p><p></p><p>After coming to the Divine Realm, it was the same. From becoming renowned in the Divine Realm to subduing true dragons, it also took only a short time. For martial artists, this amount of time was not even enough to break through a minor realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was already unrivaled in the Divine Realm! Truly a prodigy worthy of being that senior's true disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xin overpraises me. The path of martial arts is long, and I am still far from being invincible," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Among those who came from the Spirit Realm, you and Principal Wu have the strongest abilities, breaking through to the Immortal realm so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's expression became surprised when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu broke through to the Immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>She was able to break through to the Immortal realm so quickly not only because of her talent in the Dream Path, but also due to guidance from Ancestor Tai Miao. She had obtained great opportunities, which allowed her to break through so rapidly.</p><p></p><p>And all of this was thanks to the senior's guidance back then, which allowed her to take that unusual half step on the Dream Path.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Principal Wu broke through to the Immortal realm some time ago," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao secretly glanced at Xin Mengrou. Why was Great-grandmother (Ancestral Master) being so talkative? They hadn't even had a chance to catch up with Young Master Xu yet!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you young people chat. These two little girls have been talking about you every day!" Xin Mengrou said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Xu, for coming to our rescue!" The Tai Miao Sect Master seized the opportunity to speak, with a grateful expression.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the place for catching up. Young Master Xu, if you don't mind, how about we move to the Tai Miao Sect?" The Tai Miao Sect Master continued, while secretly giving Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao meaningful looks.</p><p></p><p>"That would be fine," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother has subdued the dragon and is now in the Tai Miao Realm. Let's go to the Tai Miao Realm!" Meng Chong and Jiang Buping said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, will you join us?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Wu Tiannan thought for a moment. The Divine Realm was currently unstable, and his sister still had no trace. They couldn't go to the Dao Realm for now, so they might as well go to the Tai Miao Realm together.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother sent a message saying that Senior Xin Mengrou has also broken through to the Immortal realm," Meng Chong said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Mengrou, that girl, has broken through?" Wu Tiannan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's talent was certainly not weak, and the Tai Miao Dream Path she cultivated was extremely special. But it shouldn't have been possible for her to break through to the Immortal realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>It seems she must have obtained some opportunities in the Tai Miao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the other two set off for the Tai Miao Realm, while many Immortal Heavenly Venerable experts of the Divine Realm were now rushing towards the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Divine Realm originated from the Taihe Realm, caused by the collapse of the Dao Realm's Heavenly Stairway.</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Realm was constantly in turmoil, and the powerful experts of the Taihe Sect were now at a loss. The Taihe Sect Master and several elders had already perished in the collapse of the Heavenly Stairway. The current Taihe Sect could be said to be in a state of leaderless chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, the Taihe Sect was ultimately the number one sect in the Divine Realm, with profound foundations. Moreover, it was a subordinate sect of the Taihe Realm in the Dao Realm. Soon, the few remaining elders jointly took control of the Taihe Sect, stabilizing the situation while waiting for envoys from the Taihe Realm to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A small world fell where the Dao Realm's Heavenly Stairway had been, with continuous rumbling. The Dao principles of heaven and earth surged, spiritual energy became violent, and the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth became unstable.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Realm shook, buildings collapsed, mountains and rivers boiled, and the disturbance continued for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The tremors affected the entire Divine Realm. Even the Qinghua Realm and the Nine Mountains Realm, which were furthest from the Taihe Realm, were shaking.</p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Heavenly Venerable experts felt uneasy and solemn, with a sense of crisis as if a world-ending calamity was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Weaker martial artists, especially those below the Refining Spirit realm, were even more desperate. But they had no ability to resist these crises and could only resign themselves to fate.</p><p></p><p>In fact, weaker martial artists could easily get injured if they weren't careful during the tremors. They could only try their best to find safe places.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the powerful experts unleashed their auras to comfort the anxious people, waiting for the great tremors to end.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the tremors of heaven and earth continued, but no other major disasters appeared. The anxious mood began to ease.</p><p></p><p>After the unease subsided, people began to investigate what exactly had happened in the Divine Realm to cause such turmoil in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For the weak, there were almost no ways to learn about the great situations of heaven and earth or the secrets of the world. So even though the Divine Realm had been in turmoil for so long, they still didn't know what changes had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, within the Divine Realm, martial artists who had invaded from outside were still rampaging. Due to the severe damage to the Divine Realm's strength, there was insufficient power to guard the Heavenly Caves, and many Heavenly Caves had fallen, becoming strongholds for the outside martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The entire Divine Realm was in chaos, with killing to be seen everywhere. There were even Blood Sons of the Netherworld performing blood sacrifices in cities.</p><p></p><p>"My sworn brother has established a Demon Race?" </p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger had escaped death, surviving under the true dragon's claws. Now it was hiding somewhere to recuperate. After a period of recovery, it had finally regained most of its strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had turned misfortune into blessing, with its bloodline becoming purified. It even gained the might of a Celestial Tiger as a result.</p><p></p><p>Just as it emerged from its hiding place, it learned about the Red Cat establishing a Demon Race, calling for spirit beasts of the Divine Realm to gather in the Nine Mountains Realm and jointly create a Demon Race!</p><p></p><p>"Return to the Nine Mountains Realm!" </p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger was extremely excited at this moment.</p><p></p><p>If not for the jade talisman saving it, it would already be a dead tiger!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Seventeen, just you wait!"</p><p></p><p>By now, how could the Wind Spirit Tiger not know that it had been set up by Heaven Seventeen!</p><p></p><p>The great changes in the Divine Realm now all began with it activating the Celestial Tiger aura in the Dragon Abyss, luring the true dragon to fall. This was all part of the plot by Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Wind Spirit Tiger was slow-witted, it had realized that Heaven Seventeen was far from being as simple as he appeared on the surface. His strength must be above its own.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger frantically rushed towards the Nine Mountains Realm. Along the way, it also encountered some Immortal realm spirit beasts who were also heading to the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>It even saw hundreds of spirit beasts comparable to True King Heavenly Venerables, majestically heading towards the Nine Mountains Realm. They were going to join the Great Demon King Red Cat!</p><p></p><p>With the great changes in the Divine Realm and the turmoil in heaven and earth, these spirit beasts also needed to band together to face the coming crisis. The Demon Race in the Nine Mountains Realm was undoubtedly the best choice. After all, it was rumored that the Demon Race's cultivation methods could ignore bloodline restrictions, allowing them to continuously cultivate and increase their strength like human martial artists!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

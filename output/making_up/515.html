        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through and continued cultivating. The Qinghua realm remained a bottleneck as always. He cultivated what needed cultivating and handled affairs that needed handling.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Divine Realm did not affect this place. </p><p></p><p>Naturally, it affected Li Xuan even less. He was still reading the bamboo slips, which recorded many strange tales and events. He could spend a long time reading them slowly every day.</p><p></p><p>It was just a way to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>"This must be a diary, the Sea Spirit Emperor's diary?" Li Xuan mused to himself. The events recorded on the bamboo slips were like someone writing down their experiences and observations in a diary.</p><p></p><p>Although the bamboo slips were from the Sea Spirit clan, they weren't necessarily written by the Sea Spirit Emperor, since there wasn't much information about the Sea Spirit clan recorded.</p><p></p><p>On this day, unexpected news arrived - a Divine Venerable realm martial artist had issued a challenge to Meng Chong outside the Nine Mountains realm! News of the challenge spread throughout the Divine Realm, causing a sensation.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Celestial God Meng Chong once again spread widely across the Divine Realm, even attracting the attention of some Supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Divine Venerable from the Myriad Treasures Alliance seeking death?" Meng Shushu exclaimed in astonishment. </p><p></p><p>The Myriad Treasures Alliance, which had been cowardly for so long, was no longer cowardly this time and directly challenged Meng Chong, wanting to regain dignity for the alliance?</p><p></p><p>Was it because a Divine Venerable realm martial artist, the Myriad Treasures Alliance's backer in the Dao Realm, had arrived, so they felt very confident?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had just killed a Divine Venerable not long ago. Did they not know about the relationship between Meng Chong and Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong walked out of his closed cultivation chamber, also with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Yi and the others from the Myriad Treasures Alliance are quite shrewd. How did they become so foolish this time?"</p><p></p><p>Last time the Myriad Treasures Alliance had been cowardly and very sensible, so he hadn't made things difficult for Hong Yi and the others.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after such a short time, a Divine Venerable came to challenge him? That Divine Venerable issued the challenge outside the Nine Mountains realm, taunting Meng Chong to come and die.</p><p></p><p>Originally, that Divine Venerable had planned to issue the challenge at the border between the Qinghua realm and Nine Mountains realm, but Red Cat directly blocked the way, demanding a toll before allowing entry into the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>That Divine Venerable had no choice but to issue the challenge outside the Nine Mountains realm, because he discovered that with his strength, he actually couldn't defeat the Great Beast King.</p><p></p><p>"This comes at a good time, I can stretch my muscles a bit!" Meng Chong said with a fierce grin.</p><p></p><p>If someone wanted to come deliver themselves to death, how could he not oblige?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong immediately set out for the battlefield. Zi Yun was extremely excited, able to witness Meng Chong display his divine might again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu, Shi Er, Feng Yan and the others also excitedly went along. Even Da Yue Emperor and his group wouldn't miss such a good opportunity to witness a battle between Divine Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Nine Mountains realm, Red Cat came scampering over to welcome them, and even brought someone along.</p><p></p><p>It was actually Hong Yi from the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was very surprised. "Ah, Hong Yi, I saw that your Myriad Treasures Alliance was quite sensible. What's going on this time?"</p><p></p><p>He was indeed somewhat surprised. After all, his senior brother disciple Xu Yan killed Divine Venerables as easily as crushing ants. Hong Yi and the other Myriad Treasures Alliance martial artists should have already known after the Snow Vengeance Alliance incident that he and Xu Yan were fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, how did they dare to send a mere Divine Venerable to seek revenge against him? Hong Yi had an extremely wronged expression as he said: "Great Hero Meng, this is a misunderstanding! It has nothing to do with us! We were afraid you would misunderstand, so we came to explain to you. Please don't implicate us!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a puzzled expression. Misunderstanding?</p><p></p><p>"You mean that Divine Venerable isn't from your Myriad Treasures Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi sighed and said: "He's our Myriad Treasures Alliance's backer who came from the Dao Realm. It's just that his character is somewhat lacking. He heard about Great Hero Meng's deeds and insisted on seeking an explanation from you..."</p><p></p><p>As Hong Yi explained, Meng Chong and the others finally understood. That Divine Venerable was too tyrannical and arrogant, treating Hong Yi and the others completely like slaves.</p><p></p><p>According to rumors, this Divine Venerable had an extraordinary background. He was the son of the Realm Lord of the Wan Tao Realm, one of the 300 realms of the Dao Realm. Thus he had developed an arrogant personality and didn't even take Supreme beings seriously.</p><p></p><p>Of course, because he was the son of a Realm Lord, even those Supreme beings didn't dare to do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the other Myriad Treasures Alliance martial artists had been beaten and scolded at will, and had long harbored deep resentment. When he wanted to seek revenge for the Myriad Treasures Alliance against Meng Chong, not a single person reminded him that Meng Chong and Xu Yan were fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that this challenge was issued.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi was worried this matter would cause Meng Chong to misunderstand, so he came to explain and distance themselves from it.</p><p></p><p>"Great Hero Meng, his status is extraordinary. After all, he's the son of a Realm Lord. And because of his special status, his strength is not weak. Supreme beings don't dare to do anything to him. So this time he came to the Divine Realm without any Supreme beings accompanying him, purely for entertainment. If he dies, it may provoke retaliation from the Realm Lord." Hong Yi said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"The son of a Realm Lord? Whether I kill him or not depends on his attitude. If he seeks death, I'll grant his wish. As for his father, hmph!" Meng Chong said contemptuously at the end.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong a Realm Lord was, in his master's eyes they were still insects. Not to mention the Wan Tao Realm Lord's strength was not considered among the strong among Realm Lords, only middling at best. Even Old Man Xiao could suppress him.</p><p></p><p>"The son of a Realm Lord? In that case, he must hate me to death and is certainly thinking of how to take revenge on me?" Red Cat said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the other party wanted to enter the Nine Mountains realm, he had blocked the way and verbally humiliated him quite a bit. After a battle, the other party had even suffered a small loss.</p><p></p><p>With his character, and being the son of a Realm Lord accustomed to arrogance, he definitely wouldn't swallow this anger and would be full of thoughts of revenge.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat naturally wasn't worried. After all, his own master was the Dao Ancestor. In terms of background and backing, what did the other party amount to?</p><p></p><p>At the border between the Nine Mountains realm and Long Yun realm, many powerful experts had gathered. The weakest were all Immortal Venerable realm, and all were among the top ranks of Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists below the Immortal realm didn't have the qualifications to come watch the battle.</p><p></p><p>Among the spectators, there were naturally many Heaven Fusion realm and Divine Venerable realm martial artists who had come from the Dao Realm. As for Supreme realm martial artists, they all had their own tasks and didn't come to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that Wan Jie?"</p><p></p><p>"It's him, the son of the Wan Tao Realm Lord. He's used to being arrogant. The Wan Tao Realm is the backer of the Divine Realm's Myriad Treasures Alliance. This time Wan Jie came to the Divine Realm, heard about the so-called Celestial God Meng Chong, and wants to regain dignity for the Myriad Treasures Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Celestial God Meng Chong. I've also heard a bit about him. He once shocked the Divine Realm and forced the Myriad Treasures Alliance to bow their heads."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Venerable martial artists who had come from the Dao Realm were discussing amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This time Wan Jie is likely to be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Someone gloated.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Meng Chong and Xu Yan are fellow disciples. How could Meng Chong's strength be weak? Wan Jie is only at the Divine Venerable realm. This time he will undoubtedly be defeated."</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>However, someone disagreed: "That's not necessarily true. Wan Jie has a Realm Lord for a father. He's different from other Divine Venerables. Would Meng Chong dare to kill the son of a Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>When this was said, the others all revealed envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>That was the highest level of expert in the entire world. Even the weakest Realm Lord was high above others. Those below the Realm Lord level wouldn't dare to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even among Realm Lords themselves, they would try to avoid conflict with each other as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even though Meng Chong had a Realm Lord level expert backing him, he wouldn't dare make a mortal enemy of a Realm Lord, as that would break the unspoken agreement between Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>"The reason Wan Jie can be so arrogant and tyrannical in the Dao Realm is because he relies on his Realm Lord father. This time, I actually hope Meng Chong gives him a good beating," a Divine Venerable cultivator said with a cold laugh, clearly harboring some hostility towards Wan Jie and having long been fed up with his behavior.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, beating up Wan Jie would be satisfying. Seeing him get thrashed would make me happy!" another cultivator chimed in.</p><p></p><p>As for killing Wan Jie, none of them had any hope of that happening. After all, he was the son of a Realm Lord - a noble identity with powerful backing!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is here!" </p><p></p><p>Among the spectating cultivators, Princess Zhou Qingshuang of the Great Yan Kingdom from the Great Yan Realm said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Her bright eyes looked towards that towering figure, as well as the purple-robed woman clinging to Meng Chong's arm as they arrived together. A look of envy flashed across her face.</p><p></p><p>Beside Zhou Qingshuang, a Divine Venerable from the Great Yan Realm raised an eyebrow and said, "This Meng Chong's physical body gives me an extremely powerful feeling."</p><p></p><p>Other than that, they couldn't tell what level of strength Meng Chong actually possessed.</p><p></p><p>"So you're the so-called Divine Meng Chong?" </p><p></p><p>Wan Jie stood atop a high platform made of giant stones, looking down with an arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you're the son of Realm Lord Wan Tao?" Meng Chong scratched his head. This Wan Jie was indeed used to being arrogant, with a look of disdain for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wan Jie's expression grew even more haughty and overbearing. "What, are you scared now? How about this - send that girl by your side up here, kowtow to me three times, and from now on run errands for me. Then I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>The might of a Realm Lord was something no one in this world dared to offend, except for other Realm Lords. </p><p></p><p>This was the source of Wan Jie's confidence, and the root of his tyrannical behavior. Even other Supreme level experts with Realm Lords backing them wouldn't dare to kill him.</p><p></p><p>After all, his identity as the son of a Realm Lord meant there were some unwritten rules between the various realms in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, the true disciples and offspring of Realm Lords were inviolable. Even if there was conflict between children of different Realm Lords, they were not allowed to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>In Wan Jie's view, as a cultivator from the Divine Realm, no matter how talented Meng Chong was, how could he compare to his own noble status as the son of a Realm Lord? Moreover, at most Meng Chong was only at the Heaven Fusion realm. Even if he was at the Divine Venerable realm, so what? He was the son of a Realm Lord, inherently stronger than ordinary Divine Venerables.</p><p></p><p>When Meng Chong asked if he was the son of a Realm Lord, Wan Jie's ingrained thought process immediately assumed Meng Chong was scared and wanted to back down.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Wan Jie acted haughty and arrogant, preparing to humiliate Meng Chong according to his usual way of doing things, to let him know the price of offending a Realm Lord's son!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yun immediately exploded with anger. She jumped up and shouted furiously, "Meng Chong, beat him to death! How dare he covet me? Beat him to death!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head and revealed a fierce smile. For a mere Realm Lord's son to be even more arrogant than himself, a true disciple of the Dao Ancestor - if he didn't beat him to death, it would damage his reputation as a Divine God.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're seeking death, I'll grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong walked forward step by step, his fierce aura gradually revealing itself.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't transform into a golden giant, nor did he display an overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>"Make your move. Otherwise, you won't even have a chance to attack!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood on the high platform, grinning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" </p><p></p><p>Wan Jie was furious. "I want to see what gives you the right to call yourself a Divine God!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! In that instant, Wan Jie's aura erupted as a long saber appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The saber was surrounded by Dao rhymes, with laws coiled around it. This was a divine artifact of heaven and earth, far beyond ordinary divine artifacts, having been empowered by a Realm Lord level expert.</p><p></p><p>This was Wan Jie's trump card, the source of his confidence in surpassing many Divine Venerables and being able to slay them.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a Realm Lord's son. That divine artifact is incomparable to the ones we wield!" </p><p></p><p>The spectating Divine Venerable cultivators couldn't help but sigh in envy.</p><p></p><p>"Can Meng Chong win?"</p><p></p><p>When Wan Jie wielded a divine artifact empowered by a Realm Lord, their confidence in Meng Chong wavered.</p><p></p><p>"Playing with knives in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered. "I'll be fair - if I can't obliterate you with one punch, I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Jie was enraged and slashed out with his saber.</p><p></p><p>Although he was arrogant, he went all out from the start, not daring to be careless at all.</p><p></p><p>The fierce aura emanating from Meng Chong's body gave him a vague sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>As the saber slashed out, the blade light seemed to carry the might of a small world, fiercely chopping down. The space of heaven and earth shook, as if about to be split open by this slash.</p><p></p><p>The spectating cultivators below the Heaven Fusion realm suddenly felt their breathing stall, their expressions shocked as they hurriedly retreated some distance.</p><p></p><p>Even the Divine Venerable cultivators had solemn expressions, secretly estimating whether they could withstand this slash if they encountered it! Their final conclusion was that they wouldn't be able to block it and would inevitably suffer heavy injuries under this slash!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, heaven and earth seemed to freeze. The spectating cultivators seemed to see a great sun appear between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>They saw Meng Chong throw out a punch, like a great sun erupting forth. The might of the great sun was like a massive mountain pressing down on everyone.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes was that overwhelmingly powerful great sun that seemed capable of annihilating everything.</p><p></p><p>This time, it wasn't just cultivators below the Heaven Fusion realm who hastily and狼狈地 retreated. Even the Divine Venerable realm cultivators paled in shock and retreated some distance.</p><p></p><p>One punch struck out, like the great sun destroying the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The might of Wan Jie's slash shattered like paper under the great sun. The power of this one punch was actually this strong.</p><p></p><p>"My father is a Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Wan Jie's expression was one of great shock, his breathing almost stopping as the crisis of death descended. Both his physical body and divine soul felt like they were about to be crushed.</p><p></p><p>Any defense or attack was incapable of shaking this punch.</p><p></p><p>A punch like the great sun destroying the world!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he hurriedly opened his mouth, wanting to remind the other party that he was the son of a Realm Lord. Even if there was conflict, they couldn't fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>Boom! But this punch didn't hesitate at all, directly smashing into his body.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The hearts of all the Divine Venerable cultivators trembled, their bodies involuntarily shaking. Wan Jie had been obliterated by one punch, disintegrating into ash with not even his divine soul remaining!</p><p></p><p>That was the son of a Realm Lord!</p><p></p><p>The image of that punch like the great sun destroying the world lingered in their minds.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they couldn't help but recall Meng Chong's nickname - Divine God!</p><p></p><p>One punch from the Divine God had directly obliterated a Divine Venerable. Such violent power - even a Supreme level expert couldn't do this, right?</p><p></p><p>What shocked the Divine Venerables even more was that Wan Jie was the son of a Realm Lord! Yet Meng Chong had unhesitatingly, without even blinking, directly obliterated him with one punch. He had turned to ash, not even leaving a corpse for Realm Lord Wan Tao.</p><p></p><p>This was probably the first person in history to so blatantly disregard the might of a Realm Lord and humiliate them, right?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

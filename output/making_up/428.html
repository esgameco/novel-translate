        <h1>Chapter 428</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can he really be awakened?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Luo Zhan was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Although that sword wound had severely injured Hong Ting, the most troublesome issue was that he remained in a coma, with the Duowu power eroding him. </p><p></p><p>As long as the Duowu power could not be eliminated, Hong Ting would never be able to recover, and was essentially crippled.</p><p></p><p>"Waking him up isn't a big problem, but curing him will be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan tossed the pill to Luo Zhan and said, "This is the pill. Once it dissolves into his body, he'll quickly regain consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pill in his hand, Luo Zhan was amazed. With his keen spiritual sense, he naturally knew this pill was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand to dissolve the pill into Hong Ting's body. Since Xu Yan was here, this medicine certainly wouldn't be poisonous, otherwise it would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the pill dissolved into Hong Ting's body, with a few painful groans, Hong Ting slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even his groans gave off a sense of laziness.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Luo!" </p><p></p><p>Hong Ting saw Luo Zhan, his voice weak and feeble, as if he was too lazy to even call out a title.</p><p></p><p>"How do you feel?" </p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan asked joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Not sure, I just don't want to move, don't want to do anything..."</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting replied lazily.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's expression changed several times, his heart growing heavy. Hong Ting was crippled.</p><p></p><p>Just like some geniuses eroded by the Duowu power, he had fallen and would slowly die in laziness.</p><p></p><p>"It was this young brother who woke you up."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan looked at Xu Yan beside him and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, brother!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting seemed to want to raise his hand, but was too lazy to lift it, only mumbling his thanks.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. He was somewhat surprised in his heart - this Duowu power was even more terrifying than he had imagined. </p><p></p><p>The genius of the Hundred Battles Hall must have condensed the will of a hundred battles, with firm and strong willpower, yet he was eroded to this state. Ordinary martial artists would find it even harder to resist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Luo Zhan understood that Xu Yan was not the culprit, and had indeed been framed.</p><p></p><p>He took out a token and handed it to Xu Yan, saying: "Young brother Xu, this is the Hundred Battles Token. Wherever there is a Hundred Battles Hall, you can use this token to seek assistance from them, whether it's for urgently needed treasures, protection for friends, obtaining intelligence and information, etc."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan accepted the token.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Battles Hall had an extremely wide influence. In terms of pure strength, they were even stronger than the Myriad Treasures Alliance. As he traveled through the Divine Realm, he would inevitably have need of it.</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, he said: "My junior sister may be able to treat Brother Hong Ting's injuries. She should be able to cure him."</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's injury was rather special, and Su Lingxiu would likely be very interested. Since Luo Zhan had taken the initiative to befriend him, he might as well point out a path.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your junior sister, young brother?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he felt the chances were slim, Luo Zhan wanted to try his best. It was just a matter of making a trip.</p><p></p><p>"My junior sister Su Lingxiu is in the Great Yue Kingdom of the Qinghua Realm. You can take Brother Hong Ting there to seek treatment. Just say I directed you."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added: "That pill was refined by my junior sister."</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhan heard this, his spirits immediately lifted, seeing hope for curing Hong Ting.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. As for the Tianshadiying matter..."</p><p></p><p>"Those despicable rats, daring to commit such a shameless act, they certainly won't stop at this..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two discussed for a while how to counter Tianshadiying's actions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a secret chamber in White Wood City.</p><p></p><p>"How foolish! What kind of stupid move was that, provoking the Hundred Battles Hall at this time? The timing is not right!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, it was Eight Leaf Tiansha's order."</p><p></p><p>"Killing Xu Yan directly would have been clean and neat. Going to such lengths, and then being exposed - now the Hundred Battles Hall will surely retaliate. This is extremely stupid! According to Lord Seventeen's plan, the Hundred Battles Hall was to be left for later, to add the final spark to the great chaos. Now that the Hundred Battles Hall is alerted, problems will certainly arise!"</p><p></p><p>After angrily scolding for a while, he asked in a deep voice: "Where is Eight Leaf?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Eight Leaf Tiansha has gone into seclusion. He said he sensed an opportunity for breakthrough and won't emerge for some time..."</p><p></p><p>"Send a message to Lord Seventeen, tell him to dispatch more powerful experts to kill Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, now our Tianshadiying has been exposed prematurely!"</p><p></p><p>The clan leader cursed incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Hong Ting incident, the name Tianshadiying had spread widely throughout the Changyu Realm. Many martial artists were discussing what kind of force would dare to provoke the Hundred Battles Hall.</p><p></p><p>And the Hundred Battles Hall had begun retaliating against Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Nine Mountains Realm did not subside with Xu Yan and Meng Chong's departure. Instead, it showed signs of intensifying.</p><p></p><p>Even Thousand Fold Mountain and横峰山 were secretly discussing actions against the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>And the Wan family was forced to start attempting alliances with other forces to avoid being jointly targeted, starting with the Spirit Veneration Gate.</p><p></p><p>As the chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm continued, the Heavenly Abyss also occasionally showed disturbances. Another Blood Child emerged from the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Joining forces with the Blood Child at the realm gate, they actually attempted to cross the realm gate and enter the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>When crossing the realm gate, they encountered an Immortal Venerable from the Qinghua Realm blocking them and failed to succeed.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, due to the calm of the Heavenly Abyss, the Immortal Venerables were able to devote more time to arranging formations.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely busy, preparing for the grand formation of the Qinghua Realm. To prevent the turmoil of the Nine Mountains Realm from affecting the Qinghua Realm, and to block the spread of Tianshadiying's information and prevent intelligence about the Qinghua Realm from leaking out,</p><p></p><p>He immediately arranged a formation at the realm gate, sealing it off. Even an Immortal Venerable would find it difficult to break through this formation by force.</p><p></p><p>With the formation plus an Immortal Venerable and many True King Venerables guarding it, the safety of the realm gate could be ensured.</p><p></p><p>Besides the realm gate, one could also cross through the wilderness, although there were certain dangers and it required more time.</p><p></p><p>But since they wanted to arrange formations and remove the Qinghua Realm from the turmoil of the Divine Realm, they had to seal off the route into the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, under the orders of the three major forces of the Great Yue Kingdom, many Law Condensation Realm martial artists and True Kings of the Tempering Truth Realm began building small border towns along the edge of the wilderness at certain intervals.</p><p></p><p>With the powerful abilities of martial artists, building cities was naturally simple and quick, especially with the entire Qinghua Realm mobilized.</p><p></p><p>The border towns were connected by formations. Anyone crossing the formations would trigger an alarm, thus alerting patrolling personnel to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Although they couldn't completely block off the wilderness route for now, they could at least know if anyone was crossing the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, anyone crossing the wilderness must be a martial artist of Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also selected suitable locations in the territories of the three major forces to arrange a grand formation, drawing in spiritual energy and heavenly spiritual mechanisms. Cultivating in the area covered by this formation was equivalent to over ten days of cultivation outside.</p><p></p><p>To gain entry to cultivate in the area covered by the formation, one needed to earn merits.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Exchanged for merit points.</p><p></p><p>The area covered by the great formation was called Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>To enter Spirit City, one needed to obtain merit. To gain merit, countless martial artists naturally participated in the grand construction of Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Especially for lower-level martial artists, this was the best way for them to earn cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was time for the three major powers of Qinghua Realm to discuss unifying into one, to bind the entire Qinghua Realm together.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, the Heavenly Martial Sect Leader, and the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect Leader, as the three supreme powerhouses of Qinghua Realm, represented the three major forces. As long as these three reached an agreement, any other opposing voices would not be of concern.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were no opposing voices to speak of. As long as the benefits were distributed properly, everything would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who wasn't a fool knew that Qinghua Realm was about to undergo a tremendous transformation. Seizing this opportunity would surely lead to soaring success.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the first martial artist to break through the long-standing bottleneck by taking the pill and entering the Immortal Realm, the respected and famous experts of Qinghua Realm understood that the unification of Qinghua Realm was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>In the future, there would no longer be three major powers in Qinghua Realm, but rather the entire realm would belong to one power! The unification of Qinghua Realm could not be achieved without the key figures Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu. As Su Lingxiu was busy arranging the Heavenly Cave into a Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth, and had no interest in these matters, it meant that only one key figure remained - Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>After repeated discussions and deliberations, it was finally decided.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was established! The three major powers were divided into the Great Yue State, Heavenly Martial State, and Ten Thousand Thunder State under the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu became the founders of the Qinghua Sect. The Great Yue Emperor, Heavenly Martial Sect Leader, and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect Leader became the three founding elders of the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was established with branches for artifact refining, formations, and alchemy. Fang Hao became the Sect Leader of the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became the Master of the Evergreen Pavilion of the Qinghua Sect, with a transcendent status above the elders and equal to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to some extent, as the senior apprentice sister, Su Lingxiu's status was actually above Fang Hao's.</p><p></p><p>With the establishment of the Qinghua Sect, the next step was to build a Spirit City for the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Spirit City began expansion and arrangement based on the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, also incorporating the Great Yue Heavenly Cave into the Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>The locations of the Heavenly Martial Sect and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect were also building Spirit Cities, naturally on a slightly smaller scale than the Qinghua Sect's main Spirit City, but still considered sacred places of martial arts in Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the establishment of the Qinghua Sect, they immediately began to recruit talented individuals, including those skilled in formations, artifact refining, and alchemy.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ability martial arts were also passed down to the Immortal Lords following the establishment of the Qinghua Sect. As for whether they could cultivate it successfully depended on their individual talents.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Feng Yan became quite proud.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had cultivated the Divine Ability, so even those as strong as the Great Yue Emperor and the other two had to swallow their pride and seek his guidance.</p><p></p><p>As for asking the expert Li Xuan for guidance, they didn't have the courage. Disturbing a great expert's tranquility was not a good idea.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts world of Qinghua Realm was undergoing earth-shattering changes, with many talented individuals eager to join the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>Other family clans and small sects naturally became subordinate forces of the Qinghua Sect and were all assigned tasks.</p><p></p><p>In a certain location in Qinghua Realm, a great formation was set up, and the technique for planting divine herbs was passed down by Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>A group of disciples from the Evergreen Pavilion, under Yue'er's guidance, began to cultivate spirit fields and plant spirit herbs and divine herbs.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Qinghua Sect, Fang Hao could not afford to rest for a moment. He even dragged Yue Changming and Cai Ling'er to help.</p><p></p><p>Even Meng Shushu and Shi Er, whose strength was still weak, were pulled in by him.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect needed to establish a sword dao, and naturally, the Big Senior Brother was the expert in sword dao. Fang Hao also asked Xu Yan to pass down the introductory and foundational techniques of sword dao.</p><p></p><p>For example, cultivating sword momentum, then perceiving sword intent, and finally achieving sword heart enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The complete system of sword dao truly began to be passed down in the Qinghua Sect at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also asked Meng Chong to pass down more comprehensive methods for physical cultivation, as well as the dao of the blade.</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior Sister..."</p><p></p><p>"Go find Yue'er."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Third Senior Sister tinkering with the Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth in the Heavenly Cave, Fang Hao left helplessly. Third Senior Sister was really too lazy!</p><p></p><p>As one of the founders of the Qinghua Sect and the Master of the Evergreen Pavilion, she didn't do anything, leaving everything to Yue'er, Zhou Ying, and others.</p><p></p><p>With the establishment of the Qinghua Sect, Fang Hao was ambitious, vowing to make the Qinghua Sect the strongest sect in the world.</p><p></p><p>He then summoned the group of talented individuals who had come from the Spirit Realm. They were all acquaintances, making them easier to work with, and their talents were not bad, so they could be cultivated with focused attention.</p><p></p><p>"Someone crossed the wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Sect Leader, indeed someone crossed the wilderness, triggering the formation's warning. The person has already self-destructed."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't we just have two people break through to the Immortal Realm recently? Send them to patrol the wilderness border. Capture anyone who crosses the wilderness. Those who self-destruct must be from the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Leader!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's eyes turned cold. This Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow was truly deeply hidden, and he had a great grudge against them.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, can you refine a few more pills? We still don't have enough Immortal Lords, we're a bit short on manpower!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao found Su Lingxiu again and said with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Junior Brother, these pills are not so easy to refine. Wait until I finish arranging the Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth, then we can try to refine them," Su Lingxiu said after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, how long will it take? Do you need more people to help?"</p><p></p><p>"In three days, we can start trying to refine them," Su Lingxiu said after thinking for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Heavenly Cave was very large. It was not possible to turn the entire cave into a Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth for now, but part of it could be utilized.</p><p></p><p>"Great!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Su Lingxiu excitedly began to prepare for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>This time, she was not using her divine ability to manifest the Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth, but using the Heavenly Cave as a pill furnace, employing the Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth pill refining technique to refine pills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Cave was extremely special, being a hole in heaven and earth. The boundaries of the Heavenly Cave were surrounded by the laws of heaven and earth, making it easier to draw upon the power of these laws to condense into pills.</p><p></p><p>What Su Lingxiu valued more was the possibility of using this to draw upon energies from beyond heaven and earth, even some of the laws of the Netherworld, to use in refining pills.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu stood at one side of the Heavenly Cave, raising her hand to send out a flame of heaven and earth, which fell into the prepared Divine Furnace of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and others watched excitedly. If this succeeded, there would be no shortage of pills.</p><p></p><p>They would also be able to refine more pills to assist in breaking through to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were many large and small Heavenly Caves throughout Qinghua Realm. If they could all be turned into Divine Furnaces of Heaven and Earth, there would be more pills than they could consume.</p><p></p><p>The special feature of Heavenly Caves was that divine herbs, spirit herbs, and various cultivation resources naturally spawned within them.</p><p></p><p>Within a thousand years, there was no need to worry about a shortage of pill refining materials. After a hundred years, various divine herbs and spirit herbs would be cultivated, providing a continuous supply to maintain balance.</p><p></p><p>Once the Qinghua Sect's strength increased, they could take advantage of the chaos in the Divine Realm to expand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, pills could be directly condensed using the laws of heaven and earth, so there would never be a shortage of pills no matter what.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

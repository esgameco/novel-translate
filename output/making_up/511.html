        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the location of the great tomb, Blood Demon was stunned. Where had such a large tomb gone? Looking around, there was a faint rippling in the air, with an unknown aura lingering and an unfathomable power fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>Everything here was beyond even his comprehension. </p><p></p><p>Although the power of this body was only at the Spirit Refinement realm, he was not the original soul of the body, but rather a blood soul split off by his true self to carry out this plan.</p><p></p><p>And this blood soul's knowledge was the same as his true self's.</p><p></p><p>However, even someone as powerful as him could not determine what kind of power was causing the fluctuations at the tomb site. It was beyond the scope of his understanding.</p><p></p><p>All of this left Blood Demon extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the name of the Great Wilderness realm echoed in his mind again, causing him to once again suspect that he had descended into an unfamiliar world.</p><p></p><p>However, what he couldn't understand was that this body was clearly Blood Spirit Child's, a physical body he had once schemed to nurture. And Blood Spirit Child was definitely in the Cang Realm - there was no mistake about that.</p><p></p><p>"It's just as I expected!" </p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer also came to his side and said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon looked at him puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer gazed towards where the great tomb had been and shook his head, saying: "You young people don't know your own limitations. To actually seclude yourself here for cultivation, no wonder you've gone mad and your consciousness is confused, spouting nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"Is there something special about this place?" </p><p></p><p>After realizing he may have arrived in an unfamiliar realm, Blood Demon's tone unconsciously became more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"This place!" The herb gatherer sighed and said: "In ancient times in the Great Wilderness realm, there was a tragic figure. Because his beloved perished, he couldn't bear the blow and immersed himself in memories of the past every day. He hypnotized himself and created a unique technique called the Mind Imaging Divine Art...</p><p></p><p>"He once cultivated here, immersed in memories of the past. As a result, this place was imbued with the principles of his technique. Anyone who enters here will be affected - either their consciousness becomes confused, or they become trapped in their own dreams, believing they have become what they dream of being.</p><p></p><p>"For example, if someone's lifelong wish was to be with the person they admire, after being affected here they would believe they were already with that person. They might hug a wooden log all day, as if embracing their beloved.</p><p></p><p>"There was once someone who desired love but couldn't attain it. They deliberately entered this place to immerse themselves in the illusion of being in a passionate romance with the one they admired. As a result, they mistook a spirit dog for their beloved and passionately romanced the dog every day. It was unbearable to watch, truly unbearable. In the end, they perished within the illusion!"</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer recounted the strange and bizarre nature of this place with a look of lamentation.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon listened with his scalp tingling and eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I was affected by this, which is why I thought I had arrived in the inner region of Cang and successfully entered Blood Spirit Child's corpse? In reality, this isn't Blood Spirit Child's corpse, and this isn't the location of the great tomb - all of this is due to the influence of that mysterious power?"</p><p></p><p>The more Blood Demon thought about it, the more his scalp tingled. What kind of powerful force could affect even him?</p><p></p><p>Although this blood soul's power wasn't strong, it should be known that the true self of the blood soul was very powerful.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be compared to ordinary split souls. Even so, it had been affected, which showed how terrifyingly powerful that expert must be.</p><p></p><p>"Although you've been affected, gone mad and your consciousness is confused, there's still hope. Since we've met, come back with me. I'll try to save you!" </p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer looked at him with pity as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What realm was that expert at?" Blood Demon swallowed and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you should be polite. You should realize by now that something's wrong with you, so you should know to be respectful!" The herb gatherer said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sen...senior. May I ask what realm that expert was at?" Blood Demon forced himself to say.</p><p></p><p>He was such a powerful being, yet he was calling this person "senior". However, in order to figure out what kind of realm he had arrived in, he could only endure it.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's heart was pounding violently, both shocked and excited. Besides the Seven Great Realms, there was actually another realm? The Great Wilderness Realm!</p><p></p><p>And he had inadvertently arrived in an unknown realm with this blood soul. The power of this realm seemed even greater than the Cang Realm?</p><p></p><p>And what kind of figure was the Dao Ancestor? At this point, Blood Demon had completely forgotten his original plans. He only wanted to understand the Great Wilderness Realm clearly, thinking he might obtain some fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Especially, how powerful was that Dao Ancestor? </p><p></p><p>This place was so bizarrely affected by that expert's influence that even he was affected. Wasn't that expert's power above even his true self? How many experts of this level were there in the Great Wilderness Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Dao Establishment Realm!" The herb gatherer said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>When Blood Demon heard this, any doubts remaining deep in his heart disappeared. This really wasn't the Cang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Dao Establishment Realm, what kind of realm was that? He had never heard of it before. It definitely wasn't part of the Cang martial arts system, nor was it any martial arts realm he knew of.</p><p></p><p>"How strong is the Dao Establishment Realm?" Blood Demon couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, don't aim too high. The Dao Establishment Realm is far, far beyond you. It's a realm where one can establish one's own Dao lineage, a realm that possesses the wonders of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this place - it's merely affected by the Dao principles of a Dao Establisher. Three trillion six hundred billion years have passed, yet it can still have such a remarkable influence. You can estimate from this how powerful a Dao Establisher is."</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer pointed to where the great tomb had been as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon swallowed, his heart surging with shock. That expert's influence on this place had lasted for three trillion six hundred billion years? After such an immensely long time, it still had such a terrifying effect. How horrifyingly powerful was that?</p><p></p><p>"Three trillion six hundred billion years? That's an era before I was even born. The Seven Great Realms didn't even exist then. Perhaps even That One hadn't been born yet?" </p><p></p><p>Blood Demon thought with shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, come with me. Let's go to my herb hut. I'll treat you there."</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you senior!" </p><p></p><p>At this point, Blood Demon only wanted to understand the Great Wilderness Realm. He only wanted to explore here to see if there were any fortuitous encounters, perhaps methods that could allow his true self to advance further. He was extremely excited in his heart. What great fortune! By chance, this blood soul of his had descended into an unknown and powerful realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are there many Dao Establishment Realm experts in this world?" Blood Demon asked curiously as he followed closely.</p><p></p><p>"There's a rumor that there are three thousand Dao Establishers in the world. It may seem like a lot, but in this vast and boundless Great Wilderness, it's actually quite few."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand Dao Establishers? This Great Wilderness Realm was truly unbelievably powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are there beings stronger than Dao Establishers?" Blood Demon asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course there are. Dao Establishment is merely having the qualification to establish one's own Dao lineage. Above Dao Establishment, there are even stronger beings..."</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer turned back and tapped his head, saying: "Young man, don't aim too high. Take it one step at a time and cultivate steadily."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Blood Demon nodded at this point.</p><p></p><p>Following closely behind the herb gatherer, they finally arrived at a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of the slope was a small courtyard with an ordinary thatched cottage that looked very simple.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!" Blood Demon frowned slightly. Though the cottage appeared ordinary, for some reason he felt it wasn't as simple as it seemed on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what realm are you at?" Blood Demon couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Me?" The herb gatherer turned to look at him with a slight smile and said, "My realm isn't high, just a very ordinary level."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's heart trembled. "He must be a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer pushed open the wicker gate. "Come in."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon followed him into the courtyard, feeling increasingly that something was off about this yard and cottage. They seemed ordinary, yet gave him a sense of unfathomability. </p><p></p><p>"Could this herb gatherer also be a Realm Establishing expert?" Blood Demon thought with a shock.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity? Could this be my chance?"</p><p></p><p>Looking around and surveying the small courtyard, he noticed a small pond with a jade-white lotus flower blooming in it.</p><p></p><p>"What treasure is this?"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, at first glance he could tell this jade-white lotus was extremely extraordinary. Even he had never seen such a treasure before.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously he went to the edge of the pond. Looking down, his eyes couldn't help but reveal a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>What did he see?!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help rubbing his eyes and staring wide-eyed. It wasn't an illusion!</p><p></p><p>In the pond were two golden dragons! Real dragons! Although these two golden dragons looked only about three feet long and their aura wasn't apparent, as if they were ordinary, he could vaguely sense the powerful strength contained within them.</p><p></p><p>"Not weaker than Ao Hong!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon was incredibly shocked. The strength of these two golden dragons was actually not inferior to Ao Hong, the lord of the True Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Two such powerful golden dragons, actually kept in a pond?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon was both shocked and excited, almost unable to suppress his excitement at discovering such a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer was truly a terrifying expert! "Realm Establishing level, definitely a Realm Establishing expert. No, possibly even above Realm Establishing!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was getting excited, the herb gatherer called out: "Come over here!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" Blood Demon walked over with a respectful expression.</p><p></p><p>This time he called him "senior" sincerely and with true respect.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer sat down on a simple bamboo chair and gestured for Blood Demon to sit as well.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon sat down on the bamboo chair and was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>"This chair..."</p><p></p><p>The seemingly ordinary bamboo chair was actually extremely extraordinary, giving him the feeling that it was made from laws of nature!</p><p></p><p>"Hold out your hand!" said the herb gatherer.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" Blood Demon held out his hand and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit confused inside. With the herb gatherer being so powerful, why would he still use pulse diagnosis, such a mundane medical technique? "It must be because of the influence of that powerful expert that the herb gatherer is using this method to examine the root of the illness? Or perhaps this is the herb gatherer's way of treating illnesses?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon couldn't figure it out, but only felt that the herb gatherer was profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer's fingers touched his wrist. In that instant, Blood Demon felt an unknown and profound essence flow through his entire body. Even his soul seemed to become transparent.</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer frowned and said pensively: "How strange. Even if you were affected, it shouldn't be like this. Why does your soul have a foreign feeling? As if it's an unfamiliar soul?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Blood Demon's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad. If he finds out I'm a soul that has taken residence here, won't he kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon immediately became anxious. Accidentally coming to this Great Wilderness world was a huge opportunity. Perhaps there was a chance to find a way to increase his strength here.</p><p></p><p>How could he miss such a great opportunity?</p><p></p><p>His mind raced, and he quickly came up with an idea. He carefully said: "Senior, could it be related to my soul having left my body and wandered? I vaguely remember that when I was in seclusion, my soul seemed to leave my body for a long time and only recently returned to my physical body."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the herb gatherer said with sudden realization: "So that's what happened."</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his hand from taking the pulse, but frowned again and said: "This complicates things. Your soul left your body and was affected by his Dao rhyme, becoming separated from your physical body. If you can't reunite your soul and body as one again, there will be no possibility for your cultivation to advance further.</p><p></p><p>"Let's do this - although your consciousness is confused and even reversed, and your memory has problems, your mind is still intact. So let's first treat the issue of separation between your soul and body."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon breathed a sigh of relief and said: "Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, during this time, you need to cooperate well with the treatment. Otherwise, it will be too difficult to cure," the herb gatherer reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior. I will certainly follow your instructions carefully!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Demon carefully asked again: "Senior, if I'm cured, will I be able to continue cultivating? I feel like I've forgotten how to continue cultivating, forgotten the methods of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer pondered for a while, then sighed and said: "Since we've met, it must be fate. After you recover, I'll pass on a cultivation technique to you. With this technique, it's not impossible for you to establish your own Dao, and there's even hope of going beyond that!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Blood Demon was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed respectfully and said: "Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Next, I need to go prepare some medicines. You rest here and don't wander around!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the herb gatherer shouldered his medicine basket and left.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity! A great opportunity!" Blood Demon was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but go to the edge of the pond again, looking at the two golden dragons. He was still shocked that these two dragons comparable to Ao Hong were kept in the pond like pets.</p><p></p><p>The herb gatherer's strength was truly terrifyingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This Tianzi is quite good at deceiving," Li Xuan observed everything.</p><p></p><p>Everything Blood Demon saw was arranged by the Heavenly Dao rules. Although Blood Demon's strength was very high, this blood soul's power wasn't strong, and the Heavenly Dao was beyond his understanding, so he was naturally deceived.</p><p></p><p>The blood soul's strength wasn't able to see through the arrangements of the Heavenly Dao rules, especially since Li Xuan had also slightly intervened.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Ancestor, I've fooled him. It's so fun!" Tianzi, transformed into the herb gatherer, came before Li Xuan and said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you see fit," Li Xuan said with a smile and shook his head. Tianzi was a bit playful.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Ancestor, please give me some more guidance on how to fool him next?" Tianzi looked at him expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The arrangement of the cottage, the two golden dragons, etc., were all based on Li Xuan's guidance, which had successfully deceived Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was familiar with powerful beings like Tai Cang, so he used the Heavenly Dao rules to create two golden dragons simulating strength comparable to Ao Hong.</p><p></p><p>This blood soul of Blood Demon naturally couldn't distinguish that they weren't real dragons as strong as Ao Hong.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

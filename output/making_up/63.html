        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 63: Pack Them All Up and Take Them Away</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, Meng Chong immersed himself wholeheartedly in cultivation. Stone Er seized the opportunity and came to Meng Chong's house every day to cook, mop the floor, and clean the house, doing the work of a servant.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also focused his mind on the great cause of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>He prepared martial arts techniques and formulas for Meng Chong, pondering how to perfect the physical martial dao system.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Eastern River Prefecture, a fervent search for masters had erupted. Group after group of reckless young masters who used to bully others or live in idleness, leading their guards and servants, scoured the vast mountains, all for the purpose of seeking out masters and learning true martial arts.</p><p></p><p>They were envious of Xu Yan's strength. </p><p></p><p>Before this, they had often secretly mocked Xu Yan, that fool who didn't have much intelligence. But in the end, the real fools were themselves?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't accept it!</p><p></p><p>"I also want to become a powerful martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>And so, the Eastern River Prefecture was swept up in a craze of seeking out masters. Figures searching for masters could often be seen in the remote, uninhabited mountains and hills.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Wang, what a coincidence! Have you found a master yet?"</p><p>"Young Master Tian, how about you?"</p><p>"No, I've searched through several big mountains, and even encountered some fierce beasts, but still haven't found a master."</p><p>"Me neither!"</p><p>"Sigh, I wonder where Xu Yan found his master? Surely not in the city, masters must all be recluses in the mountains, right?"</p><p>"How could it be in the city? If that were the case, everyone would know about it!"</p><p>"Enough talk, I still need to go check out that mountain up ahead... What, you've already been there?"</p><p></p><p>In the remote mountains and hills, groups searching for masters would encounter each other and share their experiences, all the while expressing their admiration and envy of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, who had shattered the worldviews of both the people of the Eastern River Prefecture and the officials of the Qi Kingdom, he was currently in the imperial palace's treasury.</p><p></p><p>"What wonderful things! The imperial treasury is truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the treasures in the treasury, marveling endlessly. </p><p></p><p>The gold and silver items were no longer valuable enough to be kept in the treasury.</p><p></p><p>Rare gems, luminous pearls, nine-leaf spirit herbs, thousand-year-old ginseng - all were priceless items, and the storage quantities were staggering.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, just tell me which treasures you need, and this old servant will have them prepared for you."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch overseer smiled obsequiously.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan walked around the treasury, he suddenly noticed a sword and a knife placed there.</p><p></p><p>Weapons worthy of being collected in the imperial treasury were naturally of high quality. Xu Yan became interested and walked over, picking up the sword on the rack.</p><p></p><p>The eunuch overseer followed closely, bowing the entire time, his face wearing a fawning smile. </p><p></p><p>But in his eyes, there was a hint of puzzlement. When did these particular sword and knife become part of the collection?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew the sword from its sheath, and immediately felt a fierce aura emanating from it. The cold sword light reflected on his face, giving off an intense chill.</p><p></p><p>The eunuch overseer couldn't help but take a step back, his expression filled with doubt. Since when did the treasury have such a sword?</p><p></p><p>This sword was clearly no ordinary weapon.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the sword in his hand, delighted. This sword was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be more than just a pure steel sword. As his inner qi surged, he felt a connection with the sword, as if he could infuse it with his energy.</p><p></p><p>With a hum, the sword's light grew even more fierce under the stimulation of his qi.</p><p></p><p>A treasure sword!</p><p></p><p>Sheathing the sword, Xu Yan did not return it to its place, but instead hung it at his waist. This sword, he would keep.</p><p></p><p>His gaze then turned to the knife.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out to pick it up, he was immediately struck by its weight. </p><p></p><p>"This is an incredibly heavy knife!"</p><p></p><p>Even the most skilled martial artists would likely struggle to wield this knife, unless they possessed superhuman strength.</p><p></p><p>He drew the knife from its sheath.</p><p></p><p>Like the sword, this knife also appeared to be no common weapon.</p><p></p><p>The thick blade had a blood-red vein running through the center, and the edge was as cold as ice, exuding a sharp, fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Keen Sense.</p><p></p><p>"Good blade!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself admiringly.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not like this heavy knife, since it was a precious blade, how could he not take it?</p><p></p><p>So he picked up the knife in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, if there's anything else you fancy, let me have someone pack it up and send it to your manor."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager hurriedly flattered with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look around some more!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to wander around the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>The imperial treasure vault was filled with a vast collection - jade, sculptures, calligraphy and paintings, all masterpieces from renowned artists, passed down through generations.</p><p></p><p>"As for the calligraphy and paintings, they're of no use to me, and I don't even like them, so I'll pass on those!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked over the collection of artworks, shaking his head, ready to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, although I don't care for them, my master might enjoy them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly thought of his master, who was an extraordinary recluse, and appreciating calligraphy and paintings was part of the lifestyle of such high-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his master would like them?</p><p></p><p>"And these jade carvings, luminous pearls... the medicinal herbs are naturally a must-have as well."</p><p></p><p>After another round in the treasure vault, he excluded some items that were merely decorative, without any real value.</p><p></p><p>"I've selected the items I want."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the eunuch manager.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, say the word and I'll have people come pack them up right away!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager heaved a sigh of relief, his face plastered with a fawning smile.</p><p></p><p>"This, this... these stones, they only have form but no function, I don't want them!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed at the stones that were merely decorative without any practical use, excluding them.</p><p></p><p>"Pack up and take away everything else!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Young Mas- Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager's smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>Take away everything else?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he supposed to just select a few items?</p><p></p><p>Those stones were items the previous emperor had liked, so they were placed in the treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>They were the only things in the entire vault that had no value.</p><p></p><p>Apart from those, he wanted to take away everything else?</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager was dumbfounded, carefully saying, "Young Master Xu, there are many treasures in this vault, accumulated over the years by the imperial family. Taking everything away..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave the eunuch manager a puzzled look and said, "Didn't the old Emperor Qi say I could take whatever I fancied? I fancy taking everything, can't I?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this..."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager was sweating nervously. How could he do that! The order was to take whatever you liked, not to clear out the entire vault!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the eunuch manager's hesitant expression, Xu Yan's brow furrowed as he said, "What, is the old Emperor Qi playing tricks on me? He said his words were as good as gold, that I could take whatever I liked, and now you won't let me take them?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you take me, Xu Yan, for?</p><p></p><p>"I thought the old Emperor Qi was a decent person, but now he dares to go back on his word in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's tone grew increasingly angry, ready to go find Emperor Qi and settle the score.</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager was so frightened he almost peed his pants, hastily explaining, "Young Master Xu, you've misunderstood. I meant that there are so many items here, packing them all up will take time, and I was worried it might inconvenience you..."</p><p></p><p>He quickly changed his words, for if he really went to find Emperor Qi and beat him up, his life would be over. And it would be a gruesome end!</p><p></p><p>The treasures were nothing, once the Emperor knew, he would surely allow it.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, have people come pack everything up, I can wait."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression softened.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I'll have people start packing it all up!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch manager ordered the staff to pack up all the items in the treasure vault, while also having someone report to Emperor Qi.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

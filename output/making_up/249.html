        <h1>Chapter 249</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sword formation was set up by him, so how could there be anything unusual about it?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his bald head, looking a bit gloomy. He carefully sensed it and indeed there was something unusual, as if he was enveloped by a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really just an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Even the eldest disciple said there was nothing unusual, so it was most likely just his own delusion, right?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. At this moment, the sword formation set up by Xu Yan had shrunk, only covering the area where Meng Chong was.</p><p></p><p>This made Meng Chong even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Why did the sense of danger keep growing stronger?</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was surrounded by danger, and the environment around him had become extremely perilous, as if he would be subjected to endless attacks at any moment! "Shidi, have you noticed anything unusual?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head gloomily, "A little bit. I feel a sense of danger, but that shouldn't be the case. Master is right beside us, and even if the Cultivated Celestials are watching, there shouldn't be any danger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded thoughtfully. Meng Chong was no ordinary martial artist after all, and although the sword formation was hidden, it was still detected by him. But since the Master was nearby, he didn't become vigilant.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the sword formation was withdrawn, enveloping Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Shimei, have you discovered anything?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was searching for a way to make the sword formation even more hidden and stealthy.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu furrowed her brows and said, "I don't know why, but I feel the surrounding plants and trees have become rather sharp and dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, and in a flash, the sword intent merged into the soil and even blended into the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, that feeling is gone, it's just... I feel something is a bit off."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a puzzled frown.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the eldest disciple, his mouth twitching. He seemed to have figured it out - the eldest disciple must be up to something!</p><p>"Eldest disciple, have you realized something?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The sword formation!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exhaled, and in a flash, the sword formation appeared. Looking at the sword-shaped formations, the plants, soil, and everything seemed ready to transform into sharp blades, and each sword formation was rotating in a special pattern.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's scalp immediately went numb. So this was the sword formation?</p><p></p><p>Previously at the Dai family, Xu Yan had displayed the might of the Heart Sword Realm, where all things in heaven and earth could become swords. However, the sword formation operated in a profound way, making the attacks even stronger and the killing power more formidable.</p><p></p><p>"With this sword formation, if I were to fight Dai Sheng again, I'm confident I can kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan withdrew the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the strength to slay a Cultivated Celestial in the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm about to break through, let me find a place to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the Master, Xu Yan turned and left. He was not far from reaching the Shen Yi Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go cultivate as well!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a sigh. The eldest disciple could now slay a Cultivated Celestial in the initial stage on his own, so he also had to work hard on his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had just comprehended a cultivation technique that could assist his practice, so he could try it out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong each found a place to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu, she did not leave, sitting beside Li Xuan, pouring tea for the Master while asking, "Master, how long will it take for my shidi to reach the initial stage?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Fang Hao in the valley and said, "The great momentum of heaven and earth is weakening, which means it is time for him to reach the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Lingxiu looked at the strange formation set up by Fang Hao. The spiritual energy in the mountains was still gathering and slowly rising, far from being weakened.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what realm will my shidi reach after entering the initial stage?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment. Fang Hao was originally a Grand Master martial artist, and by relying on the momentum of heaven and earth to rebuild his martial foundation, he had become an Esoteric Martial Artist. His starting point was not low.</p><p></p><p>"The Tong Xuan Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao would enter the Tong Xuan Realm upon reaching the initial stage! Normally, Esoteric Martial Artists would enter the Xian Tian Realm at the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Hao was the first Esoteric Martial Artist, and he already had a martial foundation, so his starting point would be higher.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, before reaching the initial stage, Esoteric Martial Artists also need to temper their bodies, strengthen their roots, and learn formations, strange realms, and the like. Only after completing these foundations can they meet the requirements for the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>"Although they can reach the initial stage directly, the cultivation before that is not necessarily faster than orthodox martial arts, physical martial arts, or alchemical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"If the talent is insufficient, it may even be slower than cultivating other martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently evaluated.</p><p></p><p>"After Fang Hao reaches the initial stage and receives the feedback from Esoteric Martial Arts, he will know the true cultivation path of Esoteric Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the momentum of heaven and earth began to weaken, and the treasures Fang Hao used to set up the strange formations of heaven and earth gradually showed cracks, almost reaching their limit.</p><p></p><p>"He's about to reach the initial stage, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quietly watched.</p><p></p><p>A few more days passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan revealed a smile. Fang Hao in the valley had become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual platform, the Great Dao Golden Book opened.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao, upon cultivating the Esoteric Martial Arts you created, has reached the initial stage of Esoteric Martial Arts, with strength a hundredfold of those at the same realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes slightly, the Esoteric Martial Arts technique appearing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>"You have created the fourth martial dao, and your Esoteric Martial Arts have reached the Shen Yi Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Esoteric Martial Arts had reached the Shen Yi Realm. Now the four martial daos were: the Shen Yuan Realm of orthodox martial arts, the Shen Yi Realm of physical martial arts, alchemy martial arts, and Esoteric Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao, in cultivating the Esoteric Martial Arts you created, has successfully refined a Heaven and Earth Esoteric Talisman. You have obtained a Xian Tian Esoteric Talisman."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mysterious esoteric talisman appeared on Li Xuan's bones.</p><p></p><p>"This!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat surprised. He never expected Fang Hao to use this as the entry point for Esoteric Martial Arts, and to successfully cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"I should have realized that for Esoteric Martial Artists to control formations, manipulate the great momentum of heaven and earth, and operate the strange realms of the Esoteric, they must use their own body as the core.</p><p></p><p>"And the only way to do this is to refine the Heaven and Earth Esoteric Talisman."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed deeply. The Esoteric Martial Arts had indeed taken an unconventional path, with a cultivation method completely different from the others.</p><p></p><p>This first Heaven and Earth Esoteric Talisman was just the foundation. The subsequent cultivation would be to refine the second, third, and more talismans within the body.</p><p></p><p>But each Heaven and Earth Esoteric Talisman needed to be cultivated to perfection before the next one could be refined.</p><p></p><p>Using the Heaven and Earth Esoteric Talismans to circulate true qi, true essence, divine will, and divine power... this would form the foundation of the martial dao, completely different from orthodox martial arts, physical martial arts, and alchemy martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This was the true embodiment of the unconventional Esoteric Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has comprehended the method of refining treasures, and your foundation in treasure refining is now complete."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has comprehended the method of formations, and your foundation in formations is now complete."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has mastered the principles of the restrictive formations, and your foundation in restrictive formations is complete."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has mastered the mysteries of the Heaven and Earth Bizarre Formations, and you have grasped the Thirty-Six Bizarre Formations."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Scriptures kept providing feedback one after another.</p><p></p><p>The branches of the Bizarre Martial Dao, formations, forging of weapons, restrictive formations, and bizarre formations were all fed back one by one.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just the completion of the foundations, Li Xuan was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to pass these foundations on to Fang Hao, just like how he had done with Su Ling Xiu before, to shorten Fang Hao's comprehension time and allow him to attain higher levels of feedback more quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just the foundations, they are very strong!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath and stepped out, and suddenly, a bizarre formation appeared. The great momentum of Heaven and Earth seemed to have been triggered by him.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre formations of Heaven and Earth, while similar to formations in some aspects, are vastly different from them. This is the unique characteristic of the Bizarre Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the momentum of Heaven and Earth as the main focus, utilizing the terrain and landforms to set up formations, a bizarre formation can be established in just a single step.</p><p></p><p>This is one of the offensive methods of the Bizarre Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for formations, they require the arrangement of external objects.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when formations are combined with bizarre formations, the profundity becomes extraordinary, and the killing power is even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I have already mastered all the thirty-six formations I created, including the nine great formations, but they are all just the foundations and have not been able to fully unleash the power of the great formations.</p><p></p><p>"For example, the transportation formation. With my current formation skills, the transportation formation I set up can only transport people for a few dozen miles, which is too short and seems useless.</p><p></p><p>"But these smaller formations are more practical."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Fang Hao in the valley, he was consolidating his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Fang Hao came out of the valley, excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have successfully entered the door!"</p><p></p><p>The Bizarre Martial Dao is truly powerful beyond measure! Fang Hao's mouth could not close due to his excitement.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, it seemed as if there was a mysterious momentum spreading from the ground, and in an instant, a formation was formed.</p><p></p><p>Being trapped in the formation, one's will was not their own!</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu raised her eyebrows. As a Spiritual Perception Realm cultivator, Fang Hao's bizarre formation could not affect her, but she was secretly astonished.</p><p></p><p>So this is the bizarre formation?</p><p></p><p>Her aura surged, and with a stomp of her foot, a burst of true essence power instantly gushed out, striking the weak point of the bizarre formation.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The spreading bizarre formation was instantly shattered, and Fang Hao stumbled, almost falling.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu smiled and said, "Junior brother, you are still too weak. Trying to surpass your senior sister is just a dream. You might be able to deal with other cultivators in the Spirit Realm, but you are still far from being able to handle your senior sister!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled awkwardly and scratched his head, saying, "I thought Sister wouldn't notice."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, and the Red Cat heard it and immediately left.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan turned around, Su Ling Xiu and Fang Hao suddenly felt the scene in front of them change, and their bodies lost control, spinning and tumbling, losing all sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the bizarre formation of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was secretly astonished.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly felt a little depressed. If she and her junior brother were at the same cultivation level, it seems that her strength would not be as great as her junior brother's!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan retracted the bizarre formation of Heaven and Earth, and a smile appeared on his face. With a single thought, the innate bizarre patterns on him activated, gathering the momentum for himself and drawing the enemy into the formation.</p><p></p><p>"The bizarre formations of Heaven and Earth are truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan also understood that while the Bizarre Martial Dao is powerful, it may not necessarily have an advantage against cultivators like Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword dao is unparalleled in its lethality and can likely tear apart any formation or array. Meng Chong's Titan Martial Dao, with its ability to become a giant, also possesses overwhelming strength.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Hao's Bizarre Martial Dao also has its own unique strengths, and most cultivators in the Spirit Realm would be crushed when facing it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, how powerful the Bizarre Martial Dao becomes and how Fang Hao cultivates it will depend on Fang Hao himself.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has entered the door, he should consider how to use the Bizarre Martial Dao to strengthen himself, such as formations, forging of weapons, and restrictive formations.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before Fang Hao's mastery of formations and his unique forging techniques will shake the entire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong have both left to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Although the two of them are being pursued by the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu Clan, Li Xuan is not worried about their safety.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan is refining his sword formations, perfecting them, and preparing to break through to the small success of the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong should have found a treasure land and is cultivating the Indestructible Golden Body technique, supplementing the cultivation of his Unbreakable Golden Body, which Li Xuan can sense is slowly improving along with Meng Chong's progress.</p><p></p><p>Back in the manor, Li Xuan sat down in the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have entered the door, you should memorize these Thirty-Six Formations as a foundation, and then diligently research the Dao of formations."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan depicted the diagrams of the Thirty-Six Formations.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Fang Hao responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Bizarre Martial Dao, it was much easier for Fang Hao to memorize the formation diagrams, and he was able to remember all the Thirty-Six Formations without any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>"These are the Thirty-Six Bizarre Formations. You should also use them as a foundation and ponder them deeply, so that I hope you can forge your own unique path in the Bizarre Martial Dao, rather than being confined by the old footsteps."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He also passed on the Thirty-Six Bizarre Formations of Heaven and Earth to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>As for when Fang Hao would be able to fully grasp them and extend them to create more Heaven and Earth Bizarre Formations, Li Xuan could not control. It all depended on Fang Hao himself.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Fang Hao responded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Forge your own unique path in the Bizarre Martial Dao, rather than being confined by the old footsteps." This manor, you can set up formations in it as practice. You can also refine the tools for formation deployment to hone your forging techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely not disappoint you, Master!" Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and continued, "Although you are only at the Penetrating Mysteries Realm, the strength of a Bizarre Martial Dao cultivator lies in the bizarre formations of Heaven and Earth, in formations, and in restrictive formations.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful Bizarre Martial Dao cultivator, with proper preparation and formation deployment, can easily surpass their opponents.</p><p></p><p>"You can set up a formation that can restrain Cultivators at the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators are not weak, but when suddenly faced with an unfamiliar formation, they would be rendered helpless and unable to act freely.</p><p></p><p>With Fang Hao's current strength, setting up a formation that can slay Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators might be a bit difficult. </p><p></p><p>However, restraining them for a period of time is possible. Even powerful Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators, when trapped in a formation, would have to be cautious and dare not attack recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the spiritual perception power of the soul is not as strong as the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will definitely set up a formation that can restrain Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to surpass the two senior brothers and attack the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators!</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

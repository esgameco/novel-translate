        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance from Leizhou State retreated, and the Wanshi Alliance from Qianwu State was also defeated. In Qingzhou, the Yuling Palace even used a divine Yuling artifact to slay a super sixth-rank spiritual beast, powerfully crushing the spiritual beast and driving it back to the great mountains of Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance of Qingzhou was defeated, and the strongest members suffered heavy blows. It was not until the Alliance Master Tan Wenlin personally intervened that the situation was stabilized, and they withdrew from Qingzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Lords from various states also displayed their formidable strength. The originally disadvantageous situation was instantly reversed, and they regained control over vast territories.</p><p></p><p>However, Chenzhou had already fallen under the control of the Wanshi Alliance, and the Wanshi Alliance also occupied a foothold in the other states.</p><p></p><p>The two sides entered a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>On the border of the Luozhou, Ao Chong Dynasty, the mighty expert Changda Niu was engaged in a fierce battle with the powerful cultivators from the Leizhou Mountain Villa. The two sides were evenly matched, and they were old acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>"You remnants of the Wanxing Sect, do you really think you can make a comeback?" the Leizhou Mountain Villa expert said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxing Martial Institute will not make a comeback, but the Wanshi Alliance will certainly occupy a place. The era of your Spiritual Lords dominating the Spiritual Realm is coming to an end!" Changda Niu sneered.</p><p></p><p>Chenzhou had already fallen under the control of the Wanshi Alliance. Except for the states directly under the Transcendent Spiritual Lords, the Wanshi Alliance had a foothold in the other states. The situation of the Spiritual Lords' complete dominance had changed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you really think you can have your way? The foundation of my Spiritual Lords is something you lowly scattered cultivators cannot fathom. Even if you unite with the Sea Spirit Clan and the Spiritual Beast Clan, what can you do?</p><p></p><p>"This Spiritual Realm ultimately belongs to us, the Spiritual Lords."</p><p></p><p>Changda Niu laughed arrogantly, "Is that so? Then let's see what your Spiritual Lords are truly capable of. The new order of this Spiritual Realm has already been determined, and the scattered cultivators will also have a place!"</p><p></p><p>The two sides continued to engage in fierce battles. Changda Niu's dual hammers thundered down, while the Leizhou Mountain Villa expert wielded hammers surrounded by lightning.</p><p></p><p>The two mighty experts collided with overwhelming might, causing the onlookers to tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>This was the true power of the strongest experts.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Spiritual Realm, five figures stood amidst the clouds, seemingly exuding the profound principles of heaven and earth. Although they did not display overwhelming auras, it was as if the great powers of the cosmos were gathered around them.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master, the Yuling Palace Master, and the Leizhou Mountain Villa Master, the three Transcendent Spiritual Lords, were now glaring coldly at the two figures below.</p><p></p><p>"Prefect Fu, are you willing to degrade yourself and stand with this lowly scattered cultivator?" the Qianwu Palace Master asked the man with the Bihai Spirit Pearl in his hair, holding a folding fan and appearing innocent.</p><p></p><p>Prefect Fu sighed with resignation, "I have no choice. I was tricked by this scoundrel once and owe him a favor, so I have to help him.</p><p></p><p>"You three, please don't get too worked up. Can't you see that neither Dazhou nor Taimei have come to help?"</p><p></p><p>Turning to the man beside him, who held a ruler and a book, looking like a scholarly gentleman, Prefect Fu continued, "You see this Bihai Spirit Pearl on my head? I've always wanted to use it to tie my hair, but I couldn't figure out how to make a hole in it.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow said he could help me, and I didn't believe him, so I took a gamble. Turns out he really did it.</p><p></p><p>"You all know I, Fu Tianhai, am a man of my word, so I have no choice but to help him."</p><p></p><p>The three Transcendent Spiritual Lords' expressions were extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The man beside Prefect Fu, who looked like a scholarly gentleman holding a ruler and a book, was none other than the legendary figure, the Dean of the Wanxing Martial Institute.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Spiritual Realm from the Inner Realm and taking charge of the Wanxing Martial Institute, he had elevated its strength to a level comparable to the Transcendent Spiritual Lords.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that he was the teacher of the Blood Demon Patriarch during the latter's first rise to power.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been defeated and wiped out from the Eighteen States by the geniuses of the Wanxing Martial Institute, he had somehow survived.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan, do you think bringing Prefect Fu will allow you to stand against us?" the Leizhou Mountain Villa Master stepped forward, lightning energy swirling around him, and the Leizhou Pearl in his hand glowing with blue lightning.</p><p></p><p>The Yuling Palace Master chuckled, "Prefect Fu, I understand your predicament, so you and I will not interfere. Let them three fight it out."</p><p></p><p>Prefect Fu smiled and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master wielded a sword, its icy aura enveloping the blade, and said coldly, "Wu Tiannan, when my senior uncle struck you before, I thought you would either die or be crippled. I never expected you to still be alive.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're seeking death, I'll grant your wish today!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, however, smiled calmly, putting away his book and gripping the ruler in his hand, showing no anger or retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Among the Transcendent Spiritual Lords in the Spiritual Realm, the Qianwu Palace is the most shameless. Your senior uncle not only ambushed me but also secretly bribed those around me.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that the Wanxing Martial Institute is gone. I can now lay down one of my responsibilities."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan lightly tapped his left palm with the ruler, the sound echoing in the sky above. Facing the two mighty Transcendent Spiritual Lords, he showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was pensive, as if reminiscing about the past.</p><p></p><p>"I was born in a small mountain village in the Tiannan Prefecture of the Inner Realm. I had no martial arts skills and had never been exposed to the martial dao. My parents passed away early, and I was a lonely, impoverished wanderer.</p><p></p><p>"The villagers called me 'little stray dog', and I didn't even have a name.</p><p></p><p>"Until the year I turned eight, a heavenly sister-like figure, severely injured and being pursued, fled to our village. I hid her in the cellar and erased the traces of her presence, tricking the pursuers away..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan recounted his childhood memories, speaking slowly.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master and the Leizhou Mountain Villa Master did not rush to attack, but instead listened quietly, also curious about Wu Tiannan's background, as he was a legendary figure.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan continued, "...The beautiful sister was badly injured, but she had medicine and was able to recover. That was when I first encountered the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"She taught me martial arts techniques, and I found them very simple, quickly mastering them. The sister was amazed by my talent and, after her wounds healed, began guiding my martial cultivation in the small mountain village. By the time I was sixteen, I had already reached the level of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I would always be by the sister's side, but she ultimately left, telling me to enter the Spiritual Realm and join the Wanxing Martial Institute.</p><p></p><p>"Before she left, she gave me a name - Wu Tiannan!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy, spreading the martial arts, delving into the martial arts..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, the founder of the Seven Star Academy, was a legendary figure of his time. After arriving in the Spiritual Realm, he joined the Myriad Star Martial Arts Institute, which became the Spiritual Realm branch of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>The previous dean, due to his old injuries, had a greatly diminished lifespan and passed away twenty years after Wu Tiannan joined the Myriad Star Institute.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his powerful abilities and outstanding prestige, Wu Tiannan succeeded the position of dean, continuing his martial arts aspirations and spreading the martial arts in the Spiritual Realm. Under his leadership, the Myriad Star Martial Arts Institute rose rapidly, producing countless geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"...Blood Spirit Child was an accident, it was you Spiritual Clan families who drove him to madness."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Wu Tiannan sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall masters frowned, not quite understanding why Wu Tiannan was recounting his origins and rise to prominence. The Lord of the Spiritual府suddenly frowned and said in a deep voice, "Your martial arts destiny came from that woman, and it was she who pointed you towards the Myriad Star Martial Arts Institute."</p><p></p><p>"Where has she gone?" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan smiled brightly and said, "I don't know, there's no trace of her in the Spiritual Realm, I've been searching for my sister all this time."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the three with deep meaning and said, "That bridge, it's about to appear, isn't it? Or do you have the ability to make that bridge appear?"</p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall masters were stunned, their expressions turning cold and murderous intent surging.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Tianhai, how dare you reveal this secret matter to him?"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord angrily looked at Fu Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai rolled his eyes, with an innocent look, "I, Fu Tianhai, am not an idiot, how could I possibly reveal such a secret matter to him? How he knows, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall master raised his sword, emanating a murderous aura, "Wu Tiannan, you must die today, and the Myriad World Alliance must be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor Lord also erupted with powerful energy, thunderous rumbles. The Lord of the Spiritual府waved his hand, and a spiritual beast swiftly departed into the distant clouds.</p><p></p><p>"So this is your Spiritual Clan's secret, only grasped by your transcendent Spiritual Clan."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan smiled, then his expression suddenly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Arts Institute no longer exists in the Eighteen Provinces, I have only one purpose in my life - to ascend that divine bridge and see if the one I'm looking for is there. </p><p>Who dares to obstruct me, who has the qualifications to obstruct me! Although the Myriad World Alliance was not founded by me, Wenlin is still my disciple, so today I will fight for the Myriad World Alliance's place!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the talisman in Wu Tiannan's hand radiated a vast and mighty light.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, between heaven and earth, nine profound auras suddenly descended, surrounding Wu Tiannan. His aura directly suppressed the three supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>"This...how is this possible!" </p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall masters were greatly shocked, staring in horror at Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>The nine profound auras radiated a faint light, containing the profoundest truths of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai was also greatly shocked, looking in awe at how powerful Wu Tiannan had become.</p><p></p><p>"What's impossible about it? I have reached the pinnacle of the Spiritual Realm's martial arts, just watch if I have the qualifications to fight for the Myriad World Alliance's place, if I have the qualifications to ascend that divine bridge!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan waved his talisman, unleashing a mighty radiance to fight the three supreme experts alone.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, a fierce battle erupted, the three Thousand Martial Hall masters wielding divine artifacts, joining forces to resist Wu Tiannan, yet still found themselves at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>The three were surrounded by five profound auras, one less than Wu Tiannan's, the disparity in strength evident.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out the essence of your transcendent Spiritual Clan, let's see if I, Wu Tiannan, can withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's expression was cold and aloof, with an aura of decisiveness amidst his refined demeanor.</p><p></p><p>As he wielded the talisman, he pushed the three Thousand Martial Hall masters back step by step.</p><p></p><p>"Why must we resort to such drastic measures?"</p><p></p><p>A sigh echoed.</p><p></p><p>Dream-like flowers drifted down, a dreamlike power surging forth, blocking Wu Tiannan's attacks.</p><p></p><p>A figure shrouded in a dreamlike haze slowly approached, her beauty transcendent and unparalleled, though her features were indistinct.</p><p></p><p>Nine profound auras surrounded her.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan retracted his talisman, looking at the newcomer with a calm expression tinged with complexity.</p><p></p><p>"No more debts, no more favors, from now on I am my own. Heart like a dream, person like a dream, Tai Xiao Xin Meng Rou, I didn't expect you to have reached this level."</p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall masters, while still shocked, also felt relieved. Tai Xiao Xin Meng Rou had reached this level of strength, not inferior to Wu Tiannan.</p><p>The Spiritual Clan still held the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan knows the secret of the divine bridge, we cannot let him live, and the Myriad World Alliance must also be destroyed. Elder Xin, let us join forces to slay Wu Tiannan!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall master spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>But Xin Meng Rou did not heed him, instead quietly gazing at Wu Tiannan, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's expression was calm, with complexity and a hint of sorrow in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The carefree and lively girl he once knew, who used to trick him into teaching her martial arts secrets - but the vicissitudes of life had completely changed her.</p><p></p><p>"I went to the Inner Realm, killed him, buried him, and repaid the gratitude of one who saved me. I even bore a daughter for him.</p><p></p><p>In this world, I owe no one any favors or gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, perhaps I still owe the Martial Arts Institute something, like the martial arts secrets you taught me, the principles of the martial arts you imparted.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Clan has its own rules, and since you know something of the divine bridge's secret, then so be it.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the Myriad World Alliance and the Spiritual Clan can come to an end. Continuing to fight would only result in more deaths.</p><p></p><p>Let's continue the battle according to the rules of the Genius Confrontation, I believe with you here, the Spiritual Clan will not dare to break the rules."</p><p></p><p>Xin Meng Rou's voice was soft and dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed, cupping his hands in a salute, without saying anything further. Blood Spirit Child had ultimately died, killed by Xin Meng Rou's hand.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall master grew anxious, "Elder Xin, this is the Spiritual Clan's secret, how can you let an outsider know? The Myriad World Alliance must be destroyed, the Genius Confrontation is just a joke, what geniuses can scattered cultivators produce?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Meng Rou looked back at him and said, "If you are dissatisfied, you can fight the Martial Arts Institute's dean. If you win, then it shall be as you wish."</p><p></p><p>"I...!" </p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall master opened his mouth but could not say anything.</p><p></p><p>"There is no rule that only those of the Spiritual Clan can ascend the divine bridge, it's just that the Spiritual Clan has monopolized it. If you can kill the Martial Arts Institute's dean, then everything will remain the same. </p><p>If you cannot, and the Martial Arts Institute's dean ascends the bridge, so be it. If you wish to bring the divine bridge down, that is up to you, I, Tai Xiao, will not participate."</p><p></p><p>Xin Meng Rou finished speaking and her dreamlike figure drifted away.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

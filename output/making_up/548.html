        <h1>Chapter 548</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the great mountains beyond Hong Ze's realm, Cang Hai Turtle was waiting for Xu Yan and the other three to return, while remaining vigilant of his surroundings, ready to send a message at any time.</p><p></p><p>This area, influenced by Hong Ze's realm, had an added darkness amidst the chaos, and was deathly silent with no true spirits to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit uncomfortable staying here," Cang Hai Turtle sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, when he looked towards Hong Ze's realm, his heart was still trembling, though the feeling of fear had diminished somewhat compared to initially.</p><p></p><p>"I must overcome this fear!" </p><p></p><p>Cang Hai Turtle gritted his teeth and stared at Hong Ze's realm, wanting to use this to overcome the fear deep in his heart. Even if he couldn't completely eliminate the shadow in his heart, being able to reduce the fear would be great progress.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Cang Hai Turtle gradually became delighted. The longer he stared, the more accustomed he became, and the fear in his heart kept diminishing.</p><p></p><p>"How much time has passed?" Cang Hai Turtle pondered. Had it been half a month since Xu Yan and the other three entered Hong Ze's realm?</p><p></p><p>"In the blink of an eye, so much time has passed? Why haven't they returned yet? I hope nothing has happened."</p><p></p><p>Cang Hai Turtle took out a communication talisman, preparing to send a message to inquire, but then thought, "If they are in the middle of comprehending something, wouldn't my message now be a disturbance? Besides, Xu Yan and the others are disciples of that person, they shouldn't be in any danger."</p><p></p><p>That person was an existence who could casually crush a true spirit comparable to a realm lord. In terms of strength, he was definitely not below the one from the Immutable Palace, and should be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue waiting. If they've really found an opportunity, they won't be able to return so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Cang Hai Turtle continued to work on overcoming his inner fear.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Immutable Land, a huge true spirit was galloping, with three figures sitting on its back.</p><p></p><p>These three figures were different from ordinary martial artists, lacking some spiritual aura but with an added gloominess, as if they had never lived within the realms.</p><p></p><p>The three wore gray robes with the outline of a palace embroidered on the chest.</p><p></p><p>"What use is a dead realm? Why are we looking for it?" one of them asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"We just need to complete the mission. As for what use a dead realm has, that's the business of the important figures," another shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>The third person spoke in a deep voice: "The four people and one turtle we encountered were living beings from a realm. They're probably here for this dead realm too. If we can find the dead realm, we can also capture those four people and one turtle."</p><p></p><p>The first person who spoke asked confusedly: "Can people from the Tai Cang Realm actually leave their realm and have the leisure to search for the dead Hong Ze Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Since they were living beings from a realm, there was no other realm besides the Tai Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>When they accepted the mission to search for the dead Hong Ze Realm, they had already learned that the Netherworld Realm had been refined by that Blood Prison Guardian, though it originally belonged to him anyway.</p><p></p><p>As for the Demon Shaman Realm, it had also disappeared, crashing into the Tai Cang Realm, seemingly causing no small disaster for the Tai Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, how could martial artists from the Tai Cang Realm have the leisure to search for the dead Hong Ze Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Tai Cang Realm, after being hit by the Demon Shaman Realm, has developed a major problem, and they want to find the dead Hong Ze Realm to fill this gap?" the third person said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The three continued riding the true spirit, searching for the Hong Ze Realm in the Immutable Land.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tai Cang Realm, that was the business of important figures. They could only follow orders.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A great mountain shook, and a terrifying aura spread out from within. The true spirits near the mountain were immediately frightened, their bodies trembling as they turned and fled, moving away from that mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that mountain had an aura that made them tremble.</p><p></p><p>The groups of true spirits were fleeing, with constant cries ringing out. Even powerful true spirits trampled and collided with weaker ones as they fled. In just a short time, over a dozen weak true spirits were killed by being trampled or struck during this escape.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, you've only just realized? Too late!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness Realm is fake? My soul fragment that descended actually came to the Tai Cang Realm, and nothing unusual happened?!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness is not fake!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop trying to deceive me. The Great Wilderness is fake, and the Dao Ancestor is also fake!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, I've already said, the Great Wilderness is not fake. Tai Cang is already history. Now it's the Great Wilderness, called the Great Wilderness Realm. The Dao Ancestor is of course real. How could you fathom the Dao Ancestor's power? The reason you can't destroy me is precisely because the Dao Ancestor bestowed upon me a strand of opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"Fine, very well. You dare to plot against me, you dare to covet my power. Let's see what abilities you have!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, don't you already know what abilities I have?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the mountain, after a long struggle, Blood Demon finally understood that what he had drawn back was not his own soul fragment! No, to be precise, this soul fragment had undergone some change and had been usurped by an outsider.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party intended to usurp his power and wanted to replace him! At this moment, Blood Demon knew that some unknown change had occurred in the Tai Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see how you'll replace me!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was furious, but he had to admit that he couldn't do anything to the other party.</p><p></p><p>From the initial misjudgment, he had missed the opportunity and let the other party gain the upper hand. After the other party had stolen half of his body, it was destined that he couldn't suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this soul fragment was very strange. It had a quality that was of the same origin as himself and wouldn't be rejected by his laws, yet it wasn't under his control, and some secret techniques were ineffective against it.</p><p></p><p>The power of that mysterious "Dao Ancestor" was truly strong and inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>He was a realm lord, after all! </p><p></p><p>"Just because I can't do anything to you doesn't mean no one can!"</p><p></p><p>Blood light surged on Blood Demon's body as the blood pool disappeared. He prepared to return to the Immutable Palace to ask that person to take action and suppress the unknown soul in his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, you can't make that decision."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme laughed wickedly. Blood Demon stepped forward with one foot, but the other foot stepped backward in the opposite direction. As a result, Blood Demon's body did a split and sat on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme laughed arrogantly, controlling the hand he possessed and raising it up, then slamming it towards the other hand that Blood Demon controlled, as if wanting to break Blood Demon's hand.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wasn't his own body, so he didn't care at all!</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was furious, blood light surging on his body as he entered into another struggle for control of the body. As a result, Blood Demon's body rolled back and forth in the mountain, as if he was fighting with himself.</p><p></p><p>"You've already lost your chance. Now we share control of the body. You can't expel me, and I can't devour you for now. We should have a talk and reach some agreements, shouldn't we?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme smiled very happily.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't succeeded in replacing Blood Demon and couldn't control all of Blood Demon's power and body, he had still occupied half.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...which could be considered half successful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the advantage was on his side. The longer this dragged on, the more beneficial it was for him.</p><p></p><p>He was secretly carrying out the "soul planting" plan. Once the soul planting was complete, even if Blood Demon found outside help, he wouldn't be able to remove him, unless Blood Demon was willing to give up half of his divine soul, half of his power, and half of his body.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Blood Demon was unwilling to give up half of his power. In that case, Blood Demon wouldn't think about seeking outside help and would have to sit down and negotiate properly.</p><p></p><p>In the future, they could take turns controlling the power and being the master.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to Blood Demon's body and divine soul having two conscious entities, both independent and able to control the body, with neither able to do anything about the other.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was temporarily satisfied with this situation. Although he wasn't the complete master of heaven and earth, he could still take turns being the master, which was worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still had opportunities. For example, if the Immutable Temple went to war with the Great Wilderness, he could borrow outside forces to completely replace Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>However, before that, he needed to stabilize Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about it!" Blood Demon said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's continue to split," Blood Extreme said, controlling half of the body and struggling against Blood Demon. For a moment, Blood Demon's body assumed various strange postures, even twisting directly in various ways.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, this is your body. If you don't cherish it, I don't care either!" Blood Extreme laughed evilly.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was about to go mad with anger. What was this thing? It was too hateful.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you feel uncomfortable?" Blood Demon asked through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all. What's this little pain to me? Come on, you're the mighty Blood Demon, can't you endure even this little pain?" Blood Extreme said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>This so-called pain was far inferior compared to when he had voluntarily let Su Lingxiu research and create soul torment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his soul had been refined. In order to be able to endure stronger pain, he had been refined in a fully conscious state.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's research on souls had reached an extremely deep level, lowering the pain sensitivity of his soul, so this little pain was nothing to Blood Extreme!</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was speechless for a moment, but he also became desperate and said, "You're forcing me to do this!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed a crazy look, and blood-colored flames appeared in his soul, enveloping the entire soul.</p><p></p><p>"You're going this far?" Blood Extreme said with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I'll fight you to the death!" Blood Demon growled. The blood-colored flames burned, and in an instant, Blood Demon's face became hideous and distorted as he endured intense pain. In the end, he even let out screams of agony.</p><p></p><p>He, the mighty master of heaven and earth, had been forced to this point! Self-immolation of the soul!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use this method to burn Blood Extreme out, to expel Blood Extreme, even if it meant damaging his soul, even if it meant suffering cruel torture. It was worth it!</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, it's a bit spicy. I feel like my whole body has been smeared with chili water. It has a kind of burning sensation!" As a result, Blood Extreme remained calm, his face not distorted, and no screams came out. He just sighed that it felt a bit spicy!</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's mental state nearly collapsed! "How come you're fine?" Blood Demon asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had even self-immolated his soul, yet he couldn't expel the other party. Moreover, it seemed that he himself was suffering more damage.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the other party couldn't feel the pain of the soul?</p><p></p><p>"This is nothing, it doesn't count for much. Mere soul burning, I advise you not to continue. You're just wasting your soul. If your strength decreases because of this, that wouldn't be good. Don't think you can use this method to expel me, it's useless. I have a trace of the Dao Ancestor's power protecting me. Even if you're the master of heaven and earth, you can't do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme felt heartache at Blood Demon's actions, as if the soul burning was consuming his own power.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon couldn't continue the soul burning. He was completely at a loss now.</p><p></p><p>Even after using his last, desperate measure, all he got in return was suffering the pain of soul burning for nothing!</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Dao Ancestor?" At this moment, Blood Demon's expression became solemn. That mysterious Dao Ancestor must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Is it someone from the Jade Court?" Blood Demon's expression became extremely heavy.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's heart skipped a beat. Jade Court?</p><p></p><p>"Is it another force in the Immutable Land besides the Immutable Temple? And it has a somewhat hostile relationship with the Immutable Temple?" Blood Extreme was secretly delighted, there was an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>Jade Court!</p><p></p><p>"Jade Court? What's that? The mere Jade Court isn't even worthy of licking the Dao Ancestor's shoes!" Blood Extreme said with confusion and contempt.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's gaze was cold and sharp. "Besides the Jade Court, there can't be any other existence with such power!"</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Blood Demon calmed down and said solemnly, "Tell me, what does the Jade Court want to do?"</p><p></p><p>"You know about the Jade Court? Then tell me about it. You should know that not everyone has the right to negotiate." Blood Extreme went with the flow and said pensively.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon stared at him, and after a long while, he said, "I don't know much about the Jade Court either. You're from Taicang, you can't possibly know about the Jade Court. Let's talk. The existence of the Jade Court going to Taicang might not be a good thing!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's talk," Blood Extreme nodded after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Court was a mysterious force that even Blood Demon didn't understand. Perhaps Taicang had been able to survive until now because of the conflict between that person from the Immutable Temple and the Jade Court?</p><p></p><p>"Is the Dao Ancestor from the Jade Court?" Blood Extreme was also somewhat confused, but the Dao Ancestor clearly had no ill intentions towards the Taicang world. As for Taicang becoming the Great Wilderness, although the world had changed, the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao was the orthodox successor of Taicang, the true inheritor.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor was clearly enhancing the Great Wilderness world, trying to save Taicang from facing a crisis. From this perspective, it seemed unrelated to the Jade Court.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find an opportunity to send a message back to the Master about this mysterious Jade Court force," Blood Extreme muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the mysterious Dao Ancestor, including Taihe, Taikun, Ao Lie, Meiwu, and others, they absolutely didn't know about the existence of the Jade Court. Even the original Seven of Taicang obviously didn't know.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Immutable Temple and the Jade Court, are there any other forces?" The more Blood Extreme thought about it, the deeper he felt the waters of the boundless Immutable Land were.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Great Worlds seemed powerful and long-standing, but compared to the Immutable Temple and the Jade Court, they seemed too naive.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't unfair to lose! Blood Extreme sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me your purpose," Blood Demon said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"My purpose is simple, to replace you!" Blood Extreme rolled his eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon gritted his teeth and said solemnly, "Wanting to replace me is impossible. Give up that idea."</p><p></p><p>"So, now we should talk. You and I are inseparable now. Continuing to fight each other and twist the body isn't going to solve anything," Blood Extreme said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

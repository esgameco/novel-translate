        <h1>Chapter 451</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hearing Meng Chong's intentions, Du Yuan became puzzled. Looking for martial artists from the Spirit Realm? The Great Zhou Kingdom of the Spirit Realm was a subordinate power of the Great Yan Dynasty, and would send spirit body prodigies to the Great Yan Dynasty at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>Spirit body prodigies were also top-tier talents in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was said that due to certain factors, although spiritual energy was scarce in the Spirit Realm and the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth were not very active, with a low upper limit for martial arts, spirit body prodigies would still appear there.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that this was the origin of the name "Spirit Realm".</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan did not know the secrets behind this, but prodigies from the Spirit Realm had also broken through to become Immortal Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The strongest among them, and the greatest backer of martial artists from the Spirit Realm, was the Marquis of Dongyang, whose strength was extremely powerful and who was a top existence even among Immortal Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Marquis of Dongyang, Xiang Zhen, had a thunder spirit body, and thus possessed extremely powerful offensive abilities that were tyrannical beyond compare.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was actually looking for prodigies from the Spirit Realm - could it be that he had a grudge against the Marquis of Dongyang? Thinking of this, Du Yuan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>He cautiously asked, "Brother Meng, if I may ask, do you have a grudge against the Marquis of Dongyang?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is the Marquis of Dongyang?" Meng Chong raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of Dongyang, Xiang Zhen," Du Yuan added, fearing Meng Chong might not know the Marquis of Dongyang's name.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know, don't recognize him!" Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Yuan felt slightly relieved, and asked again, "Then may I ask, what business do you have with martial artists from the Spirit Realm, Brother Meng?"</p><p></p><p>"You're asking too much. You just need to tell me where they are," Meng Chong said, displeased.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "Don't worry, I'm not going to kill anyone." He was afraid Du Yuan might misunderstand and cause unnecessary conflict.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Yuan immediately felt relieved. As long as he wasn't going to kill anyone, things would be much easier to handle.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists from the Spirit Realm are mostly gathered in Dongyang Prefecture. The Dongyang Martial Academy is responsible for recruiting prodigies from the Spirit Realm. Brother Meng can go to Dongyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much!" Having obtained the information he wanted, Meng Chong didn't linger. He cupped his hands in farewell.</p><p></p><p>Watching Meng Chong's figure disappear, Du Yuan pondered for a moment, feeling somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"If Meng Chong is going to cause trouble for the Spirit Realm martial artists, and I provided the information, how could the Marquis of Dongyang let it go if he found out? I would surely be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan decided to pass the information to the Marquis of Dongyang, Xiang Zhen.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he should also report Meng Chong's matter to the Great Yan Emperor. After all, such a dangerous person entering Great Yan territory could easily cause big trouble if not handled carefully.</p><p></p><p>Besides, the Great Yan royal family was also one of the behind-the-scenes forces of the Myriad Treasures Alliance. He must report to the Great Yan Emperor that Meng Chong alone had killed sixteen Immortal Celestial Lords of the Myriad Treasures Alliance. If they were to take action against Meng Chong, they would have to carefully consider whether it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current losses of the Myriad Treasures Alliance had not implicated the Great Yan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Provoking Meng Chong without reason would be unwise.</p><p></p><p>Dongyang Prefecture was far from Biannan Prefecture, and Meng Chong was not hurrying to Dongyang Prefecture. Instead, he was traveling leisurely, enjoying the scenery of the Great Yan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong even went to a Myriad Treasures Alliance branch in a certain prefecture city of the Great Yan Dynasty to buy some treasures as gifts for Zi Yun.</p><p></p><p>He specifically chose good-looking items.</p><p></p><p>As for the spirit crystals and such needed for the purchases, they were all looted from the Myriad Treasures Alliance, with the marks still not erased.</p><p></p><p>Too arrogant, too reckless, this was simply not taking the Myriad Treasures Alliance seriously at all. This was directly coming to their door to slap their face!</p><p></p><p>This was going too far!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Meng, how about I give you a 40% discount?" The shopkeeper of the Myriad Treasures Alliance was screaming furiously in his heart, but his face wore a smile reserved for honored guests.</p><p></p><p>This person was dangerous. If not treated well, he might directly loot the branch. It was something he was capable of doing.</p><p></p><p>"Our Myriad Treasures Alliance branch belongs to the Great Yan royal family and is somewhat different from the Myriad Treasures Alliance branches in other realms," the shopkeeper hurriedly added.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Meng Chong might not know the difference and loot this Myriad Treasures Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so this is Great Yan's Myriad Treasures Alliance. Well then, that's fine, that's fine!" Meng Chong's face showed a look of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the shopkeeper's heart trembled. Had this person really been thinking of looting just now? Fortunately, he was quick-witted and quickly distanced themselves from the Myriad Treasures Alliance branches in other realms.</p><p></p><p>Dongyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Dongyang, the Principal of Dongyang Martial Academy, and several other Immortal Celestial Lords of Dongyang Prefecture suddenly gathered at the prefect's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The renowned Marquis of Dongyang, Xiang Zhen, had quietly returned to Dongyang Prefecture on this day.</p><p></p><p>"Why has the Marquis summoned us?" the Principal of Dongyang Martial Academy asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the head, a middle-aged man with a burly build and an imposing presence even without anger, now spoke with a serious expression, "You all know about this Divine God Meng Chong, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Dongyang and other powerful figures were stunned, not understanding why Xiang Zhen suddenly mentioned Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Principal of Dongyang Martial Academy said with a shocked expression, "Marquis, could it be that His Majesty wants to participate in the Myriad Treasures Alliance's action?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yan royal family was one of the major behind-the-scenes forces of the Myriad Treasures Alliance. Could it be that this time, the Great Yan royal family also wanted to join in surrounding and killing Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"No!" Xiang Zhen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>With an extremely solemn expression, he said, "You probably don't know, but sixteen Immortal Celestial Lords of the Myriad Treasures Alliance tried to ambush and kill Meng Chong, but they were all slain by him. Meng Chong's strength is terrifyingly powerful."</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty and the royal family have no intention of provoking Meng Chong, and the Myriad Treasures Alliance has not yet decided whether to continue seeking revenge."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Zhen paused, took a deep breath, and said, "I came here because Meng Chong has been inquiring about prodigies from the Spirit Realm. Although he has no grudges with us from the Spirit Realm, we must be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all the powerful figures present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong alone had killed sixteen Immortal Celestial Lords from the Myriad Treasures Alliance?</p><p></p><p>The Principal of Dongyang Martial Academy's face changed drastically, and he exclaimed in shock, "Marquis, do you mean that someone from our Spirit Realm might have offended Meng Chong, and he's come to seek revenge?"</p><p></p><p>If this were true, it would be a disaster for those of them from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Given Meng Chong's overwhelming strength, even if all their Immortal Celestial Lords joined forces, they might not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"It's not necessarily so. Perhaps his enemy is not from among us who came from Great Zhou, but from other Spirit Realms?" Xiang Zhen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest among the martial artists from the Spirit Realm, and the greatest backer of the Spirit Realm faction, Xiang Zhen had to make decisive decisions at crucial moments.</p><p></p><p>"If it truly is someone among us who has a grudge with Meng Chong, I only hope that this matter will not escalate and implicate the innocent."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable. After all, even if they joined forces, they couldn't resist such a powerful enemy, so naturally, there was no reason to stand up for any individual.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they were implicated, it would be a disaster for all the Spirit Realm martial artists in the Great Yan realm.</p><p></p><p>They might even be completely suppressed because of this.</p><p></p><p>After all, they, who came from the Spirit Realm, were not without rivals in the Great Yan realm.</p><p></p><p>Their ability to establish themselves was related to their long-standing connection to the Great Yan royal family. They were like swords in the hands of the Great Yan royal family. As long as they didn't commit any major mistakes and get abandoned by the royal family, they could maintain their stable position.</p><p></p><p>"Don't spread this matter. Notify me immediately when Meng Chong arrives in Dongyang Prefecture," Xiang Zhen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Marquis!" Everyone nodded.</p><p></p><p>In Dongyang Prefecture, dark</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The currents were flowing, and other forces from the Great Yan realm sent people to come, especially the opposing forces of the Spirit Domain camp.</p><p></p><p>Some people had even prepared to persuade the Great Yan royal family to abandon the Spirit Domain camp.</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Martial Academy remained as usual.</p><p></p><p>For the East Sun students, these matters were beyond their reach. However, some with backgrounds, or the top talents from the Spirit Domain in previous batches, vaguely sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Will Meng Chong come to find me?" Zi Yun had no heart to cultivate anymore.</p><p></p><p>Sitting by the window, looking at the horizon, she felt restless.</p><p></p><p>What she feared most now was that Meng Chong had forgotten about her.</p><p></p><p>"That big guy, looking careless but actually very attentive, and values relationships. He wouldn't forget about me, right? When will he come to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Zi Yun, why haven't you been practicing hard these days? Do you have something on your mind?" </p><p></p><p>A senior sister she was close with came over and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Ping, I'm fine, just tired and want to rest for a while," </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun shook her head and said.</p><p></p><p>"You can't fool me. Looking at you, you're lovesick? Come on, tell your senior sister, who do you like?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping said with a teasing smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Ping, stop asking. Even if there's someone I like, you wouldn't know him,"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun rolled her eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I've also fallen for someone,"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping imitated her posture, resting her chin on her hand and looking at the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Senior Sister, you like someone? Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping had a lovestruck expression.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a genius in this world, handsome and unparalleled in swordsmanship. When will I be able to see him..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun covered her forehead and said: "Senior Sister Ping, don't daydream, you have no chance."</p><p></p><p>If Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying knew about Senior Sister Ping's thoughts, they would probably beat her half to death.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Ping, you've never seen Xu Yan, how do you know he's handsome?" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Who says I haven't seen him?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping took out a scroll painting and slowly unrolled it. On it was a sword-wielding young man, extraordinarily handsome.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Where did you get this portrait?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the painting was indeed Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Killers and Earthly Shadows put out wanted posters with portraits when hunting Sword God Xu Yan. This is a copy I made..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Zi Yun, many people from the capital have come to the county city recently. Something big might be happening. Let's go take a look around too."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping put away the painting and said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun thought it would be good to go to the county city since she had nothing else to do.</p><p></p><p>The two left East Sun Martial Academy and came to the county city.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they arrived, they saw the county governor leading a procession at the city gate. A luxurious beast-drawn carriage was slowly approaching from outside the city, pulled by two celestial spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that seems to be someone from the royal family."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Someone from the royal family? Why have they come to East Sun County?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun didn't understand this and asked curiously: "Senior Sister Ping, how do you know they're from the royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping explained: "The carriage is pulled by celestial spirit beasts. In the entire Great Yan realm, tamed celestial spirit beasts are very rare, and only members of the royal family are qualified to ride them. Even within the royal family, those qualified to ride spirit beast carriages are few."</p><p></p><p>Then, Senior Sister Ping explained about celestial spirit beasts and the rules for royal carriages.</p><p></p><p>These celestial spirit beasts were all captured in the Heavenly Abyss. Due to their low intelligence and violent nature, it was extremely difficult to tame them and make them obey commands. It required specialized beast tamers and a very long time to tame them.</p><p></p><p>"According to rumors, not all celestial spirit beasts can be tamed. The ones with the highest chance of being tamed are the Giant Armored Beasts. Even so, it takes at least a hundred years to tame one Giant Armored Beast."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Only the royal family had such deep pockets and manpower to tame celestial spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beast carriage entering the county city attracted onlookers from all around. Everyone was secretly shocked, speculating which important figure from the royal family had come to East Sun County.</p><p></p><p>No martial artist dared to offend the majesty of the Great Yan royal family. They all cleared the main street, lining up on both sides to watch curiously.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun and Senior Sister Ping stood at the side of the street, looking on with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The carriage slowly approached. Everyone was curious about who was sitting inside.</p><p></p><p>The Giant Armored Beasts pulled the carriage, making clip-clop sounds. Golden curtains covered the carriage windows. As the carriage drove by, it suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>A delicate jade-like hand lifted the window curtain, revealing an incomparably beautiful and stunning face inside the carriage. Bright eyes seemed to carry an air of authority.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's heart tightened, and she hurriedly lowered her gaze slightly. She didn't know why, but she felt the woman in the carriage seemed to be looking at her.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>The beauty in the carriage asked.</p><p></p><p>Her voice was cold, with no discernible emotion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone looked at Zi Yun, and Senior Sister Ping also became nervous.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Zi Yun!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's palms were sweaty, not knowing why the other party was staring at her.</p><p></p><p>"You have an uncommon aura and a beautiful face. This princess is in need of a personal maid. Come be my maid. Someone will teach you how to be a good maid."</p><p></p><p>The woman finished speaking and lowered the curtain.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was stunned. Be a maid? She didn't want that!</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Domain, she was a princess of a country. She had only been served by others, never serving anyone. In the Spirit Domain, she was even more noble as the Princess of Great Zhou, also of high status, only being served and never serving others.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to the Divine Realm, she had mostly been cultivating hard and had never served anyone.</p><p></p><p>Now, to ask her to be a maid serving others was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your favor, but I'm not worthy. I'm used to being free and independent. I'm sorry!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun took a deep breath and said.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you! You dare to question the words of the Crown Princess?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an angry shout rang out.</p><p></p><p>An old woman following beside the carriage spoke with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>Crown Princess? Everyone present was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Although Zi Yun didn't know much about the Crown Princess, she knew the other party's status was exalted. Refusing her recruitment would likely cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't regret it. At worst, she could just run away!</p><p></p><p>With the jade talisman from her senior, she should be able to escape, right?</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun, quickly apologize! That's Crown Princess Zhou Qingshuang. She's cold-hearted and decisive in killing. In the royal family, besides His Majesty, she's the one you can't offend the most!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Ping hurriedly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yun became even more nervous. Her fists clenched together. To ask her to apologize and be a maid serving others, even if the other party was the Crown Princess of the Great Yan Dynasty, she was unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze swept around, preparing to find an opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 460</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the vast sea of the Azure Sea Realm, a small boat bobbed up and down amidst the turbulent waves. Layers of light emerged on the flying boat as formations and restrictions were triggered.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand!" Xu Yan, inside the shell of the Primordial Turtle, smiled at this moment. </p><p></p><p>He had comprehended the Establishing the Way Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Establish the Way of Heaven and Earth, establish one's own Way - so that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Master said that without entering the Establishing the Way Realm, one is not qualified to pass on the Dao lineage. Only the Establishing the Way Realm is the beginning, only then is one qualified to establish a Dao lineage. Only by establishing one's own Way and the Way of Heaven and Earth can one understand what the Dao is and be qualified to pass on the Dao lineage!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Xu Yan's aura surged, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth poured in frantically.</p><p></p><p>With his comprehension of the Establishing the Way Realm, his strength also broke through.</p><p></p><p>He reached the Great Perfection of the Breaking Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My Mountains and Rivers Dao Body is already close to establishing the Way. Breaking through to the Heaven and Earth Realm and the Establishing the Way Realm will have no bottleneck or difficulty for me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed an excited smile.</p><p></p><p>The Establishing the Way Realm would have no bottleneck for him.</p><p></p><p>He had a Dao Body, so establishing the Way would not be difficult!</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've comprehended the Establishing the Way Realm, I should go find Brother Xie. I wonder how much time has passed during this secluded cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's form flickered and he left the small world inside the Primordial Turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he came out, Xu Yan frowned. What had happened in the Azure Sea Realm?</p><p></p><p>Surging waves and rolling billows tossed the flying boat up and down, even triggering the defensive formations and restrictions to keep the boat from sinking.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Primordial Turtle shell, Xu Yan hadn't sensed the outside disturbances, and the shell was unaffected by external fluctuations, so he didn't know the current situation in the Azure Sea Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had come out of the shell and noticed the roiling waves, he couldn't help but be astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Heavenly Abyss in chaos?"</p><p></p><p>The first thing Xu Yan thought of was the turmoil in the Azure Sea Realm's Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Primordial Turtle shell entered his body, nourishing within the myriad mountains and rivers inside him.</p><p></p><p>Besides having a small world inside, the Primordial Turtle shell was also an extremely strong defensive treasure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, using the shell for defense wasn't very aesthetically pleasing - it was like wearing a turtle shell on his body!</p><p></p><p>The turbulent waves rose several zhang high, and even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth became violent. The power of the laws of heaven and earth surged between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a beam of blood-red light shot straight into the sky, like a pillar of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Netherworld invading?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>The current situation in the Azure Sea Realm was extremely turbulent. Even the laws of heaven and earth had become agitated due to the invasion of the Netherworld aura.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I have the feeling that this is some kind of signal?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan furrowed his brow, staring at the beam of blood-red light in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've encountered it, I might as well wipe it out."</p><p></p><p>That beam of blood-red light clearly came from the Netherworld, and it gave him the feeling that it was some kind of signal. Xu Yan couldn't help but think of Heavenly Bane and Earthly Shadow.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Nine Mountains Realm, Heavenly Bane and Earthly Shadow had colluded with the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this turmoil in the Azure Sea Realm and this blood-red light signal might also be related to Heavenly Bane and Earthly Shadow.</p><p></p><p>In any case, since he had encountered it, Xu Yan would not stand idly by.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, his form instantly disappearing from the spot as he used his divine ability to rush towards the source of the blood-red light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that giant crocodile was emitting a blood-red radiance. It leapt up, opened its huge mouth, and spewed out a stream of blood-refined light that swept in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and other powerful experts had to resist both the Netherworld blood crocodile and the blood light gushing from the Heavenly Abyss, trying to suppress this beam of blood light!</p><p></p><p>For a time, they seemed extremely passive.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, blood light burst forth from the Heavenly Abyss, and a figure was walking out.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier Blood Son!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As this Blood Son entered the Azure Sea Realm, the aura of this world became even more chaotic. The seawater turned completely blood-red and even bubbled, with a faint smell of blood permeating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go kill him!"</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable from the Sea Spirit Clan, wielding a sea trident, rode the water to attack, charging towards that Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>"Sea Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>That Blood Son licked his lips, revealing a cold smile. "I've heard the taste of Sea Spirits is quite good. Today I'll have a taste!"</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored blade light emerged from his body, along with a flame-like blood-colored fire that blazed up. Behind him, the entrance to the Heavenly Abyss had turned crimson like a blood hell, with streams of blood energy pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>He swung his blade, cleaving apart the blood-red seawater, shattering the Sea Spirit's power to control the sea. That Sea Spirit expert's expression changed drastically as he raised his trident to defend, but was sent flying by a single slash, spitting blood.</p><p></p><p>"You... have already surpassed the power of an Immortal Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit expert's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"You're just too weak!"</p><p></p><p>That Blood Son shook his head, sneering, "After the Sea Spirit Emperor disappeared, the Sea Spirit Clan has become weaker and weaker. It seems you can't even break through the shackles of the Immortal Realm anymore!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder's expression darkened as he said coldly, "You can't possibly be a Blood Son. Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>How could a mere Blood Son know some of the Sea Spirit Clan's secrets?</p><p></p><p>"I am Blood King Li!"</p><p></p><p>Blood King!</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder's expression was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Divine Realm martial artists probably didn't know what a Blood King was, but as the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan, he knew quite a few secrets passed down in the clan.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the Netherworld naturally far surpassed that of other experts.</p><p></p><p>Besides Blood Disciples, Blood Sons, and Blood Spirits, the Netherworld also had Blood Kings!</p><p></p><p>The strength of Blood Kings far surpassed that of Blood Spirits, and in the entire Netherworld, those honored with the title of Blood King could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>"A Blood King's avatar!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder's expression sank.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Abyss here had been expanded, a Blood King's true body still couldn't descend. Moreover, how could a Blood King's strength be merely this?</p><p></p><p>Blood King Li had sent an avatar, but the strength of this avatar had already surpassed the upper limit of Immortal Venerables by a notch. Combined with his experience as a Blood King, his strength would certainly be greater than others at the same level.</p><p></p><p>No one in the Azure Sea Realm could match him!</p><p></p><p>It would require multiple people joining forces, but at this moment, all the major Heavenly Abysses in the Azure Sea Realm had become turbulent, and it was impossible to dispatch experts to surround and kill Blood King Li's avatar.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's heart sank as they considered whether to abandon this sea area, give up on suppressing this Heavenly Abyss, stabilize the situation in the Azure Sea Realm, and then wait for reinforcements from the greater realm.</p><p></p><p>"And which Blood King are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder suddenly felt his heart skip a beat as he looked at the Netherworld blood crocodile and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>This Netherworld blood crocodile was clearly unusual, probably also a certain Blood King who had invaded the Azure Sea Realm using its physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Blood King Ju!"</p><p></p><p>The giant crocodile's cold eyes glanced at him as it said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Blood King Ju suddenly rose into the air, its huge crocodile body like a terrifying monster, with blood waves rolling and an even more terrifying blood-colored flame emerging.</p><p></p><p>On the giant crocodile's body appeared the image of an extremely muscular man with a fierce face, wearing blood-colored armor.</p><p></p><p>"The Sea Spirit Clan has truly declined!"</p><p></p><p>Blood King Ju's cold eyes looked towards the sea, suddenly opening its huge mouth and pouncing towards an area where the Sea Spirit Clan was hunting Netherworld beasts.</p><p></p><p>"You dare!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder roared in anger, waving the scepter in his hand. The power of the vast sea surged forth, causing his body to instantly swell at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His Sea Spirit body fully manifested, and a cyan curved blade, like a crescent moon in the sky, slashed towards Blood King Ju!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>!</p><p></p><p>The giant crocodile body of Blood King Ju suddenly swung its tail, unleashing a fierce blade of light that collided with the cyan curved blade.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The cyan curved blade developed cracks under the attack.</p><p></p><p>But with this obstruction, the targeted sea spirits frantically fled.</p><p></p><p>"Li, entangle them. I'll use this avatar to destroy that island!" Blood King Ju said with a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Blood King Li had just swallowed a sea spirit, a look of satisfaction on his face.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The blood-colored light transformed into chains, instantly entangling the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and other Immortal Venerable beings.</p><p></p><p>"With the power of this avatar, I can entangle them for five breaths!" Blood King Li said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just an avatar with limited power. Being able to entangle these Sea Spirit Clan Immortal Venerables for five breaths was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough!" Blood King Ju nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was horrified. Blood King Ju was going to destroy Cloud Sky Island?!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sky Island was special in the Azure Sea Realm. Located in the middle of the Azure Sea, once destroyed, it would cause some turmoil in the Azure Sea Realm, especially the nearest Heavenly Abyss, which would lose its suppression and continue to expand.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sky Island Lord alone could not resist Blood King Ju, especially since Blood King Ju was clearly willing to sacrifice this avatar to destroy Cloud Sky Island!</p><p></p><p>The giant crocodile sped across the sea, extremely fast, swallowing one sea spirit after another that blocked its path.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder let out a low roar. All the Sea Spirit Clan Immortal Venerables now revealed their true sea spirit forms, with pale blue light surrounding their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Their auras connected, merging with the sea, as they performed a powerful secret technique, trying to break free from Blood King Li's restraints!</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, withdraw from this sea area immediately!" the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder ordered loudly.</p><p></p><p>This sea area could not be protected anymore. Cloud Sky Island was of utmost importance. They could only stabilize the situation and wait for reinforcements from the Great Realm. As long as the Great Realm sent help, Blood King Li's avatar could eventually be driven back.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, who was hunting Netherworld Beasts to hone his sword skills, suddenly felt alarmed. He saw a giant crocodile shooting across the sea at extreme speed, devouring all Sea Spirit Clan members and human cultivators in its path.</p><p></p><p>Its destination was Cloud Sky Island!</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder had also reached them from afar.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!" Xie Lingfeng was shocked and was about to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Blood King Ju's eyes were cold. This human cultivator's sword skills were extraordinary, surely an unparalleled genius. It would be good to eliminate him along the way!</p><p></p><p>"I can't escape!" Xie Lingfeng's heart sank, but he wasn't panicked.</p><p></p><p>With the senior's life-saving jade talisman, his life wouldn't be threatened.</p><p></p><p>However, having to trigger the senior's jade talisman in such a situation made him feel a bit ashamed. He had to rely on the senior's protection rather than his own strength to resolve the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't escape, he might as well go all out!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng steadied himself, his sword intent surging forth. He raised his sword with both hands, layers of sword light behind him. The sword was like thousands of rivers surging, its rumbling sound even drowning out the roar of the sea.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all nearby cultivators turned to look.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Who's attacking? What kind of sword technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked and amazed.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such sword skills before. However, as strong as these sword skills were, they were far from enough to resist that giant crocodile!</p><p></p><p>Was a genius about to fall?!</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianxing looked up, stunned for a moment, feeling both proud and a bit helpless. He had finally been surpassed.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of sword skills, I might not lose. But in Tai Cang martial arts, I'm indeed inferior!" He sighed inwardly. The Great Wilderness martial arts were indeed much stronger than Tai Cang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xie Lingfeng struck with his sword.</p><p></p><p>This was his all-out attack. The surging sea was split by the sword, and the sharp sword light slashed towards the approaching giant crocodile.</p><p></p><p>"Like an ant trying to shake a tree!" Blood King Ju laughed coldly, his eyes filled with even stronger killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to defend, charging straight ahead. The sword light was shattering, and the blood-colored giant crocodile had already opened its huge bloody mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a deep breath, feeling a bit powerless. His all-out sword attack was so easily ignored.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. If Brother Xu were facing this giant crocodile, he could probably kill it with one sword strike, right?" He thought to himself, about to actively trigger the jade talisman. Since he was using the talisman anyway, he might as well clear this entire sea area!</p><p></p><p>Hum! At this moment, a black sword light descended from the sky, with an intent to annihilate everything in heaven and earth, surging between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was aimed at the giant crocodile.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Xie Lingfeng felt that the sword in his hand seemed to be a bit out of control.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the sword in his hand was no longer his own!</p><p></p><p>Blood King Ju let out a roar. The entire giant crocodile body stood upright, its tail supporting it on the sea surface. It opened its huge mouth, spewing out a powerful blood light.</p><p></p><p>The virtual image of Blood King Ju appeared on the giant crocodile's body.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" This sword strike was too shocking. Even before it landed, he had already sensed a strong crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan!" A clear voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Puff! With one sword strike, the giant crocodile's body was cut open, gradually dissolving into ashes!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan?! Very well, this king will remember you!" Blood King Ju said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan snorted coldly. The sword light retracted, and in an instant, this fragment of Blood King Ju's soul was completely annihilated!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu!" Xie Lingfeng was excited.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Brother Xu was as invincible as ever. One sword strike had killed the giant crocodile!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, it's been a while!" Xu Yan smiled, then looked towards the Heavenly Abyss ahead. That thin man was single-handedly entangling all the Sea Spirit Clan Immortal Venerables, and this sea area was almost turning into a Netherworld sea.</p><p></p><p>"Let me clear this Heavenly Abyss, then we can catch up properly!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xie Lingfeng was excited, his face full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward. With a boom, sea waves rose to the sky, turning into a giant sword. The surging waves were like sword intent, sweeping out. The Netherworld beasts in the sea instantly turned to ashes and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in the Azure Sea Realm were shocked. What terrifying strength was this? What kind of sword technique was this?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan once again used the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword. In an instant, it swept across the sea area, descending upon the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and others were pale-faced but excited.</p><p></p><p>The Sword God had arrived. The Azure Sea Realm was saved!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Blood King Li's gaze was gloomy and vicious.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Netherworld Blood King. If you dare to interfere in this matter, you are making an enemy of me, Blood King Li!"</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Blood King had a notorious reputation. Ordinary supreme experts wouldn't dare to offend him.</p><p></p><p>"Remember this. The one who kills you is Sword God Xu Yan. Since you're an enemy, you shall turn to dust!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Ten Directions Annihilation Sword instantly descended, covering the Heavenly Abyss and engulfing Blood King Li.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

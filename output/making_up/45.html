        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 45: I Wish to Appoint the Young Master as the Great Saint of the Heavenly Mother Sect</p><p></p><p>"You dog of an official, how dare you come to ransack my home? Are you tired of living?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's face was filled with rage as he glared at the Prefect of Donghe. A scarlet-red dragon coiled around him, exerting a powerful pressure that forced the Prefect to sit down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"My father worked hard to do some business and earn some money. Is that so difficult? </p><p></p><p>"Just because the Emperor's two sons are fighting over the throne, my Xu family has to be implicated? This is outrageous!</p><p></p><p>"My grandfather, the Xu family patriarch, is respected by the Emperor's third son. That is the Emperor's good fortune."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan spoke these words, the expressions on Xu Junhe and his wife's faces changed drastically. </p><p></p><p>This was extremely disloyal and treacherous talk! </p><p></p><p>They could be executed along with their entire family for this!</p><p></p><p>The ambusher Kou Ruozhi, who was hiding outside the Xu family estate, was overjoyed upon hearing this. Seeing Xu Yan's majestic and awe-inspiring demeanor, a bold idea formed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Donghe pointed a trembling finger at Xu Yan, "You... you are disloyal and treacherous! This is tantamount to rebellion. What crime shall you be punished with!"</p><p></p><p>"Seize them! Capture the father and son of the Xu family who intend to rebel. This is a great opportunity to accomplish a meritorious deed!" the Prefect roared.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had displayed formidable, godly power, there were always those who, blinded by the prospect of rewards, thought they could achieve glory by recklessly attacking him.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, charge together! He is just one person, do not be afraid!" the officer leading the troops shouted, brandishing his weapon.</p><p></p><p>Quelling a rebellion and capturing the ringleader of the traitors would be an enormous feat, bringing wealth, status and high office within reach.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Donghe turned to Chen the Escort Leader and the others, saying, "All who participate in capturing this traitorous villain will be reported to the court, and great rewards, high offices and wealth will be yours. Seize this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Those were all top experts!</p><p></p><p>Chen the Escort Leader and the others exchanged glances, tempted but also hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Archer troops!" </p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu family estate, rows of soldiers drew their bows, the cold arrowheads aimed at Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu's face turned pale as she trembled, "Yan'er, quickly escape! Don't worry about your father and I!"</p><p></p><p>"Mother, don't worry. Today, I will seek justice for our family!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes gleamed with icy coldness as he angrily said, "My father worked hard doing business, minding his own affairs. Yet because of the Emperor's family affairs, he is implicated. This is utterly unreasonable!"</p><p></p><p>His fury was beyond containment.</p><p></p><p>"If not for my father earning money through his business, where would I get the funds to pay the master's initiation fee? </p><p></p><p>"Without the family's wealth that my father accumulated, how could I have the means to cultivate the supreme martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the icy arrows and hundreds of soldiers, as well as the top experts, Xu Yan showed no fear. In his eyes, they were all mere insignificant insects.</p><p></p><p>A single strike of the Descending Dragon Palm could annihilate them all!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you are mere frogs in a well, unaware of the vastness of the heavens and earth. Today, I, Xu Yan, shall let you know what true martial arts are!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an excited shout rang out, "Young Master Xu is right, the foolish old Emperor rules with incompetence and blindness. He deserves to be rebelled against!"</p><p></p><p>Thirteen figures leaped up from amidst the soldiers, soaring over their heads and landing in the center of the scene. </p><p></p><p>The leader, holding a goose-feather fan, had an excited expression on his face. The other twelve, wielding weapons, had cold, grim expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother Sect?" Xu Yan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>He did not have much enmity towards the Heavenly Mother Sect, as long as they did not interfere with the interests of the Xu family. The news of their arrival had reached him earlier from the County Magistrate of Yunshan, who was a disciple of the Heavenly Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe coldly said, "The father and son, Xu Jun and Xu He, have colluded with the Tianmu Sect, and the evidence is conclusive. They must be executed for their crimes!"</p><p></p><p>"Shoot them, no mercy!" </p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe waved his hand and commanded.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi gently waved his feather fan and lightly chuckled, "You foolish official, do you have any idea how many of the soldiers here are actually members of our Tianmu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He then sneered coldly, "Do you think my府has no precautions? These soldiers are not from the Donghe Guard, but have been dispatched from the General's府."</p><p></p><p>"Loose the arrows, no mercy!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand with a cold and ruthless expression.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The arrows instantly rained down like a storm, but at the same time, in one particular area, not a single arrow was fired. The soldiers there turned their weapons and started shooting at the archers.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing cries rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe's expression changed drastically. The Tianmu Sect had infiltrated this deeply?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The powerful Tianmu Sect members, including Kou Ruozhi, retreated rapidly to avoid the hail of arrows. But at that moment, two crimson dragons roared to life.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>All the arrows stopped in midair about ten meters away from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly snorted, and with a shake of his Descending Dragon Palm, the arrows were reduced to dust.</p><p></p><p>With a push of his palm, a Descending Dragon Palm force howled out, sweeping all the soldiers away. They all coughed up blood and collapsed, unable to get up for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan looked at the Governor of Donghe with a sharp gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Rebellion? What is this old Qi Emperor worth? I, Xu Yan, will rebel against him today, and what can he do about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe's face turned pale, his lips trembling, but he shouted harshly, "You, Xu Yan, I don't know where you learned such incredible abilities, but do you think a single person can withstand an army of thousands?</p><p></p><p>"My Qi Kingdom's Divine Might Army, how can you possibly resist them?</p><p></p><p>"You will surely die, and your Xu family, as well as Guo the Advisor, will all perish!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kou Ruozhi stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, don't be anxious. My Tianmu Sect supports you. This old Qi Emperor is blind and ignorant, unfit to rule. He should be removed from the throne!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was excited and agitated, his eyes filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"I, Kou Ruozhi, was once a top scholar, unparalleled in both martial and literary skills, yet I failed the imperial examinations three times. This incompetent old Emperor and his useless ministers enjoy wealth and honor, it's an outrage!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked at the indignant Kou Ruozhi with a strange gaze. So he was just a failed scholar, and this was the reason he had been plotting a rebellion?</p><p></p><p>"Now, Heaven has opened its eyes, and the godly figure of Young Master Xu has appeared. This is Heaven's will to destroy the Qi Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi grew more and more excited and impassioned as he spoke. With a thud, he knelt on the ground, his expression fervent and his gaze fanatical.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, from this day on, all the members of the Tianmu Sect pledge to revere you as the Heavenly Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Sovereign, with unrivaled divine might, will surely be able to remove this incompetent old Qi Emperor from the throne!"</p><p></p><p>The twelve Tianmu Sect elites, seeing their strategist Kou Ruozhi kneel, immediately planted their weapons on the ground, knelt on one knee, and paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"The Twelve Pinnacles of the Tianmu Sect pay our respects to the Heavenly Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>They sighed inwardly, thinking that Kou the Strategist truly understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>With such an invincible Heavenly Sovereign leading the Tianmu Sect, how could their grand ambition not succeed?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the excited and fanatical Kou Ruozhi, completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>What is this "Heavenly Sovereign" nonsense?</p><p></p><p>If I want to rebel, what does that have to do with you?</p><p></p><p>"What Heavenly Sovereign? Hold on, you all are from the Tianmu Sect, right? Don't tell me you're going to change the name to the Heavenly Sovereign Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his mouth, utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 230</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside, there was a top-grade spiritual medicine.</p><p></p><p>There should still be some remnants.</p><p></p><p>However, when Xu Yan explored, he found that the remaining treasures in Black Rock Mountain had already been plundered.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Jade Crystal Snake.</p><p></p><p>Since there were no more treasures, Xu Yan no longer lingered and immediately left the Black Cloud Swamp.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Qingtianjiao Tomb would soon spread, and even Refining Celestial Immortals might descend. His current strength was no match for a Refining Celestial Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou also turned and left at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Pondering where to go next, the Qingtianjiao Corpse was already in his hands, and the Bixiao Tree and Dragon's Eye Fruit had also been obtained, but there was still a gap before accumulating enough foundation to break through the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered that he should further understand the Spirit Realm and Yuzhou next.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the city and see if there are any shops selling spiritual items. I still have some spirit crystals, and I need to quickly gather the spiritual items needed to cultivate myself."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual medicine was not refined into a pill, but consumed directly, which seemed a bit wasteful.</p><p></p><p>However, in order to quickly accumulate enough foundation and break through the Divine Realm in the Spirit Realm, Xu Yan did not care about this waste.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were enough spirit crystals, he could eventually buy spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm also lacks spirit pills. If my junior sister comes to the Spirit Realm, and the Longqing Pavilion develops in the Spirit Realm, she can quickly accumulate them."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm is truly a cultivation paradise. The fifth-grade spiritual medicines that are rare in the Inner Realm are only mid-to-low-grade spiritual medicines in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Inner Realm and the Spirit Realm is indeed quite large, no wonder the strong cultivators in the Spirit Realm look down on the Inner Realm and see it as an inferior place, and there is a reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan just entered the Spirit Realm, and after learning about the Qingtianjiao Tomb from Dai Yingying, he came directly here, afraid of missing the opportunity to enter.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had not been to the towns of Zheng Kingdom yet. Now that the Qingtianjiao Tomb matter has come to an end, and the fact that the Qingtianjiao has become a corpse will certainly cause a stir.</p><p></p><p>What actions the various major forces to which the young geniuses belong will take can only be obtained by going to the city.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingtianjiao has been taken by me, and it is likely that I will be watched. I should hide myself to avoid being discovered."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"My Harmony Technique can avoid attracting the attention of strong cultivators. As long as I hide properly, even Refining Celestial Immortals will not be able to detect me."</p><p></p><p>Looking around, it was a desolate land.</p><p></p><p>The Qingtianjiao Tomb was originally located in a desolate area. After leaving the Spirit Realm gate, Xu Yan followed the direction pointed out by Dai Yingying and came all the way here, until he saw the Black Cloud Swamp, which was his destination.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he did not see any cities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan did not know which direction to go to enter the city.</p><p></p><p>"I was careless, I should have asked Shen Haizhou for directions earlier."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a little frustrated.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he chose a direction and prepared to go.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shot towards him!</p><p></p><p>The speed was so fast, like a sword beam, and it was close to him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, and a powerful aura burst forth from his body. A giant golden dragon head emerged from him.</p><p></p><p>His eyes shone brightly, staring at the approaching beam of light.</p><p></p><p>"Even a dragon can be subdued, and I easily captured the Qingtianjiao. A mere snake dares to be so presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The flying Jade Crystal Snake suddenly became soft, the entire snake trembling. The overwhelming aura instilled a fear in it, a fear from its bloodline and soul.</p><p></p><p>The entire snake was weakened, unable to exert any strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed the snake's neck with one hand, squeezing it so hard that its mouth opened and its tongue stuck out.</p><p></p><p>Just about to crush it to death! The Jade Crystal Snake was almost scared to the point of urinating. It hurriedly said, "I'm here to deliver treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to crush the snake, but upon hearing that it was here to deliver treasures, his hand loosened slightly. He extended two fingers and gently rubbed the bulge on the snake's head.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so you're here to deliver treasures. You should have said so earlier!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Crystal Snake almost cried, barely escaping with its life! Fortunately, it was quick-witted, or else it might have already been crushed by now. "Where are the treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan released his grip on the Jade Crystal Snake's neck, but the dragon aura still suppressed the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Crystal Snake opened its mouth and spat out a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened the storage bag and saw that it contained the spiritual medicines from the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>He put away the storage bag, and just as the Jade Crystal Snake was about to breathe a sigh of relief, Xu Yan grabbed its neck again.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingtianjiao has been captured by me, and I am the victor. These things rightfully belong to me. I won't pursue the crime of you stealing them, but in the tomb, you attacked me, and that crime cannot be forgiven."</p><p></p><p>A crime is a crime, the Jade Crystal Snake's attack in the tomb could not be ignored.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures I mentioned are not these!" The Jade Crystal Snake opened its mouth wide, its tongue sticking out, terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there are other treasures?" Xu Yan loosened his grip and looked at it calmly. "If you're deceiving me, I'll have you cooked!"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I wouldn't dare!" The Jade Crystal Snake licked its face, sticking out its tongue, full of flattering gestures.</p><p></p><p>"So, what are the treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures are not on me... Ugh!" Its neck was grabbed again, almost crushed to death.</p><p></p><p>"It's a special treasure, a special treasure that cannot be carried..." The Jade Crystal Snake was in a terrible state.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of special treasure?" Xu Yan released his grip again.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!" The Jade Crystal Snake suddenly started coughing violently, sticking out its tongue.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Earth Dragon Qi! The legendary Earth Dragon Qi, said to be born from the great river's spiritual vein, has already surpassed the first-grade spiritual item level and is rumored to be a divine-grade spiritual item, or even a divine treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up at these words. If the Earth Dragon Qi is real, he can use it to accumulate enough foundation and smoothly break through the Divine Realm, allowing him to undergo a successful transformation and advancement.</p><p></p><p>"Since this treasure is so precious, why are you telling me about it?" Xu Yan grabbed the Jade Crystal Snake's neck again, coldly saying, "Could this be a trap?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Crystal Snake's entire body went numb. Could he please not grab its neck? "Listen to me, listen to me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan released his grip again. "Speak."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Crystal Snake stuck out its tongue, panting. "Can you not grab my neck?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xu Yan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Crystal Snake paused for a moment, surprised that he agreed so easily. "The thing is, the Earth Dragon Qi is elusive and difficult to capture. I know that with my own strength, it would be too difficult for me to obtain the Earth Dragon Qi."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly reached out and grabbed the Jade Crystal Snake's tail, shaking it a few times, making the Jade Crystal Snake dizzy, its bones almost scattering.</p><p></p><p>"So you're trying to use me to help you get the Earth Dragon Qi. You're dreaming!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered. This snake had attacked him before, and he would not let that grudge go.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It must be reported."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, let me finish!" </p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake was dizzy, feeling his bones loosening, as if the entire snake was about to fall apart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan released his grip and said, "Okay, go ahead and say it."</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake shook its head, somewhat suspicious that the other party was deliberately seeking revenge for the attack it had launched in the tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Next time, just strangle my neck."</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake had realized that being strangled at the neck was better than being grabbed by the tail and shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, readily agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake: ...</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I have the bloodline of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, or it may not be the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's, but it doesn't matter, as long as you know I have the Flood Dragon's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"I'm currently at the late fourth stage, but I'm almost at the peak and cannot advance further. I need to refine the bloodline to break through to the fifth stage.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sky Flood Dragon is the key to refining my bloodline. I want to obtain some of your Azure Sky Flood Dragon's essence blood in exchange for helping you obtain the Earth Spirit Dragon's Qi."</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake revealed its purpose.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then suddenly grabbed Yujing Snake's neck, "Just for the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's essence blood?"</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake no longer struggled, getting used to being strangled.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's essence blood, there's also your Golden Dragon's aura. I feel that this dragon might allow me to transform into a true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake said in a flattering tone.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan released his grip. He didn't know if the dragon's true essence could truly allow Yujing Snake to transform, but since Yujing Snake was trying to curry favor with him for this, he could take advantage of it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a local snake of Yuzhou?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so."</p><p></p><p>Yujing Snake nodded, then added, "My name is Yuxiao Long."</p><p></p><p>"My dream is to one day transform into the legendary true dragon."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long raised its head proudly.</p><p></p><p>It was a snake with a grand dream!</p><p></p><p>"Since you're a local snake, it'll be easy. Lead the way and show me where the Earth Spirit Dragon's Qi is, so we can quickly leave this place of trouble."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's this way."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long gestured with its head in a direction.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately followed that direction, curiously asking along the way, "Can't you continue to break through? Can't you cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual beasts rely entirely on bloodline. The cultivation is also about the bloodline. Once the bloodline reaches its limit, that's it. There's no cultivation method like you martial artists have."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long said enviously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted its head and said, "Follow me, work hard, and if you perform well, I'll let the Crimson Cat teach you the Great Demon Cultivation Method. This is much stronger than relying on bloodline alone, allowing you to cultivate and improve like martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Demon Cultivation Method? We spiritual beasts can also cultivate like martial artists, not just rely on bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Snake was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I wouldn't lie to you, so work hard."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan encouraged.</p><p></p><p>"How can you speak? Spiritual beasts can't speak, can they?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked the biggest question on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual beasts could only speak with the power of their refined spiritual souls, which was at the sixth stage.</p><p></p><p>Before that, they couldn't speak human language.</p><p></p><p>"I learned it."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long explained, "When I was young, I almost got eaten by a foul bird, but a very beautiful sister saved me. I lived with her for a long time, and she taught me how to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Over time, after I broke through to the fourth stage, I could speak."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long opened its mouth, revealing the vocal cords in its throat, "This is what that sister helped me with, so I can make sounds now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, "So you were a pet snake!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a pet snake!"</p><p></p><p>Yuxiao Long raised its body and refuted.</p><p></p><p>Then it deflated, "That sister, I don't know where she went, and I can't find her to repay her kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Xu Yan learned more about the Spiritual Realm, Yuzhou, and the Zheng Kingdom's martial arts world from Yuxiao Long, as well as a further understanding of spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>Some spiritual beasts could actually learn to speak.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this type of spiritual beast was relatively rare, and most spiritual beasts were proud and disdained learning human language.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit Dragon's Qi was located very far from the Black Cloud Swamp, deep in the vast mountains at the edge of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's tomb ended with the fall of many geniuses. The once-fearsome Azure Sky Flood Dragon had become a corpse, and the news shook the martial arts world of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses who returned alive all had serious injuries, except for Shen Haizhou.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun had died!</p><p></p><p>The Dai family was shaken, and even the Dai family's ancestor, Dai Sheng, personally came to inquire about the matter.</p><p></p><p>What they cared about was not Dai Jun, but Dai Yingying! After some investigation, they learned that Dai Yingying had not gone to the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's tomb, and they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, just a few days later.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family was furious, with all their powerful experts going out to hunt down that Celestial Wandering Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying had died!</p><p></p><p>After a period of searching, the Dai family finally confirmed that Dai Yingying had died, and the first suspect they suspected was naturally that Celestial Wandering Cultivator who had made a threat.</p><p></p><p>The royal family of the Zheng Kingdom also dispatched powerful experts to hunt him down.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Dai Yingying was the fiancée of the Second Prince, the future Empress.</p><p></p><p>Above the Black Cloud Swamp, two figures stepped forward, their auras seemingly intertwined with heaven and earth, their spiritual souls searching in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Refining Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sky Flood Dragon is not here, and the young man who fought with the Azure Sky Flood Dragon has also left, his aura going in that direction."</p><p></p><p>One of the Refining Spirit Realm cultivators spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"How the Azure Sky Flood Dragon became a corpse, what method was used, this is very important."</p><p></p><p>The other Refining Spirit Realm cultivator continued.</p><p></p><p>Following the remaining aura, the two Refining Spirit Realm cultivators pursued.</p><p></p><p>But in just half a day, they suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>The aura had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In a small village in Qiushan County, Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>A burly man pushed open the door of a courtyard, and the people inside, hearing the sound, cautiously came out. Seeing the burly man, they relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong approached and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Huang Meng looked Wen Yong up and down, his expression disbelieving, and he lowered his voice, "Xiao Yong, did you really go and kill Dai Yingying? How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Wen Yong swallowed hard, his forehead beading with cold sweat. "I didn't kill Dai Yingying!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Meng still looked suspicious, "Really didn't kill her? Now the Dai family is going crazy, hunting you down everywhere. The Zheng Kingdom's royal family has also sent people.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yong, you were a bit impulsive. Our Wanshi Alliance is not yet ready to confront the Spiritual Sects and the great families. But your courage is still commendable."</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong's face turned pale, trembling as he said, "Dai Yingying is dead? Everyone suspects it was me?"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

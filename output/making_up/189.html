        <h1>Chapter 189</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out to grab the pouch on the stone table, but suddenly, with a bang, the crimson stone coffin shattered and a crimson hand reached out from the coffin, grabbing his wrist.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, to have killed the Fire Exterminator and come here is no small feat. I am in need of a blood offering!" a chilling voice said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression did not change, as if he had already known this would happen. He did not retract his outstretched hand, but instead grabbed the pouch, and at the same time, his wrist was seized by the crimson hand.</p><p></p><p>A powerful, ominous energy emanated from the crimson palm, which began to glow with a faint blood-red flame, as if trying to corrode the flesh and essence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's palm gripped the pouch, a cold light flashing in his eyes, and a sword light emerged on his wrist, like a rotating sword wheel encircling the crimson palm.</p><p></p><p>The sword wheel spun, seemingly intent on severing the crimson palm.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" a startled voice came from the shattered crimson stone coffin.</p><p></p><p>The hand grasping Xu Yan's wrist hastily retracted, but the sword wheel clung to it like a bracelet, spinning rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, the stone coffin completely exploded, and a crimson figure rose up.</p><p></p><p>Surging blood-red, sinister energy emanated from the figure, and it struck out with its other hand, attempting to shatter the sword wheel.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly snorted, and the sword wheel suddenly expanded, enveloping the figure within its rotation.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy!" the crimson figure exclaimed, undaunted. With a bang, it erupted in a blazing blood-red fire, and the ominous, corrosive energy spread, becoming like viscous blood that covered the sword wheel.</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds rang out. Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly, becoming more cautious.</p><p></p><p>The sword wheel dissolved under the blood-fire coverage, and Xu Yan did not attack further, but instead frowned at the crimson figure.</p><p></p><p>The figure had long, crimson hair, and its aged face gave the impression that its body was filled with blood, an intense crimson.</p><p></p><p>The ominous energy constantly permeated the area, with a faint, unusual blood scent.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you are the true Fire Exterminator Demon Lord?" Xu Yan asked, surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Demon Sect's Blood Ravager King, the Fire Exterminator was merely my disciple," the Blood Ravager King replied, his scarlet eyes glowing faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Ravager King?" Xu Yan frowned, not having heard of him before, but since he was the Fire Exterminator's master, he must be a formidable expert in the Demon Sect with a fearsome reputation.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fire Exterminator has died, and I had a deal with him. If I killed him, his lifetime's treasures would belong to me, so I've taken this pouch," Xu Yan said, hanging the pouch at his waist.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Ravager King frowned, somewhat displeased. "Young man, have you not heard of my reputation?"</p><p></p><p>He was the Blood Ravager King, a notorious figure in the Demon Sect. In the past, he had single-handedly massacred an entire city, refining the blood essence, and reached the peak master realm. He had even killed several pinnacle great masters in the face of attacks from many powerful experts, and with this blood refinement, he broke through the bottleneck of the pinnacle great master realm, further advancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>When the Demon Lord disappeared and the Demon Sect fell into disarray, he fought with the other great figures for the top position, sustaining injuries, and later fell into an ambush, suffering severe wounds. He could only feign death and hibernate until now.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Exterminator Demon Lord was his disciple, who obtained blood offerings for him to maintain his vitality, allowing him to survive to this day.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with some understanding of the Demon Sect and the inner domain martial arts world would surely know of the Blood Ravager King's notorious reputation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him and indifferently said, "I have no interest in understanding the affairs of you old washed-up types."</p><p></p><p>Old washed-up types? The Blood Ravager King let out a sinister laugh. "Daring to look down on me, the delicious blood offering? In all my years, I've never seen the likes of this!"</p><p></p><p>Surging, viscous blood-like terrifying power emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly said, "Having lived so long with such weak strength, you still dare to be arrogant? Admitting you're a washed-up type is that hard for you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had no goodwill towards the Demon Sect members, especially those who cultivated murderous techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the Blood Ravager King's terrifying strength and that crimson aura, he must have refined the blood of countless martial artists to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel before me!" the Blood Ravager King roared furiously, a half-step Celestial-Immortal-level pressure bearing down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood calmly, unaffected. A faint sword intent gradually emanated from his body, and amid the surging mountains and rivers, it suddenly transformed into a life-and-death sword wheel.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll use you to hone my sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>The sword wheel split, and two sword lights of life and death shot towards the Blood Ravager King.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Ravager King's expression changed drastically. He found that Xu Yan was unaffected by his half-step Celestial-Immortal pressure. Could this young man be at the half-step Celestial-Immortal realm? Moreover, he suddenly realized that Xu Yan's aura was somewhat unusual, neither that of a master nor a great master, nor even a half-step Celestial-Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A large hole was blasted in the ancient mountain, and two figures flew out.</p><p></p><p>One was crimson as blood, with a terrifying crimson blood aura like viscous blood waves, utterly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>In his hand was a crimson, hook-like weapon, also crimson as blood, emanating an ominous energy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wielded a long sword, and with one sword strike, the majestic life-and-death sword wheel emerged, its cyclic life-and-death, endless and ever-changing in its attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Ravager King was increasingly alarmed as the battle progressed. Each time he shattered the mysterious sword wheel, a second one would immediately appear. From the initial somewhat illusory and imperfect sword wheel, it gradually became more substantial and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cyclic attack and defense changes were unpredictable, and at times, he sensed a deathly intent from one sword light. Yet when he launched his fierce attacks, they were blocked and defended by another sword light, the endless, ceaseless onslaught, as if it would never stop.</p><p></p><p>Just when he thought the sword was only for defense, in a flash, it transformed into a sword of death, nearly severing his arm!</p><p></p><p>As the battle continued, Xu Yan's understanding deepened, and the life-and-death sword wheel continued to improve. At one point, it rotated like the Taiji, presenting a black and white before him.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights gradually transformed into black and white, as if new sword intents were being born.</p><p></p><p>However, it still lacked something, unable to fully comprehend the essence of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Today is a day of great harvest. The pouch is in my hands, and I've mastered the life-and-death sword wheel. Blood Ravager King, remember this: the one who kills you is the Sword Immortal Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's life-and-death sword wheel suddenly split apart, transforming into two terrifying sword lights that instantly enveloped the Blood Ravager King.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights swiftly converged, and amid the alternation of life and death, they thundered towards the Blood Ravager King!</p><p></p><p>"You think you can kill me, you arrogant brat!" the Blood Ravager King's eyes gleamed with icy light, and with a rumbling sound, a blood light shot up to the sky, the blazing blood fire turning half the sky crimson.</p><p></p><p>The hook-like weapon, crimson as blood, seemed to tear open the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Half-step Celestial Immortal</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The might was unleashed to the extreme at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The secret techniques hidden away were also deployed.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon King felt a chill in his heart, as he sensed a strong crisis of life and death. Those two sword light wheels were too dangerous, capable of slaying him at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Even when he was surrounded by many powerful experts before, he had never felt such a strong sense of life-and-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked in his heart, wondering how this young man could be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, he decisively unleashed the secret martial arts technique to save his life! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The life-and-death sword wheels came crashing down, with life and death interchanging, the killing wheels tearing through one layer of defense after another, crushing one attack after another. No matter how frantically the Blood Demon King struck, he was ultimately unable to escape these wheels of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Poof! At a certain moment, the life-and-death sword wheels converged, and the terrifying sword intent surged, as if transforming into mountains and rivers. In an instant, life and death became one, annihilating everything! The Blood Demon King's consciousness was horrified, watching his own body turn to ashes in the sword light.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this? He was only half a step away from becoming a Martial Dao Celestial, and although his physical body was destroyed, his spiritual consciousness had not been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, sensing that illusory, intangible spiritual consciousness - was that the spiritual body refined by the Martial Dao Celestials? "Soul Annihilation! Indeed, once the cultivation reaches a certain level, merely killing the physical body is not enough, as the enemy may not be truly dead!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, no wonder his master had taught him early on that when dealing with enemies, he must grind their bones to dust and annihilate their souls. If the soul is not destroyed, the enemy may still have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>The sword wheels rotated, the swords of life and death, slashing at that invisible spiritual body. The sword light transformed into the sword of death, completely annihilating that spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon King perished! After slaying the Blood Demon King, Xu Yan couldn't help but ponder. Although the Blood Demon King was only half a step away from becoming a Martial Dao Celestial, this led him to speculate that the true Martial Dao Celestials might not be that much stronger.</p><p></p><p>"In the Inner Realm, are there truly Martial Dao Celestials?" Xu Yan revealed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the existence of Martial Dao Celestials had never been heard of in the Inner Realm. Even half-step Martial Dao Celestials were extremely rare, known only to the top major powers and peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Inner Realm did not have any genuine Martial Dao Celestials.</p><p></p><p>"If I could compete with a Martial Dao Celestial, my Life-and-Death Sword Wheels should be able to be further perfected," Xu Yan thought regretfully.</p><p></p><p>But then he became excited again.</p><p></p><p>He had long yearned for the storage pouch, and finally obtained one! He took the storage pouch hanging at his waist, channeled his true qi to open the mouth of the pouch, and took a look inside. The pouch contained a stack of spirit tickets and a small pile of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were also some bottles and jars, as well as some spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Subjugation Venerable is truly wealthy!" Xu Yan quickly counted it all, becoming greatly excited, as he had regained his wealth.</p><p></p><p>The storage pouch was shaped like a toad, hanging at his waist like a small toad. The closed toad mouth was the opening of the pouch.</p><p></p><p>With the flow of true qi, he could open the mouth of the pouch and access the items inside conveniently.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully obtained the Demon Subjugation Venerable's treasures, and having also slain the Blood Demon King to further perfect his Life-and-Death Sword Wheels, Xu Yan did not linger and left the Withered Mountain, setting out for Cyan Wave Island.</p><p></p><p>In a certain city, he found the communication station of the Sword Venerable Cliff and sent a message to Xie Lingfeng, asking to meet on Cyan Wave Island.</p><p></p><p>"To avoid major turmoil and martial arts conflicts in the Inner Realm, and to transform the cultivation towards the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, a solution must be found. Only then can the Great Wilderness replace the Inner Realm," Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for how to transform the Inner Realm's martial arts into the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, he did not have a good method yet. Refining true qi could be done, but merely refining true qi was not a complete transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts scholars of the Seven Star Academy are well-versed in the Inner Realm's martial arts, having researched them deeply. If I teach them the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, perhaps they can research a method of transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Or I can further understand the essence of the Inner Realm's martial arts from them, and then try to devise a compromise method."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xu Yan had slain the peak grand master on Cyan Wave Island, no one dared to set foot on the island. After the battle at the Long Green Pavilion, with Cyan Wave Island belonging to the Great Wilderness domain, although some people passing by the Cyan River would occasionally glance at it with longing, they dared not approach, intimidated by Xu Yan's might.</p><p></p><p>Until Peng Yuan from the Seven Star Academy, leading seven martial arts scholars, came to reside on Cyan Wave Island.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the Seven Star Academy, they had been studying a book diligently for some time, repeatedly observing and contemplating, or taking out paper and pen to write something.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation of the martial arts never ceased.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Xu has arrived, please have a seat!" Peng Yuan and the others excitedly came over and pulled a chair for Xu Yan to sit down.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, Xu Yan was addressed as a Martial Arts Grand Scholar, so they addressed him as such.</p><p></p><p>They were all aware of the news of the battle at the Long Green Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Peng, you are too kind," Xu Yan smiled and clasped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others were the ones Xu Yan had selected from among the martial arts scholars. They were all true diligent researchers of the martial arts, as evidenced by their dark eye circles.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts research cannot be wasted a moment. Scholar Xu, look, is this the Great Wilderness Martial Dao?" Peng Yuan and the others, despite their dark eye circles, had bright and eager eyes, looking at Xu Yan with hopeful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let's not waste time." Xu Yan took out a small booklet.</p><p></p><p>This was the cultivation method for the foundational and entry-level stages of refining the skin, bones, and organs up to the realm of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"This is the foundational and entry-level cultivation method. You scholars can take a look. Furthermore, the Great Wilderness Martial Dao and the Inner Realm's martial arts are ultimately different. Nowadays, many Inner Realm martial artists want to transform their cultivation towards the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, but they lack the methods to do so.</p><p></p><p>"You scholars have dedicated your lives to researching the Inner Realm's martial arts. After understanding the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, you can research how to transform the Inner Realm's martial arts into the Great Wilderness Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others became solemn. The emergence of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao was a heavy blow to the martial arts world of the Inner Realm. Various signs indicated that the Great Wilderness Martial Dao was superior to the Inner Realm's martial arts, and which martial artist did not seek greater strength?</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Wilderness Martial Dao spread, the major powers would become uneasy, as their strength came not only from their own foundations, but also from the inherited martial arts techniques, which were far superior to the external martial arts. This was the reason for the great powers' strength.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Martial Dao would shake their foundations. Due to the shock of the battle at the Long Green Pavilion, these powers were deeply wary and had not taken any action yet.</p><p></p><p>Once they regained their composure and felt the strong threat, as it concerned the survival of their inheritances, they would inevitably join forces and fight for a chance at survival. To lower or avoid this martial arts conflict, the only solution was to develop a transformation method. The strong experts of the major powers, with their solid foundations, if they could successfully transform, would still maintain their advantages.</p><p></p><p>In this way, they would not have to take the risk of an all-out confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Inheritance was certainly important, but a more powerful martial arts cultivation method was clearly more important.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Xu, rest assured, we will devote ourselves wholeheartedly to this task, not only for the sake of others, but also for our own sake. We will definitely find a way to research and develop the transformation method," Peng Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

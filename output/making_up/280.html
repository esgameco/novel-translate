        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan and the others heard this, they raised their heads and looked up. They saw that the clouds in the sky were surging, and a terrifying power was sweeping in from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming's face was grave. "This is the supreme expert of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!" Xu Yan frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>This power had far surpassed the peak of Refining the Spirit realm! Moreover, it was stirring the winds and clouds of the heavens and earth, with a shocking and earth-shaking momentum, as if the winds and clouds of the heavens and earth were all under its control.</p><p></p><p>"To subdue the supreme expert of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect, I can only do it in the Spiritual Origin Realm!" Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But even entering the Spiritual Origin Realm might not be enough to suppress such a powerful expert. "Is this what a supreme expert is like?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his bald head and had a solemn expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>To trample the Thousand Martial Hall, he must subdue such a powerful expert. And where did Huang Liang's strength stand among the supreme experts of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect? Perhaps there were even stronger existences within the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>He felt some pressure, but more of an exhilarating passion. The stronger the Thousand Martial Hall, the more fulfilling it would be to trample it!</p><p></p><p>"One day, I will step on the Thousand Martial Hall and reach the peak of the Spiritual Realm!" Xu Yan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>He was not even twenty years old yet. In a few more years, stepping on the Thousand Martial Hall would not be impossible!</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang was rushing towards the capital of Zheng Kingdom. Li Xuan was sitting in the chair, indifferently watching, without removing the formation.</p><p></p><p>With Huang Liang's strength, he could detect the existence of the formation. The manor could not hide from him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the formation he had reinforced had been removed, and the current formation was set up by Fang Hao originally. It could conceal from those at the peak of Refining the Spirit realm, but could not hide from a powerful expert like Huang Liang.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what the supreme expert of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect is like!" As Huang Liang approached, Li Xuan suddenly understood why Yue Changming had said that it seemed to control the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was still far from being able to control the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Refining a wisp of the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into the spiritual soul, and then using this spiritual mechanism to sense the power of the heavens and earth, and condense a wisp of the power of the heavens and earth, although it is only a small wisp, it is still far beyond the peak of Refining the Spirit realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instantly understood how the supreme experts of the Spiritual Realm worked.</p><p></p><p>The so-called supreme experts were still at the Refining the Spirit and Heavenly Realm, the difference being that they had refined a wisp of the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into their spiritual souls, and could then use this spiritual mechanism to condense a wisp of the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Taisuang Martial Dao can only be cultivated by relying on the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth. And when one reaches the Refining the Spirit and Heavenly Realm, to advance further, one needs to refine the spiritual mechanism into the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>"Only by doing so can one condense the power of the heavens and earth. The Taisuang Martial Dao uses the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth as a bridge to communicate with the heavens and earth and comprehend the laws of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The more spiritual mechanisms one refines and condenses, the stronger one's strength will be.</p><p></p><p>"When the spiritual mechanisms are refined to a certain level, one can comprehend the laws of the heavens and earth, and then refine a wisp of the power of the heavenly laws into one's body..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan had already grasped the cultivation path after the Refining the Spirit and Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the martial dao he had created, which used the bridge of the heavens and earth to communicate with the heavens and earth and the great Dao, using one's own body as a bridge.</p><p></p><p>The Taisuang Martial Dao is based on the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth. Only where the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth is can one cultivate the martial dao, without being able to cultivate it apart from the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This is the limitation of the Taisuang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning of cultivation to the realm of the sect master, it is all about sensing the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth. As the cultivation level increases, one senses more and more. In the end, one needs to refine the spiritual mechanism into the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Only by refining the spiritual mechanism into the spiritual soul can one build the bridge to communicate with the laws of the heavens and earth, and continue to cultivate, and then refine the power of the laws into one's body.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Liang is not that strong among the supreme experts of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect. He has only refined a wisp of the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth. Although he can condense a wisp of the power of the heavens and earth with it, it is still too weak.</p><p></p><p>"He is still far from being able to contact the laws of the heavens and earth and refine the power of the heavenly laws into his body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a clear judgment of Huang Liang's strength, and also had a certain judgment of the peak strength of the supreme experts of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Refining a wisp of the power of the heavenly laws was already almost the limit.</p><p></p><p>An expert at this level, he could easily slap to death!</p><p></p><p>As for stronger experts, based on Li Xuan's understanding of the Taisuang Martial Dao, they did not exist in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because they were limited by the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth in the Spiritual Realm is more active than in the Inner Realm, but it is still not enough to support stronger cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Divine Consciousness Realm, Li Xuan's comprehension of the laws of the heavens and earth had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, he could sense the laws of the heavens and earth in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>He could even use the power of the divine consciousness to utilize the laws of the heavens and earth to some extent.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to his research on the laws of the heavens and earth in the Taisuang Book.</p><p></p><p>He had even found the operation pattern of the laws of the heavens and earth in the Spiritual Realm from the Taisuang Book.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the spiritual mechanism into the spiritual soul, this technique should be the core secret of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect, and also the fundamental reason for their strength.</p><p></p><p>"However, there should also be similar experts in the Spiritual Realm who have mastered the technique of refining the spiritual mechanism into the spiritual soul, but they are probably not as refined, fast, and efficient as the Chaoran Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, to refine the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into the spiritual soul, it is not enough to just have the technique. It also involves some comprehension of the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"There are also some other factors, and the requirements for talent are not low. Only those with spiritual bodies can more easily refine the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and understood the key points.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Yue Changming, this old man probably also knew the technique of refining the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into the spiritual soul, but it was probably a bit rougher, and the refinement efficiency was not high, and the requirements for the cultivator were very high.</p><p></p><p>Without a spiritual body, one cannot refine the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into the spiritual soul! This was also the reason why Yue Changming had not advanced further, because his spiritual body was flawed, so he could not refine the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang's powerful aura was approaching the manor. Xu Yan and the others were silently watching, not at all nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Huang Liang has already learned to use the power of the heavens and earth?" Fang Hao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Probably not yet," Xu Yan shook his head and pondered, "His aura is very strong, stirring the winds and clouds of the heavens and earth. I think he must have used some secret technique as a bridge to achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"If I break through the Unbreakable Golden Body's second layer, the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber can shatter his aura," Meng Chong said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke up, "It's just a matter of refining a wisp of the spiritual mechanism of the heavens and earth into the spiritual soul, and then using this spiritual mechanism to stir the winds and clouds of the heavens and earth and condense a wisp of the power of the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others suddenly understood, "So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was secretly shocked. This mysterious master of Xu Yan's had seen through it at a glance.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan had such confidence. It seemed his strength was probably not weaker than Huang Liang's, and must be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Yue Changming's heart calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"The weak like to flaunt their power, trying to show off their own strength. They are like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, or an ant trying to shake a tree. Huang Liang is just like that, an ant unaware of its own insignificance!" Li Xuan chuckled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Master is right!" Xu Yan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others also expressed their recognition.</p><p></p><p>Their master was so powerful, yet he never showed off his strength, but was as carefree as an ordinary person, not revealing any aura.</p><p></p><p>This was the true mark of a strong expert! Yue Changming was at a loss for words for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang was an ant? Perhaps... maybe in the eyes of this master, he was truly an ant?</p><p></p><p>Boom! Huang Liang suddenly stopped in his tracks, his gaze turning towards the manor.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So that's how you were able to conceal yourself! No wonder you could hide your true abilities!"</p><p></p><p>As Huang Liang paused, Zheng Huang and the other Lingzong clan elites who had rushed over were all filled with puzzlement. There, in the forest, there was no trace of Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and the formation dissipated, revealing the manor.</p><p></p><p>He sat in the chair, looking indifferently at Huang Liang. "How pitiful are these insects!"</p><p></p><p>He shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Turning to look at Xu Yan and the others, he said seriously, "Remember, do not think you are strong just because you have gained some power. You must know that there are people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens.</p><p></p><p>"What you consider your strength may actually be insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this Huang Liang, he is seen as the mightiest by others, but in my eyes, he is nothing more than an insect!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others had solemn expressions, respectfully bowing and saying, "Yes, Master. Your disciples will remember this."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang and the others were all stunned. This master of Xu Yan's was so arrogant. </p><p></p><p>To belittle the mightiest warrior right in front of him, and Xu Yan and the others actually listened to him respectfully, not even considering Huang Liang worthy of their attention.</p><p></p><p>Even Yue Changming was a little frightened.</p><p></p><p>But Yue'er's eyes were shining, and she also nodded, "I will definitely remember the elder's teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang was almost enraged.</p><p></p><p>However, he had come for Xu Yan's sword dao, and he would not kill anyone before obtaining the sword dao and understanding its origins.</p><p></p><p>He glared coldly at Yue Changming, not expecting that the other party had been saved, and although his spiritual body was gone, his injuries had almost completely healed.</p><p></p><p>"You have a lot of nerve. The remnant of the Ten Thousand Stars dares to save the one I want to kill? I shall kill him right in front of you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Huang Liang raised his spear, and the spear energy coalesced, thrusting towards Yue Changming. He wanted to intimidate this person and capture him, to interrogate him about the secrets of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>A single spear beam, like a falling meteor, caused the heavens and earth to tremble. The speed of the spear beam was not fast, but it was inescapable, locked onto by a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The slow-moving spear beam was like the arrival of death, with overwhelming pressure that threatened to shatter the mind and soul. </p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, there was only this one spear beam! Huang Liang undoubtedly intended to crush the enemy's will, giving them a powerful sense of oppression and despair.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang and the other Xingzhen warriors trembled and hurriedly retreated.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Is this the power of the mightiest warrior?</p><p></p><p>A casual strike of the spear beam, as if it had gathered the power of heaven and earth, could still make them feel a suffocating sensation, even though it was not aimed at them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared intently at the manor, wanting to see how Li Xuan would block this strike.</p><p></p><p>"This person is doomed!" This was the thought of all the Xingzhen warriors.</p><p></p><p>The spear beam fell slowly, directly targeting Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>But in the manor, Li Xuan raised his teacup and took a sip of spiritual tea, looking at the pale-faced Yue Changming and calmly said, "How does it feel? Feel this attack, and you can refine the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into your soul."</p><p></p><p>The spear beam was less than three feet away from Yue Changming, about to completely annihilate him.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's face showed panic, and she was too late to intervene.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a hand reached out and grasped the spear beam.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The spear beam shattered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the suddenly grave-faced Huang Liang and indifferently said, "I said you are an insect, and you are an insect. Today, let you know how insignificant you are!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a towering figure stood in the heavens, with eyes like the sun, hair flowing like the laws of heaven and earth, and a terrifying aura like a divine demon descending.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang's mind and soul were shaken, his liver and gallbladder about to burst, his whole body trembling, and his spear falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, at the figure like a divine demon standing before him, the two suns in the sky burning into him.</p><p></p><p>Thud! "You, you, you..." Huang Liang was so shocked he couldn't even speak.</p><p></p><p>And Zheng Huang and the other Xingzhen experts were almost on the verge of a mental breakdown, staring in terror at this divine demonic figure, their souls trembling, faces pale, livers and gallbladders shaking.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Even the air was filled with the stench of urine...</p><p></p><p>How terrifying! No wonder he said Huang Liang was an insect - he was truly an insect, no, even less than an insect! In the manor, Xu Yan and the others were also greatly shocked. This figure towering to the heavens, with eyes like the sun and hair flowing like the laws of heaven and earth, was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, they were greatly excited. They finally saw their master reveal a glimpse of his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was dumbfounded. He had thought the other party was arrogant and powerful, able to look down on Huang Liang. </p><p></p><p>But in comparison, Huang Liang was truly an insect!</p><p></p><p>And he himself was even less than an insect.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's mouth hung open, completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu Yan's teacher is so strong, so strong! What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>In the Lingyu Realm, had they ever heard of such a terrifying martial art?</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan displayed his "Controlling the Heavens and Earth" technique, he instantly appeared like a divine demon descending upon the Lingyu Realm, and Huang Liang had truly become an insect in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is what a true expert is!" </p><p></p><p>The feeling of overlooking the heavens, the earth, and all living beings, the feeling of being an unparalleled expert, he finally experienced it.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Liang, how are you not an insect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke indifferently, his voice like thunderous roars, causing Huang Liang's ears to ring and his soul to tremble.</p><p></p><p>He tried to gather a thread of heaven and earth's power to stabilize himself, but the heaven and earth's power seemed to be blocked, as if it had been drained away.</p><p></p><p>He could not gather it! "It would be a blessing for you to die by my hand," Li Xuan said indifferently, pressing down with a finger.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The earth seemed to be on the verge of shattering, the heavens and earth shaking. Huang Liang frantically activated his cultivation techniques and secret martial arts, even wanting to say something, but unable to.</p><p></p><p>Before the finger even pressed down, his physical body had already cracked, his soul violently trembling.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Huang Liang's physical body disintegrated, his soul dissipated, completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The mightiest warrior of the Qianwu Palace couldn't even let out a final scream before dying.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang and the other Xingzhen warriors all prostrated themselves on the ground, trembling in fear, not daring to even look up.</p><p></p><p>So terrifying, so powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, insects are just insects. If I didn't let him see someone beyond people and heavens beyond heavens, he wouldn't know his own insignificance and dare to call himself the mightiest warrior!" Li Xuan shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>After casually crushing Huang Liang with a finger, Li Xuan retracted his "Controlling the Heavens and Earth" technique, sitting back in the chair and leisurely sipping his tea, as if he had just casually crushed an ant, insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Around him, all the Xingzhen warriors remained prostrate on the ground, daring not to rise for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also had expressions of shock on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The Yue family was completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt very satisfied. This "Controlling the Heavens and Earth" technique had shocked the entire world!</p>

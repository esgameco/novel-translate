        <h1>Chapter 448</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some profound cultivation techniques were comprehended and successfully cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The number of immortal celestial lords who cultivated supernatural powers also increased significantly, which meant that the upper echelons of the Qinghua Sect had a huge boost in strength in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan worked even harder, praising himself for his wise decision back then. It was precisely because of that wise decision that he was able to seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, following by the side of a great master was the greatest opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Look at those guys in the Nine Mountains Realm, fighting endlessly without seeking to improve themselves, not even realizing there was a great opportunity right beside them.</p><p></p><p>Bah, they deserve it!</p><p></p><p>A bunch of simple-minded wastes!</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan looked towards the direction of the Nine Mountains Realm and scorned them fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"I, Feng Yan, elder of the Qinghua Sect, the most capable assistant to Sect Leader Fang Hao and Pavilion Master Su Lingxiu, highly efficient in handling matters, deeply trusted!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan walked with a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan, go fetch me tens of thousands of catties of crimson blood gold," Su Lingxiu's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Right away, I'll go immediately!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan hurriedly flew off at once, as if afraid someone would steal the task from him.</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan gave an impromptu lecture on the Dao and received the title of Qinghua Dao Ancestor, gaining the halo of a Dao Ancestor, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to his great undertaking of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He even greatly reduced the frequency of using the Thousand Machinations to tease Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>Most of his time was spent on compiling martial arts, using the Golden Book of the Great Dao to compile martial arts above the Dao Realm level and perfect the entire martial arts system.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by swiftly. For Li Xuan, who was immersed in his great martial arts undertaking, five years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>As his realm increased and his strength grew stronger, time became less and less sensitive to him.</p><p></p><p>The later martial arts realms became more profound, requiring more theories and techniques to be compiled. Fortunately, he had the Golden Book of the Great Dao, otherwise it would have been difficult to create logically consistent martial arts methods out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The direction of martial arts after the Dao Establishment Realm was roughly determined. Even so, compiling the subsequent martial arts realms and methods was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>After all, the later realms involved more profound issues, and had to maintain their inherent power. Therefore, Li Xuan had to repeatedly deliberate, delete and add, until he was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of my great martial arts undertaking, for the sake of my Dao Ancestor status, it's all worth it," Li Xuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>It was just compiling, not requiring him to cultivate arduously, so it wasn't considered too hard.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the second level of the Great Sun Star Immortal Body. Your Great Sun Star Immortal Body has reached small success in the third level."</p><p></p><p>Feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao appeared.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through, entering the Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally broken through," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has undergone extreme transformation, evolving into a Vajra Dao Body. You have obtained an Innate Immortal Dao Body."</p><p></p><p>The feedback of Meng Chong evolving into a Dao Body caused the Innate Dao Body to upgrade to an Innate Immortal Dao Body.</p><p></p><p>"When that girl Su Lingxiu transforms, what kind of Dao Body will I obtain? Now it's already an Innate Immortal Dao Body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very curious about what kind of Dao Body the Golden Book would give him as feedback when Su Lingxiu broke through next. He looked up towards the location of the Great Mountain Heavenly Cave, now called the Great Mountain Divine Furnace. This heavenly cave had been completely transformed by Su Lingxiu into a divine furnace of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Once netherworld creatures entered, they would be refined into pure blood essence. From outside the heavenly cave, it drew in extraterrestrial qi, which was now being melted and refined.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was currently inside the Great Mountain Divine Furnace, preparing for her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong has broken through, it's going to get lively again," Li Xuan anticipated eagerly.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan broke through, he began a killing spree. The number of immortal celestial lords who fell at his hands had already exceeded ten.</p><p></p><p>His fame spread throughout the Divine Realm. Even powerful immortal celestial lords changed color at the mention of Sword Immortal Xu Yan's name.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was hunted by the Myriad Treasures Alliance and encountered danger several times. This breakthrough would certainly not end well for them. He would surely kill until the Myriad Treasures Alliance changed color, kill until they bowed their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping is also about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Once Jiang Buping broke through, the Divine Realm would have another god of killing.</p><p></p><p>"Continue my great martial arts undertaking."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immersed himself in his martial arts undertaking again.</p><p></p><p>A year later, Su Lingxiu broke through to the Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Void Breaking Realm. Her alchemy and medical martial arts have reached small success in the Heaven and Earth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to anticipate what kind of upgrade he would receive when Su Lingxiu evolved into a Dao Body.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has undergone extreme transformation, evolving into an Evergreen Dao Body. You have obtained an Innate Great Dao Body."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt himself become stronger again. Due to the Innate Great Dao Body, it seemed as if Dao qi had been born within his body.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not entered the Dao Establishment Realm, his inner world seemed to have already laid the foundation of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"A Great Dao Body, another upgrade," Li Xuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I shouldn't be weaker than Meiwu, I might even be stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's confidence greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>With an Innate Great Dao Body, small success in the Heaven and Earth Realm, and numerous powerful martial arts divine abilities, he could easily suppress Meiwu now.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Meiwu entered this world now, I could send her flying out."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, only improving one's strength brings the greatest joy."</p><p></p><p>After Su Lingxiu's breakthrough, another year passed, and Xu Yan broke through to small success in the Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, with a loud boom, a burst of green light emerged from the Qinghua Realm, illuminating the entire sky. In an instant, the entire Qinghua Realm seemed to enter a mystical space.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Great Array was completed on this day.</p><p></p><p>The entire Qinghua Realm was within the great array, as if forming an independent space.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy has increased by more than double, and is still increasing."</p><p></p><p>"Our Qinghua Sect will surely become the number one great sect in the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is still increasing, I feel my bottleneck loosening, I'm going to seclude myself for a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Do you sense that the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms seem to have become more active?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have that feeling too. The upper limit of the Immortal Realm seems to be breaking!"</p><p></p><p>"Great, we can finally break through the Immortal Realm's limit even in the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Within the Qinghua Sect, the martial artists were excited and discussing enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>The immortal celestial lords were even more overjoyed. The upper limit of heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms had been broken and was becoming increasingly active.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was slowly and continuously rising, which meant that the Immortal Realm was no longer the limit in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>No, to be precise, the Immortal Realm was no longer the limit in the Qinghua Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao is about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up towards the core of the Qinghua Great Array, where Fang Hao's body was shrouded in light.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly and earthly wondrous patterns were appearing, and the entire heavenly and earthly momentum was converging and pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough was also a huge transformation for Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>The Qimen martial arts would reach an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Hao broke through, Li Xuan's Qimen martial arts also improved, reaching the Heaven and Earth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>With this, all five of his martial arts had reached the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Fang Hao's breakthrough, Jiang Buping also broke through.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! On this day, the heavens and earth rumbled again, and the sound continued for a long time. However, due to the protection of the Qinghua Sect's grand formation, apart from the Immortal Heavenly Venerable, no other martial artists felt it.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, the divine realm and even the entire world are likely to undergo great changes. Our Qinghua Sect must also prepare countermeasures," Emperor Dayue said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and said, "Continue to strengthen the Qinghua Grand Formation. Now that I've broken through, I will personally set up key points. With this formation, we can cope with major changes."</p><p></p><p>After his breakthrough, Fang Hao was full of confidence. </p><p></p><p>Now, he was truly the number one expert in the Qinghua Sect. Although his senior sister was also very powerful, Fang Hao was confident that his senior sister, who wasn't skilled in combat, was probably no match for him.</p><p></p><p>As for Emperor Dayue and the other two, they were no longer his match now.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Qinghua Sect began preparations again, especially preparations targeting the Heavenly Caves.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also began to take action, transforming the Heavenly Caves one by one into divine furnaces of heaven and earth, dispatching the sect's alchemists to preside over the divine furnaces and refine pills using them.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Qinghua Sect did not lack medicinal pills, and their strength began to enter a stage of rapid improvement again, especially the prodigies from various places who received focused cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and two years passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, unexpectedly, Red Cat came running back.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!" </p><p></p><p>Red Cat rubbed against Li Xuan's leg.</p><p></p><p>"What, you've broken through and are ready to establish a demon race?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tapped its head with the jade ruyi scepter in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!" </p><p></p><p>Red Cat nodded.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Void-Breaking realm, Red Cat's confidence greatly increased. Now its strength was even greater than Wind Spirit Tiger's, so naturally it wouldn't continue to be a junior brother.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Little Ha and Jade Little Dragon were also about to break through.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the demon race was imminent, but the mission promised to Tian Shiqi was also approaching, and Wind Spirit Tiger was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Wind Spirit Tiger had indeed treated it well and trusted it extremely, so Red Cat came back this time wanting to save Wind Spirit Tiger's life.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger was foolish and overconfident, but Red Cat knew that Wind Spirit Tiger's departure might be life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>"You big cat, you do have some loyalty." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed a jade talisman to Red Cat, "Alright, go about your business."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was extremely excited and acted cute for a while before running off to find Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Red Cat, you're back!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Red Cat acting cute, Li Xuan's mouth twitched. How did he end up catching such a fierce tiger back then?</p><p></p><p>It didn't have any tiger-like qualities at all.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger, one of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings. This Red Cat has great ambitions, wanting to bring the Twelve Kings under its command and unify the spirit beast race of the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled. The greater Red Cat's ambitions, the better. After all, the stronger the demon race became, the stronger his Demon Ancestor true form would become as well.</p><p></p><p>"This Red Cat's Great Demon Divine Ability has been cultivated quite well. I should give it some more guidance later."</p><p></p><p>As Red Cat's strength increased, the Great Demon Martial Way naturally became more refined, and Red Cat also gained more insights into the Great Demon Martial Way.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to thoroughly refine the Way of the Great Demon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Since Red Cat wanted to establish the demon race and become the Great Demon King, it must have some means of control, so it was time to refine it.</p><p></p><p>"Demon race bloodline intimidation, preventing subordination, or techniques like the Demon King's Seal and other Great Demon arts can all be refined. As long as spirit beasts cultivate the Great Demon Martial Way, they will be intimidated by Red Cat as the Demon King..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had ideas in mind and opened the Golden Book of the Great Dao to begin refining.</p><p></p><p>This time when Red Cat returned, it brought back a large number of divine herbs and various treasures. Su Lingxiu refined pills for it and created new pills more suitable for the demon race.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had no choice but to take time to refine some divine artifacts for Red Cat, all of which were demon race divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, are you arming the demon race?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat patted its chest with a proud look on its face. It was planning to find an opportunity to unify the Nine Mountains Region.</p><p></p><p>When Red Cat got what it needed and prepared to return to the Nine Mountains Region, it came to bid farewell to its master Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have the heart to establish the demon race, you should contemplate more on the Way of the Great Demon. This will help you rule over the demon race."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed, transmitting the more refined Great Demon Martial Way into Red Cat's soul.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Region, Red Cat returned.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, Tian Shiqi will soon come to find you. This journey will certainly have some dangers. I happened to obtain a supreme treasure that will surely save big brother's life in times of crisis."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat stuffed the jade talisman to Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"Dear brother!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger was deeply moved. "Don't worry, with your big brother's strong abilities, how could Tian Shiqi possibly ambush me? Take this supreme treasure back, dear brother."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat secretly despised Wind Spirit Tiger in its heart. With that brain of yours, you'd help count money for someone who sold you.</p><p></p><p>As for Tian Shiqi, that guy's strength was definitely stronger than Wind Spirit Tiger's. Since it broke through to the Void-Breaking realm, it had sensed this.</p><p></p><p>And much stronger too. Even after its breakthrough, it was no match for Tian Shiqi.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I am very safe here and won't have any problems. On the contrary, big brother's journey will certainly have unknown dangers. I'll only be at ease if big brother takes this supreme treasure."</p><p></p><p>With a few words, Red Cat persuaded Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Then, it instructed Wind Spirit Tiger again, telling it to be smarter, especially to find opportunities to extort some treasures from Tian Shiqi.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was certain that Wind Spirit Tiger's mission was extremely important, and Tian Shiqi would endure Wind Spirit Tiger's various extortions along the way.</p><p></p><p>"I'll save Wind Spirit Tiger's life once, and when it comes back, it doesn't need to be the big brother anymore. I'll leave an elder position for it in the demon race, which will be enough to repay our friendship."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat muttered to itself.</p><p></p><p>"Dear brother, I understand. Before reaching the destination, I'll try to find opportunities to extort some treasures from Tian Shiqi. If he doesn't give them to me, I won't leave. I get it!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger patted its chest to show it understood.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, Tian Shiqi arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, King Red Cat!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi looked at this striped fierce tiger and was slightly surprised. Why did this big tiger's aura seem different after breaking through?</p><p></p><p>But he didn't think deeply about it. After all, due to bloodline reasons, spirit beasts' auras could be unusual, and even awakening bloodline inheritance methods could cause differences.</p><p></p><p>"King Wind Spirit, let's go. This mission's task relies on King Wind Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, no problem!" </p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger stood up but then said, "We don't know when we'll return from this journey. My dear brother has just broken through and needs to guard Spirit Venerable Mountain, with no time to search for treasures and resources. Tian Shiqi, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi's mouth twitched, and even Red Cat was surprised. Had Wind Spirit Tiger's brain started working?</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter."</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi naturally wouldn't cause trouble at this critical moment. It was just some treasures after all.</p><p></p><p>He casually gave Red Cat a storage bag of treasures.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger nodded with satisfaction. Sure enough, dear brother was right. Along this journey, it must find more opportunities to extort a large amount from Tian Shiqi.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tian Shiqi and Wind Spirit Tiger left, Red Cat began to gather spirit beasts to establish the demon race!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

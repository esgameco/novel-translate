        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Cat, you heartless creature! I poured my heart and soul into you, sincerely caring for you, yet you still treat me this way? That thick gold chain around your neck, I was the one who bought it for you."</p><p></p><p>After healing his wounds, Shi Er stood before Crimson Cat, angrily voicing his grievances.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Cat looked ashamed, raising his paws to indicate that he would be gentler next time.</p><p></p><p>In the subsequent training sessions, Crimson Cat did indeed use less force, no longer breaking Shi Er's ribs. However, he still batted Shi Er around like a ball, not stopping even when Shi Er asked him to.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Shi Er could no longer endure it that Crimson Cat finally stopped, wearing an expression as if he was doing it for Shi Er's own good.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when will Crimson Cat become a great demon?" Suling Xiu asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"When the time is ripe and the opportunity arises, he will become a great demon," Li Xuan replied evasively, not knowing when exactly Crimson Cat would achieve that milestone.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Crimson Cat's transformation into a great demon was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had returned.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have broken through to the Tong Xuan Realm," he reported.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have... invited some martial arts scholars from the Seven Star Academy to Canglan Island. I feel they are truly passionate about the martial dao, so I want to pass on to them the techniques of the Qi Blood Realm and the Innate Realm, so they can research them," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Long Qing Pavilion would be moving to Canglan Island. After all, the Great Wilderness was still the Great Wilderness, and while the Long Qing Pavilion might be a holy land of the Great Wilderness, it was not the Great Wilderness itself. Xu Yan needed to renovate Canglan Island and then pass on the martial arts techniques of the Qi Blood Realm and the Innate Realm to the martial arts scholars, to see what they could uncover.</p><p></p><p>This was also a way to spread the martial arts of the Great Wilderness. Starting from the Seven Star Academy, the true dissemination would reach the entire Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart stirred upon hearing this. He had been anticipating the matter of Inner Domain cultivators transitioning their cultivation. If they could research a successful method of transitioning to the Great Wilderness martial arts, even a small portion of the vast number of Inner Domain martial artists above the Third Rank achieving success would bring him considerable feedback.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Martial Shadows would soon be complete, with nine hundred shadow images. Further progress towards the Thousand Martial and Ten Thousand Martial would also receive rapid feedback.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts scholars of the Seven Star Academy, having always researched the martial dao, likely had a deeper understanding of the martial arts of the Inner Domain than most.</p><p></p><p>And those who delved into the martial dao must possess extraordinary talents. Perhaps they could even research a successful method of transitioning to the Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Li Xuan nodded, then added, "Xie Lingfeng has refined his true qi, but he is not a true Innate Realm cultivator. You can have them research how to transition as well.</p><p></p><p>"The insights they gain will be their own harvest. Let them comprehend it themselves."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paused and then nodded. This was in line with his master's teaching philosophy - if they wanted to transition to the Great Wilderness martial arts, they would have to comprehend it themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. I will notify Brother Xie to come to Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan further suggested, "If you are so inclined, you can also provide some guidance. You might gain some insights into the transformation between different martial arts as well."</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan participated in the research, it would likely take the martial arts scholars and Xie Lingfeng much less time to comprehend the true method of transition.</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's prodigious talents, having already reached the Tong Xuan Realm, his understanding of the Innate Realm and below would be unparalleled, giving him the best chance of comprehending the transitioning method.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Xuan felt that if Xu Yan truly grasped it, he might gain even more insights and new realizations in the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Lest Xu Yan devote too much of his attention to researching the transitioning method, Li Xuan added, "Of course, the cultivation and comprehension of your own martial dao should be the priority."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan respectfully acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>Before departing for Canglan Island, Xu Yan spent a few days with his family, guiding his parents' cultivation. Xu Junhe was almost ready to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once Xu Junhe broke through the Innate Realm, he would have a certain level of self-defense within the Inner Domain. However, he would not venture too far from the Long Qing Pavilion, delegating various affairs to others to handle.</p><p></p><p>When the renovation of Canglan Island was complete and the Long Qing Pavilion moved there, Xu Junhe would also go to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, Guo Rongshan, as the Grand Elder of the Great Wilderness Cabinet, would not be going to Canglan Island but would remain in the Great Wilderness. However, his safety was not a major concern.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, there were virtually no powerful figures daring to make a move against the Great Wilderness. Moreover, Guo Rongshan's relationship with Xu Yan was kept confidential, so he would not be targeted due to his connection with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the rapidly developing Great Wilderness had recruited reliable powerful figures, more than capable of handling any crises.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly. Before his departure for Canglan Island, Xu Yan guided the cultivation of Meng Chong and Suling Xiu, then set out for Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he would stop to retrieve the treasures left behind by the Fire Slaughter Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The major forces in the Inner Domain all had communication methods. Currently, the Long Qing Pavilion was using the communication system of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, but relying on others was not entirely reliable.</p><p></p><p>To establish their own communication system, they needed cultivators skilled in raising messenger falcons, as well as providing the spiritual herbs and spiritual grains to feed the falcons.</p><p></p><p>To this end, they had recruited skilled falcon trainers and selected loyal pavilion members to learn falcon cultivation. As for the feed for the falcons, they directly used medicinal pills as a substitute.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had specifically researched the medicinal pills that the falcons could eat, which were simple to refine, low in cost, and would make the falcons more obedient and sharper.</p><p></p><p>The falcon communication system was in the initial stages of being established. However, to fully mature and reach the level of the top major forces, capable of communicating across the entire Inner Domain, would still require a long period of accumulation.</p><p></p><p>But for communication within the Great Wilderness alone, it would not take too much time.</p><p></p><p>The first fixed falcon communication route would be between the Great Wilderness City and Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through to the Innate Realm and reached its pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has opened eighteen apertures, breaking through to the complete Great Sun Golden Body Innate Realm. Your Great Sun Golden Body has broken through to the Tong Xuan Realm."</p><p></p><p>Golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. The Great Sun Golden Body had broken through to the Tong Xuan Realm, further strengthening its power. With just its physical body, it could easily defeat Half-Step Celestials without any difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's breakthrough to the complete Innate Realm had completed a small cycle for the Great Sun Golden Body, which was now accumulating its own foundation to prepare for the breakthrough to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tong Xuan Realm Great Sun Golden Body had a cycle of thirty-six golden body apertures, possessing the ability to transform.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had refined a batch of medicinal pills to nourish Meng Chong, allowing him to accumulate his foundation more quickly and reach completion.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Suling Xiu also broke through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also received feedback from the Pill Dao and Martial Dao, allowing him to reach the Tong Xuan Realm in those two cultivation systems as well.</p><p></p><p>The three martial cultivation systems had all reached the Tong Xuan Realm, further strengthening his overall power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion continued to grow stronger, and the Great Wilderness gradually stabilized. Kou Ruozhi, along with the Emperors of Qi and Wu, continued to infiltrate the Great Yue Kingdom and gather the hearts of the people.</p><p></p><p>They had already begun to make contact with a certain high-ranking official of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>They promised him a position in the Great Wilderness Cabinet.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness Guard cultivated the technique of refining true qi, the martial arts masters of the Guard saw their strength increase by more than 30% through the refinement of true qi.</p><p></p><p>As a result, more martial artists became eager to join the Guard and learn the technique of refining true qi.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Great Wilderness also became increasingly renowned, and the martial arts of the Great Wilderness spread throughout the inner domain. Many young men and women who had not yet cultivated turned the cultivation of the Great Wilderness martial arts into their goal.</p><p></p><p>Even some clan geniuses directly abandoned their clan's inherited martial arts techniques and came to the Great Wilderness to study the Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the increasing number of Bai Wu Shen Ying (Hundred Martial Shadows), Li Xuan knew that more and more martial arts beginners were arriving.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Great Wilderness was naturally the most unsettling for the Great Yue Kingdom, as it was within the borders of the Great Yue Kingdom, and they had also developed a grudge with each other.</p><p></p><p>Ceding land and compensating the Great Wilderness was already a humiliating matter, but the battle at the Long Qing Pavilion was so terrifying that the Great Yue Kingdom did not dare to take any action.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had not left the courtyard of the Long Qing Pavilion, the Bai Wu Shen Ying almost covered the entire Great Wilderness City, coming and going without a trace. Even martial arts masters found it difficult to detect them.</p><p></p><p>As long as they did not actively reveal themselves, martial arts masters could not detect them. Only when they actively revealed themselves could one see a shadow, which seemed a bit unreal.</p><p></p><p>There were occasionally some malicious intents in the Great Wilderness City, as well as some spies of certain forces, but these people often disappeared without a trace when they tried to act.</p><p></p><p>They were instantly killed by a mysterious shadow, leaving no trace of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Although each of Li Xuan's Bai Wu Shen Ying was only at the Blood Qi Realm, his Blood Qi Realm power could easily kill martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that his days were comfortable, with the Great Wilderness City firmly in his grasp. When the interest arose, he would guide the cultivating young men and women.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared, and the feedback from the Golden Finger came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Half-Step Celestial Being, and your Annihilation Sword Intent has been enhanced, and your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled. Xu Yan had only left a few days ago, how could he have already slain a Half-Step Celestial Being? Where did this Half-Step Celestial Being come from?</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly. Could it be that a Half-Step Celestial Being had targeted Xu Yan? Was it the Sky Treasure Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>He then recalled that Xu Yan was on his way to Cang Lan Island to visit the treasure trove of the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign. Could it be a powerful figure from the Demon Sect?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has already broken through to the Penetrating Realm, so this is just delivering experience to him on a silver platter," Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's current strength, he could even contend with a true Celestial Being, not just a Half-Step Celestial Being. After clashing with the Master of the Hidden Pavilion and the Withered Demon Sovereign, Li Xuan had gained some understanding of Celestial Being martial artists. The greatest power of Celestial Beings lies in their Celestial Might.</p><p></p><p>Under suppression, martial artists below Celestial Beings are utterly powerless, as if a great mountain is pressing down on their consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when facing Celestial Being martial artists, they have almost no resistance. However, their Celestial Might, sword intent, and blade intent can be resisted, and once they lose this advantage, the strongest techniques of Celestial Being martial artists become ineffective.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely for this reason that Xu Yan, even when facing a true Martial Dao Celestial Being, can still contend with them!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On his way to Cang Lan Island, Xu Yan took out the map of the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign's treasure trove. As one of the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns, his treasure trove must contain many precious items.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign, Xu Yan was almost certain that he did not have a storage bag on him.</p><p></p><p>If the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign had a storage bag, it must be in this treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not carry it on his person, perhaps the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign was worried that it would attract the covetous gaze of the Black-Robed Ones, so he did not carry it with him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether the treasure trove recorded on the map was real or not was still unknown at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Going to explore it would not take much time, and perhaps the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign was confident in his own treasure trove, and the map's record was true.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered the map and began to search for the location it indicated.</p><p></p><p>The treasure trove of the Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign was in a desolate place, with a few withered mountains and no vegetation. Faint miasma swirled in the mountain valleys.</p><p></p><p>This kind of place would not be visited by ordinary martial artists. Once they inhaled the miasma, they would either die or be severely poisoned. Even great masters would not frequent this area.</p><p></p><p>The withered mountains were desolate, without even the sound of insects or birds, as if it were a land of death.</p><p></p><p>"That Burning Extermination Demon Sovereign, cultivating a killing technique, this place poses no threat to him, and it may even be beneficial for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those who wanted to kill him could never find his trace. When he appeared on Cang Lan Island, there were rumors of a peak great master trying to kill him, but he was blocked by someone, probably a powerful figure from the Demon Sect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself as he looked at the map and headed towards one of the withered mountains.</p><p></p><p>The miasma and poisonous mist here posed no threat to him. He boldly made his way forward.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Penetrating Realm, his strength had greatly increased, and he had also transformed into a Mountain and River Spirit Body, no longer fearing these poisonous mists. He was full of confidence, and even if he encountered someone like the Master of the Hidden Pavilion, he could still slay them.</p><p></p><p>This was a good opportunity to hone the Life and Death Sword Wheel that he had comprehended when he broke through to the Penetrating Realm.</p><p></p><p>This sword technique was still in its initial form and had not been fully comprehended. Finding a powerful opponent to practice on would likely allow him to master it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped halfway up one of the withered mountains. There was a protruding rock here, and according to the map's description, the treasure trove was behind this rock.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and slapped the rock, which instantly crumbled into powder, revealing a cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly, as he vaguely felt that there was something unusual inside.</p><p></p><p>Fearless as an accomplished expert, Xu Yan was not afraid at all. He stepped into the cave and continued forward.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the path ahead was blocked.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and slapped the stone wall, turning it to powder, unable to find the opening mechanism, and simply forced his way through.</p><p></p><p>He continued to advance.</p><p></p><p>Turning a corner, Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He had arrived in a stone chamber within the withered mountain. The walls of the chamber were inlaid with luminous pearls, like twinkling stars.</p><p></p><p>The faint light illuminated the chamber, making the large space not too dark, but giving it an eerie feeling.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that caught his eye was a blood-red stone sarcophagus, as if it had been soaked in fresh blood. Under the faint light, it gave a terrifying and horrifying impression.</p><p></p><p>In front of the blood-red sarcophagus was a small stone table, on which rested a gray pouch.</p><p></p><p>The shape of the pouch resembled a crouching toad. Xu Yan's eyes burned with excitement, as the long-coveted storage pouch finally appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, glancing around the chamber, then his gaze rested on the blood-red sarcophagus for a moment before focusing on the storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare treasure in the inner domain. Even if the contents of the pouch were not valuable, the pouch itself was a precious item! (Chapter end)</p>

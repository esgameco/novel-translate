            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 33: Disciple, I will pass on the Subduing the Dragon Palm to you</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan struck out with a palm, and his qi and blood transformed into a torrential flow that struck a tree dozens of yards away. The massive tree, as thick as a thigh, was instantly shattered to pieces by the palm strike, with fragments flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"The power is not bad, but the consumption of qi and blood is quite large.</p><p></p><p>"It's true that relying solely on the brute force of qi and blood is not enough. If I encounter an opponent of similar strength, I will definitely be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"I've already got an idea for this palm technique, I'll compile the palm technique formula and pass it on to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"What about the body technique? How do I pass it on? I don't know how to demonstrate it myself. Relying solely on brute strength won't show the subtlety of the body technique."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the body technique problem, Li Xuan became troubled again.</p><p></p><p>"Am I overthinking this? Why do I need to demonstrate it to my disciple? Just pass on the formula and theoretical framework, and let him comprehend it himself."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Outside the village, he found a flat area.</p><p></p><p>"How was the Bagua diagram drawn again?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recalled the Bagua diagram he had seen in his previous life, and waved his hand, causing streams of qi and blood to flow out and draw it on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I think it's like this."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Bagua diagram he had drawn on the ground, Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan returned, he would let him cultivate the body technique here. </p><p></p><p>And at the same time, let him ponder the Bagua, who knows, he might gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready, just waiting for his disciple Xu Yan to return.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned home in less than ten days.</p><p></p><p>After violently pushing back the bandit's lair, he realized his lack of martial arts skills, and didn't stay at home for long, hurrying back.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully paid his respects, pondering how to bring up the matter of asking his master to teach him martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, stood up, and headed towards the outskirts of the village.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've returned, come with me."</p><p></p><p>Before his disciple could speak, he passed on the martial arts techniques, demonstrating the profound and inscrutable mastery of his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled, not knowing what his master had in store.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at a small hillside outside the village.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clasped his hands behind his back and said, "Disciple, although you have entered the martial dao, you only have a strong physique, but don't know how to utilize it or how to fight opponents.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is not just about reaching a certain realm, the more powerful the martial artist, the more exquisite and powerful the martial techniques and divine abilities they possess."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was extremely excited: "Master is going to teach me martial dao divine abilities? I'm no longer just a brute who only knows how to use brute force!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned around and looked at his foolish disciple, speaking in a deep voice, "Today, I will pass on to you the Subduing the Dragon Palm, which is both a martial technique and a martial dao divine ability. The higher the realm, the deeper the comprehension, the greater the power."</p><p></p><p>Since it was a martial dao technique, Li Xuan had originally wanted to call it the Eighteen Subduing the Dragon Palms, but then he thought the eighteen palms limit would be too restrictive, and might limit his disciple's room for comprehension.</p><p></p><p>So he simply called it the Subduing the Dragon Palm. The name didn't matter, the power was the key.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he positioned the Subduing the Dragon Palm as something that could continuously improve with the increase in realm, reaching the level of a martial dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Whether he could succeed or not, it all depended on his disciple's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Subduing the Dragon Palm!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immediately excited: "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"The dragon is a divine beast, possessing immense power and divine abilities... Disciple, do you know this?" Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've read in an ancient storybook about the legends of the true dragon, which is the supreme symbol, its movements causing wind and thunder, making heaven and earth change color..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully said, "This world actually has legends of dragons as well? I don't know if the books I've read were just fictional stories, or if dragons truly existed in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit surprised. Since this world also had legends of dragons, and Xu Yan had read related story books, it would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do real dragons truly exist in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked excitedly and curiously.</p><p></p><p>"That is too distant from you. Whether they exist or not, when you become powerful enough, you will naturally know the answer."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally would not give a definite answer on such questions.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I shall teach you the Subduing Dragon Palm. This palm technique is named 'Subduing Dragon', so you should know how powerful it is."</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, watch carefully."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, he raised his hand and struck out a palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The powerful qi and might instantly shattered a tree dozens of feet away that was as thick as a thigh!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was dumbfounded! </p><p></p><p>The power of the Subduing Dragon Palm was so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied with his reaction, withdrew his hand, and clasped it behind his back, beginning to speak nonsense, "This is the power of the Subduing Dragon Palm revealed at the Qi Blood Realm entry level. </p><p></p><p>"However, as your master, I did not use the true form of the Subduing Dragon Palm in order to not interfere with your comprehension of its true essence."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened respectfully, his face flushed red, showing his inner excitement.</p><p></p><p>"This was just a casual strike from Master at the Qi Blood Realm entry level, yet it had such terrifying power. And Master did not even use the true Subduing Dragon Palm form - the Subduing Dragon Palm must be incredibly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression became serious as he began to explain the Subduing Dragon Palm, "The true form of the Subduing Dragon Palm releases a dragon-shaped palm force, fierce and agile like a true dragon. The deeper your comprehension, the more true dragon palm forces you can unleash..."</p><p></p><p>He then casually struck out a few palms while explaining to his disciple, "I did not demonstrate the true dragon palm force to you, fearing that you would become trapped in the true dragon essence of my Subduing Dragon Palm. Once you are trapped in it, you will be unable to cultivate your own Subduing Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>"I do not wish for you to be confined in my shadow. The martial dao is boundless, and I hope you can cultivate your own true essence."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked very serious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved in his heart: "Master is truly an extraordinary expert. In taking me as his disciple, he not only teaches me the martial dao, but also places great hopes on me, hoping that I can forge my own true martial path, and not be forever trapped in Master's shadow!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes reddened with excitement as he nodded, "Disciple understands, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! This Subduing Dragon Palm, like the martial techniques I've taught you, emphasizes comprehension and essence, not just form. You must go and comprehend, grasp its true essence.</p><p></p><p>"When you can simultaneously unleash eighteen true dragon palm forces, that will be considered a small accomplishment at your current stage."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan preached again, emphasizing that Xu Yan should focus on comprehension and essence, not just the few palms he had just demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction. Before imparting the fabricated incantation of the Subduing Dragon Palm, he asked, "Disciple, do you have any other questions?"</p><p></p><p>This was a routine inquiry after imparting the teachings, to see if the disciple had any remaining doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I do have one doubt."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Master, since the Subduing Dragon Palm is meant to subdue dragons, why does it release dragon-shaped palm forces?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

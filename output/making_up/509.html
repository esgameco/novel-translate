        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Qinghua Realm, the group of Supreme Realm martial artists who had been watching from afar suddenly changed their expressions and hurriedly retreated.</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord!</p><p></p><p>There was actually a Realm Lord level expert within the Qinghua Realm. </p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord was hidden in the Divine Realm - this was already beyond what they could get involved with. As expected, Xu Yan had a Realm Lord level expert backing him.</p><p></p><p>A figure came flying backwards out of the Qinghua Realm, spitting blood from his mouth, clearly having suffered no light injury! It was Tian Jiu!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Tian Jiu crashed to the ground, and it took him a while to struggle to his feet. He looked towards the direction of the Qinghua Realm without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jiu, which Realm Lord is inside the Qinghua Realm?" a Supreme Realm expert asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tian Jiu glanced at him and said, "Cough cough, it's Realm Lord Xiao Yao!"</p><p></p><p>When the other Supreme Realm experts heard this, their expressions immediately changed, and then they looked enlightened.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan dared to subdue dragons without fear of offending the True Dragon clan - it turns out he was a disciple of Realm Lord Xiao Yao!</p><p></p><p>Although Realm Lord Xiao Yao's reputation was not prominent nowadays, anyone who knew about him was aware of his former fame.</p><p></p><p>He was the number one among the second generation of experts in the Tai Cang world.</p><p></p><p>Known as the leader of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang, this showed his strength and talent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, only someone of his status would not fear offending the True Dragon clan. After all, Realm Lord Xiao Yao was, in a sense, a disciple of Tai Cang!</p><p></p><p>The news that there was a Realm Lord in the Qinghua Realm quickly spread among the Supreme Realm experts in the Divine Realm. Those who originally had some thoughts of trying to obtain the method of subduing dragons all changed their expressions and gave up on that idea.</p><p></p><p>But there were also Supreme Realm experts who were not familiar with Realm Lord Xiao Yao and inquired curiously, "Realm Lord Xiao Yao? Why have I never heard of him? He must be a weak Realm Lord, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Weak Realm Lord? Realm Lord Xiao Yao has been in seclusion since the ancient world war. You latecomers don't know his reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Let me put it this way - Realm Lord Xiao Yao's strength is on par with the lords of the ancient minor worlds. Moreover, he is acclaimed as the number one among the second generation of experts in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Among the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang, Xiao Yao is the leader!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the explanation from the older generation of Supreme Realm experts, the other Supreme Realm experts who were confused suddenly felt a chill in their hearts, sighing that the waters of this world were too deep.</p><p></p><p>As Supreme Realm experts, they had such limited knowledge of such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>As news of the Realm Lord in the Qinghua Realm spread, Ao Ming naturally also learned of this news, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xue, is Xu Yan the disciple of Realm Lord Xiao Yao?" Ao Ming asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Ao Yu Xue shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xue, since you're alright now, come back to the True Dragon Realm with your father. Your grandfather will handle this matter!" Ao Ming said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Ao Yu Xue's words earlier seemed to be deliberately protecting Xu Yan, and there was likely some hidden story behind it.</p><p></p><p>However, with Realm Lord Xiao Yao in the Qinghua Realm, matters involving a Realm Lord were already beyond what he could resolve.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ao Ming decided to return to the Dao Realm. Only his own father would have the ability to handle this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I'm not going back. I want to seize the opportunities in the Divine Realm!" Ao Yu Xue shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"What opportunities could there be in the Divine Realm? Even if the Dao Realm and Divine Realm merge and the world changes greatly, these opportunities have nothing to do with us True Dragons."</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming frowned, feeling increasingly that there was something off about his daughter's attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Father, if I miss this opportunity, I'll never be able to grasp it again. You have to trust me, I know what I'm doing," Ao Yu Xue said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you should go back quickly. Tell grandfather that Tian Sha is not a good person, be careful not to be used by him!"</p><p></p><p>After giving this warning, Ao Yu Xue turned and returned to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao Long had long wanted to leave and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming frowned, hesitating whether or not to take action and forcibly bring his daughter back to the Dao Realm. But if he did so, he feared it would upset his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was also worried that if there really was an opportunity, and it was missed because of him, wouldn't that harm his daughter?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it. Since Yu Xue is unharmed, staying in the Divine Realm shouldn't be a problem. As for the matter of subduing dragons, we must understand it clearly."</p><p></p><p>"If it's true, even if it's Realm Lord Xiao Yao, he must give our True Dragon Realm an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ao Ming gave up on the idea of forcibly bringing Ao Yu Xue back to the True Dragon Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the matter of subduing dragons must be clarified. It couldn't be dropped just because Ao Yu Xue was protecting Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Even if the person behind it was the renowned leader of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang, Xiao Yao, an explanation must be given.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't have the strength to demand an explanation from a Realm Lord, so he could only report this matter to his father.</p><p></p><p>"Go, all of you, to various parts of the Divine Realm and inquire about the matter of subduing dragons," Ao Ming ordered the four true spirit beasts in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yu Xue returned to the Qinghua Realm and finally breathed a sigh of relief. She had also been worried that her father would take action and forcibly bring her back to the True Dragon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, her father ultimately didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Qinghua Realm, Ao Yu Xue transformed into human form and timidly came to the small courtyard, respectfully bowing and saying, "Yu Xue pays her respects to Ancestor Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, "Little girl, you're quite clever. If you have something to say, just say it directly."</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Dao, I still have some questions about the methods of great demons..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and answered her questions, while also giving her some guidance on the divine abilities of great demons that Ao Yu Xue was pondering.</p><p></p><p>How to integrate them with her True Dragon techniques, how to make her True Dragon techniques evolve into True Dragon divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>After this, Ao Yu Xue would come every few days to ask various questions about cultivation or the laws of heaven and earth. As she came more often, she gradually became less reserved.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, it's fate. This jade talisman is for you," Li Xuan smiled and bestowed a jade talisman to Ao Yu Xue, which was what Ao Yu Xue had been longing for.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor Dao!" Ao Yu Xue was overjoyed, having finally received the protection of Ancestor Dao.</p><p></p><p>In Su Ling Xiu's secret chamber, the Blood Extreme in the jar was hesitating and struggling, still unable to make a final decision.</p><p></p><p>"Yue'er, how is it?" After studying the soul of Blood Extreme for this period of time, there had been no small gains. Even the remnant soul of a minor world lord had special characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Although Realm Lords and minor world lords were at the same level, the biggest difference between the two was that ray of purple light! Minor world lords obtained the opportunity of that ray of purple light and opened up minor worlds.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lords, however, lacked the opportunity of the purple light. Although their level was equivalent to minor world lords, they were unable to open up minor worlds. Once fighting inside a minor world lord's world, they would ultimately be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Due to obtaining the opportunity of the purple light, minor world lords had special foundations that made them harder to kill and less likely to perish than Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>However, with the great battle back then, many minor world lords perished, and the minor worlds they opened up became ownerless. They were successively occupied by later Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>These Realm Lords also gradually gained complete control over the minor worlds. As such, the biggest difference with minor world lords was now just that ray of world-opening purple light.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was a minor world lord, and moreover an expert of the Netherworld. Naturally there were some differences between his soul and those of Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>"It's going well, I feel my soul has improved somewhat," Yue'er said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This was a new pill that Su Ling Xiu had developed after studying Blood Extreme's soul, which could nourish the soul.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was most</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal was to refine a pill that had effects on the soul similar to the miraculous Primordial Purple Light. If successful, it would be a major breakthrough and greatly aid warriors in breaking through to the Realm Lord level. For warriors of the Great Wilderness, it could increase their chances of breaking through to the Heaven and Earth Realm or even the Path Establishment Realm, as well as strengthen their martial soul. It would be especially helpful when cultivating soul-type divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"It's still too weak. The Primordial Purple Light is extremely mysterious, but unfortunately Blood Extreme is only a remnant soul and cannot perceive its essence," Su Lingxiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme finally made a decision and revealed a fawning smile. "Pavilion Master, I have a secret I want to tell you!"</p><p></p><p>"What secret?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this - I still have a part of my soul outside. That part is weak, but it's the most crucial..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme said with a flattering expression.</p><p></p><p>"Where is that part of your soul? Are you sure you want to tell me? Once I capture your remaining soul fragments, you'll never be able to escape again."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was quite surprised that Blood Extreme would betray another part of his own soul.</p><p></p><p>"I've thought it through. Only here with the Pavilion Master do I have a chance to recover. Moreover, those supreme beings who have descended, especially the supreme being from the Taikun Realm, are surely coming for me.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, that brat Jiang Feng had grand ambitions and didn't kill me - wasn't it just to scheme against me? Now that the time is ripe, he's begun to take action."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme sighed.</p><p></p><p>This was also a helpless move on his part. Rather than letting the Taikun Realm benefit, he might as well curry favor with Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>This girl was kind-hearted. Maybe one day if she was in a good mood, she would help him recover?</p><p></p><p>Besides, following a true disciple of the Dao Ancestor wouldn't be a loss. This could perhaps be an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Where is that part of your soul?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"In the Taikun Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme told Su Lingxiu the detailed location of that part of his soul.</p><p></p><p>"That core part of my soul contains a portion of the Primordial Purple Light that I obtained back then. It's the source of the soul transformation from the Primordial Purple Light. What that brat Jiang Feng is after is probably this."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme spilled all his secrets in one go.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme beings have been descending into the Divine Realm for some time now. Your soul fragment may have already been taken."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed as she had thought - that part of Blood Extreme's soul was related to the Primordial Purple Light.</p><p></p><p>"That part of my soul benefited from the Primordial Purple Light. How could mere supreme beings easily detect it? Unless that brat Jiang Feng comes personally. But if Jiang Feng comes in person, I would definitely self-destruct completely rather than give him a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, he sealed me precisely because he was afraid I would self-destruct and ruin his plans, right?</p><p></p><p>"He sent supreme beings to come, but they can't forcibly take it. He must be planning to obtain it gradually. If that wisp of soul were to perish or be taken, I would sense it."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Blood Extreme's face showed disdain for Jiang Feng.</p><p></p><p>"I see. However, I can't go retrieve your soul fragment for now. I need to go into seclusion to break through. After I come out, I'll personally make a trip to the Taikun Realm," Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng's scheme for Blood Extreme's soul origin was probably to extract the Primordial Purple Light from it. Even if it was just a weak trace, it would still be an incredible treasure.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this was true, she would know once she saw that fragment of Blood Extreme's soul.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's as I've guessed." </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was secretly excited. If it was true, she would have the chance to replicate pills with the miraculous properties of the Primordial Purple Light. Even if they only had 10-20% of its power, they would still be supreme treasures in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, what about me?" Blood Extreme asked with a fawning expression.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take these." </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought for a moment, then took out several pills and put them into the jar.</p><p></p><p>These were pills that nourished and cultivated the soul. Even for a Realm Lord level soul, they would have a significant effect.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Pavilion Master!" Blood Extreme said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu left the secret room and entered the closed cultivation chamber, preparing to break through to the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm going into seclusion to break through," Su Lingxiu said excitedly, squeezing Li Xuan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed time for Su Lingxiu to break through.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan looked up towards the Great Wilderness with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"What is it, Master?" Su Lingxiu asked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Just some interesting happenings," Li Xuan said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu didn't pursue the matter further. After asking a few questions about breaking through to the Heaven and Earth Realm, she began her formal seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Unmelting Divine Palace also begun to move? Xu Yan still needs to quickly comprehend the Creation Realm. Only then will he have more confidence," Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, in the former Inner Region.</p><p></p><p>In that tomb of heaven and man lay buried the infamous Blood Demon, interred by Xin Mengrou herself.</p><p></p><p>The coffin inscribed with "Born lowly, buried in the wilderness" was now shaking. At first the tremors were faint, but they gradually grew stronger and more violent.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, with a bang, the coffin burst open. A pair of hands stretched out from inside.</p><p></p><p>A figure sat up from within the coffin. His pale face was bloodless, and his skin appeared somewhat shriveled. His eyelids trembled as they slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>They were a pair of blood-red eyes. As they opened, it was as if a surge of blood essence poured in from nowhere, infusing into his body. Color returned to his pale face.</p><p></p><p>The shriveled skin became smooth, and the dry hair turned black and glossy.</p><p></p><p>From deathly stillness, he gradually became full of vitality and brimming with blood essence! The man stepped out of the coffin, his gaze falling on the small characters inscribed on the coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>"'Born lowly, buried in the wilderness'? Interesting, very interesting. Buried in the wilderness is good, very good. They didn't even crush my bones and scatter the ashes. This shows they still held some old feelings after all."</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the tomb, the corners of his mouth curling up into a smile. Then he began to laugh: "Hahaha, I've finally succeeded! I've finally descended into Taicang! This should be the Inner Region of Taicang!"</p><p></p><p>"Who am I again? What was my identity?" He lowered his head, pondering as if trying to remember. "Blood Spirit Child? Blood Demon? Right, Blood Demon. The name Blood Demon is better. Hahaha, I, Blood Demon, have returned! Let this world begin to tremble!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon laughed arrogantly, his gaze seeming to penetrate through the burial chamber to see beyond the great tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Region, Spirit Region, Divine Region... Let's start with the Inner Region. I wonder if anyone who knew me, Blood Demon, is still alive?"</p><p></p><p>He patted the dust off his clothes, rubbed his face, and smiled brightly, his eyes gleaming coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This body is truly marvelous. This little fellow was indeed extraordinary back then. Since I've occupied your body, shall I fulfill your wish? That little girl who buried you had a good relationship with you. After I'm done using your body, I'll bury her together with you. That should be fair to you!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon muttered to himself as he strode towards the exit of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

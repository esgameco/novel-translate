        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew he only had one chance to strike, and he couldn't make any noise, otherwise it would definitely alert the Blood Child in that stone house.</p><p></p><p>This row of stone houses was already the innermost row, very close to where the Blood Child lived. With the Blood Child's power, even the slightest disturbance would be sensed.</p><p></p><p>And because this Blood Disciple was the leader of the 666 Blood Disciples, due to the difference in status, he naturally couldn't use the same underhanded methods as with the previous Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>He could only get as close as possible, use conversation to distract the other's attention, and then suddenly strike to kill when the other was off guard. Especially, he couldn't give the other a chance to raise the alarm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew very clearly that even if the other was dissatisfied with the 666 Blood Disciples, or felt something was off, he wouldn't suspect an impersonator trying to kill him. This was the opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Little Six, just say it directly!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple frowned, looking displeased, but didn't become guarded or move away, allowing Xu Yan to approach.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already moved right up to him, almost touching him. He raised one hand and said with a slightly excited tone: "Look, what's this?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The fierce-looking Blood Disciple felt the "Little Six" address was too disrespectful, not even calling him "sir", and became even more displeased. But he still lowered his head to look at Xu Yan's hand extended in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In that instant, a sword pierced his chest. And this sword, as if possessing intelligence, moved from his chest to his throat in a flash, shredding his throat so he couldn't cry out.</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly widened in disbelief - how dare the 666 Blood Disciple betray and ambush him! Even now, he didn't suspect it was an impersonator.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Energy surged in his body, about to unleash his powerful strength to suppress this subordinate who dared to betray him.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, he vaguely saw a landscape of mountains and rivers. In that hazy vision, it was as if he was in a realm of mountains and rivers, and saw a sword light slashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>The sword wielder seemed to embody all the living beings of that realm.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he finally realized in horror that the 666 Blood Disciple was an imposter, a fake!</p><p></p><p>Puff! As blood just started to spray out, he was about to use his ultimate secret technique, not to escape but just to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>But it was all too late.</p><p></p><p>The black sword light fell, instantly extinguishing his consciousness. His physical body turned to ash in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's tense nerves finally relaxed. Beads of sweat had even formed on his forehead. He had finally completely eliminated the target without making any commotion.</p><p></p><p>He had been prepared to flee if the other had managed to raise the alarm - he would have immediately escaped!</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a breath, then became excited and started looting the stone house, taking all of the other's resources.</p><p></p><p>"So many Blood Heart Fruits, these should be able to exchange for quite a few needed treasures, right?"</p><p></p><p>This trip was worth it!</p><p></p><p>"66 Blood Disciple?"</p><p></p><p>As he looted, Xu Yan also learned the name of this Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am the 66 Blood Disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan decisively changed identities, changing clothes, keeping the 66 Blood Disciple's blood bead on him, merging his aura with the blood bead. The muscles on his face shifted a few times, roughly transforming into the appearance of the 66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, the 66 Blood Disciple had a burly build. Xu Yan could only circulate his techniques to make his body swell up slightly, becoming as burly as the 66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't cultivate body-refining martial arts, his control over his physical body was still extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"After all, becoming burly through circulating techniques is a flaw. Spending a long time with the Blood Disciples would reveal the abnormality and easily expose me."</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan didn't care about this. He wasn't planning to infiltrate long-term anyway.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since there had never been infiltrators in the Netherworld Prison before, in their cognition, martial artists from the Divine Realm were unable to impersonate and infiltrate, as their auras couldn't be changed.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, even if some abnormalities were discovered, they wouldn't immediately suspect an outside impersonator. This also gave Xu Yan the opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>"The identity of the 66 Blood Disciple should be more useful now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came out of the stone house and looked at this innermost row of stone houses. Each stone house housed a Blood Disciple, all of whom were among the elite of the Snake Peak Heavenly Cave Netherworld Prison Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>They could be said to be some of the core figures.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the neighboring stone house, Xu Yan raised his hand and knocked on the door.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>A muffled voice came from inside, sounding somewhat displeased at being disturbed.</p><p></p><p>"It's me, 66!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, imitating the voice of the 66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and the person inside frowned as he looked at him. "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk inside."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked into the stone house on his own. The other frowned but didn't say anything, just closing the door behind them.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan came out of this stone house later, it was empty inside.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his actions. Each time he struck, he had to be extremely cautious, as each Blood Disciple was quite powerful. The slightest carelessness would create a disturbance.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Xu Yan stood in front of a stone house.</p><p></p><p>This stone house was one of the largest among the Blood Disciple stone houses. The blood light on its roof was particularly glaring.</p><p></p><p>Everything indicated that this Blood Disciple's strength ranked in the top ten among all the Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>"How many Blood Disciples have I killed?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, looking back at these stone houses. About 70% were empty now.</p><p></p><p>Except for those out on patrol, most of the Blood Disciples who had stayed in their stone houses had been killed by him. The gains were naturally extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>"I must be more careful now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already decided to retreat after finishing this job.</p><p></p><p>He had enough Blood Heart Fruits now.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>To Xu Yan's surprise, this Blood Disciple was actually female, with a cold expression, seemingly very unwelcoming towards the 66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk inside."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to enter the stone house, but she directly blocked him, saying coldly: "Are you worthy of entering?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan decisively turned to leave, planning to change targets.</p><p></p><p>"Did I say you could leave?"</p><p></p><p>However, she said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was helpless.</p><p></p><p>He cursed inwardly, wondering if this woman had some grudge against the 66 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want? Speak!"</p><p></p><p>She frowned, looking like she might teach him a lesson at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"I've discovered that this thing can attract martial artists from the Wan family..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a Blood Heart Fruit and moved closer, saying in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"I have a big plan and want to find someone to cooperate. If successful, it would be a great achievement. Why don't we go inside to discuss the details?"</p><p></p><p>She pondered for a while, then turned and entered the stone house.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed closely behind, closing the door.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he started to consider how to strike.</p><p></p><p>She clearly wouldn't allow him to get too close or familiar, making it difficult to strike.</p><p></p><p>"My plan is..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved closer. She frowned and suddenly raised her hand, striking out with a palm towards him.</p><p></p><p>"You're getting more and more..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! At that moment, Xu Yan also made his move.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The opponent's attack was meant to teach a lesson, not to kill. But Xu Yan's counterattack, while seemingly defensive, was actually a deadly strike.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>The female blood disciple's expression changed as blood light surged from her body. At that moment, mountains and rivers enveloped her as sword light flashed coldly. In the instant Xu Yan attacked with full force, he instantly reverted to his true form.</p><p></p><p>As he returned to his true form, the female blood disciple's eyes filled with terror. Just as she was about to cry out a warning, a rumbling sound erupted as the mountains and rivers within the sword seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan slashed out with his sword, unleashing the wind sword intent that could sever souls to its fullest. At the same time, the sword light seemed to come alive, piercing into the female blood disciple's body at a tricky angle.</p><p></p><p>Splat! Blood sprayed out. In that instant, the opponent broke open a gap in the mountains and rivers within the sword, letting out a low, miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan's expression turned cold as the sword light engulfed the opponent in an instant, completely annihilating her.</p><p></p><p>However, this sneak attack caused the stone house to shake a few times, creating a disturbance. Xu Yan swiftly looted everything in the stone house, then transformed back into the appearance of Blood Disciple 66. He even created the illusion of swelling on his left cheek.</p><p></p><p>Looking somewhat disheveled, he opened the door of the stone house. With one hand covering his swollen face and an extremely embarrassed expression, he slipped out of the stone house.</p><p></p><p>The commotion had already alerted the blood disciples in nearby stone houses.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Disciple 66, what were you doing in there?" a gaunt blood disciple asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"None of your damn business!" Xu Yan replied gruffly, imitating Blood Disciple 66's manner of speaking.</p><p></p><p>"That's my woman. You entered my woman's house - you're asking to die!" </p><p></p><p>With that, the blood disciple flew into a rage, his aura exploding as a crimson long blade appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>This was about to be exposed. He needed to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Your woman was quite nice!" Xu Yan said, then flew rapidly towards the edge of the Netherworld camp.</p><p></p><p>"You're dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on then, let our strength do the talking!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan acted as if he wanted to fight the other disciple.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The gaunt blood disciple transformed into a streak of blood light and gave chase. In an instant, the entire camp was alerted.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan remained calm, continuing to fly outwards while saying: "Come on, let's duel!"</p><p></p><p>It was as if he wanted to fight the other disciple outside the camp.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he still maintained the appearance of Blood Disciple 66, so no one suspected he was an imposter.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Son hasn't discovered the problem yet. As soon as we leave the camp, I'll make a run for it!" Xu Yan thought tensely.</p><p></p><p>On top of the largest stone house, a figure raised its head and looked towards the two departing blood disciples. At first it paid no mind, but then suddenly realized - why were there so few blood disciples in the camp? It was as if 70% had vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>With such a big commotion, all the blood disciples should have appeared. But in the residential area of the camp, only a sparse few blood disciples were watching the excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Where is everyone?"</p><p></p><p>The figure moved, emerging from the stone house. Looking at the few blood disciples, it asked in a deep voice: "Where are the others?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, we don't know."</p><p></p><p>The other blood disciples were also confused, only now realizing that the others were missing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already left the camp, with his pursuer about to catch up. His speed suddenly increased dramatically, quickly widening the distance between them.</p><p></p><p>"66, stop right there!" </p><p></p><p>The gaunt blood disciple behind him roared in anger, his speed also abruptly increasing.</p><p></p><p>After moving far away from the Netherworld camp, Xu Yan's expression turned cold. With a thought, his sword formation instantly materialized.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned back and slashed down with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Technique: Heaven-Severing Sword!</p><p></p><p>"You're not Blood Disciple 66!"</p><p></p><p>The gaunt blood disciple's expression filled with terror as a horrifying thought occurred to him - could this imposter have killed his woman?</p><p></p><p>"I'm the one who will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan suddenly attacked, catching the other off guard. In an instant, he unleashed all his techniques, determined to kill his opponent in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The battle was extremely intense. Because Xu Yan had seized the initiative and caught his opponent unprepared, and because the profundity of his techniques exceeded the other's imagination, in a moment of carelessness, the gaunt disciple's arm was sliced off by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>The gaunt blood disciple's expression was terrified. He no longer dared to continue fighting and tried to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Streams of sword light appeared, each pulsing with sword intent, as if alive. They surrounded the gaunt blood disciple as mountains and rivers enveloped him from above.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The fury of a true dragon manifested within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan attacked with all his might, taking advantage of seizing the initiative and his opponent's injury which had greatly reduced his strength. He unleashed a barrage of fierce attacks.</p><p></p><p>Splat! Finally, a sword light pierced into his opponent's body.</p><p></p><p>Once inside the other's body, the sword light seemed to come alive, moving about and not giving the opponent a chance to expel it. As the situation deteriorated, it took only a few breaths before Xu Yan finally slew his opponent with a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't caught him off guard and severely injured him, it would have been difficult to kill him!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Deity Transformation realm, he was still slightly lacking. If he could break through to the Divine Image realm, he would be able to defeat such an opponent in direct combat.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a terrifying blood light shot into the sky from the direction of the Netherworld camp. An immense aura rapidly approached.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned and fled! He immediately used his technique "Thoughtless Vanishing", causing his form to instantly disappear. In the blink of an eye, he returned to the great city in front of Snake Peak Skyhole.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Son is attacking!" Xu Yan shouted.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Atop a tall building, the aura of an Immortal Venerable surged forth, instantly descending.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Son is attacking?" </p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Netherworld was launching another large-scale invasion?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I had just picked a blood heart fruit when I saw the Blood Son's aura coming to kill me!" Xu Yan nodded as he entered the great city.</p><p></p><p>"You obtained a blood heart fruit?" </p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable said with great joy.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wan, you despicable scoundrel! What method did you use to kill my blood disciples?!"</p><p></p><p>An enraged roar had already reached them.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying blood light swept towards the great city as the Blood Son approached in fury.</p><p></p><p>"My Wan family will deal with you."</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder left those words before going to meet the attacking Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>In the great city, many martial artists had solemn expressions as they prepared for battle. The fight between the Blood Son and the Wan family elder had already begun, more intense than ever before. That Blood Son seemed to be fighting as if his life depended on it.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the Wan family elder was somewhat flustered by the onslaught. What puzzled him even more was what the Snake Peak Blood Son was shouting about - when had he ever killed the other's blood disciples?</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son's fury was understandable. After conducting a count and investigation, he was shocked to discover that over half the blood disciples' stone houses were empty. At least 70% of the blood disciples he had painstakingly cultivated were gone!</p><p></p><p>The first person he thought of was the Wan family elder, since besides him, no other martial artist had such capability.</p><p></p><p>In his rage, he immediately came to attack.</p><p></p><p>Seventy percent! He had instantly lost seventy percent of his blood disciples! Just what method had that undying old man of the Wan family used to accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

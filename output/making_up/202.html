        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard that the Great Desolation Martial Dao is the true orthodox martial path!"</p><p></p><p>"I will switch to cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao, no matter the cost!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain martial arts world, the topic of the seniors converting to cultivate the Great Desolation Martial Dao was the hottest.</p><p></p><p>"My child, the inner domain martial arts are too weak. The inheritance techniques of our family are no longer worth cultivating. While you are still young and your martial arts are still weak, you should switch to cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, all new disciples entering our sect will cultivate the Great Desolation Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts school will only teach the Great Desolation Martial Dao from today onwards."</p><p></p><p>After the traitor of the Crushing Heaven Alliance was easily defeated by a senior at the same realm, the Great Desolation Martial Dao became the primary choice for all martial artists who had not yet entered the door.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion was selling cultivation techniques for the Blood Qi Realm in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>As for the techniques above the Blood Qi Realm, they have not been sold yet. To obtain them, one would have to go to the Great Desolation to search.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, some people hesitated, fearing that after cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao, the conditions to obtain the subsequent techniques would be too harsh, and without the subsequent techniques, they would be stuck and unable to progress further. Of course, more people resolutely chose to cultivate the Great Desolation Martial Dao, as not every martial artist believes they can break through to the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, those who consider their talent to be average and have no hope of reaching the Patriarch Realm, whether they are innately gifted or not, it no longer matters.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao, at the very least, can make one stronger than the Blood Qi Realm in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>It is worth it.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, those who cultivate the Great Desolation Martial Dao have a much longer lifespan than the inner domain's Grandmaster Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain martial arts world was swept by a fervor to cultivate the Great Desolation Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the major powers, they were secretly distressed but dared not express it openly. They even self-deluded, believing that the Crushing Heaven Alliance was a traitorous and evil force, and that this was the truth!</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, Bai Yunkong was walking in the academy, and more than half of the familiar teachers were gone.</p><p></p><p>This made the entire Seven Star Academy seem to be lacking in teachers.</p><p></p><p>"The tenet of the Seven Star Academy is inviolable. This tenet is not just empty words, as there are some hidden things within it.</p><p></p><p>"Is the gate to the Spirit Realm truly so easy to enter? Even if one enters, what then? The inner domain martial artists are ultimately weak and insignificant."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Back in his residence, sipping tea, he pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation Martial Dao will gradually replace the inner domain martial arts, won't it? If one day the Great Desolation Martial Dao is no longer restricted and can break through to rival the martial dao seniors, the inner domain will undergo earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the situation for inner domain martial artists entering the Spirit Realm will be completely different.</p><p></p><p>"That day seems quite far away," Bai Yunkon shook his head with a bitter smile. Even if the entire inner domain switches to cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao, it will still take time to accumulate and raise the overall strength.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we martial arts scholars will have to trouble ourselves again to teach the disciples, as those teachers are all useless."</p><p></p><p>The old man with a fan in his hand sighed as he appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Pang Yu, as the head of the martial arts scholars, it's time for you to lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon snorted.</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu shook his head and sighed, "The current Palace Master is incompetent, so we martial arts scholars have to bear the burden!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon couldn't be bothered to respond.</p><p></p><p>After Pang Yu sat down, he sighed wistfully, "I never expected that the disappeared Demon Lord has actually died. I thought he had fled back to the Spirit Realm gate."</p><p></p><p>"You seem to know quite a bit about the Demon Lord?" Bai Yunkon asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Not too much, really. The previous head had participated in the hunt to kill the Demon Lord and almost died, barely escaping with his life. </p><p></p><p>"When he was still alive, he would often boast about the old days in front of me, so I have some understanding of the Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu shook his head and spoke disdainfully about the previous head.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the Demon Lord came from the Spirit Realm gate," Bai Yunkon said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, he did come from the Spirit Realm gate. When we hunted down the Demon Lord back then, many people died. If not for the people from the Spirit Realm gate who came to chase the Demon Lord, perhaps everyone would have died."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Now in the inner domain, those who experienced the Demon Lord's affairs have all died - Demon Child, the Empress Dowager of the Great Yue Kingdom... those old fellows are all gone.</p><p></p><p>"The truth about the Demon Lord's affairs was suppressed by powerful figures who forced the dynasties and major powers to erase the original events.</p><p></p><p>"Just like now, the truth about the Crushing Heaven Alliance is far from the real situation."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon silently nodded. By the time they, the eyewitnesses of these events, have all passed away, the true situation of the Crushing Heaven Alliance will no longer be known, and only vague rumors will be left, unable to convince anyone.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, Pang Yu and Bai Yunkon chatted about the great changes in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>On the Ice Tower, Ice Maiden was still lying beside two petite figures, shivering in the cold wind, while her hands seemed to be playing with something.</p><p></p><p>A blush appeared on her enchanting face, and the two petite figures gradually withered and lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>The fine wrinkles that had just appeared on Ice Maiden's brow disappeared, and she became even more bewitching and youthful.</p><p></p><p>"The Crushing Heaven Alliance, the martial dao seniors... Demon Child, you have died."</p><p></p><p>Ice Maiden murmured to herself, a hint of loneliness in her expression.</p><p></p><p>All her old friends have passed away, leaving only her alone, living on the ice lake, absorbing the essence of young maidens to maintain her own agelessness and beauty.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation technique passed down by the Demon Lord is indeed effective, but I have to consume the youth of many beautiful young women every year to sustain it."</p><p></p><p>Ice Maiden sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Two veiled women came up and took away the withered corpses on both sides of Ice Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Lord has died!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Ice Maiden became melancholic.</p><p></p><p>The missing Demon Lord has finally passed away.</p><p></p><p>Ice Maiden took out a scroll, "Demon Child, your method of revenge is indeed unique. Perhaps I won't live much longer if I do this as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh well, I'll help you one last time."</p><p></p><p>Ice Maiden followed the instructions Demon Child had left, burning the scroll and activating the jade pearl. The jade pearl turned into powder, and Ice Maiden vaguely recalled the Demon Lord once mentioning a thing called the Mother-Child Pearl. The broken child pearl may have been part of the Mother-Child Pearl.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Child, I've done as you wished. Whether it will be as you hoped, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Ice Maiden murmured.</p><p></p><p>Her face became increasingly flushed, and she slumped down in the chair in an extremely indecent posture, humming a few times and ordering, "Go, find me a handsome young man, the more handsome the better, at least at the Patriarch Realm level!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lady!"</p><p></p><p>The voice came from the Ice Tower.</p><p></p><p>In the northern region, at the headquarters of the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man stood in the courtyard, sighing wistfully as the mighty Crushing Heaven Alliance was destroyed in a single night and had become an evil force that harmed martial artists in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Demon Lord to actually die at the hands of that person on Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>A half-step Celestial Realm expert sighed.</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man shook his head, "The Demon Lord did not die at his hands."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Master, why do you say that? The Blood Spirit Blade was on Canglan Island, so how could he not have died at that person's hands?"</p><p></p><p>The strong experts of the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion present were all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple crown seemed quite wary of the matter regarding the Demon Lord. After pondering for a while, he said, "The Demon Lord is the one that the Taixi Sect must eliminate. In order to avoid causing a commotion in the Inner Domain, she asked me to convey a message to lure the Demon Lord to the wilderness."</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion were all stunned. The Demon Lord suddenly disappeared, and it seems there was some connection with the Pavilion Master? "Taixi Sect?" </p><p></p><p>A cultivator murmured, wanting to inquire further, but the man in the purple crown shook his head, unwilling to say more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turmoil of the Heavenly Destruction Alliance had passed, and Canglan Island had regained its tranquility. The reactions of the major powers in the Inner Domain were within expectations. This battle had a profound impact on the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness once again became the focus of attention.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi left Canglan Island and returned to the Great Wilderness City, intending to overthrow the Great Yue Kingdom, seizing the opportunity presented by the destruction of the Heavenly Destruction Alliance.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a Patriarch-level cultivator quietly arrived at the Du Marquis Mansion, and the Du Marquis personally received him, welcoming him with the status of a peak Patriarch-level cultivator. It was clear that this visitor was of extraordinary identity.</p><p></p><p>This Patriarch-level cultivator came from the Great Wilderness City.</p><p></p><p>Several important ministers of the Great Yue Kingdom also had Patriarch-level cultivators quietly visiting their family clans.</p><p></p><p>Undercurrents were already flowing within the Great Yue Kingdom. Seizing the opportunity when the imperial power of the Great Yue Kingdom was greatly weakened and the people's hearts were unsettled, a storm targeting the Great Yue Kingdom was brewing.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Li Xuan had resumed his carefree days. He would sail on the Cang River every day, enjoying the leisurely and comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat seemed to have been stimulated by the attack of the Heavenly Destruction Alliance. It seemed to be holding back some anger, especially towards Shi Er, mocking it for being as timid as a mouse and hiding in the mud.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was indignant and spent most of its days sleeping. Occasionally, rumbling sounds would come from within it, as if it was undergoing a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was somewhat regretful for mocking the Red Cat. After its transformation, would the big cat come to seek revenge?</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was constantly accumulating her own cultivation. She had completely abandoned the alchemy room and was delving into the study of alchemical martial arts, using it as a foundation to explore higher levels of alchemical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>She was impatient to enhance her own strength. The key to improving her strength lay in how to utilize alchemy to strengthen her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yingxiu's cultivation had become even more arduous.</p><p></p><p>The attack by the Blue-faced Man and the Heavenly Destruction Alliance were both because of Suling Xiu. She felt a sense of powerlessness and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Although the two crises were easily resolved, this stimulation made Xu Mu's cultivation diligent again. Previously, she would cultivate for an hour, but now she cultivated for an hour and a half every day!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned from another river cruise.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Small Perfection of the Penetrating Profound Realm, and you have reached the Perfection of the Penetrating Profound Realm."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Finger came suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan broke through so quickly?" Li Xuan was surprised. It seems that the Tomb of the Celestial Beings did indeed contain some treasures.</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, as Li Xuan was preparing to continue his river cruise, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Penetrating Profound Realm, and you have attained the Great Sun Golden Body at the Penetrating Profound Realm, with a hundredfold increase in strength."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, his strength had increased once again. Moreover, the Great Sun Golden Body at the Penetrating Profound Realm allowed for the transformation into a thirty-foot giant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Xuan did not display this transformation, as if Meng Chong were to transform, his clothes would be torn off, leaving him completely naked.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong would need to prepare a highly stretchable garment that won't tear if he wants to use the Great Sun Golden Body transformation."</p><p></p><p>Such garments existed in the Inner Domain, woven from the Cloud Wandering Silkworm Silk, which could cover the body even if one transformed into a ten-zhang giant. However, it seemed that Meng Chong had not prepared such a garment.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Meng Chong doesn't encounter an enemy that requires him to use the thirty-foot golden body transformation," Li Xuan muttered to himself, for if Meng Chong were to do so, he would be completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>His three disciples, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Suling Xiu, had all made significant progress. Xu Yan had reached the Small Perfection of the Penetrating Profound Realm, Meng Chong had entered the Penetrating Profound Realm, and Suling Xiu had reached the Perfection of the Innate Realm. It wouldn't be long before they could all break through to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the realm above the Penetrating Profound Realm, the Spiritual Insight Realm, Li Xuan believed that Xu Yan would be able to comprehend it soon.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light flashed again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has transformed into a Golden Immortal Body, and you have obtained the Innate Mountain and River Golden Immortal Body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. Meng Chong had broken through the Penetrating Profound Realm and also undergone a transformation into an Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>It had only been three days since Meng Chong's breakthrough to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan was sipping his Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea, the golden light surged forth again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has unleashed the thirty-foot golden body to battle the Spiritual Beast Snow Bear. Your thirty-foot golden body has been enhanced, and your battle experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback. Meng Chong had used the thirty-foot golden body transformation.</p><p></p><p>Where did Ziyu go? A Spiritual Beast Snow Bear? Were there Spiritual Beasts in the Inner Domain?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment. The Inner Domain did indeed have Spiritual Beasts, as the Swallowing Mountain Toad was considered a Spiritual Beast.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, he had not heard of any other powerful Spiritual Beasts in the Inner Domain. For Meng Chong to use the thirty-foot golden body transformation, it meant that this Snow Bear Spiritual Beast was extremely powerful, not much weaker than a true Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the Golden Finger provided another feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the Dao Technique of the Absolute Deity Slash, and your Absolute Deity Slash has reached Mastery."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat astonished. What had Meng Chong encountered that allowed him to comprehend a Dao Technique akin to the Annihilating Deity Slash?</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong had not grasped the Dao of the Spiritual Soul, the fact that he had comprehended the Absolute Deity Slash targeting the Spiritual Soul was already extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has used the Absolute Deity Slash to slay a Celestial Being's Remnant Soul. Your Absolute Deity Slash has been further enhanced, and your battle experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Being's Remnant Soul?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned. Was this the second time Meng Chong had killed a Celestial Being's Remnant Soul? The previous time, he was at the Qi and Blood Realm and had slain the Demon Lord's Remnant Soul that had possessed Wu!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Meng Chong had entered the Spiritual Domain Gate? </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself, "Could it be that Meng Chong has killed a Dao Celestial Being?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly frowned, "No, Dao Celestial Beings also have varying levels of strength. If it's a weaker Dao Celestial Being, Meng Chong would be able to handle it, but if it's a stronger one, Meng Chong may not be a match."</p><p></p><p>He then thought of Xu Yan, who had entered the Tomb of the Celestial Beings for some time, but had not encountered any danger.</p><p></p><p>"Even if a Dao Celestial Being comes, as long as I don't intervene, just using my mysterious aura should be enough to intimidate them, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Northern Wasteland, the Demon Hunting Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong had shattered that palm, Ziyu also began to talk about the origins of the Demon Hunting Battlefield, which was actually related to the legendary Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>As they walked deeper inside, Ziyu narrated the history of the Demon Hunting Battlefield and the deeds of the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

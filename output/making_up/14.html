            <p>Chapter 14: The King of Tigers, the Red-Eyed Tiger (Seeking to Read)</p><p></p><p>"Master, I would like to go home for a visit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"I will be back at the latest in half a month."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan heaved a sigh of relief and spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, then said, "There's no need for extra words, your master likes to keep a low profile, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the timing was about right, Li Xuan slowly spoke, "Fierce tigers are fierce beasts, with abundant qi and blood. They are good nourishing foods for cultivating the body, and beneficial for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, and his heart became excited: "Of course, tempering the golden bones consumes a lot. Master has reminded me that besides precious medicines, the blood and flesh of fierce tigers and beasts are also great tonics that can aid cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>He nodded vigorously and said, "Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had expected Xu Yan's excitement, and sighed inwardly, "This foolish disciple, he's seen hope again and is overjoyed."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, while the nourishment is great, don't expect to make a breakthrough in cultivation just from this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan casually reminded him, "There are fierce tigers and beasts roaming the 30-li Evil Demon Forest. You must be very careful when going back and forth."</p><p></p><p>At the end, he added, "Your master likes peace and quiet, and doesn't like disturbances, so don't make too much commotion."</p><p></p><p>There are fierce tigers and beasts in the Evil Demon Forest, and their blood and flesh are beneficial for cultivation. As long as Xu Yan succeeds in passing through the Evil Demon Forest this time, with his status and background, he will surely lead hunters to hunt down the fierce tigers and beasts in the forest.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had pre-emptively warned him not to let anyone come to the small village and disturb his peace. </p><p></p><p>As long as there are no outsiders, the risk of exposure will be reduced, and he won't be exposed as a fraud.</p><p></p><p>Once the danger of the Evil Demon Forest is eliminated, Li Xuan can flee the village at any time. If there is a risk of exposure, he can quickly escape and not be trapped in the village.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was now extremely excited: "Master is letting me go hunt those fierce beasts? With my current strength, I'm already capable of hunting such fierce beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"I must be decisive and thorough, and not make too much commotion to disturb Master's peace!"</p><p></p><p>He then thought, "Master is letting me go hunt the beasts at this time, in fact, it's also to temper me, let me fight with the fierce beasts to stimulate my qi and blood, and improve my control over my own strength!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood up, clenched his fists, and said excitedly, "Master, don't worry, I absolutely won't make a big commotion, and won't disturb your peace!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, very good, your master trusts you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>This foolish disciple is still very obedient, and can also understand the meaning behind his words.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited, he had now grasped the deeper meaning behind his master's intentions. This trip to the Evil Demon Forest will definitely yield some gains!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it won't even take a month, and he can temper his golden bones!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Yan leave, Li Xuan's heart was in turmoil: "I hope this foolish disciple can safely pass through the Evil Demon Forest this time, and then lead people to hunt down the fierce tigers and beasts there.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, I will have avenged the tragic deaths of the villagers."</p><p></p><p>As long as the fierce tigers and beasts in the Evil Demon Forest are killed, the path out of the village will also be safe. If he detects any danger of being exposed, he can immediately flee and escape far away to the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's gift for becoming his disciple, he can live a good life.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, carrying a long sword, his expression excited, walked faster and faster, until he finally arrived at the Evil Demon Forest.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time Xu Yan had passed through the 30-li Evil Demon Forest, and he had seen the half-eaten carcasses of wild beasts more than once.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Body.</p><p></p><p>He had gone back and forth several times without encountering any danger.</p><p></p><p>This time, as he entered the Wicked Abyss Forest, he did not hurry on his way, but began searching in the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>"Since my master said so, that means with my current strength, fighting and killing a fierce tiger is no problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's qi and blood circulated, his muscles tensed, his senses were acute and alert, as he searched through the Wicked Abyss Forest.</p><p></p><p>"Up ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan heard a faint snoring sound.</p><p></p><p>Lightening his footsteps, he carefully approached, and finally saw a spotted fierce tiger resting in the undergrowth.</p><p></p><p>Even from several dozen meters away, he could still feel the tiger's powerful aura, as well as its strong physique and abundant qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tiger, Xu Yan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this tiger so huge?"</p><p></p><p>He came from a wealthy family and had liked practicing martial arts since he was young. He had hunted fierce tigers with the family's guards and some hunters more than once.</p><p></p><p>However, the fierce tigers he had hunted before were not even close to the one in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The fierce tiger in the Wicked Abyss Forest was more than twice as large.</p><p></p><p>Its spotted fur looked even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my master told me to come to the Wicked Abyss Forest. It turns out this tiger is not an ordinary tiger, but its blood qi is much stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Its flesh, blood, and bones are all precious tonics. They will greatly benefit the tempering of my golden bones."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes shone with excitement, and he marveled inwardly that his master had told him to hunt the fierce tiger in the Wicked Abyss Forest - it was clearly an extraordinary tiger.</p><p></p><p>"With this tiger's blood, flesh, and bones, combined with precious medicines, the effect will definitely be stronger, enough to let me refine my bones and undergo transformation three times over!"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Xu Yan's mind. Bringing this tiger back and having the family's alchemist refine it with precious medicines would surely greatly enhance the effect of assisting in bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Can't be careless. Now is the chance, seize the opportunity to strike and instantly kill the fierce tiger. It won't make a big commotion, and the tiger won't escape the Wicked Abyss Forest!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood qi boiled, his heart pounding, as his powerful blood qi circulated throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>His entire body of muscles tensed, poised and ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>He slowly drew his long sword, lightened his footsteps, and approached cautiously.</p><p></p><p>He was prepared to ambush and slay the tiger in one strike!</p><p></p><p>"Can't use the sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly thought of something: "If I use the sword to kill the tiger, won't that damage the tiger's hide?"</p><p></p><p>"This tiger's hide looks so beautiful. If I can peel it off intact, it would be the perfect gift for my master!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan slowly put down his sword and clenched his fists, his blood qi surging, his muscles tensing, preparing to fight and kill this fierce tiger with his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>As the distance grew closer, the resting fierce tiger suddenly twitched its nostrils a few times.</p><p></p><p>It abruptly raised its head and looked back.</p><p></p><p>A human had appeared in its line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The fierce tiger let out a deep, rumbling roar and was about to pounce, but at that moment, Xu Yan saw the tiger raise its head, and its eyes were a scarlet red, filled with savagery and bloodlust.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson-Eyed Tiger!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart shuddered. This fierce tiger was no wonder so much larger than ordinary tigers, more than twice the size.</p><p></p><p>It was actually the legendary Tiger King, the Crimson-Eyed Tiger!</p><p></p><p>He had read in story books about the rumored existence of a type of fierce tiger with eyes like scarlet fire, ferocious and bloodthirsty, which even a hunting party of hundreds would suffer heavy casualties if they encountered.</p><p></p><p>The fierce tiger in the Wicked Abyss Forest was actually the legendary Tiger King, the Crimson-Eyed Tiger!</p><p></p><p>It had already detected him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood qi surged, and without waiting for the Crimson-Eyed Tiger to pounce, he suddenly lunged forward!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 38 Xu Yan Enlightened Again, the Agile Body Technique</p><p></p><p>After thinking about the body technique incantation, Li Xuan came to the Bagua diagram and said, "My disciple, you have been cultivating diligently these days, and your speed has improved, and your steps have become much more nimble.</p><p></p><p>"But you are still far from comprehending the body technique.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you have gained some insights into the body technique, it is time for me to pass down the body technique incantation to you.</p><p></p><p>"Remember it well."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks and said excitedly, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"The essence of the body technique lies in its lightness and swiftness. Being light means being silent and invisible, and being swift is like lightning..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke in a lofty manner.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened thoughtfully, vaguely understanding how he should comprehend the body technique.</p><p></p><p>"Light as a goose feather falling, swift as thundering strides leaving no trace!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recited the incantation he had just composed, word by word.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, ponder well on this incantation!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned and left with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan bowed.</p><p></p><p>By giving Xu Yan two lines of incantation, the rest was up to Xu Yan to comprehend the body technique. However, Li Xuan believed that his disciple would not disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind was filled with the two lines of incantation, and the more he pondered, the more profound it seemed.</p><p></p><p>He looked up and saw that his master had already left. Just as he was about to continue his cultivation, he suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that the power of the body technique lies in its lightness and swiftness... </p><p></p><p>"This is it? Master's steps are so leisurely and carefree, so light and comfortable..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan observed his master's departing figure, with his hands behind his back, his steps leisurely and comfortable, exuding a sense of effortlessness.</p><p></p><p>"Master's leisurely steps, is this an unconscious display of the body technique?</p><p></p><p>"No! Master's realm is so high that he has returned to the original simplicity. Although he seems to be walking slowly, he is actually concealing the supreme principles of the body technique.</p><p></p><p>"They say that teaching by words and by example, and Master just passed down the incantation to me. This leisurely gait must be the embodiment of his teachings!</p><p></p><p>"Yes! It must be so, I must comprehend the profound meaning hidden in Master's steps!"</p><p></p><p>After this realization, Xu Yan's spirits were immediately lifted.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at his master's steps, and saw that his master's steps had a certain leisurely quality, light and carefree, yet also unrestrained and free.</p><p></p><p>The more he observed, the more he felt that his master's steps contained the profound principles of the body technique.</p><p></p><p>"Light as a goose feather falling, swift as thundering strides leaving no trace... I have gained some understanding."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched his master's steps, and gradually, a flash of insight seemed to appear in his mind. The leisurely, light, and unrestrained steps blended with the incantation, and he vaguely grasped something.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Xuan's figure had already disappeared from Xu Yan's sight.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a very good mood at the moment. He had just composed two lines of incantation and passed them on to his disciple, and soon he would receive the feedback on the body technique.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he walked with a leisurely and unrestrained gait, his whole being floating, and he even felt like humming a few songs.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea that his carefree and unrestrained steps had been observed by Xu Yan, who had engaged in a self-induced contemplation to comprehend the profound principles hidden within.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had contemplated the profound meaning behind his master's steps, when he studied the body technique incantation and practiced the body technique, the image of his master's leisurely, comfortable, and unrestrained steps constantly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Combining it with the incantation, he continued to gain new insights.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he only needed to break through a thin layer to fully comprehend the powerful body technique.</p><p></p><p>In the Bagua diagram, Xu Yan's steps became lighter, landing without a sound, and his turns became smoother. His leaps had a floating quality to them.</p><p></p><p>His figure flowed and maneuvered on the Bagua, his steps becoming increasingly light and agile, and his speed continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm almost there!</p><p></p><p>"I feel that I'm just a step away from comprehending the body technique."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the only thing left in his mind was his master's carefree and unrestrained steps, gradually becoming more mysterious and clearer.</p><p></p><p>He had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"Light as a floating feather, swift as a thunderbolt, leaving no trace... I have gained some understanding. Floating like a wild goose feather, drifting silently, swift as a thunderbolt, only for an instant... This must be the Lightness Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have not fully grasped its true meaning, I have at least mastered the foundation of the technique.</p><p></p><p>"Floating like a wild goose feather, silent and leaving no trace - the Lightness Technique!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a surge of insights flooded Xu Yan's mind, and in that instant, his figure began to float.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he seemed to have teleported to another position.</p><p></p><p>He landed without a sound, not even stirring a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>His figure kept drifting in the Bagua diagram, becoming faster and lighter, and in an instant, he had changed positions again.</p><p></p><p>And with such swift speed, there was not even a whisper of wind.</p><p></p><p>Drifting like a floating feather, silent and undetectable.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally succeeded in cultivating the Lightness Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long roar and soared into the air. In an instant, he was hundreds of feet away, and he struck out with a Descending Dragon Palm, sending out a crimson dragon that blasted a crater in the ground.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's body drifted, the Descending Dragon Palm struck out, shifting left and right, up and down, twisting and turning, changing positions in an instant, and the Descending Dragon Palm also burst forth from different positions in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>With the mastery of the body technique, Xu Yan's combat power had skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I must diligently cultivate and strive to reach the small success of the Qi and Blood Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has successfully cultivated the body technique you created, and named it the Lightness Technique. You have directly achieved mastery of the body technique, ten times that of those at the same realm."</p><p></p><p>Three days after passing on the incantation to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was sitting in a chair, playing with a jade scepter.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the profound principles of the Lightness Technique flashed in his mind, and he had directly achieved mastery of it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immediately stood up, his face filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, with the incantation and without the incantation, the difference is significant.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, his talent is truly monstrous. As long as he has the incantation, he can comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"It was not in vain that I racked my brains to create the incantation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I can pass on the cultivation methods of the Innate Realm to my disciple in advance, so that he can familiarize himself with them and strive to break through the Innate Realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>With a step, light as a floating feather, silent and undetectable, he had already left the small village.</p><p></p><p>Drifting in his movements, his speed was extremely fast, yet without a single sound, stealthily silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was playing with the jade scepter in his hand as he arrived at the place where Xu Yan was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He saw his disciple was practicing the body technique, continuously striking out with the Descending Dragon Palm, cultivating the strategy of combining the body technique and the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>"It's time for the master to show off his skills again!"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Li Xuan's face.</p><p></p><p>With a movement, silent and undetectable, he appeared behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>With his Qi and Blood Realm mastery, which was a hundred times that of those at the same realm, and the mastery of the Lightness Technique, which was ten times that of those at the same realm, how could Xu Yan possibly detect his arrival?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was excitedly practicing, completely unaware of the presence behind him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had his hands clasped behind his back, and no matter how Xu Yan twisted and turned, he silently followed behind him, and Xu Yan did not sense him at all.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, soon you will experience the power of your master!"</p><p></p><p>A joyful smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

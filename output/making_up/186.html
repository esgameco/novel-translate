        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the storm had passed, the calm was restored, and the red cat was lying in the courtyard, its body even more robust than before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both diligently cultivating and summarizing their insights from the previous experience.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was delving into the study of medicine and martial arts, conducting an anatomical study on the physical body of a peak Grand Master, exploring the mysteries of martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was preparing for a breakthrough to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was cultivating furiously, and had even surpassed Zhou Ying, feeling a bit embarrassed about it.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu, after being excited for a few days, set off with high morale to seek out spiritual herbs, his eyes filled with determination. Before leaving, he asked Su Lingxiu if there were any specific herbs she needed, and he could try to gather them.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu gave him a few types of spiritual herbs and asked him to try to collect them.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was busy spreading the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, and had also dispatched people from the Great Wilderness to enter the Inner Realm, while also meeting with the Emperors of Wu and Qi to discuss plans for rebellion.</p><p></p><p>How to bring down the Great Yue Kingdom and have the Great Wilderness take its place.</p><p></p><p>The Emperors of Wu and Qi could never have imagined that, as the ruling Emperors, they would one day conspire with others to plan a rebellion! The two were greatly excited, and if they could successfully overthrow the Great Yue Kingdom and have the Great Wilderness take its place, the Great Wilderness would truly be established in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>And as the two Emperors of the Great Wilderness, they would share in the glory, an achievement that would echo through the ages.</p><p></p><p>Future generations would look back and give them a thumbs up, praising how the two Emperors of the Great Wilderness were able to scheme and plot, crushing the evil Great Yue Kingdom, and ushering in the era of the Great Wilderness in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more excited they became. One scheme after another - internal disintegration, rallying support, suppression, and more - emerged, leaving even Kou Ruozhi somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He silently cursed, thinking that the Emperors of Qi and Wu were truly no fools, as seasoned in the ways of rebellion as they were, even more so than himself.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Qi looked down on Kou Ruozhi with disdain, thinking that as an Emperor, not to understand the ways of rebellion, how could one guard against one's own subjects rebelling? How to suppress the rebels? He was no foolish or incompetent ruler, he had his own methods to firmly hold onto the throne.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu was also a man of great ambition. Since ascending the throne, his imperial power had been stable, and he had toured the lands of the Wu Kingdom. If not for the sudden appearance of Meng Chong, he would not have been cooped up in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was working on the sale of medicinal pills, negotiating with the Tianbaoge to quickly distribute the pills throughout the Inner Realm, expanding the influence of the Changqingge and promoting the ideals of the Great Wilderness. Cooperation with the Tianbaoge was indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had suggested an equity investment, and Xu Junhe immediately had an idea. He was currently negotiating with the Tianbaoge about investing, subtly hinting that if they did not agree, the Changqingge would have to find another powerful force to cooperate with, perhaps to create a medicinal pill sales alliance.</p><p></p><p>After much discussion, the Tianbaoge finally relented. The Changqingge would invest its medicinal pills into the Tianbaoge, with the Tianbaoge having the exclusive sales rights, and the profits split 80/20. </p><p></p><p>The Changqingge would not interfere in the Tianbaoge's other businesses, but the Tianbaoge would need to steadily provide the spiritual herbs required for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>After these negotiations, the Changqingge officially entered the Tianbaoge, but was not swallowed up by it. Instead, it gained access to the Tianbaoge's sales channels, while the Tianbaoge only obtained a share of the medicinal pill sales profits. The Changqingge retained full autonomy over its own affairs, with the Tianbaoge having no right to intervene.</p><p></p><p>As the Changqingge continued to grow stronger, there might come a day when it could completely control the Tianbaoge, becoming the hidden power behind it.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the agreement with the Tianbaoge, the Changqingge entered a phase of rapid expansion and development. Its pill refining facilities also began expansion, increasing production lines.</p><p></p><p>The pill refining apprentices were all from the Great Wilderness, carefully selected outstanding talents.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Essence Gathering Pill, the Blood Qi Pill and Healing Pill also began to be sold.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Blood Qi Pill provided great assistance to the cultivation of martial artists below the First Rank, and quickly became highly sought after.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had also entered a high-speed development stage. While there were still less than a hundred martial artists who had broken through to the Blood Qi Realm, there were many who had reached the stages of Skin Refining, Bone Refining, and even Organ Refining.</p><p></p><p>It would not be long before the martial artists of the Great Wilderness entered a period of explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>However, the growth of Innate Realm martial artists could not be accelerated quickly. Not all martial artists could frequently use medicinal pills to assist their cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Most martial artists only used medicinal pills when they encountered bottlenecks in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Iron Mountain County had gradually seen the emergence of young people cultivating the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, and the Changqingge had also begun to recruit those with exceptional talents, training them as personnel for external expansion, as well as recruiting martial artists from the Inner Realm as auxiliary members.</p><p></p><p>The concepts of the Great Wilderness were constantly being instilled in the people of Iron Mountain County, to the point that they almost completely disregarded the Great Yue Kingdom, seeing the Great Wilderness as the true orthodox way.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Martial Patriarch had even become the martial faith that these martial artists aspired to, everyone wishing to become a figure like the Great Wilderness Martial Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Under Kou Ruozhi's planning, this trend was spreading from Iron Mountain County to the surrounding Lanping Prefecture, gradually taking root in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that by worshipping the Great Wilderness Martial Patriarch, one's martial cultivation would be easier, with the chance to gain the Patriarch's favor and enhance one's martial dao fortune.</p><p></p><p>These rumors spoke of how certain individuals, after struggling in their cultivation of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, only experienced a sudden enlightenment and rapid progress after worshipping the Great Wilderness Martial Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the young men and women who began cultivating the Great Wilderness Martial Dao all started worshipping the Great Wilderness Martial Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, admitting that Kou Ruozhi really had a knack for this, no wonder he was able to revive and widely spread the teachings of the Heavenly Mother Sect back then.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had begun preparing for a breakthrough to the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, news finally came from the royal court of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Lanping Prefecture and the portion of Yunfeng Prefecture bordering the Canglang River where Canglang Island was located would all be ceded to the Changqingge as compensation for the previous conflict.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, through the Tianbaoge's channels, 10,000 spiritual herbs were delivered.</p><p></p><p>Effective immediately, the entire area from Lanping Prefecture to Canglang Island, spanning half a prefecture, would be under the control of the Changqingge, with the Great Yue Kingdom relinquishing its governing authority and agreeing to assist the Changqingge in fully taking control of this region.</p><p></p><p>How to receive and control this half-prefecture area would naturally be handled by Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi, after they had thoroughly investigated the situation in Lanping Prefecture and that portion of Yunfeng Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>They quickly formulated a plan to consolidate control:</p><p></p><p>First, Lanping Prefecture and that half of Yunfeng Prefecture would be merged into the Great Wilderness, accepting the governance of the Great Wilderness and establishing a Great Wilderness Cabinet to manage its affairs.</p><p></p><p>To rally the people's hearts, it was announced that all martial artists within the Great Wilderness domain would enjoy a 30% discount on medicinal pills, and those who had made contributions to stabilizing the Great Wilderness would be rewarded with a bottle of Essence Gathering Pill, worth 12 pills.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the establishment of the Great Wilderness Guard was announced, responsible for stabilizing and patrolling the Great Wilderness. Those who joined the Great Wilderness Guard would receive a Blood Qi Pill every month, and Grandmaster-level martial artists would receive two Essence Gathering Pills per month. They would also be granted the inheritance of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, including the method for refining true qi for Grandmaster-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>With this series of measures, the situation was quickly stabilized, and the Great Wilderness Guard was successfully established.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the consumption of medicinal pills would also be tremendous...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The size of the alchemy room has been continuously expanding for this purpose. The task of teaching alchemy apprentices and practicing alchemy procedures no longer requires Suling Xiu's involvement.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan is responsible for management, with senior apprentices guiding new apprentices, one by one. The new production line was quickly established. New medicinal pills have also been put on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan and several apprentices with exceptional talent and alchemy aptitude were summoned to be taught the formula for refining the new medicinal pills. They were each tasked with mastering the steps of pill refinement. They were then asked to attempt completing the entire pill refinement process on their own.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness officially entered the inner domain, Emperor Wu and Emperor Qi also moved into the inner domain. Guo Rongshan and others established the Great Wilderness Inner Cabinet in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Among the cabinet members, they began to select warriors from the inner domain, but they had to undergo strict examination to ensure their loyalty to the Great Wilderness. Of course, all of this would take time.</p><p></p><p>Due to the generous treatment of the Great Wilderness Guard, there was a constant stream of applicants. The first batch had already been fully recruited, and the next step was to tighten the review conditions.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Yue Kingdom had surrendered and ceded land, Kou Ruozhi and others had not given up on overthrowing the Great Yue royal family. With the establishment of the Great Wilderness Guard and the recruitment of outstanding warriors from the inner domain, the rebellion plan began to be implemented.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi, Emperor Wu, and Emperor Qi were responsible for inciting the internal forces of the Great Yue Kingdom to rebel, steadily advancing and gradually infiltrating.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not concerned about the expansion of the Great Wilderness or the development of the Changqing Pavilion. No matter how much turmoil, as long as it was beneficial to his martial dao, he was content.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also not focused on these matters, as he had already perfected himself and was preparing to break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was no longer as concerned about the development of the Changqing Pavilion either. After her great vengeance was fulfilled, she felt relieved and immersed herself wholeheartedly in the contemplation of alchemy and martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Walking through the former Tieshan County, Li Xuan sighed, feeling that the changes since entering the inner domain were truly remarkable. The once impoverished county, where even a First-Order Warrior was hard to find, now occasionally saw the presence of Grandmaster Warriors.</p><p></p><p>The county had expanded, incorporating the location of the Changqing Pavilion, and was now known as Great Wilderness City. The ongoing city expansion involved the participation of many warriors, progressing at an extremely rapid pace. It would not be long before a grand city emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Guard on patrol included Grandmaster Warriors leading the teams. They were all originally scattered cultivators or from small families and factions, making it easier to ensure their loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Wandering in the Great Wilderness, Li Xuan saw young men and women practicing martial arts in the mountains and fields. Some had a resolute gaze and high morale, diligently cultivating the martial dao despite their simple attire. Others were frowning, not yet having sensed the flow of their vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion, feeling that the martial dao he had fabricated had unexpectedly flourished. He had truly become the Martial Ancestor of the Great Wilderness. Would the martial arts of the inner domain be eliminated? Li Xuan did not know, but he believed that the martial techniques and secrets he had created would continue to be developed as more cultivators practiced them.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as one had sufficient talent, they could use the foundation of the inner domain martial arts to research and develop secrets suitable for the Great Wilderness martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"The more people who cultivate, the more abundant the feedback I can receive," Li Xuan contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet received any feedback, he believed that as the number of cultivators increased, the feedback would inevitably come.</p><p></p><p>Back in the small courtyard of the Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan used a bamboo staff to guide the Red Cat, whose physique was constantly growing stronger and whose aura was becoming more formidable, showing signs of becoming a great demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The number of disciples who have started cultivating the martial dao you created has exceeded 100, and you have obtained the Hundred Martial Shadows."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, as the feedback had finally arrived. The external cultivators of his created martial dao had exceeded 100, triggering the feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Martial Shadows?" Li Xuan was extremely excited. In an instant, numerous seemingly illusory shadows emerged from his body, each possessing the strength of the Vital Energy Realm. Moreover, each shadow had a different fighting style and mastery of martial techniques, even if they cultivated the same techniques.</p><p></p><p>All the shadows merged into one, with their combined strength reaching the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is not much different from martial dao clones!" Li Xuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Each shadow was like a clone of him, but unlike regular clones, these Martial Shadows did not require him to divide his own strength. They were the reflections of the cultivators of his created martial dao, and their strength could be directly replicated without him having to separate a part of his own power.</p><p></p><p>With the hundred Martial Shadows combined, they possessed the might of an Innate Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"When I was at the Vital Energy Realm, I could easily defeat Grandmasters. Now, at the Innate Realm, I can effortlessly defeat Great Grandmasters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited. As long as the enemy was not too strong, he no longer needed to personally intervene, as a single Martial Shadow could handle the task.</p><p></p><p>Even against Great Grandmaster-level experts, the combined hundred Martial Shadows at the Innate Realm could easily defeat them.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness martial dao must be widely promoted and disseminated!" Li Xuan was overjoyed. Indeed, as the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor, he had reaped a bountiful harvest. The Hundred Martial Shadows would continue to increase in number as more disciples cultivated his created martial dao, and their strength would also rise accordingly.</p><p></p><p>The maximum number could reach nine hundred Martial Shadows!</p><p></p><p>"If the martial dao disciples exceed a thousand, will I obtain a Thousand Martial Shadows? Then Ten Thousand Martial Shadows, a Hundred Thousand Martial Shadows..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became more and more excited at the thought. This would be equivalent to him having hundreds of thousands of martial dao clones. Imagining himself sitting calmly while a hundred thousand shadow figures rushed forth to face the enemy, it would surely terrify them.</p><p></p><p>Invincible!</p><p></p><p>"For now, only the Vital Energy Realm techniques are circulating externally. When someone has mastered the Vital Energy Realm, I will then transmit the Innate Realm techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into contemplation. "If inner domain Grandmasters who have refined true qi reach a certain level, can they be considered to have successfully transitioned to cultivating the Great Wilderness martial dao and receive feedback?"</p><p></p><p>Inner domain Grandmaster warriors transitioning would not be practicing pure Great Wilderness martial dao, and merely refining true qi would not be considered a successful transition.</p><p></p><p>"I should ponder how to guide inner domain warriors to smoothly transition to the Great Wilderness martial dao. It's not easy for me to figure it out alone, so I should rely on my senior disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, feeling that this kind of brain-racking task would be better left to his disciple. However, Xu Yan was focused on his own cultivation, so he could also have Xie Lingfeng try to ponder it, as he was also a prodigy and had already succeeded in refining true qi.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

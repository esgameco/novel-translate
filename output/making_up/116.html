        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 116 The Inner Realm, I, Xu Yan, Have Arrived</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat stared with wide eyes, seeming a bit confused, as if unable to understand what Li Xuan was saying.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is a fierce beast. Although it appears to have intelligence, how could it possibly comprehend such profound things?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and smiled wryly. </p><p></p><p>He had been overly idealistic, actually thinking that the Red Cat could comprehend the Dao of the Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>He played with the jade scepter in his hand and left with a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, on the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sat cross-legged, fully immersed in the contemplation of the Great Sun Golden Body. He was just a step away from fully comprehending the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The senior brother had gone to the Inner Realm, and he too yearned to go there.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not go to the Inner Realm immediately, aside from feeling that his strength was still not enough, there was another more important factor - his Qi and Blood Realm could not take flight.</p><p></p><p>Without entering the Primal Realm, he could not truly unleash his Furious Thunder Soaring Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Body, after connecting the Heavenly and Earthly Bridge, opens the Qi Sea. With the Qi Sea as the foundation, it opens the Golden Body Acupoints. In the Primal Realm, eighteen Golden Body Acupoints are opened, forming a small cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Each acupoint can nurture the profundities of the physical body. With all eighteen acupoints opened, one can also possess a portion of the transformations of the Great Sun Golden Body, although not to the extent of a thirty-foot Golden Body, a ten-foot Golden Body should be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's mind flashed with insight, and the mysteries of the Great Sun Golden Body began to unfold before him.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Body Acupoints had been determined, and he even discovered some other acupoints through his own comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Body is right before my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how many days he had spent in contemplation on the hillside, but at this moment, he had finally comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>Sitting in a chair, he looked at an ancient leather book while using a bamboo cane to point at the acupoints on the Red Cat's body. "Red Cat, these are acupoints. If you can channel the power of the medicinal pills you've eaten into one of these acupoints, you might gain some benefits!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's tail swished as it lay on the ground, its gaze seeming to understand yet not understand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart rejoiced, Meng Chong had comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body you created. He has entered the Great Sun Golden Body."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt that his own acupoints were opening, nurturing profound powers. His physical body was rapidly enhanced, strengthening by more than tenfold in a moment.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Great Sun Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already obtained the complete cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Body. The martial dao system of his physical body, from the Qi and Blood Realm to the Primal Realm, had all been fully developed.</p><p></p><p>In the Primal Realm Great Sun Golden Body, eighteen acupoints are opened, but as a beginner, he had only opened three acupoints. These three acupoints were constantly nurturing profound powers, continuously nourishing his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"With my current physical body, even if I stand still, a Sect Master would be unable to harm me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. This Great Sun Golden Body he had created was quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>His strength had taken another leap forward.</p><p></p><p>The day when he could crush a Great Sect Master with a single hand was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Now that Meng Chong had comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body, his breakthrough to the Primal Realm was also imminent.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan broke through, he transformed into the Dragon Soaring Mountain and River Spiritual Bone. Will Meng Chong also undergo a transformation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered this.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's talent was simply too monstrous, and he was the pioneer of the martial dao. Li Xuan suspected that he possessed great fortune, belonging to the category of a Child of Fate.</p><p></p><p>That was why his breakthrough to the Primal Realm resulted in a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong ultimately lacked a bit compared to Xu Yan, so he might not necessarily undergo a transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Once Meng Chong breaks through, and my Great Sun Golden Body in the Primal Realm is fully mastered, with my strength further enhanced, I'll be able to easily defeat Great Sect Masters with a single punch or palm strike. Even if faced with dozens of Great Sect Masters surrounding me, I'll be able to handle them with ease."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the complete Great Sun Golden Body technique, he now looked at the Red Cat and had some new ideas. Tapping the Red Cat's body with the bamboo cane, he said, "I'll teach you the Dao of the Great Demons. You must cultivate it diligently. Even if you're just a pet, I can't let you be completely useless. Especially with your huge body, you're not even a bit cute.</p><p></p><p>"If you can't comprehend it, I might just have to consider stewing you!"</p><p></p><p>With a threatening tone, he looked at the Red Cat with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's eyes widened, and it trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling you, you have to comprehend it well..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tapped the Red Cat's body again, carefully explaining the new Dao of the Great Demons to it word by word.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the Red Cat to remember it all at once. He would repeat it to it every day. If the Red Cat's intelligence was indeed decent, it should be able to remember it over time.</p><p></p><p>If the Red Cat truly cultivated the Dao of the Great Demons, would that mean he had created the martial dao of the Great Demons? Would he also receive some kind of feedback?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked at the letter, then opened the box, revealing a statue inside.</p><p></p><p>The statue was posed with one hand behind the back and the other holding a jade scepter, slightly tilting the head upwards, exuding an aura of a transcendent immortal.</p><p></p><p>The facial features were only roughly outlined, but they gave a sense of youthful handsomeness and refinement.</p><p></p><p>If Li Xuan saw this statue, he would find that although the facial features were only roughly outlined, the shadow of his own likeness could still be vaguely discerned.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Martial Dao, the Venerable Teacher? The Martial Dao Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's expression was solemn and reverent as he carefully lifted the statue and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Father, what did you summon me for?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see the statue? It is carved from the finest jade, to be enshrined in our home. This is the Martial Dao Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan pointed to the statue on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Also, copy a cultivation technique. I will present it to the Emperor in the palace."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan continued.</p><p></p><p>"Father, that cannot be done!" Guo Yunkai exclaimed in alarm.</p><p></p><p>If the martial techniques were to be leaked out, everyone would be able to cultivate them, and the Guo family's advantages would be lost.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the techniques have not already been leaked?" Guo Rongshan looked at him. "The remote borders lack martial dao, but we are now ahead of the curve. Actively passing on the techniques has a different meaning than passive leakage. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What does Father mean?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan pointed to the letter on the table. Guo Yunkai picked it up and read it, then let out a sigh of relief. "I understand now, Father!"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor had been feeling a bit more at ease lately, but he still felt constrained.</p><p></p><p>What slightly relieved him was that although Guo Rongshan controlled the court politics, he had no intention of rebelling, and also gave the Qi Emperor face.</p><p></p><p>He had never defied the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo, what matter do you have? You can make your own decision, and I will not refuse!"</p><p></p><p>That day, Guo Rongshan went to the palace, holding a box in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this is the martial technique. This is the Martial Dao Saint. Our remote borders are poor and lacking in martial dao, so I pass on the teachings to the borders..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan handed over the cultivation technique and opened the box, revealing a statue inside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Qi was stunned. Guo Rongshan was actually transmitting the martial arts techniques?</p><p></p><p>No, he was a martial arts saint, and he wanted to spread the Dao to the remote border regions!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo, you are truly a great contributor to our Qi Kingdom and our border regions!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Qi trembled as he held the martial arts techniques, his eyes brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the border regions are small, but the central domain is vast. Our border regions should also have martial arts, and we should unite..." </p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Qi was taken aback for a long while, then took a deep breath and said, "I understand."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Guo Rongshan and the Emperor of Qi discussed the dissemination of martial arts. Since people have their own selfish motives, they decided to wait until their cultivation was successful before widely spreading the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This way, they could first seize control of the majority of the precious medicines, naturally allowing them to take the lead, making it difficult for later comers to catch up.</p><p></p><p>In the border regions, the seeds of martial arts began to sprout in the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>And the Xu family in Donghe Prefecture would gradually become the holy land of martial arts in the border regions...</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was overjoyed, finally able to cultivate the martial arts techniques. He knelt on the ground and respectfully said, "I am willing to devote my life for the Heavenly Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu solemnly said, "Kou Ruozhi, I have taken a liking to your cunning and treacherous nature. I hope you won't disappoint me. When you go to the central domain in the future, you must fully utilize your cunning and treacherous abilities to scheme against all potential enemies and defeat them!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Heavenly Mother!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's face twitched. How did he become cunning and treacherous? He was clearly resourceful and clever!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A figure was soaring through the boundless mountains, heading straight for the central domain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement as he overlooked the towering mountains below. He sighed inwardly, no wonder countless explorers of the border regions either never returned or came back with nothing to show for their efforts.</p><p></p><p>The mountains near the central domain were infested with fierce beasts. With the abilities of the border region people, safely traversing them would be extremely difficult. </p><p></p><p>And if they encountered fierce beasts, there would be no chance of escape.</p><p></p><p>This was why the depths of the boundless mountains remained a mystery - anyone who encountered the fierce beasts never made it back.</p><p></p><p>Even if one managed to cross the boundless mountains and enter the central domain, they would never return to the border regions. The prosperity and martial arts of the central domain were too alluring; once experienced, no one would long for the border regions anymore.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flew with his qi, passing through layer after layer of mountains, crossing over three thousand li, finally emerging from the boundless mountains.</p><p></p><p>He had entered the central domain.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the villages amidst the mountains and forests outside the boundless mountains, as well as the people cultivating martial arts, Xu Yan sighed inwardly. Martial arts had already become very widespread in the central domain.</p><p></p><p>Even in this remote place, there were people cultivating martial arts. Although the techniques they practiced were only ordinary, belonging to the common variety, they were still far beyond what the border regions could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"The central domain, I, Xu Yan, have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement. After briefly orienting himself, he headed straight for the nearest city to the boundless mountains.</p><p></p><p>"According to my sworn sister's instructions, after emerging from the boundless mountains, this should be the territory of the Great Yue Kingdom's Lanping Prefecture. Thirty li away there is a county called Iron Mountain County."</p><p></p><p>Iron Mountain County was a small, impoverished county on the borders of Lanping Prefecture. Even so, the county had a branch of the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The boundless mountains in the central domain are called the Iron Barrier Mountains, and Iron Mountain County is named after them. My sworn sister said this is a poor, small county, but let me go take a look, go to the Tianbao Pavilion and buy some spiritual medicines."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flew at high speed, and soon the outline of a city appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called poor county?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes widened. Although the so-called poor county was not as grand as the capital of the Qi Kingdom, it had already surpassed the city of Donghe Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>And this was just a poor county in the Great Yue Kingdom, in Lanping Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The central domain is truly prosperous!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shocked, feeling like a country bumpkin seeing the bustling city for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the sky, Xu Yan walked towards the county.</p><p></p><p>The guards of Iron Mountain County, seeing a young man with a rustic appearance, couldn't help but be curious. They were about to step forward to demand money, but suddenly stopped in their tracks, their expressions turning solemn.</p><p></p><p>"That was close, where did this powerful expert come from? He looks like he's never seen the world, I almost provoked him!"</p><p></p><p>The guards thought anxiously.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, they had sensed a powerful aura from Xu Yan, even if it was just for a moment, they were certain.</p><p></p><p>This was a powerful expert, far beyond their ability to provoke.</p><p></p><p>"At least a Fifth Rank cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The guards thought to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan curiously glanced at the guards, marveling inwardly, "Just a poor county, but the quality of the guards is so high. Their bearing is upright and their posture is straight, without a trace of the demeanor of corrupt officials."</p><p></p><p>The guards, however, were growing increasingly panicked. "He couldn't have realized I was about to extort him, right? What if he attacks? At best I'll get beaten up, at worst I'll be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"He's at least a Fifth Rank cultivator, maybe even stronger. Killing me wouldn't even be a problem for a martial arts expert like him."</p><p></p><p>The guards grew more and more anxious, until finally one of them gritted his teeth and stepped forward, speaking respectfully, "Young master, I see you seem to be new to Iron Mountain County. Is there anything I can assist you with?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, the minor officials of Iron Mountain County would actually take the initiative to help outsiders? This was unheard of in the Qi Kingdom, where even not being harassed was considered a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Tianbao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the Tianbao Pavilion is in the city center. After you enter the city, you'll see a large building, that's the Tianbao Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The guard replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he breathed a sigh of relief, "He shouldn't suspect that I was just about to extort him, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>As he raised his hand, a few strands of true qi flickered at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, young master, you're welcome!"</p><p></p><p>The guard's face turned pale with fright, his body trembling. "A sect master? This is a sect master expert?"</p><p></p><p>That seemed to be the internal martial arts qi!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan only then realized that on his journey, he had forgotten to conceal his true qi, so his fingertips had been continuously separating and merging the true qi.</p><p></p><p>"I got too absorbed, I almost forgot to restrain my true qi."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hastily concealed his true qi. </p><p></p><p>As his mastery of true qi separation deepened, his control over it became stronger. After concealing his true qi, his aura of a Xiantian Realm cultivator was completely hidden.</p><p></p><p>After entering the city, Xu Yan looked like a country bumpkin, marveling at the wide streets, the bustling crowds, the rows of shops and inns.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a poor county? Then how prosperous must the prefecture capital be?"</p><p></p><p>He was deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This one is a Ninth Rank cultivator? This one is an Eighth Rank? And this one - a Sixth Rank?"</p><p></p><p>Walking on the streets, Xu Yan was curious about everything, looking like he had never seen the world before.</p><p></p><p>"The central domain is even more prosperous than I imagined. Iron Mountain County is a bit smaller than Jingan, but more flourishing. Cultivators are everywhere."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to be amazed as he made his way to the county center.</p><p></p><p>There stood a towering building, far larger than the tallest building in the capital of the Qi Kingdom, Jingan.</p><p></p><p>People constantly went in and out, all of them cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The central domain, I, Xu Yan, have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement as he briefly oriented himself and headed straight for the nearest city.</p>

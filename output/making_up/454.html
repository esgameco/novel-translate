        <h1>Chapter 454</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sea, rolling waves had transformed into sword light. In the sky and sea, everywhere was filled with surging sword waves, emanating an aura of killing and annihilation that covered this realm.</p><p></p><p>Giant swords tumbled, the azure sea roared, and the world lost its color. </p><p></p><p>Even the Boundary Gate was shaking at this moment, as if it would collapse under the impact of the sword formation in the next instant.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xuening's eyes trembled in shock as he watched the great battle in the distant sea. His heart was quaking. He never imagined that one day, even as an Immortal Venerable himself, he would have his spirit shaken by a battle! What terrifying sword techniques were these!</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the distant battle, watching the giant swords roll as if crushing heaven and earth. The killing intent caused the world to change color.</p><p></p><p>The azure sea for ten thousand miles seemed to be suppressed!</p><p></p><p>Except for the surging battlefield, the vast azure sea beyond seemed unable to produce even a single wave.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, the wind calmed and the waves stilled. Everything returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>"Half an hour!" Gao Xuening muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The battle ended in just half an hour?</p><p></p><p>Twenty Immortal Venerables, including one at the peak of Immortal Venerable realm and several at the late stage, all perished?! They couldn't even last an hour? The small island where the Boundary Gate was located had already disappeared, with only the gate suspended alone above the sea.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was calm. Merely twenty Immortal Venerables, even with one at the peak of Immortal realm, were nothing special.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not far from the great completion of the Void Breaking realm. Immortal Venerables are not worth mentioning to me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was already a powerhouse at the pinnacle of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>This ambush by the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow was just a small matter for Xu Yan. In less than half an hour, he had slain all the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Directions Annihilation Sword is fierce in its killing. With this sword formation, I need not fear even dozens of Immortal Venerables attacking together!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was satisfied after testing out the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword he had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>He took a step and vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xuening saw a figure flash by in the distance - a handsome youth, the very being who had slain twenty Immortal Venerables in half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gao Xuening's expression froze. His heart tightened and his whole being seemed to lose focus.</p><p></p><p>It was just a calm glance, just a moment of eye contact, but Gao Xuening instantly felt his spirit tighten. His whole being seemed dazed, not daring to make any movement.</p><p></p><p>He feared that one careless move would cause a misunderstanding, and he would be killed with a single sword strike! In the past when he was weak, facing the strong, he didn't dare to even breathe, feeling as insignificant as an ant.</p><p></p><p>Since breaking through to the Immortal realm and reaching the top ranks of the Divine Realm, becoming a feared powerhouse, he had never again experienced what it was like to be weak.</p><p></p><p>That youth's glance just now made him feel as if he had returned to his weak days - that feeling of nervousness, unease, and sensing himself as small as an ant.</p><p></p><p>With a youthful appearance but extraordinary handsomeness, he was either an ancient monster or an unparalleled prodigy! Whichever it was, Gao Xuening knew this was not someone he could provoke or offend.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at Gao Xuening. Seeing the other had no malice or killing intent, and was unrelated to the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow people, he paid no more attention and vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sky Island was where most of the Immortal Venerables of the Azure Sea Realm resided, including those of the Sea Spirit race.</p><p></p><p>The activities of Immortal Venerables were mostly fixed - taking turns guarding the Heavenly Pit, secluded cultivation on the island, and occasionally patrolling the entire Azure Sea Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Cloud Sky Island which was usually peaceful suddenly erupted with the auras of Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the island looked up in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Heavenly Pit is experiencing major turbulence again?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the Immortal Venerables on the island burst out with powerful auras and rose into the air, looking in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>With such a grand display, the first thought of the martial artists on the island was that the Heavenly Pit must be experiencing turbulence, and extremely major turbulence at that, to cause all the Immortal Venerables on the island to mobilize.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened at the Boundary Gate?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerables on Cloud Sky Island now had solemn and puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had all sensed powerful battle fluctuations from the direction of the Boundary Gate - a battle of Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, such intense fluctuations seemed to indicate dozens of Immortal Venerables fighting.</p><p></p><p>But how was this possible!</p><p></p><p>It had been many years since the Divine Realm had seen such an intense battle between Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Boundary Gate!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Immortal Venerables vanished in an instant. But four Immortal Venerables remained to guard Cloud Sky Island, in case it became vulnerable and enemies took advantage.</p><p></p><p>The auras of Immortal Venerables surged through heaven and earth as they guarded the four directions of Cloud Sky Island, preventing any enemy attacks.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, in a small courtyard, Xie Tianheng looked up at the distant figure, his face full of envy.</p><p></p><p>"So this is an Immortal Venerable. So powerful! I'm still far from that level!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Fu Tianhai's expression was somewhat unpleasant. Since coming to the Divine Realm, although he had also worked hard at cultivation, he had unexpectedly been surpassed by his son-in-law Xie Tianheng, which made him very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more uncomfortable was that this bastard Xie Tianheng would occasionally say he wanted to give pointers to his father-in-law on cultivation, with an extremely arrogant attitude! After sighing, Xie Tianheng turned to look at his father-in-law. "Father-in-law, how far are you from the Tempering Truth realm? You seem a bit slow!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai snorted coldly and walked away with a dark face.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was instantly smug. Serves this old man right! Back in the Spirit Realm he was so arrogant and looked down on his son-in-law. Now he knows how powerful his son-in-law is!</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still a bit lacking. Although I've broken through to the Tempering Truth realm, I'm not considered top-tier among True King Venerables."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng sighed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Even though his sword techniques were powerful and he had comprehended sword intent, even cultivating a sword divine ability, at most this only gave him combat power comparable to the late stage of True King Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Although in others' eyes he was already considered strong among True King Venerables and had some fame, for the always ambitious Xie Tianheng, it was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Venerable is still too far away. I'm only at the early stage of Tempering Truth realm. It will probably take over a hundred years to break through to Immortal Venerable."</p><p></p><p>At this moment Xie Tianheng thought of pills.</p><p></p><p>"If I had pills to assist, I could break through much faster."</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat tempted. Should he make a trip back to the Qinghua Realm?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint sword hum sounded. Xie Tianheng was instantly delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Has Feng broken through?"</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the source of the sword hum, a sword light flew out from the secluded cultivation area in the small courtyard. A divine image flickered, showing surging sword waves with a faint killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Then the divine image disappeared, revealing Xie Lingfeng's form.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had finally broken through to the Divine Image realm.</p><p></p><p>"Feng, since you've broken through, let's find a place to spar," said Xie Tianheng.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, or rather in the entire Azure Sea Realm, the only one worthy of his attention in sword techniques was his son Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Azure Sea Realm, apart from the two of them, father and son, no one could be considered a sword practitioner.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at his father...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he said: "Father, there's no need. You're not my match!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"You really think your father is like those useless sword practitioners? You think you can defeat me?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched. His father was indeed being a bit arrogant. "When I broke through to the Divine Power realm, I gained three divine abilities. Now that I've broken through to the Divine Form realm, my strength has increased even more significantly. Father, give up. You can't possibly be my match."</p><p></p><p>"My current martial arts cultivation has essentially fully transformed into the Great Wilderness martial arts. How could you possibly compete with me at the same level? In terms of sword comprehension, sword intent, and divine abilities, you're no match for me in any of them!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng opened and closed his mouth, suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Venerable powerhouses from Cloud Sky Island rushed at full speed towards the location of the Boundary Gate. Before they got close, they saw that the small island where the Boundary Gate was located had disappeared, and the gate was now suspended over the sea.</p><p></p><p>The great battle had already concluded!</p><p></p><p>Such a massive battle, yet it ended in less than a quarter hour?</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened? The group of powerhouses were puzzled, then thought of Gao Xueming who was guarding the Boundary Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Gao Xueming?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerhouses suddenly discovered Gao Xueming standing somewhat dazedly on a small island, as if he had been frightened by something.</p><p></p><p>This was an Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>And on the island, all the True King Venerables who had been guarding the Boundary Gate together were unconscious.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Xueming, what happened?" </p><p></p><p>An elderly man with a cyan staff, exuding a powerful aura and with a ruddy complexion, asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The elder was the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan, extremely powerful and one of the strongest individuals in the Azure Sea Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming took a deep breath, came to his senses, looked at the group of Immortal Venerables, and said solemnly: "An expert that we absolutely cannot offend has come to the Azure Sea Realm. His strength is so great that I fear even if all the Immortal realm experts in our Azure Sea Realm joined forces, we would be no match!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all the powerhouses were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"An expert above the Immortal realm? Impossible. Such experts wouldn't descend easily, and if they did, we would surely know about it."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily above the Immortal realm, but his strength certainly crushes the Immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Tell us, what exactly happened?" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple really..." </p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming briefly recounted what had happened.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't mention that he had actively cooperated with the other party and given up the Boundary Gate location. Instead, he said he had been forced by the other party and had no choice but to knock out these True King Venerables and retreat to this place.</p><p></p><p>The people from Sky Bane Earth Shadow had all been eliminated, and the one he owed a favor to was also dead. Now there was no one to contradict his story, so he could say whatever he wanted. Even if the truth came out, what could be done?</p><p></p><p>He merely owed someone a life-saving favor, and repaid it this way. They were now even, it wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person who was ambushed was incredibly powerful and had slaughtered all the ambushers.</p><p></p><p>After listening, the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan and the others were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty Immortal Venerables joined forces and were wiped out in half a quarter hour?"</p><p></p><p>All the powerhouses wore expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" </p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The other party looked like a young man. I even suspect he's not very old, and not some ancient monster!"</p><p></p><p>He smiled bitterly. The other party had merely glanced at him, and he was too scared to move a muscle!</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure those were twenty Immortal Venerables?"</p><p></p><p>One of the powerhouses couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"How could it be false?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were all trembling slightly. Twenty Immortal Venerables, skilled in joint attacks, using a divine artifact that could solidify heaven and earth, yet they were all slaughtered in less than a quarter hour?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look at the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Boundary Gate in the sea area, the great battle had long since subsided. That small island had vanished without a trace, but as the group of powerhouses stood on the sea surface where the battle had taken place, they couldn't help but change their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>Strands of sharp energy still lingered in the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Standing there, they even felt a sense of impending annihilation.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this!"</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable muttered in shock.</p><p></p><p>With their Immortal realm strength, they could feel the sense of annihilation. If a Divine Spirit realm martial artist entered the battlefield, they would probably be instantly killed by the lingering energy!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying killing intent was something that even they, as Immortal Venerables, couldn't achieve!</p><p></p><p>Although the killing intent on the battlefield was slowly dissipating, the fact that it could remain for so long after the battle ended and still possess such powerful destructive force showed that the strength of the person who had fought here was far beyond what they could contend with.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had only used the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword, without employing the Immutable Sword Intent. Otherwise, the sword intent in this place would not disappear and would become a holy land for sword practitioners to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>"This person cannot be provoked. Let's hope he has no ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Gao Xueming, he said: "Since you've seen him, reveal his appearance so we don't accidentally offend him!"</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Venerables all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying fierce person must be treated with utmost caution and absolutely could not be offended.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming raised his hand and made a gesture. The power of heaven and earth gathered, simulating Xu Yan's appearance. Although it could only simulate about 70-80% accuracy, it would be enough to recognize him and avoid offending him.</p><p></p><p>After the powerhouses memorized it, they began to discuss how to handle the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan reached out his hand and moved a small island from afar, placing it under the Boundary Gate. This way, the gate was still situated on a small island.</p><p></p><p>After leaving one person to guard the Boundary Gate, Gao Xueming returned to Cloud Sky Island with the others. As for those unconscious True King Venerables, they were awakened and continued to guard the Boundary Gate.</p><p></p><p>These True King Venerables were all bewildered. How did they fall asleep and wake up to find the Boundary Gate's island had been replaced?</p><p></p><p>However, they all understood in their hearts that something must have happened. Otherwise, how could they, as mighty True King Venerables, have fallen unconscious?</p><p></p><p>But these matters were too profound and not something that weak individuals like them should know about.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, after slaughtering the Sky Bane Earth Shadow attackers, he set off for Cloud Sky Island. But being unfamiliar with the Azure Sea Realm, his direction was somewhat off.</p><p></p><p>Walking among the waves, Xu Yan took out a flying boat and sailed on the sea. Sitting on the boat, he gazed out at the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>"With Brother Xie's talent, he should have broken through to the Divine Form realm by now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's talent was not bad. Given his cultivation speed and the assistance of pills in the early stages, he should have broken through to the Divine Form realm by now.</p><p></p><p>"With Brother Xie breaking through to the Divine Form realm, he wouldn't be considered weak among the True King Venerables."</p><p></p><p>After evaluating Xie Lingfeng's strength, Xu Yan had a good understanding.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many divine abilities Brother Xie has gained?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan's expression turned surprised as he looked towards a desolate island in the distance.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 411</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Qi, besides being able to be cultivated into sword intent, what about divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>I believe Xu Yan will comprehend more martial arts methods of using the Indestructible Qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Indestructible Qi also has an upper limit. It's not truly indestructible, so this is just a starting stage. In the end, one still needs to rely on one's own martial arts to truly achieve indestructibility and imperishability," Li Xuan was very clear about this.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Indestructible Qi can also be refined, it's just that the realm requirement is too high. And this realm is still too far away for Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Using the Indestructible Qi is just entering the starting point of cultivating indestructibility and imperishability. As one's realm continuously improves, there will come a day when one's own indestructibility and imperishability will surpass the upper limit of the Indestructible Qi.</p><p></p><p>Half a month after Xu Yan cultivated the Indestructible Sword Intent, Xu Yan had a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Phase realm. Your Void-breaking power has been amplified tenfold."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immediately felt refreshed all over. His strength had increased again. He glanced in the direction of the Nine Mountains realm - it was getting more and more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, chaotic times produce prodigies. My disciple is a prodigy among prodigies. During this time, he must have fought many battles to improve his strength so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were not people who would take a beating without fighting back. Since they were enemies, they had to be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>So these days, they must have been constantly seeking revenge against the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, news arrived.</p><p></p><p>A True King Celestial Venerable from the Qinghua realm had risked crossing the realm gate and entered Nine Mountains City. The Immortal Celestial Venerables and the Blood Sons of the Netherworld who were originally in a standoff had all left the realm gate for some distance.</p><p></p><p>This allowed this True King Celestial Venerable to take the opportunity to leave through the realm gate and bring back some information from the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>First, there was chaos within the Nine Mountains realm. The only son of the Peak Lord of Hengfeng Mountain was killed by the Immortal Celestial Venerable of Lingchi Mountain. Even though rumors said it was a plot by the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, it couldn't convince the Peak Lord of Hengfeng Mountain.</p><p></p><p>A conflict erupted with Lingchi Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Then, conflicts also arose between Qiandie Mountain and the Wan family of Dagai Mountain. It was rumored that a top genius of Qiandie Mountain was killed by a bald strong man, and the killer was in Dagai Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Qiandie Mountain demanded Dagai Mountain hand over the person, but the Wan family testified that the killer was not Meng Chong. In the end, they parted on bad terms and conflicts arose.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that Duanxia Mountain had killed Wind Spirit Tiger, the most beloved spirit beast of Lingjun Mountain, as well as a genius from the Lingjun Gate, causing conflicts between them as well.</p><p></p><p>Two Blood Sons of the Netherworld had infiltrated the Nine Mountains realm from some abyss and were causing killings.</p><p></p><p>There was even a Netherworld army of a thousand that directly invaded Dagai Mountain, but Xu Yan and Meng Chong took action to kill the Netherworld warriors and continuously uproot branches of the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>The last piece of news was that one of the Blood Sons of the Netherworld was preparing to hunt down Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>All in all, the Nine Mountains realm was now turbulent and chaotic, with constant killings. Battles between Immortal Celestial Venerables broke out every few days.</p><p></p><p>If this trend continues, sooner or later there will likely be Immortal Celestial Venerables who perish! Once an Immortal Celestial Venerable is killed on one side, the conflicts will truly become irreconcilable. As for the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, they were constantly being hunted by various factions while also continuously creating chaos.</p><p></p><p>As for how many of the Immortal Celestial Venerables in the Nine Mountains realm were members of the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, it was unknown. This made the situation even more chaotic, with the other Immortal Celestial Venerables all guarding against each other, afraid of being ambushed.</p><p></p><p>"It's really chaotic!" Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother, their opponents are now Immortal Celestial Venerables!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's blood was boiling with excitement, itching to go to the Nine Mountains realm to display the might of his esoteric martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The time is not right yet!" </p><p></p><p>In the end, Fang Hao sighed. The development of the Qinghua realm could not be abandoned halfway.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Son of the Netherworld preparing to hunt down Xu Yan and Meng Chong, Li Xuan was not worried. Up until now, the life-saving jade talisman had not been triggered, indicating that this Blood Son of the Netherworld had not posed too great a threat to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He may not even be able to track down Xu Yan and Meng Chong's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"The chaos in the Divine Realm is inevitable. The Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, this behind-the-scenes black hand, must have been planning for quite some time. Choosing to act at this time must have a reason. Their plan must have matured.</p><p></p><p>Even if they can't achieve their wish of unifying heaven and earth, the chaos in the Divine Realm is unstoppable."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Work hard on cultivation. Whether you can reach the peak amidst the great chaos depends on yourselves," Li Xuan said, looking at Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. Disciple understands!" Fang Hao nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Since it was the great chaos of the Divine Realm, and he was developing the Qinghua realm, he must forge the Qinghua realm into an extremely powerful and impregnable realm.</p><p></p><p>He already had a general goal in mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this required sufficient strength to accomplish, so striving to improve one's strength was the top priority.</p><p></p><p>The chaos in the Nine Mountains realm continued, showing signs of getting worse. Occasionally, True King Celestial Venerables would pass through the realm gate to enter the Nine Mountains realm and bring back news.</p><p></p><p>But there were also True King Celestial Venerables who encountered danger and perished in the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>Various signs indicated that the Immortal Celestial Venerables and that Blood Son in standoff at the realm gate of the Nine Mountains realm were deliberately allowing some True King Celestial Venerables from the Qinghua realm to enter and obtain intelligence about the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! On this day, the long-absent shaking of heaven and earth appeared again. Li Xuan frowned slightly and looked towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting more and more interesting."</p><p></p><p>He continued to study the general outline of the Cang Book. It wouldn't be long before he could completely memorize the general outline. His understanding of the Dao principles of the Cang heaven and earth was also becoming clearer.</p><p></p><p>He even began to have some understanding of the origin of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has cultivated the Indestructible Blade Intent. Your Indestructible Blade Intent has increased a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>As expected, Meng Chong had also cultivated the Indestructible Blade Intent.</p><p></p><p>"A battle of Immortal Celestial Venerables. This is a battle of several Immortal Celestial Venerables."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked up towards the Nine Mountains realm. The laws of heaven and earth were violently shaking, obviously a battle of Immortal Celestial Venerables had erupted, and it was very likely a battle of several Immortal Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>This was the battle with the most Immortal Celestial Venerables participating since the chaos in the Nine Mountains realm began.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he continued to study the Cang Book. Suddenly, he turned his head towards the location of Jiang Buping's closed-door cultivation chamber.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time. The Extreme Soul Martial Arts is about to emerge."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became excited.</p><p></p><p>He put away the Cang Book and took out the Extreme Soul Martial Arts Classic that had cost him a lot of mental effort to compile. It was finally about to be put to use.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Martial Arts Classic recorded Extreme Soul martial arts techniques, divine abilities, the forging of Extreme Soul weapons, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Once Jiang Buping successfully cultivates and steps into the door of Extreme Soul Martial Arts, he can pass on all the Extreme Soul martial arts methods in the classic to him.</p><p></p><p>Especially the most important thing unique to Extreme Soul Martial Arts - the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon. This is a special weapon that has never appeared in the entire Cang world.</p><p></p><p>It is different from traditional weapons.</p><p></p><p>"A weapon that kills the soul. This is different from divine abilities and sword intent. It not only kills the soul, but also has the power to destroy the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The soul has always been the most difficult to defend against, and it's also relatively difficult to</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Attack, but once the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon appears, it can easily assault the soul like a weapon that harms the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"For Taicang warriors, one moment of carelessness will result in being killed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled. Once the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon emerges, for Taicang warriors who lack methods to defend their souls and lack soul-based divine abilities, a slight mistake will lead to their souls being killed.</p><p></p><p>"The first time the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon appears in the world, even Immortal Venerable experts can have their souls severely injured if they are careless for a moment. Once the soul is severely injured...</p><p></p><p>"No, even if not severely injured, just a slight injury to the soul is extremely dangerous for Immortal Venerable experts, especially in these chaotic times."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to Jiang Buping going on a killing spree, fully displaying the might of the Extreme Soul martial arts, slaughtering Taicang warriors until they turn pale at the mere mention.</p><p></p><p>"However, there are also extremely powerful experts in the Taicang world. There must be some methods to defend the soul, or even supreme treasures to protect the soul.</p><p></p><p>"But such warriors are ultimately too few. Moreover, at the same level, they are absolutely no match for Extreme Soul martial arts. Apart from relying on level advantages, there are no effective defense methods."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Nine Mountains Realm. When Jiang Buping steps through the door of Extreme Soul martial arts, he will also go out to make a name for himself. The Nine Mountains Realm is a good place.</p><p></p><p>The martial brothers joining forces will stir up storms in the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Adding fuel to the fire in this divine realm that is about to descend into chaos!</p><p></p><p>In the closed cultivation room, Jiang Buping floated silently. At this moment, he seemed to have no changes, and one could not tell that he was in soul form.</p><p></p><p>His physical body had long since merged with his soul. Now his body was no longer flesh and blood, but a soul body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Jiang Buping felt a powerful force emerge, and his entire being transformed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his body dissolved. Extreme soul power surged in the closed room, and in the next moment it coalesced again, restoring him.</p><p></p><p>"This is Extreme Soul martial arts, this is the Extreme Dao Soul!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He felt his long-lost power. Now he was truly a martial artist. It seemed that even if he had cultivated to True King Venerable before, he could not be considered a true martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"I, Jiang Buping, have returned!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could hardly resist the urge to let out a long roar.</p><p></p><p>The power of Extreme Soul martial arts was even greater than when he was at his peak before!</p><p></p><p>"I, Jiang Buping, will one day sweep away all the injustice in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, he was an Extreme Soul martial artist, cultivating the Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Jiang Buping has cultivated the Extreme Soul martial arts entry level you created. You gain an Extreme Soul body, increased a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>"Your Extreme Soul body's level rises to match pure martial arts."</p><p></p><p>The moment Jiang Buping stepped into Extreme Soul martial arts, feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul body increased a hundredfold, and more importantly, the level of the Extreme Soul body rose to match pure martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul martial arts at the late stage of Void Breaking Realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. As soon as Jiang Buping stepped into Extreme Soul martial arts, due to his high starting point and cultivation of an undying soul, Li Xuan had thought the feedback for Extreme Soul martial arts would not be too high in level. According to Li Xuan's calculations, it should be around the Divine Phase Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao not only increased the Extreme Soul body a hundredfold, but also raised the level to match pure martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Both at the late stage of Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>This way, all five of his martial arts were at Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful, I've become even more powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>On his spirit platform, besides the Primordial Spirit, there was also the Beast Ancestor true body, and now there was an additional Extreme Soul body.</p><p></p><p>This Extreme Soul body was different from the Beast Ancestor true body. It was the body of his fifth martial art, like an Extreme Dao Soul that he had painstakingly cultivated.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far the distance, his consciousness was connected to it, and it could also be considered his true body.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Extreme Soul body waved an arm, and the power and dominance of the Extreme Soul force made Li Xuan sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being the fifth martial art he had carefully created.</p><p></p><p>"With my five martial arts combined, forget about Immortal Venerable experts, I could even blow away those above Immortal Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul martial arts attack the soul, unmatched physical body, infinite vitality of alchemy martial arts, pure martial arts coordinating everything.</p><p></p><p>Perfect, invincible!</p><p></p><p>"Without realizing it, I've already become this powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Now, among the five martial arts, pure martial arts was already the strongest, followed by Extreme Soul martial arts, after all it was one small realm higher than physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Each martial art provides a hundredfold increase at the same level. No matter how my disciples cultivate, they will never be able to catch up to their master."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face beamed with a bright smile, his mood greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>In this good mood, Li Xuan raised his hand and extracted a strand of Dao principle essence, refining several pills.</p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Venerable experts would be envious of these pills imbued with Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>"One for each person, comprehend it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan casually tossed out the pills, one for each person.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked at the pill with a shocked expression. She was far from being able to refine such a marvelous pill.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was overjoyed, praising himself for his determination to firmly grasp this opportunity. Staying behind to work hard was indeed a wise decision.</p><p></p><p>With this pill, he was confident that he could finally break through and have the hope of advancing to become a top Immortal Venerable expert.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this pill was quite difficult to refine, and it was not simply a matter of refining, but required comprehending the essence within.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping excitedly came out of seclusion, kneeling on the ground with tears in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, you haven't disappointed your master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao looked at Jiang Buping in surprise. Others might not have felt much, but the two of them sensed that Jiang Buping was unusual.</p><p></p><p>This body was no longer the flesh and blood body of before.</p><p></p><p>This was Extreme Soul martial arts!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Fifth Junior Brother, on successfully stepping into the door of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, I feel like you've become very strong."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu said with smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Third Senior Sister and Fourth Senior Brother for your help!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>If not for Third Senior Sister and Fourth Senior Brother's assistance in merging the undying qi, how could it have gone so smoothly?</p><p></p><p>"We're family, no need to be so polite!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, come, let's spar a bit. Let your Senior Brother see the might of Extreme Soul martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping hesitated. In terms of strength, he believed he was not weaker than Fang Hao now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the power of Extreme Soul martial arts was to attack the soul. He had just become an Extreme Soul martial artist and feared his control might be insufficient. It would be bad if he accidentally injured Fourth Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fourth Senior Brother specialized in artifact refining and formations, not direct combat.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

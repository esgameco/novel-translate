        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He's a peak grand master! In your eyes, is he so unworthy? Can he be casually killed like a grasshopper?" Xie asked curiously, "Brother, the other peak grand masters, are they from the Demonic Sect or the Black-Robed faction?"</p><p></p><p>Except for the Demonic Overlord Firekiller, the other peak grand masters would either be powerful figures from the Demonic Sect or the Black-Robed faction.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, Xu Yan couldn't think of any other forces that would target him.</p><p></p><p>After killing a peak grand master from the Black-Robed faction, if there were more peak grand masters from the Black-Robed faction lurking on Canglan Island, it showed how formidable the Black-Robed faction was.</p><p></p><p>"Probably the Black-Robed faction!" Xie Ling said solemnly, "I've used some intelligence from the Sword Venerable Cliff, but I still couldn't find out what faction the Black-Robed people belong to. It shows how deeply they are hidden, and their strength is not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression darkened, and he coldly said, "Since I've killed their peak grand masters, I want to see how many more peak grand masters they can send, and whether they will show their true faces."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Canglan Island, but before that, make sure Firekiller has the 1 million spirit crystals ready as my battle fee," Xu Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The group of four left Iron Mountain County and headed straight for Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>However, the news was spread to Canglan Island from Blue Peace Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan to go to Canglan Island to fight, Firekiller must prepare 1 million spirit crystals as the battle fee, and also move all of Firekiller's assets to Canglan Island! Otherwise, Xu Yan wouldn't go.</p><p></p><p>The news shocked the inner domain cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Can it be done this way?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's reason was that Canglan Island might have already been destroyed, and he suffered heavy losses. Even if he reclaimed Canglan Island, he couldn't recover the losses.</p><p></p><p>Unless Firekiller paid the 1 million spirit crystal battle fee and moved all of Firekiller's assets to Canglan Island, it would be worth Xu Yan's effort.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the fierce-looking Firekiller with his crimson hair was furious: "The scoundrel is too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>To openly demand a battle fee from him, and also ask him to move all his lifelong treasures to Canglan Island before he would come.</p><p></p><p>And he did it so righteously, without any sense of shame, lacking the bearing of a grand master.</p><p></p><p>What infuriated Firekiller even more was that the inner domain cultivators all thought Xu Yan's avoidance of the battle was wise, praising him as a talented young genius who knew when to advance and retreat.</p><p></p><p>Being young, with such extraordinary talent and strength, to avoid the battle with the infamous Firekiller Demon Overlord was not at all shameful.</p><p></p><p>This made Firekiller so angry that he wanted to destroy Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>However, without Xu Yan coming to the battle, he was completely powerless. Even if he wanted to go find Xu Yan himself, it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>If they could find Xu Yan's location, he wouldn't have come to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Accept his terms," a black-robed man behind Firekiller said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"My spirit crystals, how dare anyone take them? If you want to kill him, you pay the 1 million spirit crystals!" Firekiller said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the black-robed man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Jue, you, the deputy hall master of the Hidden Palace, actually took action yourself, and have such deep enmity with that young Xu Yan?" Firekiller narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Firekiller, things you shouldn't know, don't ask; things you shouldn't say, don't say them, or the consequences will be severe," Yin Jue's eyes were extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Firekiller sneered, "That secretive and evasive thing, if it weren't for that old monster, the Hidden Palace's hall master, I wouldn't cooperate with you."</p><p></p><p>"Firekiller, I advise you to be careful with your words," Yin Jue said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Firekiller snorted.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed with a hint of fear. The might of the Hidden Palace's hall master, even a peak grand master like him, felt a sense of dread. It was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Tell Xu Yan, I've left a map of my treasures on Canglan Island waiting for him!" Firekiller said coldly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over Yin Jue, looking towards the back, where a black-robed man stood, one of the Hidden Palace's protectors, a peak grand master.</p><p></p><p>His gaze also fell on the Canglan River, where someone seemed to be hiding underwater.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Palace's deputy hall master, accompanied by two protectors, plus Firekiller, four peak grand masters, all for the sole purpose of killing a young man! This had never happened in the inner domain's martial arts world before.</p><p></p><p>However, they all felt a sense of dread towards Xu Yan's strength and monstrosity. They had to kill him before he grew too powerful, or the consequences would be dire.</p><p></p><p>But the Hidden Palace seemed to have another purpose, to find a certain person, which seemed to be an order from the Hidden Palace's hall master.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island had gathered the attention of many powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>The infamous Firekiller Demon Overlord was actually going to challenge the rising genius Xu Yan, something unheard of in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>The tales of Xu Yan's exploits had gradually spread - passing the Nine-Layer Arena of the Seven Star Academy, defeating grand masters, and single-handedly slaying two great accomplishment grand masters in an ambush.</p><p></p><p>Being so young, his strength surpassed many grand masters, a monstrous genius never seen before in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Firekiller Demon Overlord's infamy was too great, and many sought to kill him. On Canglan Island, his enemies wanted to go and kill him.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed they were all obstructed.</p><p></p><p>The other two Demon Overlords from the Demonic Sect actually intervened to block them.</p><p></p><p>There were even other unknown powerful figures, suspected to be the remaining Demon Overlords.</p><p></p><p>This made the major factions wonder, was the Demonic Sect going to unify and sweep through the inner domain again?</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sect was once extremely powerful, but after the disappearance of the Demon Lord, under the suppression of various forces and internal turmoil, it was no longer as formidable as before.</p><p></p><p>As many powerful figures and factions focused on Canglan Island, a message spread - Firekiller Demon Overlord had paid the 1 million spirit crystal battle fee!</p><p></p><p>This shocked everyone, and made them realize that Firekiller was determined to kill Xu Yan, agreeing to such conditions.</p><p></p><p>It was also reported that Firekiller had left a map of his lifelong treasures on Canglan Island, and whoever defeated Xu Yan could claim them.</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned to Xu Yan. </p><p></p><p>Was he really going to accept the challenge?</p><p></p><p>Some perceptive factions vaguely sensed that Canglan Island might be a deadly trap.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan received the 1 million spirit crystals commissioned by Firekiller through the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"The more enemies, the better! I can kill ten or eight of them, and I won't be poor anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother is really good at business, I can't do it like him, I haven't earned that many spirit crystals," Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Peak and Hu Shan looked at each other, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>Only these sworn brothers could earn money in such a way, and only they had the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Firekiller Demon Overlord, I, Xu Yan, will certainly accept the challenge and go to Canglan Island for a decisive battle," Xu Yan said solemnly, asking the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to send the reply.</p><p></p><p>After getting what he was owed, Xu Yan's group slowly headed towards Canglan Island, not in a hurry at all.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother got Firekiller's treasure map, won't someone come to rob it?" Meng Chong asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say, since I've killed a peak grand master, who would dare to rob me?" Xu Yan shook his head, a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Peak couldn't help but speak up, "The other Demon Overlords might intervene."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, "That would be great, the mighty Demon Overlords must be very rich, another windfall!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, this is the confidence of great power!</p><p></p><p>Halfway through, he unexpectedly encountered an acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>It was Headmaster Fudao Yuntian of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster Fudao, are you here to find me?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, after this battle, come to our Seven Star Academy, our Sect Master wishes to see you, and there are also some things that you may want to know," Fudao Yuntian said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Xu Yan agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>As for why he should go to the Seven Star Academy after the battle, it was simply to see how his strength measured up.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Fudao Yuntian left, two graceful figures also appeared.</p><p></p><p>They were the Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion, and a lady in plain clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, it's been a while," the lady in plain clothes said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not that long," Xu Yan blinked.</p><p></p><p>The lady in plain clothes: ...</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion seemed to be suppressing a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Did you come to find me for something?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to remind Young Master Xu to be careful when going to Canglan Island, as there are not just the Peerless Demon Venerable, but also other peak grand masters there. I hope Young Master Xu will be cautious," the lady in plain clothes said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Are there ten peak grand masters?" Xu Yan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The lady in plain clothes was stunned, ten peak grand masters? </p><p></p><p>Does that mean that if there are less than ten peak grand masters, they cannot pose a threat to you?</p><p></p><p>Are you truly that powerful?</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so?" the lady in plain clothes replied hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Not even ten? This is looking down on me, Xu Yan!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Is it just because I'm young that they are underestimating me so much?</p><p></p><p>The lady in plain clothes fell silent, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion snorted coldly, "You're so arrogant, boy. There are not even ten peak grand masters, and you still look down on them? Are you saying you can single-handedly defeat ten peak grand masters?"</p><p></p><p>This kid is too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>His arrogance is making her so uncomfortable that she almost couldn't resist the urge to teach him a lesson.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at her, "You woman, what do you know? The weak are arrogant, but the truly strong are never arrogant, they only speak the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? And just how strong do you have to be to say that?" the Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Not that strong, someone like you, I could kill with just two or three sword strikes, it wouldn't be too much trouble," Xu Yan said thoughtfully, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion was enraged, her aura surging, the sky darkening, gritting her teeth in anger, "Arrogant brat, you think you can kill me with just two or three sword strikes? Let's see you try!"</p><p></p><p>As a peak grand master, she had never been so humiliated before. </p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Sovereign Xie Tianheng didn't dare to make such a bold claim!</p><p></p><p>"Master, calm down, calm down!" the lady in plain clothes hurriedly persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan furrowed his brow, "Why would I want to kill you? Besides, my services don't come cheap, without a hundred million spirit crystals, you're not worthy of me!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion was so angry she couldn't take it anymore, her chest heaving, her jade-like face flushed red. She angrily threw her disciple to the back and roared, "Today, I must teach this brat a lesson, don't try to stop me!"</p><p></p><p>The lady in plain clothes' face changed, and she anxiously called out from behind, "Young Master Xu, please go easy on her!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion: ...</p><p></p><p>Rebellious disciple! She was even angrier, and with a wave of her hand, she threw a bag at Xu Yan, coldly saying, "There are more than enough spirit crystals inside, let's see how you kill me in two or three sword strikes!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, this Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion is a good person! </p><p></p><p>She's actually giving him money to teach her a lesson, he had never encountered such a person in his life.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, then take my sword strike!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the bag, drew his sword, and unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The mountains and rivers echoed with the dragon's cry!</p><p></p><p>The enraged Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion, however, did not underestimate or look down on him. Two willow-leaf-like double swords appeared in her hands, and she struck out fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength was formidable, so she naturally did not doubt it. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could she dare to go to Canglan Island to fight? It was just that his boast of killing her in two or three sword strikes was what angered her. How dare he treat a peak grand master like her as nothing? She was a peak grand master, her strength among the peak grand masters was not weak.</p><p></p><p>How could she be compared to those trash grand masters? Boom! The mountains and rivers were enveloped, the dragon's cry resounding, as the sword strike descended.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was shattered, the majestic aura that stirred the winds and clouds was extinguished under this sword strike. She hurriedly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not strike again.</p><p></p><p>It's not like he really wanted to kill her.</p><p></p><p>"This sword strike of mine is only average, what do you think? If I go all out, can you block three strikes?" Xu Yan sheathed his sword.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Gritting her teeth, her expression complex, inwardly cursing, where did this monster come from, whose disciple is he that he can teach out such a monster? Indeed, the truly strong are never arrogant!</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you alright?" the lady in plain clothes hurriedly came over, caressing her master's heaving chest. "Don't be angry, Young Master Xu is an upright person who never lies, why don't you listen to him, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Rebellious disciple! The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion was so angry she could barely stand it, glaring fiercely at her disciple.</p><p></p><p>After comforting her master, the lady in plain clothes came over with an apologetic expression, "Young Master Xu, please forgive my master, she's just a bit willful, but she means no harm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Xu, for going easy on her. This is a small token of gratitude from Miaomiao, I hope the Young Master won't disdain it." </p><p></p><p>The lady in plain clothes personally handed a bag to Xu Yan, her delicate white hands lingering on his for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, cheerfully saying, "There's no need to be so polite, Miss, you're too kind."</p><p></p><p>"It's only right." The lady in plain clothes reluctantly withdrew her hand.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion was about to be driven crazy by her own disciple, seizing the opportunity to give gifts, what charm does that guy have!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, my name is Yun Caimai, please be careful on Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>Yun Caimai said softly.</p><p></p><p>"A few peak grand masters are nothing, Miss Caimai, you can rest assured," Xu Yan finally learned that the lady in plain clothes was named Yun Caimai.</p><p></p><p>Recalling their first meeting at the Matchless Pavilion, her captivating beauty had left a deep impression on him, truly a beauty that is admired but unattainable.</p><p></p><p>However, her charms had no effect on him.</p><p></p><p>Before Yun Caimai could say anything else, the Grand Master of the Matchless Pavilion, unable to accept this, dragged her disciple and left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Caimai is truly a good girl, generous and magnanimous, she wholeheartedly helped me cultivate my heart and mind back then, how rare," Xu Yan sighed admiringly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong beside him nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng remained silent, his brother Xu truly has "no women in his heart", his state of mind is so profound, far beyond his reach! Hu Shan's facial muscles twitched, these two brothers are too straightforward, don't they realize that the girl has tender feelings for him? He couldn't help but ponder, could it be that it's precisely because their minds are solely focused on the martial dao, without any other distractions, that they have become so monstrous and powerful?</p><p></p><p>"I should change too, I can't think too much, just focus on the martial dao is enough," Hu Shan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Wishing everyone a happy Mid-Autumn Festival and a joyful family reunion!

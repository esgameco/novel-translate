        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The incident on Canglan Island immediately alarmed everyone.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying, Shi Er, and other weaker cultivators felt a powerful oppressive force, and their faces instantly paled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Have the enemies come again?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, no one dares to come to Canglan Island." </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Everyone hurriedly came out of their houses.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sound rang out again, and Canglan Island trembled slightly, with the oppressive force growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Startled, everyone looked towards the sound. In the spirit fruit grove, wood chips were flying, and a small section of the grove had been reduced to dust and haze.</p><p></p><p>That was where the Red Tiger was sleeping!</p><p></p><p>"Red Tiger!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit fruit grove, the Red Tiger stood up, its body as massive as a small mountain, with surging demonic aura and terrifying might, emitting a thunderous roar from within.</p><p></p><p>A slight tremor would instantly reduce the surrounding spirit fruit trees to powder.</p><p></p><p>"You go to the Cangjiang River!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>This spirit fruit grove was one of Canglan Island's core assets. These spirit fruits were his mother's favorite. Destroying even one would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>The Red Tiger's breakthrough had already destroyed over a dozen trees in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Surging with demonic aura and terrifying might, the Red Tiger roared and swung its tail, turning another spirit fruit tree into powder.</p><p></p><p>It did not want to go to the Cangjiang River to complete its final transformation.</p><p></p><p>"If you transform here, the commotion will be too great. Do you want to turn Canglan Island into a barren land?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Although the Red Tiger was somewhat afraid of Xu Yan, it felt that it was about to become a great demon, and it should overcome its fear.</p><p></p><p>A mighty demon, how could it be so timid! "Are you itching for a beating?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glared, the Red Tiger thought it was becoming a great demon and had the confidence to defy him. </p><p></p><p>So what if it had become a great demon? Did it dare to rebel?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan descended immediately, and the Red Tiger's body trembled, but it stood firmly, its limbs shaking but refusing to lie down! It was a tiger about to become a great demon!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, watching the stubborn Red Tiger, his mouth twitching. It was just asking for trouble. Did it really think that just because it was about to become a great demon, it could resist Xu Yan? If it was afraid of Xu Yan, it should just obediently lie down, why be so stubborn?</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Xuan did not intervene with the Red Tiger. If it really transformed on Canglan Island, the spirit fruit grove would be devastated.</p><p></p><p>The spirit fruit grove was Lady Xu's favorite place, and the spirit fruits were her favorite to eat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a filial son.</p><p></p><p>So the Red Tiger was just asking for trouble, stubbornly insisting on transforming in the spirit fruit grove. As long as it changed the location, Xu Yan would not bother with it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Red Tiger's massive size, Xu Yan seemed rather small, but as soon as he descended, he exuded an overwhelming might. The Red Tiger's limbs had already weakened, and it directly fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>It still refused to submit, growling and struggling to get up.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you really are itching for a beating."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed a piece of skin on the back of the Red Tiger's neck and with a thunderous sound, directly lifted it up and flung it away.</p><p></p><p>Like a great mountain crashing into the Cangjiang River, a huge splash of water shot up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>As it fell into the water, the Red Tiger realized it should not have been so stubborn. Thinking about how it had destroyed over a dozen spirit fruit trees, it panicked. Those were Lady Xu's favorite spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a great demon, it would just get beaten up, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>The more it thought about it, the more anxious the Red Tiger became. It obediently lay on the surface of the Cangjiang River and began its final transformation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Each thunderous roar would stir up a wave on the Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>On the Cangjiang River, a massive tiger-like creature, as huge as a small mountain, surged with demonic aura and terrifying might, shocking the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Although the ships on the Cangjiang River had all kept a safe distance from the waters around Canglan Island, the Red Tiger's transformation caused too much commotion. Especially with its mountain-like size, it was impossible to go unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Each tremor caused the Red Tiger's body to shudder and expand, its size growing even larger.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the peak of Canglan Island, Li Xuan watched the Red Tiger's transformation on the Cangjiang River, his heart filled with excitement. The first great demon had been born, and the great demon martial dao would soon emerge.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of feedback will the Dao Golden Book give?"</p><p></p><p>The great demon martial dao belonged to the beast cultivation system, not suitable for humans. So the Dao Golden Book's feedback might not be a direct reflection of the Red Tiger's cultivation in the great demon martial dao.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone was watching the Red Tiger's transformation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the Red Tiger's body suddenly expanded, letting out a deep roar, and a beam of light surged out from it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Red Tiger rose into the air, hovering in midair.</p><p></p><p>Emanating terrifying might, a powerful aura swept across the area. Its eyes gleamed with a fierce glow, its body shimmering with demonic light. It raised a paw and pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The waters of the Cangjiang River were instantly pressed down.</p><p></p><p>The excited Red Tiger roared and started galloping on the Cangjiang River, causing the nearby ships to hurriedly dock on the shore. </p><p></p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>A tiger-like creature as massive as a mountain, galloping on the Cangjiang River, its oppressive force overwhelming. Even peak grand masters might not possess such a terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>"Your pet Red Tiger has successfully cultivated the great demon martial dao you created. You have gained the Great Demon Sovereign and Demon Summoning techniques."</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Red Tiger transformed into a great demon, the Dao Golden Book on the spiritual platform opened, and a golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>Great Demon Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Dao Golden Book did not provide feedback on the Red Tiger's cultivation in the great demon martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Great Demon Sovereign?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the mysterious light imprint that appeared on the spiritual platform, emanating a profound aura. Within the light imprint, the silhouette of the Red Tiger could be faintly seen.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon Sovereign could command and control all great demons, harnessing their power for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Demon Sovereign has some divine abilities. Even from a distance, one can summon great demons and utilize their power, which is almost as powerful as the great demons themselves.</p><p></p><p>"To command a myriad of demons to slay enemies, just the thought of it is thrilling.</p><p></p><p>"And the summoned great demons will possess the original demon's consciousness. If the distance is not too far, one can even directly summon the great demon's main body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart was filled with excitement. The Great Demon Sovereign had a wide range of applications, not just for summoning great demons, but also for covering oneself with the power of great demons.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Great Demon Sovereign, the Dao Golden Book also provided the Demon Summoning technique.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, it is the method of directly infusing the great demon martial dao into the consciousness of beasts, allowing them to inherently possess the legacy of becoming a great demon.</p><p></p><p>In this way, beasts cultivating the great demon martial dao would find it easier to comprehend and master the ways of the great demons.</p><p></p><p>However, the Demon Summoning technique cannot be used to transform just any beast into a demon. Just as with humans, those with poor innate talent cannot even enter the path of cultivation, let alone become a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The situation with beasts is even more serious. Even if one tries to impart the Demonic Dao of the Great Demons into their consciousness through Witchcraft, it may still be difficult for them to cultivate into Demons.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to transform beasts into Demons, one should look for beasts with relatively higher intelligence and sensitivity, as the success rate of Demonization would be higher.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of the Swallowing Toad, which was a Spirit Beast and had some differences from the Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm has Spirit Beasts, and these Spirit Beasts have relatively higher intelligence, so the success rate of Demonization would be higher."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Beasts in this world do not seem to possess the methods of cultivation, and their growth mainly relies on their bloodline. Once Spirit Beasts reach a certain level, they have almost reached their peak.</p><p></p><p>Those who can break through this limit are extremely rare, and this type of Spirit Beast is the king among Spirit Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Since Spirit Beasts have inherent superior qualities, if they cultivate the Dao of the Great Demons and break through the limits of their bloodline, it would be a common occurrence."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He even suspected that the Crimson Cat might possess the bloodline of a Spirit Beast, otherwise, how could this big cat have much higher intelligence than other Crimson-Eyed Tigers?</p><p></p><p>"Being able to be captured by me at a glance is also its own opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat becoming the first Great Demon, even if its original Spirit Beast bloodline was thin, the bloodline of the powerful Spirit Beast it cultivated later would still not be able to catch up to it.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat was excited for a while, but suddenly remembered that it had angered Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Its heart immediately panicked, as although it had become a Great Demon, it was obviously no match for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes darted around, and it recalled that when it underwent its transformation, it had destroyed the Spirit Fruit Tree, and Xu Yan's anger was because the Spirit Fruit Grove was Xu Mother's favorite place. The Spirit Fruits were Xu Mother's favorite fruits to eat.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Xu Yan was so angry and wanted to beat it up.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration came to the Crimson Cat's mind, and it immediately had an idea.</p><p></p><p>While rushing back to Canglan Island, its body size kept shrinking, and by the time it returned to Canglan Island, its size had already returned to that of an ordinary Crimson-Eyed Tiger.</p><p></p><p>However, its body size continued to shrink.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it returned to Canglan Island, the Crimson Cat was almost bristling with fur, as a powerful aura had locked onto it, ready to pin it down and beat it up at any moment! It was panicked and its eyes darted around everywhere, finally spotting Xu Mother's figure.</p><p></p><p>It frantically ran towards her.</p><p></p><p>But the sword intent was already hovering above its head, ready to strike down at any moment.</p><p></p><p>By the time it reached Xu Mother, the Crimson Cat's size had shrunk to that of an ordinary cat.</p><p></p><p>"Meow, meow, meow..."</p><p></p><p>It opened its mouth and started meowing, directly curling up at Xu Mother's feet, acting cute.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat was so afraid of Xu Yan that, in order to avoid being beaten, it transformed into a small cat to curry favor with Xu Mother.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that the Crimson Cat's actions were successful in avoiding a beating.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Crimson Cat's cute appearance, Xu Mother immediately became delighted and started petting it, and the Crimson Cat had a blissful expression as it continued acting cute.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Crimson Cat's transformation into a Great Demon, a giant beast like a mountain, had naturally spread throughout the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts were shocked, as the senior on Canglan Island was truly unfathomable, that a pet could become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island had returned to peace, with Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu all diligently cultivating, as well as Shi Er and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>Except for Xu Mother, everyone on Canglan Island was working hard on their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Mother also became a little more diligent.</p><p></p><p>She cultivated for one and a half hours a day.</p><p></p><p>In the North Ashen region, the gate to the Spirit Realm still had not disappeared, with ripples undulating.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a peak Grandmaster Patriarch happened to come by and discovered the gate to the Spirit Realm, excitedly rushing towards it and unleashing his full strength, finally pushing open the gate to the Spirit Realm and entering.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the group of Half-Step Celestials from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion watched silently.</p><p></p><p>This was the first peak Grandmaster Patriarch from the Inner Realm to enter the Spirit Realm gate.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm opened a crack, and several shredded corpses were thrown out, with a disdainful voice faintly heard: "Pig-dog trash, killing them is too dirty for my hands!"</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm closed again.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the few Half-Step Celestials from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion who still had some thoughts about entering the Spirit Realm, now had their hearts sink, no longer daring to have such an idea.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master was right, Inner Realm cultivators entering there were like servants, like pigs and dogs!</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were high and mighty, looking down on the Inner Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they felt a sense of anger, but even more so, a sense of helplessness and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Desolate Dao?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the idea of the Great Desolate Dao emerged in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Great Desolate Dao in the Inner Realm would not be restricted, and they could continue cultivating it indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>If everyone in the Inner Realm cultivated the Great Desolate Dao, one day there would certainly be no shortage of experts comparable to the Dao Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Then, what qualifications would the Spirit Realm cultivators have to remain high and mighty, to look down on the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, tell some people that the gate to the Spirit Realm has appeared, let them go in. Only when they know the plight of Inner Realm cultivators will they make the right choice."</p><p></p><p>A Half-Step Celestial spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>As an Inner Realm cultivator, being looked down upon and trampled on like this, how could their hearts not be filled with anger?</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, a martial dao sect was currently debating whether to continue cultivating the Inner Realm martial dao or to have their junior disciples switch to cultivating the Great Desolate Dao.</p><p></p><p>Their sect's own heritage was complete and could be cultivated all the way to the peak Grandmaster Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Desolate Dao currently only had the Innate Realm, and to obtain the Innate Realm cultivation methods, one could only go to the Great Desolate.</p><p></p><p>The sect's Patriarch was a peak Grandmaster Patriarch, almost a Half-Step Celestial, but because he had been in seclusion cultivating diligently in the past, he did not participate in the Subjugation of the Heavens Alliance, and thus survived.</p><p></p><p>Now old, he had naturally become more stubborn. He did not agree to switch to cultivating the Great Desolate Dao, as the sect's heritage could not be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Since the Patriarch had spoken, all voices advocating the switch to the Great Desolate Dao were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the elder received a message and was greatly excited, directly departing the sect, and before leaving, he even left behind the words "This trip will surely lead to Celestial."</p><p></p><p>In the North Ashen region, in front of the gate to the Spirit Realm, over a dozen peak Grandmaster Patriarchs gathered, most of them being venerable old figures, but also the patriarch-level existences of their respective forces, people of great influence.</p><p></p><p>"This time, will anyone come back alive?"</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion asked.</p><p></p><p>"They are too old, without any potential left, not even qualified to be servants, killing them would be too dirty, so someone will come back alive."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm opened, and the over a dozen old figures entered.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, the entrants were all thrown out of the Spirit Realm gate, crashing heavily to the ground, with three of them already lifeless.</p><p></p><p>The remaining ones had ashen faces, their auras in disarray, appearing even more aged.</p><p></p><p>They murmured in their mouths, "Pigs and dogs? We are just pigs and dogs? Not even qualified to be servants?"</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, they were patriarch-level existences.</p><p></p><p>But upon entering the Spirit Realm, they were not even worth as much as pigs and dogs?!</p><p></p><p>Being looked down upon and trampled on like this, how could they endure it? Gradually, a fire of anger burned in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damned Spirit Realm, your arrogance knows no bounds!"</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Patriarch who returned to the sect changed his attitude and resolutely supported the switch to cultivating the Great Desolate Dao.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 289</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire venue was deathly quiet, and everyone was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng unleashed a secret technique, transforming into a blood-red sword beam that charged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It was a fierce, swift, and ruthless strike. Even a late-stage Refining Spirit Celestial would be gravely injured, if not killed.</p><p></p><p>However, just as everyone was watching Xu Yan, expecting to see how he would parry this strike, they were horrified to see that Yu Changfeng, whose sword was heading towards Xu Yan, was gradually dissolving.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan, from start to finish, had remained standing in the same position, his sword still sheathed! In just a moment, Yu Changfeng had died and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>A thud!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists were all aghast.</p><p></p><p>What kind of power did Xu Yan possess? What martial art technique had he used?</p><p></p><p>"The scoundrel is vicious, not even leaving the corpse of my Sword Sect disciple! Today, I will not let you off!" the Sword Sect Elder roared as he drew his sword, furious.</p><p></p><p>Changda Niu's spirit was finally lifted, thinking it was finally his turn to act. The Spiritual Sect had violated the rules, and they should be held accountable. Although Xu Yan was not a genius of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, the rules of the genius confrontation applied to all wandering cultivators, not just the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and asked, "Is there a rule that says I must leave the challenger's corpse behind if I kill them?"</p><p></p><p>"No, there is no such rule. Life and death are self-determined, and there is no prohibition against reducing the body to ashes," Changda Niu shouted before the Sword Sect Elder could speak.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, satisfied that he had not violated the rules.</p><p></p><p>Although rules are meant to be broken, he was still new to the Spiritual Realm, so it was better to remain low-key for now. Otherwise, if others refused to challenge him, that would not be good.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the murderous Sword Sect Elder, he said, "Leaving the corpse behind is too much trouble and can pollute the environment. I, Xu Yan, love the environment, so I always let the enemy return to dust and earth."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>He made reducing the body to ashes sound so refined and elegant, something they had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Elder was furious, wanting to strike, but Changda Niu was glaring at him, and if he made a move, he would be the one violating the rules, which could bring trouble to the Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>For this genius confrontation, the upper sect had intentionally passed down an order that the rules must not be violated, unless the Myriad Worlds Alliance violated them first. Xu Yan glanced at the Sword Sect Elder, who was at the late-stage Refining Spirit Celestial level, much stronger than Zhu Liang, the early-stage Refining Spirit Celestial, but in Xu Yan's eyes, he was still not much.</p><p></p><p>Especially when it came to the sword dao he cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"I know you want to strike, so I'll allow you to do so. Come, let's have a competition," Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've said so!" The Sword Sect Elder was delighted, as this would not be considered a violation of the rules.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that Xu Yan might change his mind, he let out a roar and charged with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still held his long sword, but this time, when facing the Sword Sect Elder's fierce attacks, he occasionally shifted his position to evade the ruthless strikes.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Patriarch grew increasingly gloomy. This youth's sword techniques were strange, and it seemed he had already grasped the flaws in the Sword Sect's sword techniques, evading each move with ease.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Elder also noticed this and frowned, unleashing one fierce strike after another, seemingly using all his strength.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he suddenly unleashed a secret technique, merging his body and sword, attacking with lightning speed and ferocity, his aura locking onto Xu Yan. Xu Yan tapped his finger, and a sword beam erupted from his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Sword Sect Patriarch's face was filled with horror!</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect Elder's body disintegrated into ashes, leaving only a sword that fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan narrowed his eyes slightly, feeling a deeper understanding of the sword dao at this moment, his accumulated foundation increasing once more.</p><p></p><p>"He's still a bit lacking. His strength is still a bit short," Xu Yan said, turning his gaze to the Sword Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The peak Refining Spirit Celestial cultivator was only a step away from refining a thread of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. His strength was far superior to the one from the Crimson Dark Sect.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was the leader of the top-tier Spiritual Sect under the Thousand Martial Palace! Moreover, the Sword Sect Patriarch had a fierce and ruthless sword aura, even though he had not yet comprehended the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely refined and sharp.</p><p></p><p>If it were a cultivator of another martial art, Xu Yan would not dare to challenge him directly with his current strength, as he was only at the peak of the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Sword Sect Patriarch cultivated the sword dao, Xu Yan had no fear.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the initial success in the Heart Sword Realm. No matter how strong the Sword Sect Patriarch's sword dao was, Xu Yan could still perceive its flaws and even control the opponent's sword.</p><p></p><p>All things in the world are swords, and the enemy's sword is also his own sword!</p><p></p><p>"I know you want to strike, so go ahead," Xu Yan said, looking at the Sword Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, be careful. He is the Sword Sect Patriarch!" Changda Niu was already shocked by Xu Yan's slaying of the Sword Sect Elder, and now he was going to challenge the Sword Sect Patriarch?</p><p></p><p>"Changda Niu, just take care of your Luo Zhou Alliance." Fankashan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are arrogant. Since you dare to let me draw my sword, it seems you are confident in yourself!" The Sword Sect Patriarch stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>With each step, the sword aura grew stronger, until at the end, a terrifying sword aura soared hundreds of feet into the sky, the killing intent rippling in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Sword in hand, the murderous intent was boiling! Xu Yan's gaze narrowed slightly. The Sword Sect Patriarch was indeed very strong, his refined sword aura being the sharpest he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he spoke, "You are the Sword Sect Patriarch, who has dedicated your life to the sword dao. Although I have not yet entered the door of the sword dao, and do not even know what the sword dao is, if I do not draw my sword, it would be disrespectful to you. I, Xu Yan, have always valued my opponents, so you are worthy of me drawing my sword."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: You really do value your opponents a lot!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I have not even entered the door of the sword dao? You are arrogant, boy!" The Sword Sect Patriarch's eyes were cold and his anger surged.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew his sword, standing proudly and said indifferently, "The sword dao of the world, I am its master. You are only strong in cultivation realm, but in the sword dao, you are still far behind, not even having entered its door!"</p><p></p><p>My master is an existence that transcends heaven and earth, so in this world, he is the master of the sword dao, without any doubt!</p><p></p><p>Changda Niu took a deep breath. This was too arrogant, too proud.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sword Sect Patriarch's strength was not as good as his, he was definitely one of the top Refining Spirit Celestials. Yet in Xu Yan's eyes, he had not even entered the door of the sword dao?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"The rumors say Xu Yan is arrogant, but he is even more arrogant than the rumors!"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sect Patriarch is going to be furious, isn't he? I even suspect he might directly use a secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" The Sword Sect Patriarch roared, unleashing a sword strike. The sword energy swept across the sky, slicing the surrounding plants into powder with its unparalleled sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze remained calm, and he struck with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was level, but it was as if mountains and rivers appeared, covering and suppressing the Sword Sect Patriarch's sword energy in an instant. The Sword Sect Patriarch was a top-tier expert, and his sword techniques were expansive, with sword energy and sword light blanketing the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Despite the distance, the observing martial artists could all feel a frigid killing intent.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>The weaker onlookers hastily retreated a distance.</p><p></p><p>Elder Daniu's gaze sharpened. The Sword Pavilion Master's strength was indeed formidable, worthy of being the top-tier Spiritual Sect disciple of the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>"He is a Treasure Body!" Daniu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master possessed the Treasure Body talent. At this moment, he was mobilizing the essence of his Treasure Body, unleashing his hidden sword techniques. Even Daniu could feel the intense and ruthless killing aura.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strode through the sword qi, each step taken at the weak points of the Sword Pavilion Master's sword techniques, and every sword thrust easily neutralized the Sword Pavilion Master's killing moves.</p><p></p><p>He walked leisurely on the battlefield, amidst the criss-crossing sword qi, his sword devoid of any fierce killing intent, appearing ordinary.</p><p></p><p>And each time he struck, there was no powerful sword intent, nor any fierce sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Yet, each time he struck, he would inevitably pierce through the Sword Pavilion Master's killing moves, breaking through his ruthless sword qi, calmly passing through the openings.</p><p></p><p>It was as if no matter how the Sword Pavilion Master attacked, no matter how he displayed his exquisite and fierce sword techniques, Xu Yan understood them thoroughly, perceiving the flaws within.</p><p></p><p>These openings and weaknesses in the sword techniques were even unknown to the Sword Pavilion Master himself.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, the Sword Pavilion Master's expression growing increasingly grave, daring not to be the slightest bit careless.</p><p></p><p>He became more and more alarmed. How was Xu Yan always able to easily neutralize his killing moves? When did these killing moves develop such gaping flaws? Xu Yan's expression was solemn, seemingly strolling leisurely amidst the criss-crossing sword qi, but he too dared not be the slightest bit careless, transcending the Sword Heart Clarity realm, perceiving the Sword Pavilion Master's sword techniques, naturally handling them with ease.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sword Pavilion Master's strength was still extraordinary. Even though he had grasped the flaws in the sword techniques, he still needed the ability to seize those fleeting openings to strike.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi entered his body, the sword lights constantly slashing towards him, the killing force growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in the battle, immersed in the accumulation of his own foundation. At this moment, within his body, and even within his sword intent, a mysterious momentum seemed to have gathered.</p><p></p><p>This momentum seemed to be able to elevate his state of mind, enhance the foundation of his martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This was not the momentum that martial artists would display, but a "momentum" within the realm of intent.</p><p></p><p>"When the momentum is full, it will be the time for a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a realization.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating this realm of intent momentum, this martial dao momentum, reaching a certain degree, would be the time when his foundation was sufficient, ready to break through the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>And this momentum could only be accumulated in battle, in confrontation, by comprehending and containing the martial dao momentum of the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are indeed a prodigy, unparalleled in the Dao of the Sword, unprecedented in the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit that Xu Yan's sword dao was profoundly powerful and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"But you are too arrogant, too self-confident."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master said, as a faint icy glow surged from his body. This icy glow did not radiate from the sword edge, but from within his body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Pavilion Master's strength was continuously rising, the fierce killing aura also intensifying and coalescing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At a certain moment, the Sword Pavilion Master was enveloped in icy light.</p><p></p><p>"Although I am not a Spiritual Body, I am a Frost Blade Treasure Body, and I have also cultivated sword techniques that are in harmony with my Frost Blade Treasure Body. Even an early-stage Supremely Strong martial artist can contend with me!"</p><p></p><p>This was the Sword Pavilion Master's confidence.</p><p></p><p>Although Treasure Bodies are weaker than Spiritual Bodies, Treasure Body martial artists are not necessarily weaker than Spiritual Body martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Everything depended on one's own cultivation!</p><p></p><p>He was the top-tier Spiritual Sect disciple of the Thousand Martial Palace, and his innate talent was naturally not lacking. He also had the powerful Thousand Martial Palace as his backing.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the highest-level sword dao, constantly refining and unleashing the power of his Treasure Body, and even cultivated sword techniques that were in harmony with his Treasure Body.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Sword Pavilion Master had no choice but to activate his Treasure Body, fully revealing its might.</p><p></p><p>Icy light erupted from his body, like a frigid divine sword.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword qi unleashed by the Sword Pavilion Master became bone-chillingly cold, the battlefield seeming to be frozen by the icy sword qi, the space it occupied appearing to be frozen into ice.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan walked, he felt a sense of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>The frosty sword qi seemed to permeate everywhere, inescapable.</p><p></p><p>"How will you break this move of mine to seal you? Unless you can forcefully break through my sword qi, no matter how you evade, it will be futile."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master sneered.</p><p></p><p>The icy glow grew stronger and stronger, the sword qi slashing through the air, seemingly leaving behind sharp icy blades.</p><p></p><p>The frigid sword qi continued to condense and suppress towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master appeared relaxed, but in reality, he had already exerted his full strength, with his Treasure Body activated to the limit, and his sword techniques displayed to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>His current state was not much different from unleashing a powerful martial dao secret art.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was extremely massive, and he could not sustain prolonged battle.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he must achieve a quick victory!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master's movements grew faster and faster, his sword techniques becoming quicker and quicker, the battlefield transforming into a realm of icy light, making it impossible to see what was happening within.</p><p></p><p>And this icy light battlefield was constantly contracting, the area of coverage becoming smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is indeed formidable. If you were not a sword dao cultivator, I would have to retreat. But since you cultivate the sword dao, it's not that impressive.</p><p></p><p>"You have cultivated the sword dao your entire life, but you truly don't know what the sword dao is. Today, I will show you what the true sword dao is.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to witness the true sword dao before your death, you can rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike, and the Mountain River Sword Intent appeared, in an instant, the sword was like thunderous lightning, slashing down in an instant! Thunderclap Sword! The observing martial artists saw a sword of thunderous lightning emerge from the battlefield, slicing through the icy light, tearing apart the frigid sword qi.</p><p></p><p>The icy aura seemed to dissipate under the Thunderclap Sword.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, they saw Xu Yan's sword strike descend, as if they saw the mountains and rivers enveloping down, or as if they saw the sages of the world wielding the sword to strike down.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The Sword Pavilion Master had a look of disbelief on his face. At this moment, he realized that his sword was no longer under his control, as if it had become the enemy's sword! Even more terrifying was that the sword qi he had unleashed had also become the enemy's sword!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Pu! His body began to crumble, his divine soul dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"This is the sword dao? What kind of sword dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Pavilion Master was filled with unwillingness, resentment, and bewilderment, his body and soul dissipating, ultimately turning to ashes and dispersing! The top-tier Spiritual Sect Sword Pavilion Master, a powerful sword dao expert, had actually died at the hands of Xu Yan, a young prodigy! The Sword Immortal Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the martial artists deeply remembered this name.</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan's expression was extremely grave. Among the scattered cultivators, there was actually such a powerful prodigy? Even the Sword Pavilion Master had died at his hands.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already posed a threat to the transcendent Spiritual Sects' geniuses!</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, filled with anticipation, hoping that Xu Yan would continue his rampage, he spoke up to challenge him, for that would be his chance to eliminate this person!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

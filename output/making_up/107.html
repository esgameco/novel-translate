        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 107 Heaven Will Not Abandon My Blood Spirit Child</p><p></p><p>After passing on the Medicinal Dao Compendium and the basic pill-refining techniques to Su Lingxiu, she began to refine other medicinal pills, each with slight differences in the process.</p><p></p><p>Refining pills, after all, requires summarizing experience, and it is not always successful.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the consumption of medicinal materials for pill refining was not small.</p><p></p><p>"The average person really can't cultivate the Medicinal Dao Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>The Medicinal Dao Martial Dao was destined to be too difficult for the poor to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The consumption of refining pills alone was a burden they could not bear.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began to refine the Tempering Bone Pill, which was a medicinal pill she could use, and also refined the Blood Qi Pill to store it, as Zhou Ying wanted to switch to cultivating the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>First, he needed to sense the blood qi, and could only rely on the Blood Qi Pill to enhance the blood qi, and then refine the skin, bones, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was gloomy, as the successfully refined Blood Qi Pills were almost all taken by others, and he could only get the half-failed ones.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed of the Blood Qi Realm had become slower.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain the Blood Qi Pill, he could only go to find the medicinal materials needed to refine the Blood Qi Pill. Su Lingxiu directly told him that she would give him a preferential price, refining one batch of Blood Qi Pill with three portions of medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, "Pill refiners can really become rich easily. If this were in the inner domain, Su Lingxiu wouldn't have to worry about medicinal materials at all, as people would come to her to request pill refining."</p><p></p><p>The entry into the Medicinal Dao Martial Dao is difficult, and without a solid financial foundation, it is hard to sustain. But once one succeeds in entering and masters the pill-refining techniques, it will become easy.</p><p></p><p>It is enough to rely on the pill-refining techniques to obtain the medicinal materials one needs.</p><p></p><p>"Try the Tempering Bone Pill and see how the effect is."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu held the Tempering Bone Pill she had just refined and swallowed it directly.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pill melted in her mouth, and a warm flow entered her body, spreading throughout her bones, with a slightly numb sensation.</p><p></p><p>She activated the Bone Refining Technique and began to refine her bones.</p><p></p><p>"The Tempering Bone Pill's effect is not bad. The bone refining speed has increased by about 50%. If there were spirit herbs, the effect of the refined pill would probably be even more amazing."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was greatly excited in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"She's reached the stage of Tempering Golden Bones, this girl. Just one Tempering Bone Pill, and she's broken through the bottleneck and entered the Tempering Golden Bones stage. The speed is truly fast."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, becoming more and more suspicious that Su Lingxiu might have a special physique.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Meng Chong closed his eyes slightly, one hand gripping the sword hilt. As his blood qi circulated, the Great Sun Golden Bell was constantly improving, and he was not far from reaching the perfect Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind, sensing himself and also sensing the treasure sword.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he vaguely felt that the treasure sword trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is it an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to nurture the sword, but suddenly, the feeling of the sword trembling surfaced in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>However, the hand gripping the sword hilt did not feel the sword trembling at all.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>Sensing the heartbeat, suddenly, he felt the treasure sword trembling again, as if it appeared in sync with the heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>"Nurturing the sword with the heart, the sword and the heart resonate..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed in his heart. Could it be that he was about to succeed in nurturing the sword?</p><p></p><p>"Cannot be distracted, cannot be impatient, cannot be negligent, calm the mind..."</p><p></p><p>His mind gradually calmed down, his thoughts turned inward, comprehending the self, feeling the pulsation of his own pulse, the beating of his heart, and the circulation of his blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the feeling of the treasure sword trembling kept appearing in his mind, becoming clearer and clearer, and gradually synchronizing with his heartbeat, as if it was about to form a resonance with the heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>"I feel I'm close."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Wu Kingdom, the boundless great mountains.</p><p></p><p>Since Meng Chong had displayed his extraordinary abilities, a wave of seeking out high-level figures had emerged in the Wu Kingdom, and more and more people from the jianghu entered the boundless great mountains.</p><p></p><p>Including members of the Wu Kingdom's royal family and the children of the great ministers.</p><p></p><p>The first to enter the boundless great mountains were undoubtedly the renowned elders of the Wu Kingdom, the old master Wu and his two disciples.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the boundless great mountains, a deep valley, the forest was dense and no sunlight could be seen, and even more eerie was the absence of any bird or insect sounds.</p><p></p><p>In the deathly silent valley, on the steep mountain walls, there was a crack, as if it had been split open by a knife, the crack extending deep into the mountain, its end unseen.</p><p></p><p>Gloomy, dark, and cold... There seemed to be a chilling wind blowing out of the mountain crevice.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu and his disciples were advancing through the mountain crevice.</p><p></p><p>One disciple in the lead, one disciple behind, with Elder Wu walking in the middle, his eyes filled with excitement and regret.</p><p></p><p>It was more than eighty years ago, when he was being pursued by an enemy, he hid in the boundless great mountains and accidentally came to this valley, entering this mountain crevice and ambushing and killing the pursuing enemy.</p><p></p><p>He was also seriously injured, and after crawling into the mountain crevice, he unexpectedly found a strange vine. The fresh blood flowing from his body dripped onto the vine and was absorbed by it, and the fruit hanging on the vine gradually became reddish and emitted an alluring fragrance.</p><p></p><p>He was dizzy from blood loss, and as a last resort, he plucked and ate the fruit.</p><p></p><p>After eating it, he passed out. When he woke up, he found that the vine had withered, but he was filled with strength, his mind was clear, and he could stay awake for ten days and nights without feeling tired.</p><p></p><p>He knew he had encountered a great opportunity, and immediately continued to venture deeper into the mountain crevice, but after going about a hundred paces, the cold wind blew, and the deep and bottomless mountain crevice seemed to have a demon waiting to swallow him, and he became afraid and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Over the past eighty-plus years, he has lived to be over a hundred years old, still vigorous and energetic, becoming a respected elder in the jianghu of the Wu Kingdom. All of this was related to that fruit he ate back then.</p><p></p><p>He had come back here several times, but never saw a second fruit.</p><p></p><p>Each time, he did not dare to venture deep into the mountain crevice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's appearance made him realize that he might have missed a great opportunity back then, so he brought his two disciples here.</p><p></p><p>After entering the mountain crevice for a hundred paces, the cold wind blew from the crevice, making them shiver involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The dark, deep, and silent mountain crevice, if one were to advance alone, they might not be able to withstand the fear in their heart.</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall we continue forward?" </p><p></p><p>The disciple in the lead took out a luminous pearl, illuminating the gloomy mountain crevice. In the faint light, the deep mountain crevice seemed to want to swallow them in.</p><p></p><p>"You disciples of mine, when I was young, I missed an opportunity because of fear. Are you going to miss the opportunity too?</p><p></p><p>"Think about Meng Chong's extraordinary abilities. Don't you want to be like him?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Master is right!"</p><p></p><p>The disciple gritted his teeth and continued forward.</p><p></p><p>The mountain crevice started to slope downward, becoming deeper and colder.</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were about to give up and retreat due to the fear in their hearts...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint light appeared ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, we're almost there, the opportunity has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>The three hurried forward and reached the light, finding that the end of the mountain crevice was a cave, and in the center of the cave was a pool of water.</p><p></p><p>The pool emitted a faint silver glow, illuminating the surroundings of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Around the pool, there were some silver-colored grasses that gave a sense of spirituality.</p><p></p><p>On the cave walls, there seemed to be some faint carvings.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Case.</p><p></p><p>"Could those be martial arts techniques? And the water in this pool, could it be a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu excitedly entered the cave.</p><p></p><p>The two disciples were also extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The three of them came to the edge of the pool, looking at the several silver-colored grasses, which were clearly not ordinary medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>And the water in the pool was emanating a silver glow, hazy and beautiful - this was truly a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when I was young, I once read in a storybook that there is a magical water in the world that can cleanse the body and restore youth. Could this be it?"</p><p></p><p>One of the disciples said as he stripped off his clothes and walked into the pool.</p><p></p><p>The other disciple saw this and quickly undressed as well, entering the pool and immersing himself in the water.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you should come in too. The water is so bright, I feel all my fatigue has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>One of the disciples called out.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu sighed in exasperation, "You fools, the best way to use this magical water is to drink it. By bathing in it, you've only polluted the water!"</p><p></p><p>The two disciples suddenly froze, completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Young people these days..." </p><p></p><p>Elder Wu shook his head with a sigh, and began to undress, intending to soak in the pool as well, if it could truly restore his youth...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>His expression changed, something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The two disciples' expressions were dazed, their eyes vacant, as if they had lost their minds.</p><p></p><p>Being an experienced martial artist, he had escaped from many life-threatening crises before. Without hesitation, he turned and ran towards the exit of the cave.</p><p></p><p>His movements were agile, showing no signs of an elderly man.</p><p></p><p>However, with a thud, a large boulder fell and blocked the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's heart sank, and he turned back, only to be horrified by the sight.</p><p></p><p>In the pool, countless white, almost transparent worms were burrowing into the bodies of the two disciples. Their bodies were shriveling up, until only their clothes remained, even their hair disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's face turned deathly pale. Such a terrifying sight made his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>The white, almost transparent worms surged out of the pool, merging together into a single, bizarre worm with a blood-red interior.</p><p></p><p>Without eyes or a visible mouth, the worm wriggled towards Elder Wu.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's expression hardened, and he swung his knife fiercely at the worm, but in an instant, the worm vanished.</p><p></p><p>He felt a sharp pain in his forehead, and something had burrowed into his head, causing his consciousness to become muddled, as if it was being devoured.</p><p></p><p>He tried to speak, but only a wheezing sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"It's you, the one who ate the bait I left outside, but didn't come in, trapping me here and preventing me from leaving..."</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's pupils shrank, and a cold voice echoed in his mind. With his remaining consciousness, he fearfully asked, "Who are you? Spare me, Senior..."</p><p></p><p>"You should have died, you ate my bait but didn't come in, trapping me here." </p><p></p><p>The cold voice sounded angry, "You've grown so old, your body is almost useless now!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's last remaining consciousness: "My disciples are young, Senior..."</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit resentful, thinking the Senior was just fixated on him because of his old age, when his disciples were still young.</p><p></p><p>"The blood food didn't eat the bait, it's not suitable..." The cold voice chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu's consciousness finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The fallen Elder Wu's body suddenly shuddered and stood up, his eyes now cold and his voice filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"This decrepit body, how can it be used? How can I restore my strength..."</p><p></p><p>After moving the old body around a bit, a look of resignation appeared on Elder Wu's face.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the pool, he jumped in.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was practicing some kind of technique. After a while, he opened his eyes, a look of frustration on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this is a remote area, without the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth, I cannot cultivate."</p><p></p><p>The silver glow of the pool water gradually dimmed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Standing up from the pool, he pondered for a moment, then reached out and plucked a silver grass, swallowing it directly. He then began to circulate his technique.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally recovered a bit of strength."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining silver grasses, he plucked another one and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>"Two grasses, that's about my limit now."</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu sighed helplessly, gathering the remaining silver grasses and putting them away, then closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My consciousness is muddled, with little left. Wu Guo... a renowned figure in the jianghu?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Elder Wu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the heavens have not abandoned me, Blood Spirit Lord! In this remote area, there is actually a person with such a robust physique?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"This sturdy young man, his flesh and blood are so robust. If I can devour him, this decrepit body of mine can become young again, and my cultivation can be improved.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I return to the inner realm and cultivate for some time, I can surely restore my former power."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord was extremely excited. In the corner of the cave, he dug out a dull brown longsword with serrated edges on the back.</p><p></p><p>"My precious sword has lost its luster, how many years has it been?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>He split open the boulder blocking the cave entrance with the sword and walked into the mountain crevice, his excited voice echoing, "Young man, you are the cornerstone of my, the Blood Spirit Lord's, resurgence! As long as I devour you... Damn it, this old fool, my consciousness is muddled, I couldn't completely retrieve his memories..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the young man's name, and where is he?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving the ancient ruins, I'll go to the Wu Guo region, as I'm a renowned figure in the jianghu, I'm sure I can find out.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just wait and see, I, the Blood Spirit Lord, will make you all live in fear again!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord walked out of the desolate ancient ruins towards the boundless mountains. On the way, he encountered some Jianghu experts from the Wu Guo region who were visiting the mountains to seek out a master.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wu!" </p><p></p><p>The Jianghu experts hurriedly greeted him with respect.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... this fool seems to have quite a reputation."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord chuckled sinisterly.</p><p></p><p>The greeting Jianghu experts suddenly felt that something was off about Elder Wu.</p><p></p><p>"All of you shall become my blood food."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord swung his serrated sword, instantly slaying the Jianghu experts, and a cold power devoured their blood and essence.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui, ptui... too unpalatable, I won't eat that. I'll just eat the sturdy young man instead."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord continued on his way, muttering, "I've fused with the Blood Essence Worm, after devouring the young man, I'll have to find a way to separate from it, otherwise I'll just be a parasitic presence occupying this body."</p><p></p><p>He encountered a few more Jianghu experts, grabbing one and coldly asking, "Do you know where the young man named Meng Chong is?"</p><p></p><p>The Jianghu experts turned deathly pale, their faces filled with fear. This Elder Wu seemed... like a different person.</p><p></p><p>"He's called Meng Chong, but we don't know where he is."</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong?" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Lord memorized the name, then swung his blade, "Since you don't know where he is, then you can die!"</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 18: A Top Martial Artist of the Jianghu, Killed with a Single Punch!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rode a tall, powerful horse as he left the city, with two large packages hanging from the horse's back. One contained the precious medicinal herbs needed for his cultivation, and the other held the precious tiger skin of the Crimson-Eyed Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"The young master of the Xu family is going to seek out another expert again."</p><p></p><p>"Judging by the packages, it seems he's bringing valuable gifts to offer the expert."</p><p></p><p>Discussions arose as Xu Yan rode past, for the foolish son of the wealthy family was once again going to seek out an expert.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paid no heed to these comments, feeling proud in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well, how could they know the vastness of the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>After leaving the city, Xu Yan immediately noticed the hidden guards following him. His parents were surely worried about his safety, so they had the guards secretly protect him.</p><p></p><p>But these guards were far too weak. With Xu Yan's abilities, if he were to encounter any real danger, these guards wouldn't be able to save him - they'd likely be killed instantly.</p><p></p><p>About ten miles outside the city, Xu Yan spurred his horse and quickly entered a forest. With a little effort, he was able to lose the guards following him.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that no one was tailing him, Xu Yan returned to the small mountain village. His master disliked disturbances, so Xu Yan couldn't let anyone know the location of his master's secluded abode.</p><p></p><p>As the small town came into view, Xu Yan planned to rest there briefly before continuing on to the mountain village.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed up from behind, leaping into the air and landing steadily in front of Xu Yan, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed. Judging from the intruder's agile movements, he was a top-tier martial artist in the jianghu. It seemed the newcomer had ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, young master Xu, I've finally found you. I won't waste time - hand over the medicinal herbs, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>The man blocking the path was around forty years old, with limbs that were unusually long and thick compared to a normal person. However, his torso appeared thin and disproportionate, giving him a lanky, gangly appearance.</p><p></p><p>Sitting atop his horse, Xu Yan looked down at the man with disdain. "You?"</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" the lanky man growled.</p><p></p><p>He leaped into the air, his palm striking out towards Xu Yan's face.</p><p></p><p>Sitting calmly on his horse, Xu Yan didn't even furrow his brow. He could sense the power behind the man's palm strike, but it was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators of the Qi Kingdom, while they could shatter rocks and break through stone, their abilities were still quite ordinary to Xu Yan, who had already undergone five bone metamorphoses and was nearing the refinement of his true golden bones.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his qi and blood was far beyond what a mere top-tier martial artist could compare to. Even if he stood still and allowed the man to hack and slash at him, Xu Yan was confident he would emerge unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Facing the lanky man's palm strike, Xu Yan coldly shouted, "Begone!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his fist and struck out.</p><p></p><p>The fist collided with the palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The lanky man's eyes gleamed with malice, believing his powerful palm strike could easily shatter the young master Xu's arm, and then a follow-up strike would take his life. The precious medicinal herbs would then be his.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>However, upon impact, the man's expression suddenly changed drastically. His powerful strike had been crushed like paper, and his arm was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The fist continued, slamming into the man's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The lanky man was blasted away, his chest caved in, his bones shattered, and his internal organs pulverized. He was dead instantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had killed a top-tier martial artist of the jianghu with a single punch. He felt exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>"Too weak!" he exclaimed. "Like a mere grasshopper, killed with a single punch."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even used much force.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true essence of the martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were burning with fanaticism. His golden bones were not yet fully formed, and he had not yet entered the path of the martial arts, yet a top-tier expert was reduced to mere paper in his hands - the difference was heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to enter the path of the martial arts, I would be undefeatable in the entire Qi Kingdom, able to single-handedly face an entire army without issue!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the mighty imperial emperor would be nothing in comparison!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's blood was boiling, his eyes burning with fervor, his determination to cultivate the martial arts growing ever stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I must enter the path within a year, truly apprentice myself to a master, and cultivate the supreme martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>After killing the top-tier expert who blocked his path with a single punch, Xu Yan continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>"I can't leave any traces behind. I can't ride this horse anymore, it's too easy to track."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He immediately bent down and hoisted the horse onto his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>The horse: ???</p><p></p><p>Carrying the horse, Xu Yan strode into the mountain forest, circling around to erase his tracks, then headed towards a small mountain village to avoid being tracked.</p><p></p><p>It was only after passing through the Malicious Forest that he put the horse down and remounted, continuing on to the small mountain village.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally returned, bringing with him a large bundle of medicinal herbs. </p><p></p><p>What made Li Xuan even happier was the huge tiger skin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the vibrant colors, Li Xuan could almost be certain that this was the vicious tiger from the Malicious Forest!</p><p></p><p>The threat of the Malicious Forest had finally been eliminated, and he had also avenged the villagers who had tragically died.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I killed the crimson-eyed tiger in the Malicious Forest without causing a commotion."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully reported.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good job!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted in his heart, praising Xu Yan outwardly. He was quite satisfied with Xu Yan's performance on this trip.</p><p></p><p>"Master is finally satisfied with my performance. Now that my bones have undergone five transformations, I'm not far from refining my golden bones. Master must think my bone refining speed is not bad, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed at receiving the praise.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to your master's good guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held the tiger skin, growing more and more fond of it. This tiger skin was quite valuable and would make a good family heirloom!</p><p></p><p>This foolish disciple was actually quite reliable in handling matters.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan spoke encouragingly, "Keep cultivating diligently, keep contemplating, and you will surely achieve success."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master. Your disciple will never disappoint you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's excited state, Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this foolish disciple was really easy to fool. Just a little encouragement and he was as energetic as a rooster.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, your master believes in you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, then continued, "The weeds in the vegetable garden have grown again. Go clear them."</p><p></p><p>His foolish disciple had returned, so the accumulated weeds in the vegetable garden should be cleared as well.</p><p>With someone to take care of things, his peaceful days could continue.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback. He had just returned, so why did he have to go weed the garden?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke with a serious expression, "Your master sees that your mind is unsettled. Go weed the garden, calm your spirit, it will be beneficial for your contemplation and cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly realized, feeling somewhat ashamed: "Master has always taught me to be calm and composed, to be humble and not arrogant. After killing a top-tier expert with a single punch, I have become rather unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>"Master's insight is profound, seeing at a glance that my state of mind has become unsettled. Asking me to weed the garden to calm my spirit and settle down, so that I can refine my bones more effectively!"</p><p></p><p>The just-returned Xu Yan was immediately sent to weed the garden. Li Xuan sighed and marveled, this foolish disciple was just too easy to manipulate.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please continue reading, and thank you! ^_^</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By the time the martial artists present had recovered from the shock, Xu Yan and the others had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Where is Xu Yan? Grandpa, where did Xu Yan go?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked around anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!"</p><p></p><p>The elder felt somewhat ashamed. With his own strength, he had been so stunned that he didn't even notice when the person left.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, you've really become senile!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er stomped her foot.</p><p></p><p>The elder let out a wry laugh and rubbed his granddaughter's head, saying, "Yes, grandpa has become senile!"</p><p></p><p>"It's Yue'er who's senile!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er held her grandfather's hand and took to the skies, searching everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had just regained his senses as well, and in a flash, he searched the area within a hundred-li radius, but couldn't find a single trace of the person.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he encountered Yue'er and the elder.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, little miss, you seem a bit different."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu looked at Yue'er with surprise.</p><p></p><p>He took out a jade-green tree branch from his storage bag and said, "Little miss, come, let me hold this little tree and investigate your situation."</p><p></p><p>"Flower-robed freak, stay away from me."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er frowned.</p><p></p><p>She pulled her hands behind her back, not touching the tree branch.</p><p></p><p>"Little miss, don't be afraid, this might be an opportunity for you."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu smiled, what he thought was a friendly expression.</p><p></p><p>"Put it away, my granddaughter has nothing to do with your Yuling Palace."</p><p></p><p>The elder extended his cane and tapped the tree branch.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu stared at the elder for a while, then put away the tree branch and said, "Old man, you're going to ruin your granddaughter's future."</p><p></p><p>"That's not your concern."</p><p></p><p>The elder remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu nodded. He now understood that this young lady was likely a talented cultivator with a spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>"The old man doesn't seem to be an ordinary wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu smiled and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>As he left, his expression became a bit grave. The elder's strength was much greater than his own.</p><p></p><p>"A wandering cultivator at the peak of Refining Spirit Celestial? In this Spiritual Realm, how could there be a wandering cultivator who has cultivated to the peak of Refining Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu pondered this in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Yue'er, let's go."</p><p></p><p>The elder turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, how could Xu Yan run so fast that we can't find him?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked frustrated.</p><p></p><p>"If it's meant to be, they will meet again. This Spiritual Realm must have a place for him."</p><p></p><p>The elder said calmly.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the grand momentum of the heavens and earth like a dragon still lingered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's transformation of the mountain into a sword was already extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that the person who acted was even more shocking.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the hand, the grand momentum of the heavens and earth like a dragon - what a terrifying killing technique! With a sweep of the hand, a group of Refining Spirit Celestials were reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>In the manor, Li Xuan sat in a chair, leisurely and at ease.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were all in contemplation, absorbing the gains from this experience.</p><p></p><p>Especially Fang Hao, his mind was greatly shaken, repeatedly recalling the scene of the grand momentum of the heavens and earth transforming into a weapon. How magnificent and powerful that was!</p><p></p><p>However, what made him feel powerless was that he could not achieve it himself.</p><p></p><p>To truly comprehend it would require some time, and he was far from being able to wield it as freely as his master.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had no idea that Li Xuan's ability to do so was due to the overlapping of the Heart Sword Realm and the Hidden Sword Realm, allowing him to manifest the grand momentum of the heavens and earth as a sword or a knife, and combine it with the extraordinary formations of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting was dead.</p><p>The Second Elder of Crimson Darkness Sect had also died.</p><p>Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan of Refining Spirit were annihilated, and the situation in Yuzhou changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the Crimson Darkness Sect would not let this go easily, and Xu Yan's display of sword dao would certainly draw attention, triggering a series of confrontations.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Spiritual Realm, whether for the honor of the Spiritual Sects and Families or to maintain their unrivaled status, would inevitably come to challenge Xu Yan, for whatever reason.</p><p></p><p>"With this display, what thoughts will the powerful cultivators of the Spiritual Sects have? What reactions will they have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>This was a technique never seen before in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to enter the Spiritual Technique realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>All of this would depend on when Xu Yan could truly comprehend the Dao of Spiritual Techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Dao of Spiritual Techniques was not easy to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved the gathering of the spiritual soul and the birth of spiritual techniques.</p><p></p><p>How could one refine the spiritual soul to the point where spiritual techniques would naturally arise? And how should one cultivate the Dao of Spiritual Techniques?</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't take too long, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Xu Yan, who was immersed in cultivation and contemplation of his own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing his actions once more and comprehending the laws of heaven and earth, Xu Yan should have gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>The matters of Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan had been handed over to Yu Gao and the others to handle, as Xu Yan was now focused on cultivation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, a strange aura surged around him, as if the grand momentum of the heavens and earth was gathering, or as if formations were enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Ling Xiu, as well as Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu were all stimulated and immersed in cultivation as well.</p><p></p><p>Even the Crimson Cat was in the midst of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Only Xiao Ha and Yu Xiaolong were a bit bewildered, feeling that it was all very powerful and shocking, but they didn't know what to contemplate or how to participate in the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they felt quite frustrated, especially Yu Xiaolong, who was beginning to doubt his own talent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the battle of the geniuses, the Spiritual Sects and Families of Yuzhou fell into a hush.</p><p></p><p>They were even relieved that they hadn't taken action.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would have been doomed.</p><p></p><p>The person behind Xu Yan was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Darkness Sect was a peak Refining Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Even the weaker ones among them were still at the peak of Refining Spirit Celestial, and a single one could suppress the powerful existences of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Yet, under the joint forces of Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan of Refining Spirit, they were instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme cultivators of the Spiritual Sects were no match, it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Was this a existence on par with the supreme cultivators of the Spiritual Sects?!</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan's displayed sword dao was unheard of!</p><p></p><p>He truly had the qualifications to be considered a madman!</p><p></p><p>Such sword dao, never before seen, no sword cultivator had ever been able to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Could the sword dao masters of the Thousand Sword Hall do the same? Although they were stronger than the current Xu Yan, could they transform grass, wood, sand, and stone into swords?</p><p></p><p>Could they transform a mountain into a sword? No, they could not!</p><p></p><p>"Who is he? What kind of technique is that?"</p><p></p><p>Many powerful cultivators expressed such doubts and exclamations.</p><p></p><p>The grand momentum of the heavens and earth like a dragon, transforming into a terrifying killing field - how did he summon and control the grand momentum of the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>"Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan are now ours."</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao looked at the Refining Spirit cultivators present and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"But our Myriad Worlds Alliance is not yet the time to emerge. We must stay low-key for now, while Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan have not yet recovered."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family were occupied.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure vault must be found and emptied immediately, without revealing our involvement. </p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the Spiritual Sects from other states will inevitably intervene."</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao was extremely excited. The greatest gain from this battle was undoubtedly the Jade State's Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"That senior is truly formidable!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao sighed inwardly. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the sword dao that Xu Yan displayed also deeply shocked him.</p><p></p><p>He believed that this battle would mark the beginning of Xu Yan's fame in the Spiritual Realm, and Luo Xinting had become the first stepping stone for Xu Yan to reach the peak of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Chief Protector, rest assured, we have it all figured out."</p><p></p><p>The excited and thrilled Millennium Alliance Refiners said.</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's set off!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao waved his hand, leading a portion of the Refiners to the Jade Divine Sect, while the rest headed to the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Spiritual Sects and Families, they were terrified and dared not interfere at the moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Xu brother is so formidable, I, Shen Haizhou, was indeed wise to have discovered that he is a true dragon, a great thick-legged one!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sighed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>With the friendship with Xu Yan, the status of the Shen Family in the Jade State was stabilized, and they could even advance further.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family are going to be destroyed, those territories and people are too many to occupy openly, but it would be reasonable for the Shen Family to openly acquire the territories of the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family." I'll talk to Fang Hao about this, it's an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Zhu Liang, I, Shen Tai, have broken through, let's see how mighty you'll be from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a reckless laughter echoed.</p><p></p><p>A powerful spiritual pressure enveloped the area.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Family elders were all alarmed and emerged, immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai had broken through! The Shen Family now had strength comparable to the Jade Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm so happy today, I'll go challenge that bastard Zhu Liang!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Father, wait, wait!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang hurriedly called out to stop his arrogant and boastful father.</p><p></p><p>"What, you ungrateful son, do you think I can't defeat Zhu Liang?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai frowned, feeling the urge to punch his son.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that, Father, Zhu Liang is dead!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Zhu Liang is dead!"</p><p></p><p>The Shen Family elders hastily nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai was stunned, his arrogance dissipating, and he asked solemnly, "How did Zhu Liang die, and who killed him?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang took a deep breath, his expression grave, and his eyes still couldn't help but reveal a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know Xu Yan? It all started from the Genius Battle..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang told Shen Tai the whole story.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Then, he said seriously, "The news of my breakthrough should not be spread outside. Let's see how the situation develops first, and instruct the family members to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>"This Spiritual Realm has produced a prodigy, possibly even more terrifying than the Blood Demon back then.</p><p></p><p>"It's not to be provoked, not to be provoked at all. Oh, where's my obedient grandson? Have him come see me."</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Although he had broken through, he still needed to maintain a low profile.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Genius Battle was constantly spreading, and the name of the Sword Immortal Xu Yan was also becoming more and more widely known, and even somewhat exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Xu Yan, you know how powerful his sword dao is? With a mere gesture, plants and trees turn into sharp swords..."</p><p></p><p>"Your information is not correct, my friend's friend was at the scene and witnessed it personally. Xu Yan just raised his hand, and a towering mountain transformed into a terrifying giant sword and slashed down."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? Xu Yan just uttered the word 'Sword Rise', and a mile-high mountain turned into a giant sword, and with just a slight sword qi leakage, Luo Xinting was reduced to ashes..."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, my friend was there at the scene, Xu Yan didn't even open his mouth or move his hand, he just gave a glance, and the mountain obediently transformed into a sword, killing Luo Xinting..."</p><p></p><p>The news became more and more exaggerated and distorted, to the point that those who heard it would scoff, finding it simply ridiculous! Even the strongest experts of the Transcendent Spiritual Sects couldn't do such things, let alone a mere Wandering Cultivator genius.</p><p></p><p>"It's just another Wandering Cultivator boasting, exaggerating the prowess of a Wandering Cultivator genius. In my opinion, the killing of Luo Xinting is true, but it must have been a hard-fought battle. It only shows that Luo Xinting was a waste, and it has tarnished the reputation of our Spiritual Sect geniuses."</p><p></p><p>A genius sneered.</p><p></p><p>The claims of turning plants and trees into swords, or transforming mountains into swords, were simply absurd, the boasting had gone too far.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Darkness Sect's strength is just average, and Luo Xinting, their true disciple, couldn't have been that strong. Although he has the Divine Radiance Treasure Body, which is one of the Ten Treasured Bodies, it's just a Treasure Body, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Killing a few Refiner Celestials and Wandering Cultivators, and he thinks he's so strong? </p><p></p><p>"He was killed by this Xu Yan, a Wandering Cultivator, and it's only natural. It's just a shame for the Spiritual Sect geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if Xu Yan encounters me, if he can withstand three breaths without being defeated, he can be called the number one Wandering Cultivator genius!"</p><p></p><p>A renowned genius of the Spiritual Realm said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>The news about Xu Yan became more and more exaggerated, to the point of losing its truth, and fewer people believed it. This was clearly orchestrated by someone behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan's intervention, it had not been spread in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have been deliberately concealed.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the fact that the renowned genius Luo Xinting from Luo State, the true disciple of the Crimson Darkness Sect, was killed in the Genius Battle was true.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in a long time that a Spiritual Sect genius had been defeated, which made some of the more conservative and radical Spiritual Sect powerhouses feel outraged and even embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>In Luo State, the Crimson Darkness Sect, everyone was in disbelief. Luo Xinting was defeated? And he was killed? Normally, with the Second Elder, a Celestial Refiner, guarding him, even if he was defeated, he wouldn't have been killed.</p><p></p><p>But the news came, Luo Xinting was dead! The Second Elder was also dead! He was a peak Celestial Refiner, and although he had just broken through recently, he was still a peak Celestial Refiner.</p><p></p><p>"Who was it?" </p><p></p><p>The Sect Master Ying's expression was cold and ruthless, his killing intent surging.</p><p></p><p>The elders present were also furious, their killing intent palpable as they said, "Sect Master, we must avenge him, we must kill Xu Yan, or how can our Crimson Darkness Sect maintain its face?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we must kill Xu Yan at all costs!"</p><p></p><p>"And the people behind him!"</p><p></p><p>"Anyone with such strength to cultivate such a genius, must be the remnants of the Myriad Stars, not an ordinary Wandering Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The elders gritted their teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan must be killed, but he was able to kill a peak Celestial Refiner, his strength won't be weak. Even if the Sect Master personally fights him, can we be certain of victory?" This matter is not just about our Crimson Darkness Sect, but about the honor and dominance of the Spiritual Sects and Families in the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Elder's words are correct. Regardless of whether Xu Yan is backed by the remnants of the Myriad Stars, this is a challenge to our Spiritual Sects and Families. Recently, our Sect has intercepted some intelligence regarding the Wandering Cultivator forces.</p><p></p><p>"We should also contact the other allied Sects to discuss this matter."</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Ying said grimly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

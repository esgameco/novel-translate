        <h1>Chapter 407</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help himself and called Su Lingxiu over again. He gave her some guidance and also put a bit of pressure on her.</p><p></p><p>Next was Fang Hao. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spent more time giving detailed instructions on Fang Hao's Qimen martial arts, expanding on the Qimen techniques and encouraging Fang Hao to spend more time contemplating the broader path of Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he gave some guidance to Jiang Buping before letting him continue his secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Having done all this, Li Xuan was in a great mood. He then gave some pointers to Cai Ling'er on cultivating divine abilities, and also provided guidance to Yue Changming and Yue'er.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, he naturally gave instructions to Shi Er, Meng Shushu and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>By now, the three of them had reached the Divine Origin realm as martial artists. </p><p></p><p>However, this level of strength was still considered low-tier in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Xuan even used the abilities of his Beast Ancestor true form to give some guidance to Red Cat. It was time for this big cat he raised to put in some effort.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Red Cat, without waiting for Red Cat to say anything, Li Xuan directly retracted his Beast Ancestor form and left Red Cat's dream realm.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to comprehend the Cang Book!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan once again immersed his mind in the Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>Time passed as he contemplated the Cang Book. After giving guidance several times, rewards finally came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has understood the path to advance in Qimen martial arts. Your Qimen martial arts have been elevated to the Void-Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>At last, his Qimen martial arts had improved as well.</p><p></p><p>"All four martial arts have reached the Void-Breaking realm. My strength has increased greatly again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>With the four martial arts combined, he could easily crush an Immortal Venerable with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful Immortal Venerable like the Great Yue Emperor would be no match.</p><p></p><p>"Am I now invincible in the Divine Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Whether he was invincible in the Divine Realm remained to be seen, but it was certain that he had not yet reached the level of being invincible in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to keep working hard."</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao gained insight into advancing Qimen martial arts, Su Lingxiu also had a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the Small Heavenly Dao Eye. Your Small Heavenly Dao Eye has been upgraded."</p><p></p><p>Under his guidance, Su Lingxiu had finally comprehended the Small Heavenly Dao Eye.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this master's painstaking guidance, who knows when she would have comprehended the Small Heavenly Dao Eye. My eldest disciple is still the most impressive, comprehending it without my guidance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Among his five disciples, Xu Yan was still the most monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being his master's martial arts pioneer.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's Small Heavenly Dao Eye differed somewhat from Meng Chong and Xu Yan's, with some special abilities unique to alchemist martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Your three Small Heavenly Dao Eyes have combined. Your Small Heavenly Dao Eye has evolved into the Heavenly Dao Eye."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book continued.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed. This was an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>The combination of the Small Heavenly Dao Eyes from three martial arts had actually evolved into the Heavenly Dao Eye! In that instant, Li Xuan looked up at the sky and everything he saw was different.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Eye could see through everything.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it possessed even more mystical abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of heaven and earth, the principles of heaven and earth, that is..."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Li Xuan saw that above the laws of heaven and earth, there seemed to be another world.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew his gaze, his heart filled with shock. That was a place approaching the Dao principles, that was above the Divine Realm, the true core of heaven and earth, or perhaps the origin of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Are the experts above the Immortal realm all there?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Something had gone wrong with the Cang Heaven and Earth. It seemed to use the Dao principles as a great formation to separate heaven and earth, with the central region being the true core of heaven and earth, where the truly strongest experts gathered.</p><p></p><p>Just that one glance had allowed him to glimpse a corner of the secrets of heaven and earth's core. While marveling at the power of the Heavenly Dao Eye, Li Xuan also felt somewhat heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>He was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could the Heavenly Dao Eye only have this little bit of wonder?</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what exactly happened to this Cang Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>To understand the true secrets of the Cang Heaven and Earth, the small stone room in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace would be a good approach.</p><p></p><p>"I need to memorize the Cang Book as soon as possible and raise my realm quickly."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to look at the general outline of the Cang Book. At this moment, it appeared different.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heavenly Dao Eye, it was as if he could see through to the origin. It no longer seemed so abstruse and difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when Li Xuan looked at the Cang Book and then raised his head to look at the Dao principles, the operation of heaven and earth's principles seemed to correspond with the Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>"This principle is this one. I see now!"</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan looked, the more he understood about the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This principle can be used like this, it can transmit messages throughout heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became more and more excited as he looked. He felt the joy of constantly gaining insights and increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>"I now have ideas about the two realms above the Heavenly realm. Transcending heaven and earth doesn't seem too difficult after all."</p><p></p><p>As he understood more about the principles of heaven and earth, Li Xuan had a clearer direction for the path to transcend heaven and earth. He was also more certain about how to transcend heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan was matching the Dao principles of the Cang Book one by one with the principles of heaven and earth and memorizing them, Little Ha finally returned to the Great Yue Kingdom, back to the Qimen Academy, and found Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, are you saying that this Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is about to target me and Senior Sister? And even Master?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He immediately went to find Su Lingxiu to tell her about Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow's plot.</p><p></p><p>"This matter cannot be taken lightly. We can inform the Great Yue Emperor," Yue Changming said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go tell Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hurriedly went to find her master.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter," Li Xuan said calmly after hearing about it.</p><p></p><p>This Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow was quite bold. Not only did they attack Meng Chong and Xu Yan, but they also dared to try sneak attacks and ambushes here? They even had thoughts of ambushing him? Who gave them such courage?</p><p></p><p>"Master, will Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother be alright?" Su Lingxiu asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be a big problem," Li Xuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The life-saving jade talismans he gave his disciples hadn't been triggered, which meant that even though Meng Chong and Xu Yan had encountered attacks, they hadn't faced real danger.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, no cat or dog can escape your master's eyes," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Heavenly Dao Eye, no concealment or ill intentions could escape his notice.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm relieved," Su Lingxiu let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"You girl, you should work harder. Cultivate more divine abilities, it will be beneficial," Li Xuan said, taking on the appearance of a strict teacher.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!"</p><p></p><p>After Su Lingxiu left, Li Xuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow wants to create turmoil in the Divine Realm, unifying heaven and earth? And there are experts above the Immortal realm pushing things behind the scenes..."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heavenly Dao Eye, he could see more differences in this world and gained more understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Realm, Spirit Realm, Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to understand. The goal of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, the so-called unification of heaven and earth, was to break down the barriers so that there would no longer be divisions between the Inner Realm, Spirit Realm, and Divine Realm...</p><p></p><p>"Even with turmoil in the Divine Realm, unification is impossible. The division of this world into</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head. Could the turmoil in the divine realm really lead to the unification of heaven and earth? </p><p></p><p>That was thinking too much. Perhaps the turmoil in the divine realm was only the first step, with more actions to follow.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you stir things up. But since you've provoked me, be prepared to be destroyed. As a master, I don't act rashly. When I do act, I'll kill the true mastermind."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky again, estimating that his current strength still seemed insufficient.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of expert Tianshadiying will send to ambush and assassinate me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His disciple was right under his nose. If someone harmed him, where would he as the master put his face? As for poisoning pills and causing various disturbances, those were matters for the Emperor of Dayue, the leader of Tianwu Sect, and the master of Wanlei Sect to worry about.</p><p></p><p>They were the most anxious ones.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dayue's expression changed upon hearing Yue Changming's account.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what kind of force is Tianshadiying?" Yue Changming asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've heard of this force," the Emperor of Dayue said gravely.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Yue Changming, upon learning about Tianshadiying and its goals, the Emperor of Dayue realized this was a deeply hidden force. </p><p></p><p>It was likely not limited to just the Nine Mountains Realm and Qinghua Realm, but possibly spread throughout all 36 realms of the divine domain. Now that the time had come, it was starting to emerge.</p><p></p><p>"I will resolve this matter. Tell Brother Fang and Miss Su not to worry about some of the dirty tricks behind the scenes. We will naturally take care of those," the Emperor of Dayue said solemnly after taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Yue Changming bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>After Yue Changming's departure, the Emperor of Dayue immediately summoned Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>"Go personally to Tianwu Sect and Wanlei Sect to inform them of this matter. Don't alarm anyone for now. This is also an opportunity to root out infiltrators..."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dayue instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!" Sui Hongwu nodded gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan still hasn't returned to the Nine Mountains Realm. Could it be related to Tianshadiying?" the Emperor of Dayue pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Brother Feng Yan has always been rather carefree, but he's actually quite astute. He stayed behind because he saw an opportunity for himself. He doesn't have any subordinates in the Seven Peaks of the Nine Mountains Realm, just a lone wanderer," Sui Hongwu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dayye nodded. If there was an issue with Feng Yan, how could that senior keep him around? Moreover, under that senior's nose, even if Feng Yan was an Immortal Venerable, he couldn't do much.</p><p></p><p>In the Qimen Academy, Feng Yan had just returned and put down some rare materials and divine herbs he had collected when he was bewildered to see Fang Hao and the others surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? What happened?" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan felt a bit flustered being stared at.</p><p></p><p>Were they going to drive him away?</p><p></p><p>Impossible. He had always worked hard and diligently cultivated divine abilities. There was no reason to drive him away.</p><p></p><p>Neither Yue Changming, Meng Shushu, Shi Er, nor any of the others could replace his position. After all, his strength was far greater than theirs.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feng Yan, I feel you may be in some danger," Fang Hao said after pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Danger?" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was surprised. He was an Immortal Venerable after all, and had cultivated divine abilities. Even the Emperor of Dayue couldn't easily kill him.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't win, he could still escape.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was confident that if he had his current strength back then, he wouldn't have been beaten into crisis by Blood Zitu.</p><p></p><p>"Is the senior dissatisfied with me?"</p><p></p><p>The first thing he thought of was the master.</p><p></p><p>Unless the master was dissatisfied with him and could kill him with a slap, how could he be in danger?</p><p></p><p>He kept recalling everything he had done recently, but there wasn't anything that would displease the senior.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about Tianshadiying?" Fang Hao asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"No." </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan shook his head. "What is Tianshadiying?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao told Feng Yan about Tianshadiying's plans to target him and Su Lingxiu, and finally said: "You're the strongest, so they'll certainly try to eliminate or lure you away first. That's why you're in danger."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's expression became grave, but he wasn't afraid at all. He said, "Don't worry, nothing can lure me away. As for killing me, anyone below Immortal Venerable absolutely can't do it."</p><p></p><p>"And an Immortal Venerable definitely can't sneak past the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded, "Just be careful yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"With me, Feng Yan, here, no cats or dogs can sneak in!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's eyes widened, but he was excited inside. An opportunity to make merit had come. It was time for him to perform and show his true value.</p><p></p><p>The Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy continued as usual without any changes. Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu occasionally took time to guide the prodigies learning formations and alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Most of their time was invested in their own martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Meng Shushu, Zhou Ying and the others were the same.</p><p></p><p>Only Feng Yan began to scrutinize each person in the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy one by one to ensure there were no problems. He even personally guarded the entrance, checking everyone who entered, even familiar faces, before allowing them in.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe Tianshadiying's assassins can sneak past me, an Immortal Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, the three major forces had already joined hands and were secretly taking action, wanting to use this opportunity to eliminate the hidden Tianshadiying members.</p><p></p><p>Both formations and pills involved their core interests and concerned the rise of martial arts in the entire Qinghua Realm. Tianshadiying's actions had already crossed their red line.</p><p></p><p>While undercurrents surged in the outside world, the imperial capital of the Dayue Kingdom, especially the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy, remained calm and undisturbed. Apart from Feng Yan guarding the entrance and strictly checking all who entered and exited, there were no ripples.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained composed as ever, continuing to study the Taikang Book's main principles and racking his brains for his great martial arts cause.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body. You have reached minor completion of the second level of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through, entering the Divine Phase Realm and successfully cultivating the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has undergone extreme transformation, evolving into a Vajra Holy Body. You have obtained the Innate Indestructible Mountain River Vajra Holy Body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt his whole being become refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the greatest joy in the world is improving one's strength!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through to the Divine Phase Realm. Su Lingxiu was also in the stage of accumulating foundation, and it wouldn't be long before she broke through as well.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for Fang Hao. His Qimen martial arts were not far from the Divine Phase Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that the Heaven and Earth Realm is not far off."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. Entering the Heaven and Earth Realm would be a huge leap forward.</p><p></p><p>Truly stepping onto the path of transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Meng Chong has broken through, they should be preparing to retaliate against Tianshadiying, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerables of Tianshadiying would likely take action personally now, and it seemed he might have a chance to make a move as well?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly raised an eyebrow, looking towards the horizon with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

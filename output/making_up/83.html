        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 83: Xu Yan vs. Xie Lingfeng (Seeking Orders)</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan activated eighteen mighty dragons, soaring and diving from all directions to attack Xie Lingfeng, fully unleashing the furious might of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was grave, his aura becoming increasingly fierce. The sword in his hand radiated a brilliant light, and at a certain moment, he thrust out with his sword, the sword qi surging forth like a great river.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sword qi swept away the mighty dragons, the thunderous roar echoing. The dragons were shattered, and although the sword qi had also dissipated greatly, it remained formidable.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was icy, a sword qi enveloping his body. The precious sword in his hand shone with radiance, the sword qi surging forth like a myriad of rivers rushing forth.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, watching the battle from afar, was greatly shaken: "This young man, what palm technique is he using? The young master has actually unleashed the Myriad River Sword Art!"</p><p></p><p>The Myriad River Sword Art, where a single sword strike is like a myriad of rivers, is one of the supreme sword techniques of the Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>It was with this sword art that Xie Lingfeng had slain master-level martial artists. In the Inner Realm, his reputation was renowned.</p><p></p><p>"This is a sword art!" Xu Yan's heart trembled, for he could feel the immense pressure from Xie Lingfeng's sword art.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi surged forth, layer upon layer, vast and grand, like flowing rivers.</p><p></p><p>Unavoidable, unbreachable. The sword qi could be fierce and unmatched, or soft and fluid, penetrating everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm struck out, but it felt as if it had sunk into a river, becoming heavy and strained.</p><p></p><p>Dragons should rule over water, but now they were trapped within the river, revealing the extraordinary nature of this sword art.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan also knew that his Qi Blood Realm-activated Descending Dragon Palm had not been able to fully display its power, which was why it was being constrained by the river-like sword qi.</p><p></p><p>He was not discouraged, but rather excited.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was clear and lucid, and Xie Lingfeng's sword art emerged in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This is its weakness!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A mighty dragon broke through a sword qi, charging towards Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"This is its ferocity, I must avoid it!"</p><p></p><p>A mighty dragon suddenly dove upwards, evading a sword qi, and then plunged downwards, extinguishing another sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was grave, the Myriad River Sword Art continuously unfolding, the sword qi transforming into a myriad of rivers, completely enclosing Xu Yan from all directions, the sword qi becoming increasingly dense and fierce.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, not far away, silently observed the battle between Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng. At this moment, his Sword Heart had reached a state of clarity and mastery, allowing him to thoroughly comprehend the Myriad River Sword Art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his mind, he had recreated an even stronger version of the Myriad River Sword Art based on the original.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of Sword Heart Clarity. The enemy's sword art became my sword art, the enemy's sword techniques became my sword techniques, and by taking the best and discarding the rest, the sword art was elevated to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation realm was higher, which allowed him to thoroughly comprehend the Myriad River Sword Art in such a short time and improve upon it.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, his realm was still relatively low, and he had just entered the Sword Heart Clarity realm. Although he could perceive the weaknesses and ferocity of the sword art, he could not yet fully grasp it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was his first time using Sword Heart Clarity, so a certain degree of unfamiliarity was normal. He would become more proficient with time.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, the sword qi transforming into a multitude of rivers, criss-crossing the battlefield, while the eighteen mighty dragons constantly surged and tumbled within the intersecting sword qi, but the space for their attacks was gradually diminishing.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, the outcome was already decided.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan knew that this was merely Xu Yan learning the Myriad River Sword Art.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet drawn his own sword!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also inwardly amazed by Xu Yan's strength. In the Borderlands, there was actually such a young martial artist, truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what was this "Martial Dao Initiation" and "Qi Blood Realm" he had mentioned?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had many doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"He is just at the Martial Dao Initiation stage? No, that's absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Initiation, how could he possess such formidable strength?</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, watching the battle from afar, as the Myriad River Sword Art unfolded, the battlefield was filled with the surging, grand sword qi, like flowing rivers, while the mighty dragons' attack range was becoming increasingly limited.</p><p></p><p>It would not be long before they were crushed by the Myriad River sword qi.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to fight against the young master to this extent, he is truly a heaven-gifted talent!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Qi Blood surged, and at this moment, he pushed out with a palm, the eighteen mighty dragons suddenly merging into a single, even larger and more substantial dragon.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mighty dragon struck out, its might and ferocity shocking, directly breaking through the criss-crossing sword qi and creating an opening.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward, striking with both palms. In the midst of his surging Qi Blood, each palm strike unleashed a mighty dragon, without any fancy techniques, only direct and forceful attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm, imbued with the utmost yang and firmness, was being wielded to its peak. As Xu Yan activated the Descending Dragon Palm to the pinnacle of the Qi Blood Realm, a surge of Qi Blood rose above his head.</p><p></p><p>The palm strikes, filled with the most yang and firm power, directly collided with the Myriad River sword qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Descending Dragon Palm, in addition to its flexibility, its core lies in its unparalleled firmness and yang energy. Only with the utmost yang and firmness can it possess the might of the Descending Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart tightened, inwardly shocked by the ferocious and overbearing palm technique.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan used his yang and firm Descending Dragon Palm to forcefully clash with the Myriad River sword qi, the space that had been compressed earlier began to expand once more.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad River sword qi was being destroyed one by one.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a deep breath, his gaze becoming graver. As he moved, the Myriad River Sword Art was continuously unleashed, the Myriad River sword qi constantly growing stronger, layer upon layer, until finally, the sound of flowing water could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Like a rushing myriad of rivers, they flowed across the battlefield, turning it into a domain of water.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze sharpened, and as he circulated his Qi Blood, he struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>With this palm strike, a roaring sound, like the cry of a dragon, accompanied the palm force.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of rushing rivers filled the battlefield, growing louder and louder, until it was like a thunderous waterfall crashing down, a deafening roar echoing.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, watching the battle, had a grave expression, a flash of shock in his eyes, as the young master had been forced to unleash the Myriad River Sword Art to its fullest.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Inner Realm, only the most renowned and powerful master-level experts could force the young master to display the Myriad River Sword Art to such an extent.</p><p></p><p>Could this young man's strength truly rival those renowned master-level experts?</p><p></p><p>Amidst the thunderous roar of the waterfall, the dragon-like roar could still be heard, echoing ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the eighteen mighty dragons swept out once more.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad River sword qi layer by layer collapsed, while the mighty dragons were also continuously shattering.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Descending Dragon Palm had reached its second stage of mastery!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in admiration. With each intense battle, Xu Yan would gain new insights and breakthroughs. He truly was the pioneer of his Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has mastered the second stage of the Descending Dragon Palm. Your Descending Dragon Palm has reached the second stage of perfection."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Guidance had provided this feedback.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to observe the ongoing battle. The outcome had not yet been decided.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's strength was undoubtedly far superior to Blood Xin's. His sword art was also incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>He was a true martial arts prodigy, and his sword dao talent was exceptional.</p><p></p><p>But he still lacked Sword Heart Clarity, had not yet entered the realm of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Lingfeng's gaze sharpened, and a sword light shot forth from his hand.</p><p></p><p>The sword flew like a rainbow, swift as lightning!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the sword beam had already...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sword light approached Xu Yan's throat.</p><p></p><p>"The Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique! The young master has actually been forced to use the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Cliff, one of the three supreme sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze focused, his figure suddenly drifted away, light as a feather, yet incredibly swift.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>He was fast, but Xie Lingfeng's sword was even faster, another beam of Soaring Rainbow sword light stabbed towards him.</p><p></p><p>Shifting position!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instantly changed positions, yet his sleeve was still slashed open.</p><p></p><p>Weng!</p><p></p><p>The third sword light came swiftly.</p><p></p><p>With his sword heart clear, Xu Yan discovered the weakness in this sword, but the fleeting opportunity was not enough for him to seize.</p><p></p><p>"This sword technique must be of a high level!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He shifted position again to avoid this sword.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his hand pointed to the sword at his waist.</p><p></p><p>Weng!</p><p></p><p>The sword was unsheathed!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng paused his hand, not continuing the attack, but said, "You are also a sword cultivator? Then let me experience your sword dao as well!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't disappoint you!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>He was going to use the Myriad River Sword Technique to engage the other.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng struck, the sword light flashing, in an instant the sword qi approached Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A sword qi rippled out, like a great river, a thunderous sound arose, the sword light seemed to have entered the surging river and vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword technique seemed familiar!</p><p></p><p>An absurd idea flashed in his mind, but he suppressed it immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately unleashed the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique, the sword light swift as a rainbow soaring through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck with one sword, the Myriad Rivers surging, the sword qi crisscrossing, colliding repeatedly with the Soaring Rainbow sword light!</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan watching from afar had his eyes wide open, a look of horror on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad River Sword Technique? How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme sword technique of the Sword Saint Cliff, how could he know it?</p><p></p><p>"No, something's not right, it seems a bit different from the Myriad River Sword Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's scalp tingled the more he watched.</p><p></p><p>This Myriad River Sword Technique looked exactly the same as the one from the Sword Saint Cliff, yet some of the sword moves were different, even more terrifying was that the Myriad River sword qi was more continuous, more majestic like surging rivers, more soft and flowing.</p><p></p><p>As if it was an advanced version of the Myriad River Sword Technique?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was no longer just surprised, but his heart was trembling.</p><p></p><p>This was the Myriad River Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>No one knew the Myriad River Sword Technique better than him, even though Xu Yan's sword technique had some differences in the sword moves, it was precisely because of this that he trembled.</p><p></p><p>Those sword moves, he vaguely felt, were the shortcomings of the Myriad River Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Unable to fully manifest the surging river momentum.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xu Yan had actually displayed it, stronger than him, the surging river sword momentum, naturally perfect, without any flaws or weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>His Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique was trapped within it, feeling somewhat unable to unfold.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad River Sword Technique! How do you know the Myriad River Sword Technique of my Sword Saint Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his brow and said, "Didn't you just teach me?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded, then utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"You... you learned it while we were just fighting?"</p><p></p><p>How was that possible!</p><p></p><p>He, Xie Lingfeng, known as the number one sword dao prodigy descended from the Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years, couldn't even do that!</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with that?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked with a puzzled look. "Once I've entered the sword dao, the sword techniques are transparent to me, I can freely take them as my own.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you haven't entered the sword dao yet?"</p><p></p><p>Entering the sword dao, one can freely take others' sword techniques as their own?</p><p></p><p>Which cultivator of the Sword Saint Cliff has not entered the sword dao? Who can freely take sword techniques as their own?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mind was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure that after entering the sword dao, one can freely take sword techniques as their own?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at him in disbelief, feeling that the other was insulting his intelligence!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention entering the sword dao, even sword dao grandmasters couldn't do that!</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said affirmatively, then looked at Xie Lingfeng puzzledly, "Don't tell me you haven't entered the sword dao yet?"</p><p></p><p>This person's sword technique was strong and fierce, it would not be easy to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng raged, "I, Xie Lingfeng, entered the sword dao at the age of six!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and struck with a sword, the sword light like a soaring rainbow, swift as lightning, in an instant it approached Xie Lingfeng's chest.</p><p></p><p>He was startled and hurriedly evaded.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>His robe was slashed open.</p><p></p><p>But he no longer cared about that, his face filled with horror.</p><p></p><p>The Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>This was a move he had used before!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck again with the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng raised his sword to block, his mind in chaos, the supreme sword technique of the Sword Saint Cliff, the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique, he could learn it just by seeing it once?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>"How did you cultivate the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique?!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck again with the Soaring Rainbow Sword Technique, saying, "Didn't I just say, for one who has entered the sword dao, the sword techniques are already transparent, they can freely take them as their own."</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head regretfully, "I thought I could find someone to exchange sword dao with, but it seems you haven't entered the sword dao yet."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was furious, he was the sword dao prodigy descended from the Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years, he entered the sword dao at six years old, yet this person dared to humiliate him like this!</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his brow and said, "Then let me demonstrate a few sword techniques, see if you can take them as your own."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he struck with a sword, a sword light appeared on the spot, overbearing and unmatched, spanning the sky.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart shuddered, hurriedly raising his sword to block, and Xu Yan struck again, consecutively demonstrating several moves, all swift and fierce, overbearing and unmatched.</p><p></p><p>"This sword technique is no less than the Myriad River Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Have you learned it?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gritted his teeth and angrily said, "You are mocking me, who can learn the enemy's sword techniques and moves in the midst of battle?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented, it's impossible to do that.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have entered the sword dao can do it, so sword cultivators fight not the sword techniques, but the sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's face flushed with anger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sheathed his sword and stepped back, a look of disappointment on his face, "I see, you actually haven't entered the sword dao, you just thought you had, this is not your fault!</p><p></p><p>"It's your limited vision that has constrained your understanding!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's face turned the color of pig liver, about to explode with anger, he was being mocked again and again!</p><p></p><p>This was going too far!</p><p></p><p>"I, Xie Lingfeng, will defeat you today..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Xu Yan asked, "I'm afraid you don't even know what it means to have a clear sword heart, do you?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded, what did he just say about a clear sword heart?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

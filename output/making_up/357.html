        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Realm and gained the Divine Surge Technique, which gives you the Divine Surge Technique as well."</p><p></p><p>Divine Surge Technique!</p><p></p><p>"The unique aspect of the Martial Dao Divine Technique is its unparalleled defense and solidity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Surge Technique involves a surging, tumultuous energy that can nullify any attack. It can even defend against attacks targeting the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Surge Technique can also be used offensively, sweeping away enemies like a raging tide.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's Divine Technique is quite good. The Martial Dao is inherently powerful, and with this defensive technique, it would be extremely difficult to break through unless the opponent has an exceptionally powerful Divine Technique."</p><p></p><p>With the 18-Zhang Golden Body and the Divine Surge Technique, Meng Chong would be able to easily suppress armies.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Realm and gained the Severed Limb Regeneration Technique, which you have also obtained."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's second Divine Technique, while not as powerful as Rebirth, allows for the regeneration of severed limbs, which is also extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>This means that even if he suffers grievous injuries, he can recover in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Severed Limb Regeneration consumes Martial Dao Essence and one's own lifeblood, but for a Martial Dao cultivator, abundant Essence and lifeblood are not a concern."</p><p></p><p>As long as the Martial Dao Essence is not instantly depleted, it can be recovered through cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao cultivators have exceptional recovery abilities, so the consumption from Severed Limb Regeneration is negligible.</p><p></p><p>"My Martial Dao will never be in a situation where the Essence is depleted and cannot be recovered. This Divine Technique is also quite good, showcasing the uniqueness of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, satisfied with Meng Chong's second Divine Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Severed Limb Regeneration will likely become an essential Divine Technique for Martial Dao cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>After gaining his second Divine Technique, Meng Chong continued his breakthrough, and his aura was changing. A sun-like halo seemed to appear above his head.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Realm and gained the Great Sun Annihilation Technique, which you have also obtained."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's third Divine Technique, the Great Sun Annihilation Technique, is an offensive technique that is both fierce and domineering in power.</p><p></p><p>"This is a powerful offensive Divine Technique, with scorching and overbearing might," Li Xuan noted approvingly.</p><p></p><p>When the Great Sun Annihilation Technique is activated, a sun-like orb appears above Meng Chong's head, and it descends with devastating force, capable of annihilating everything in its path. It can also be infused into his blade techniques, showcasing its domineering and scorching nature.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Realm and gained the Peerless Wind and Thunder Slash Technique, which you have also obtained."</p><p></p><p>The fourth Divine Technique is another offensive one. With wind and thunder in his grasp, a single slash becomes unparalleled in its might.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Realm and gained the Great Sun Transversal Technique, which you have also obtained."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Transversal Technique is a movement-based Divine Technique. With a thought, Meng Chong can traverse the sky like the sun, showcasing his boldness and ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"This movement technique suits the characteristics of the Martial Dao very well," Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Yan's Thought Vanishing allows for stealthy and untraceable movement, Meng Chong's style is like the sun, descending with domineering force.</p><p></p><p>"If Meng Chong doesn't want to be so overt, he can also cultivate more low-key and swift movement techniques," Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>He had also compiled some movement and speed-based Divine Techniques in the Divine Technique Compendium.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Divine Realm, Meng Chong had gained five Divine Techniques, and it was likely that Su Ling Xiu would also gain five upon her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As for Xie Lingfeng's breakthrough, he may not necessarily gain as many Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>After his breakthrough, Meng Chong settled for a moment, then eagerly began to display his Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The 18-Zhang Golden Body stood tall, and the Divine Surge Technique surged, like a divine being descending from the heavens. Zi Yun watched with captivated eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, let's spar!" Xu Yan said, rubbing his hands together.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The clash of Divine Techniques erupted in the clouds above. Xu Yan's aura was that of the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, while Meng Chong unleashed the Divine Surge Technique. </p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong wielded the wind and thunder, his devastating blade techniques like the end of the world. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's single sword strike, containing the mountains and rivers, easily nullified the raging wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>In turn, the wind and thunder surged forth from the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, counterattacking Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A sun-like orb appeared above Meng Chong's head, and with a punch, the might of the Great Sun Annihilation Technique was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The sparring continued.</p><p></p><p>On the Long Qing Pavilion, Su Ling Xiu and the others were left awestruck.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly feel like the powerful experts in the Spirit Realm are just like children playing house compared to this," Cai Lingyi murmured.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Divine Techniques was truly incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, who is stronger, the eldest or second brother?" Su Ling Xiu asked excitedly, grabbing Li Xuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Your eldest brother," Li Xuan replied, having already determined the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was indeed superior. While Meng Chong's Divine Surge Technique was formidable in defense, Xu Yan's Divine Techniques, especially the Peerless Sword Slash that could sever the heavens and earth, could also break through the Divine Surge.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan's Mountains and Rivers Sword Technique could envelop Meng Chong, bringing the entire battle under Xu Yan's control.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, Xu Yan would emerge victorious. However, it would not be an easy victory for him. Xu Yan's comprehension of the Dao was deeper, and his Martial Dao was more refined, incorporating the essence of various schools like the Martial Dao, Alchemy Dao, and Mysterious Gate Dao.</p><p></p><p>Among the four disciples, Xu Yan had the greatest potential to forge his own unique Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>After their sparring session, both Meng Chong and Xu Yan gained new insights into their Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Meng Chong said excitedly after returning to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned, relieved that he had not disappointed his master.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're so amazing, so powerful!" Zi Yun exclaimed, jumping onto Meng Chong and caressing him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong quickly pulled her off, "Stop it!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Zi Yun giggled.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu suddenly felt some pressure. If her fourth brother also broke through, wouldn't she, the senior disciple, be the weakest? "I must enter seclusion and break through to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suli diligently continued her cultivation. She was just a step away from accumulating the necessary foundation, and she would soon be able to break through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong broke through to the Divine Realm, the subsequent cultivation of his Eternal Unextinguished Body should also be perfected.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship continued drifting, heading towards Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Soon after entering Yuzhou, Suli encountered a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli, by cultivating the martial arts you created, has broken through to the Divine Realm, and your divine soul has been amplified a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! With the feedback from the Great Dao Scripture, Li Xuan's divine soul was instantly amplified a hundredfold. On the Spiritual Platform, his divine soul body was now indistinguishable from his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Even if he were to leave his physical body, one could not tell the difference between his divine soul and physical body.</p><p></p><p>"A hundredfold amplification of divine abilities, physical body, and divine soul - a comprehensive hundredfold enhancement, how exhilarating!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan appeared calm and composed on the surface, but his heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to find an Immortal Venerable to compete with, to test the strength of the Immortal Venerables."</p><p></p><p>Although he had never seen an Immortal Venerable before and was not entirely sure of their specific abilities, Li Xuan was confident that with his current strength, he could easily defeat an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli, upon breaking through to the Divine Realm, has undergone the ultimate refinement and transformed into the Evergreen Saint Bone. You have obtained the Primordial Indestructible Saint Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he had predicted, his disciple's every breakthrough and transformation followed a certain pattern, progressing in a specific direction.</p><p></p><p>The next level of breakthrough would be the transformation into a Saint Body.</p><p></p><p>And he himself would also obtain the Primordial Indestructible Saint Body!</p><p></p><p>"Continuing to cultivate, continuing to transform, what kind of constitution will I eventually attain?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could hardly imagine, as it seemed to be an endless process.</p><p></p><p>"Suli, this girl, is a Pill Dao Martial Artist, not known for her killing prowess, but she is not without such abilities. What kind of divine abilities will she manifest?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently observed Suli's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has broken through to the Divine Realm and manifested the divine ability Life and Death Reversal. You have obtained the divine ability Life and Death Reversal!"</p><p></p><p>Life and Death Reversal! "This divine ability is not bad."</p><p></p><p>The divine ability Life and Death Reversal could reverse life and death, transfer injuries, and either take away or restore life. It could heal and save people, but also kill them invisibly.</p><p></p><p>It could transfer and reverse the damage targeted at oneself, possessing profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has broken through to the Divine Realm and manifested the divine ability Celestial Spiritual Flame. You have obtained the divine ability Celestial Spiritual Flame."</p><p></p><p>Suli's second divine ability, Celestial Spiritual Flame, was born from her Spiritual Platform. It could merge with the heavens and earth, blend into the spiritual energy without revealing its presence, and could be used for refining pills as well as killing enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Although it is not as powerful as my Evergreen Divine Fire, this Celestial Spiritual Flame is also quite remarkable, and with the improvement of her strength, it can also be further transformed."</p><p></p><p>The divine ability Celestial Spiritual Flame was a necessary divine ability for Pill Dao Martial Artists. Other Pill Dao Martial Artists who cultivated to the Divine Realm would also manifest such a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even among the divine abilities of the Celestial Spiritual Flame or similar flame-type divine abilities, there were differences in their strength and level.</p><p></p><p>Suli was undoubtedly the one with the highest level of Celestial Spiritual Flame among Pill Dao Martial Artists, aside from Li Xuan himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has broken through to the Divine Realm and manifested the divine ability Hundred Refinements of the Divine Furnace. You have obtained the divine ability Hundred Refinements of the Divine Furnace!"</p><p></p><p>Suli's third divine ability, Hundred Refinements of the Divine Furnace, was a unique divine ability that could refine higher-quality pills, as well as refine all things in heaven and earth, even transforming life and death, with boundless applications.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient strength and continuous improvement, it could even refine the Indestructible Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!" Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>The three divine abilities Suli had manifested did not focus on killing, but that did not mean they lacked the power to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has broken through to the Divine Realm and manifested the divine ability Celestial Stellar Spear. You have obtained the divine ability Celestial Stellar Spear."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was slightly surprised that she had manifested a divine ability with offensive characteristics.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Stellar Spear was a divine ability with strong concealment. It could hide in the heavens and earth, and with a single thought, the stellar spears would strike like needles, killing the enemy invisibly.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Celestial Stellar Spear for healing would also be possible, and it can be used to simultaneously treat a large group of people."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>"There is one more divine ability left."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already guessed that the final divine ability would likely be related to movement or evasion, as Suli had also comprehended the Bagua and mastered a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The manifestation of divine abilities was related to the martial arts one had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has broken through to the Divine Realm and manifested the divine ability Thousand Illusions Vanishing. You have obtained the divine ability Thousand Illusions Vanishing."</p><p></p><p>As expected, Suli's fifth divine ability was a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusions Vanishing allowed her to create countless illusions in an instant, making it impossible for the enemy to capture her true form, and she would disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>With the manifestation of this fifth divine ability, Suli had completely broken through to the Divine Realm. Three out of his four disciples had now reached the Divine Realm, with only Fang Hao, the Esoteric Martial Dao cultivator, slightly lagging behind, but he was also not far from further advancement.</p><p></p><p>After her breakthrough, Suli returned to the flying ship, excited and eager for her master's evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're being evasive!" Suli frowned.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's really not bad!" Li Xuan said with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what divine abilities did you manifest?" Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"None of them are for killing!" Suli sighed.</p><p></p><p>Fluctuations of energy emanated from her, and a faint black and white light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression became solemn, as in that instant, a surge of divine power arose within him, and divine abilities were suddenly born, indicating that the black and white light posed a significant threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"Seizing life force?" Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Not just that, it can also grant life force, transfer injuries, and even reverse life and death..." Suli said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Suli raised her delicate jade-like hand, and a faint blue flame burned in her palm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the flame merged into the heavens and earth, becoming almost untraceable.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Spiritual Flame, it will make refining pills much more convenient, allowing me to create more pure and higher-quality pills..."</p><p></p><p>Suli then demonstrated the Hundred Refinements of the Divine Furnace divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you actually have such a concealed offensive divine ability?" Xu Yan asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you've already discovered it?" Suli said, feeling frustrated.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, countless stellar spears appeared in the air, densely surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>Dyu Yuying and the others felt their scalps tingle. The sudden appearance of the stellar spears, how they formed, and when they surrounded them - they were completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>Even the Crimson Cat was a bit ruffled! It only noticed the attack at the moment the stellar spears appeared. If they had truly targeted it, by then, it might have already been pierced like a hedgehog.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

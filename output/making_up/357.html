        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Realm of Divine Powers and gained the divine power of Boundless Divine Waves. You have obtained the divine power of Boundless Divine Waves!"</p><p></p><p>Boundless Divine Waves!</p><p></p><p>"The unique aspect of physical martial arts divine powers is their unparalleled defense and unmatched solidity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Boundless Divine Waves manifests as surging, violent waves around the body that can dissolve any attack into nothingness, including attacks targeting the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Boundless Divine Waves can also transform into a fierce attack, like overwhelming waves sweeping forward with unstoppable momentum to crush enemies.</p><p></p><p>"This divine power of Meng Chong's is not bad. Physical martial artists already have strong bodies, and with this divine power for defense, it would be very difficult for enemies to break through unless they possess extremely powerful divine abilities. Even with double the strength, it would be hard to penetrate this defense."</p><p></p><p>Once the Eighteen Zhang Golden Body is activated, transforming into a small giant, and then Boundless Divine Waves is used on top of that, the imposing presence could easily sweep away thousands of troops.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Realm of Divine Powers and gained the divine power of Limb Regeneration. You have obtained the divine power of Limb Regeneration!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's second divine power, though not as powerful as Instant Rebirth or Blood Rebirth, is still extremely formidable in its ability to regenerate severed limbs.</p><p></p><p>This means that even if severely injured, he can recover in a very short time.</p><p></p><p>"Limb Regeneration consumes martial essence and one's own blood essence, but for physical martial artists, blood essence and abundant martial essence are what they have the most of."</p><p></p><p>As long as the martial essence is not instantly depleted, even if consumed, it can be replenished through cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Physical martial artists already have strong recovery abilities, so a single use of Limb Regeneration wouldn't consume much martial essence.</p><p></p><p>"In my martial way, there won't be a situation where consumed essence can't be recovered. This divine power is not bad, really showcasing the uniqueness of physical martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, fairly satisfied with Meng Chong's second divine power.</p><p></p><p>"Limb Regeneration will likely become a divine power that all physical martial artists inevitably develop."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After gaining his second divine power, Meng Chong continued his breakthrough, his aura changing. Above his head, the outline of a great sun seemed to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Realm of Divine Powers and gained the divine power of Great Sun Annihilation. You have obtained the divine power of Great Sun Annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's third divine power, Great Sun Annihilation!</p><p></p><p>"This is an offensive divine power, fierce and domineering, with considerable might!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When Great Sun Annihilation is used, it's as if a great sun hangs above one's head. When activated, it's like the sun crashing down, with terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it can be infused into blade intent, fully displaying its domineering and fierce nature, as if able to annihilate everything.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Realm of Divine Powers and gained the divine power of Peerless Wind and Thunder Slash. You have obtained the divine power of Peerless Wind and Thunder Slash!"</p><p></p><p>The fourth divine power is also an offensive one.</p><p></p><p>With wind and thunder in hand, one slash is peerless, unrivaled in its dominance!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Realm of Divine Powers and gained the divine power of Great Sun Crossing the Sky. You have obtained the divine power of Great Sun Crossing the Sky!"</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Crossing the Sky is a movement-type divine power. With a thought, one moves like the great sun traversing the sky, fully displaying one's unrestrained and powerful nature.</p><p></p><p>"This movement technique really fits the characteristics of physical martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Instant Vanishing allows for instant retreat, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>But Meng Chong's style is like the great sun, instantly arriving, displaying dominance and boldness.</p><p></p><p>"If Meng Chong doesn't want to be so showy, he could also cultivate more low-key and swift movement divine powers."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Power Martial Classic, he had also included some movement and speed-type divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's breakthrough to the Realm of Divine Powers resulted in five divine powers, and unsurprisingly, when Su Lingxiu breaks through, she will likely also gain five divine powers.</p><p></p><p>As for Xie Lingfeng breaking through to the Realm of Divine Powers, he may not necessarily gain this many divine powers.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through, Meng Chong settled for a bit before excitedly demonstrating his divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Eighteen Zhang Golden Body stood tall between heaven and earth, with Boundless Divine Waves surging, like a god descending to the world! Zi Yun watched with fascinated eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Second junior brother, let's spar!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rubbed his hands eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A clash of divine powers erupted in the clouds above.</p><p></p><p>Around Xu Yan was the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword, while Meng Chong used Boundless Divine Waves, the two colliding.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong wielded wind and thunder, slashing down with his blade. The violent wind and thunder blade light was like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust out his sword, and mountains and rivers appeared within the sword. The violent wind and thunder blade light instantly disappeared into the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Then, a wind and thunder slash emerged from the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword, counterattacking towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Above Meng Chong's head, a great sun appeared. He threw out a punch, and the might of Great Sun Annihilation came with it.</p><p></p><p>The sparring continued.</p><p></p><p>On the Changqing Pavilion, Su Lingxiu and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The power of these divine abilities was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly feel like the battles of those strong experts in the Spirit Realm are like children playing house," Cai Linger murmured.</p><p></p><p>It's a completely different level of power.</p><p></p><p>The might of divine powers is truly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, who's stronger between Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother?" Su Lingxiu excitedly grabbed her master's arm and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Your Big Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could tell the result with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was undoubtedly superior.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong's Boundless Divine Waves had strong defense, Xu Yan's divine powers were also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Heaven-Severing Sword, this sword divine power could sever heaven and earth, and could also break through Boundless Divine Waves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this sword alone might not necessarily be able to injure Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Another of Xu Yan's strengths was the Mountains and Rivers Within Sword divine power. Once the mountains and rivers envelop Meng Chong, all divine powers and battles would take place within Xu Yan's sword realm.</p><p></p><p>The final victor would naturally be Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be easy for Xu Yan to defeat Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that Xu Yan has a slight edge, and Xu Yan's comprehension of the martial way is more profound, his path of martial arts more refined.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan seems to cultivate orthodox martial arts, but he has also taken the essence of physical martial arts, medicinal martial arts, and esoteric martial arts to refine his own martial way.</p><p></p><p>Among the four disciples, the one most likely to forge their own unique martial way is undoubtedly Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His martial way is extremely refined. Even when incorporating the essence of other martial ways into his own, he still remains on an extremely pure path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong sparred for a while, each demonstrating their divine powers. After the exchange, they both gained new insights into their divine powers.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing the sparring and returning to the flying ship, Meng Chong excitedly called out.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned, feeling relieved that he hadn't disappointed his master too much!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong! You're so amazing, you're so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun excitedly bounced over, throwing herself onto Meng Chong and running her hands over his body.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong plucked her off, "Don't mess around!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun giggled.</p><p></p><p>With Second Senior Brother also breaking through, Su Lingxiu suddenly felt some pressure. If Fourth Junior Brother also broke through, wouldn't she, as the senior sister, be too weak?</p><p></p><p>"I want to go into seclusion, I want to break through to divine powers!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu buried herself in diligent cultivation. She was just a tiny bit away from fully accumulating her foundation, and would soon be able to break through to the Divine Power realm.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong broke through to Divine Power, the subsequent cultivation of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun Star should also be perfected.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship continued to drift, heading towards Yu Province.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after entering Yu Province, Su Lingxiu encountered her breakthrough opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu, cultivating the martial arts method you created, has broken through to the Divine Power realm. Your primordial spirit is amplified a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! As the Golden Book of the Great Dao provided feedback, Li Xuan's primordial spirit was instantly amplified a hundredfold. Above his spirit platform, his primordial spirit body was now indistinguishable from his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Even if separated from his physical body, one could not tell the difference between his primordial spirit and physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Divine power amplified a hundredfold, physical body amplified a hundredfold, primordial spirit amplified a hundredfold - this all-around hundredfold increase feels amazing!"</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Li Xuan remained calm and unperturbed, but inside he was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to find an Immortal Heavenly Venerable to compete with, to gauge the strength of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Although he had never seen an Immortal Heavenly Venerable and wasn't very familiar with their specific strength, Li Xuan was confident that with his current power, defeating an Immortal Heavenly Venerable should be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu, during her breakthrough to Divine Power, underwent an extreme transformation, evolving into Evergreen Sacred Bones. You obtain Innate Indestructible Sacred Bones!"</p><p></p><p>As predicted earlier, each breakthrough and transformation of his disciples was regular, following a certain direction of progress.</p><p></p><p>At the next realm breakthrough, it would be a transformation into a Sacred Body.</p><p></p><p>And he himself would obtain an Innate Indestructible Sacred Body!</p><p></p><p>"If we continue cultivating like this, continue transforming like this, what kind of physique will eventually emerge?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could hardly imagine, it seemed truly limitless.</p><p></p><p>"This girl Su Lingxiu is an alchemist martial artist, not specializing in killing, but she's not incapable of killing either. What kind of divine power will she give birth to?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently observed Su Lingxiu's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to Divine Power, giving birth to the divine power Life and Death Reversal. You obtain the divine power Life and Death Reversal!"</p><p></p><p>Life and Death Reversal! "This divine power is not bad."</p><p></p><p>The divine power Life and Death Reversal can reverse life and death, transfer damage, and also steal others' life force or grant life force.</p><p></p><p>It can cure diseases and save people, and also kill people invisibly.</p><p></p><p>It can also transfer and reverse damage targeted at oneself, quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to Divine Power, giving birth to the divine power Heavenly Spirit Flame. You obtain the divine power Heavenly Spirit Flame."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's second divine power, Heavenly Spirit Flame, was born in her spirit platform. It can merge with heaven and earth, merge with spiritual energy without revealing its aura, and can be used for alchemy as well as killing enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Although not as good as my Evergreen Divine Fire, this Heavenly Spirit Flame is quite impressive, and can also evolve as one's strength increases."</p><p></p><p>The divine power Heavenly Spirit Flame is a necessary divine power for alchemist martial artists. Other alchemist martial artists, if they cultivate to the Divine Power realm, would also give birth to such a divine power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even among Heavenly Spirit Flames or spirit flame-type divine powers, there are differences in strength and level.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu undoubtedly has the highest level Heavenly Spirit Flame among alchemist martial artists, second only to his own.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to Divine Power, giving birth to the divine power Divine Furnace Hundred Refinements. You obtain the divine power Divine Furnace Hundred Refinements!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's third divine power, Divine Furnace Hundred Refinements, is a unique divine power that can refine higher quality pills, refine all things in heaven and earth, refine life and death, and has countless wonderful uses.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient strength and continuous improvement, even indestructible qi could be refined.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded secretly.</p><p></p><p>The three divine powers Su Lingxiu gave birth to were not focused on killing, but that doesn't mean these three divine powers lack killing power.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to Divine Power, giving birth to the divine power Star Sky Divine Radiance. You obtain the divine power Star Sky Divine Radiance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was surprised for a moment, as a divine power with killing characteristics had emerged.</p><p></p><p>Star Sky Divine Radiance is a divine power with strong concealment, hidden in heaven and earth. In an instant, star radiance like needles can arrive in a flash, killing people invisibly.</p><p></p><p>"Using Star Sky Divine Radiance to treat people is also possible, and can treat a large number of people simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Using Star Sky Divine Radiance to perform acupuncture techniques is also feasible. The star radiance like needles, spread densely, can simultaneously perform acupuncture on a large group of people.</p><p></p><p>"Only one divine power left."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also had a guess about Su Lingxiu's last divine power - it must be some kind of movement technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, Su Lingxiu had also comprehended the Eight Trigrams and understood a certain technique.</p><p></p><p>The birth of divine powers is also related to the martial arts one cultivates.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to Divine Power, giving birth to the divine power Thousand Illusions No Shadow. You obtain the divine power Thousand Illusions No Shadow."</p><p></p><p>As expected, Su Lingxiu's fifth divine power was a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Illusions No Shadow, in an instant, creates thousands of illusions, making it impossible for enemies to capture the true body, disappearing without a trace in a moment.</p><p></p><p>With the birth of the fifth divine power, Su Lingxiu completely broke through to the Divine Power realm. Among the four disciples, three were now at the Divine Power realm.</p><p></p><p>Only Fang Hao, the practitioner of the strange gate martial arts, was slightly behind.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Hao was not far from advancing further.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through, Su Lingxiu excitedly returned to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at her master expectantly, waiting for his evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're being perfunctory!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu frowned.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's really not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, what divine powers did you give birth to?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"None of them are for killing people!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>The aura on her body fluctuated, and a faint black and white light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression tightened. In this instant, surging divine waves emerged on his body, divine power suddenly arising, showing that the black and white light posed a considerable threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"Stealing life force?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Not just that, it can also grant life force, transfer damage, reverse life and death..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became more and more excited as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>She raised her delicate jade hand, and a pale cyan flame burned in her palm.</p><p></p><p>Then, the flame hid into heaven and earth, almost untraceable.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Spirit Flame makes alchemy much more convenient. I can refine purer pills, higher quality pills..."</p><p></p><p>Then, Su Lingxiu also demonstrated the Divine Furnace Hundred Refinements divine power.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, you actually have such a hidden offensive divine power?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you've already discovered it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from her, star radiance like needles appeared densely in midair all around, making people feel as if they were surrounded by starlight.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the others felt their scalps tingle. They had no idea how these points of starlight appeared, how they formed, or when they appeared around them.</p><p></p><p>Even the Red Cat's fur stood on end! Only when the starlight appeared did it detect the attack. If it had really been targeted, it would probably have been turned into a porcupine by now.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 263</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Phoenixfire, thunderbolts, and sword light attacked from all directions.</p><p></p><p>There was also a strange force that seemed to want to bind him and even control his position.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a mysterious and unknown crisis, the Sect Master of the Jade Spirit Sect was deeply troubled, and what was more terrifying was that he could not sense the outside situation and did not know what had befallen the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>And it was quite clear that the outside world also knew what had happened to this Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Decisive, he took out a mother-and-child pearl and crushed one of the pearls! The Jade Spirit Sect was in crisis and needed to call for help! The Grand Elder and the others must return to the sect as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect was in complete chaos at the moment, and a huge golden dragon let out a dragon's roar, its majestic dragon aura pressing down.</p><p></p><p>The executives and disciples were all horrified, their faces deathly pale, and some even prostrated on the ground, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>While Yu Gao and the others were attacking and fighting the powerful members of the Jade Spirit Sect, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao pretended to be Jade Spirit Sect executives and secretly entered the Jade Spirit Sect, setting up a formation outside the Sect Master's Hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master entered the hall, the formation was activated, trapping the Sect Master inside.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, leave this to you, the treasury is for me and the second shidi!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out with a palm, and the golden dragon intimidated the Jade Spirit Sect executives and disciples, their souls suppressed by the majestic dragon aura, and they no longer had the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Refined Spirit Celestial, how could they resist? It would be unwise to fight against such a powerful expert, they could only leave it to the Sect Master or the Elders to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Time was pressing, Fang Hao's formation might not be able to trap the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master for too long, and the other party, suddenly encountering the formation, would be cautious and focus on self-preservation rather than recklessly attacking.</p><p></p><p>If the time was too long, the other party would discover that the purpose was just to trap him, and he would surely break out of the formation with force.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master was a mid-stage Refined Spirit expert, only one step away from the late-stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master must have already crushed the mother-and-child pearl to call for help.</p><p></p><p>This visit to the Jade Spirit Sect was not for the purpose of killing.</p><p></p><p>It was for the Jade Spirit Sect's treasury! Where the treasury was located must be an important place, and Xu Yan and Meng Chong soon discovered a treasury of the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Facing such a powerful enemy, the treasury was still guarded by a Refined Spirit initial realm cultivator, the Jade Spirit Sect truly deserved its reputation as the number one sect in Yuzhou, with an unexpected number of Refined Spirit cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Slice!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong instantly transformed into a sixty-foot giant, unleashing the Absolute Deity Slash.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan, with a sword strike, unleashed the Xun Mie Sword! Under the powerful martial arts that attacked the soul, the Refined Spirit cultivator let out a miserable scream, his soul torn apart and killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The treasury was blasted open.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect's treasury is indeed impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was not the core treasury, the treasures inside were far more than the Dai family's, truly deserving the reputation of the number one sect in Yuzhou! A jar floated up, and with a sweep of Xu Yan's spiritual sense, the treasures in the treasury were instantly sucked into the jar.</p><p></p><p>This was a jar specially refined to plunder the Jade Spirit Sect's treasury, with a huge spatial capacity and an absorbing force. With a sweep of the spiritual sense, it could suck the treasures dry in a very short time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there seems to be a hidden treasury here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly discovered that there was something unusual in the core area of the Jade Spirit Sect's back mountain.</p><p></p><p>He punched out.</p><p></p><p>This punch, with his control of the force, instantly broke through the ground, revealing a treasure artifact door.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had rushed over, and with a sword strike, the treasure artifact door shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Is this one of the core treasuries?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were greatly excited, as the treasures hidden in this secret treasury were all extremely precious medicinal herbs and the like.</p><p></p><p>The storage bag was not as good as the storage ring, as it was mainly made of the Swallowing Toad as the material, and the medicinal herbs stored inside had a certain chance of losing their potency and being absorbed by the Swallowing Toad in the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families would establish treasuries to store medicinal herbs and other treasures, rather than storing them in storage bags for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The jar flew out, and with a sweep of the spiritual sense, everything was sucked into the jar.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! Xu Yan and Meng Chong began to plunder the Jade Spirit Sect extensively, clearing out all the spiritual herbs in the spiritual fields.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they encountered what seemed to be a core treasure area, they would simply punch it open, and in just a moment, the Jade Spirit Sect was in ruins, like it had been ravaged by bandits.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect executives and disciples were all terrified, even cursing inwardly, wondering what was wrong with the Sect Master, was he useless? Even now he still hadn't taken action? The Grand Elders, were they all fools, being lured away and not knowing the crisis of the sect?</p><p></p><p>"Hand over all the storage bags, or be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and eighteen golden dragons circled above the executives and disciples, their majestic dragon aura looking down on the people below.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Jade Spirit Sect, how dare you..."</p><p></p><p>An executive regained his spirit and spoke up angrily, trying to threaten them with the sect's power.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The dragon's tail swept across, and the person instantly turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>The sect was being attacked, and he still wanted to act tough and intimidate people by relying on the sect's power, such a fool didn't deserve to live.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't hand it over, die!"</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon descended from the sky, its eyes shining brightly, like a true dragon descending to the world!</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the storage bags, or die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's towering figure, clad in divine armor, was like a divine god in the sky, with a blade of light sweeping across the executives and disciples, ready to strike down at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hand it over, I'll hand it over, spare me!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect executives and disciples, their faces deathly pale, hurriedly took out their storage bags and placed them in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Their lives were the most important! The golden dragon swept across, and all the storage bags were taken away.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formation around the Jade Spirit Sect's main hall began to shake, the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master was attacking the formation, trying to break out.</p><p></p><p>The transmission talisman also brought the news that Zhu Liang and the others were rushing back frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong instantly appeared beside Fang Hao, who was now straining to control the formation, using the extraordinary Heavenly and Earthly Formation to bind the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master inside.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao swept his spiritual sense, and the formation artifacts flew up and were stored in the weapon case.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong struck together, bombarding the Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master who had not yet fully revealed his form, and after the attack, the three of them disappeared into the sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, they had vanished into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master let out an angry roar, fending off the attack, and as the mist dispersed, his spiritual power surged out, and he was suddenly stunned!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>An angry roar echoed through the Jade Spirit Sect! "Who, who was it!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Sect Master stood in the air, looking down at the Jade Spirit Sect, which was now in ruins, the treasury plundered, and even one of the core treasuries had been taken. The elder guarding the treasury had been killed.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual herbs in the fields had all been cleared out! At this moment, the Jade Spirit Sect was like it had been ravaged by thieves, the losses were devastating! "Sect Master, it was Xu Yan and Meng Chong!" </p><p></p><p>An executive wailed.</p><p></p><p>A lifetime of treasures, almost all of them in the storage bags, were gone! Damn it, they were even more ruthless than bandits!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, the disciple's storage bag was also robbed!" </p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, the disciple's losses are severe!"</p><p></p><p>The executives and disciples of the Jade Spirit Sect wailed.</p><p></p><p>The renowned number one sect in Yuzhou was now filled with wails, each one more miserable than the last.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan! Meng Chong! I, the Jade Spirit Sect, will never rest until I have my revenge on you!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect's Sect Master roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, angry roars rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul Elders who had been chasing the wandering cultivators had returned.</p><p></p><p>They all let out furious howls.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's face turned ashen, his eyes bloodshot, panting heavily. His chest was filled with murderous intent, he was almost about to explode from rage.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! We must kill these wandering cultivators, we must kill Xu Yan and Meng Chong, we will never coexist, never coexist!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang roared madly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Nascent Soul experts from the various sects and aristocratic families of Yuzhou arrived. They were all shocked to learn that the Jade Spirit Sect's spirit pearl had been shattered. The Jade Spirit Sect was actually seeking aid? </p><p></p><p>This was the number one sect in Yuzhou, with the powerful Zhu Liang as its pillar. Who could possibly threaten the Jade Spirit Sect? Could it be an external force? However, according to the rules of the sects and aristocratic families, they all had to come, even if they didn't take action.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the devastation, as if the sect had been ravaged by bandits, the experts were all greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"It was Xu Yan and Meng Chong, along with that mysterious wandering cultivator force!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect's Sect Master gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Now it could be confirmed that Xu Yan and Meng Chong were from that mysterious wandering cultivator force.</p><p></p><p>The experts from the sects and aristocratic families were stunned. Where did this powerful wandering cultivator force come from? </p><p></p><p>At this moment, they all felt a strong sense of threat, especially the Shu Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect's Sect Master briefly recounted the events, including the mysterious and bizarre method that could seal people within layers of mist, shielding their spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul experts from the sects and aristocratic families were all unsettled. Dozens of Nascent Soul experts?</p><p></p><p>"We, the sects and aristocratic families, must unite against this threat. From today onwards, we will thoroughly search Yuzhou, and kill without mercy anyone we suspect, rather kill wrongly than let them go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang spoke with chilling murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul experts felt a chill in their hearts. In this way, the conflict between the sects, aristocratic families, and the wandering cultivators would be fully ignited, and Yuzhou would surely descend into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"We cannot hesitate, we cannot be indecisive. If we let that mysterious wandering cultivator force grow stronger, how can our position in the sects and aristocratic families be maintained?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect's Sect Master also spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's focus the search on cultivators at and above the Nascent Soul realm, those below are not important," a Nascent Soul expert, who was an elder of a prominent family, said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then," Zhu Liang nodded. There were not many Nascent Soul realm wandering cultivators, so the search would be easier. If these cultivators belonged to that mysterious wandering cultivator force, their status would certainly not be low.</p><p></p><p>After the discussion, the experts from the sects and aristocratic families took their leave, expressing their condolences for the Jade Spirit Sect's misfortune, but only they knew how they truly felt about it in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>The sects and aristocratic families could not possibly all be in harmony.</p><p></p><p>In the Shen Clan's main hall, the patriarch Shen Wang returned from outside, his mood greatly elated. He hummed a little tune, sipping on spiritual tea, with a look of contentment on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Father, what has you in such a good mood?" Shen Haizhou, who had returned home to collect some treasures for refining a mysterious spring mirror, couldn't help but ask curiously upon seeing his father's cheerful state.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect has been ravaged by bandits, their sect has been plundered, how can I not be happy?" Shen Wang hummed his little tune.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou: ...</p><p></p><p>"Father, quickly tell me, what exactly happened to the Jade Spirit Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's first thought was that this must be the work of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, as they had already set their sights on the Jade Spirit Sect's treasury. </p><p></p><p>He never expected them to actually put their plan into action! He was shocked, his scalp tingling, but also couldn't help feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>"What else could have happened? Their treasury was emptied, including one of their core treasuries, all the storage bags of the executives and disciples were stolen!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang had a look of gleeful satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect deserved it, being ravaged by bandits, right? They thought too highly of themselves as the number one sect in Yuzhou, not knowing to be low-key, and ended up attracting the bandits, being plundered!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang was full of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou also grew excited, the harvest from plundering the Jade Spirit Sect must be enormous. There would be a share for their family as well.</p><p></p><p>"We're rich!" "Father, we should improve the security of our own treasury, lest we get robbed as well!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou reminded him.</p><p></p><p>After the Jade Spirit Sect's incident was exposed, who knows how many bold wandering cultivators might be tempted to try their luck and pull off a big score.</p><p></p><p>If they succeeded, they would be free to live as they pleased!</p><p></p><p>"You're right!" Shen Wang paused, the family's treasury would need to be reconsidered in terms of how to store the treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Haizhou, remember, be low-key. Pay for your food, drink, and entertainment, we are an aristocratic family, but we can't be too arrogant. It's been not long since the Blood Demon incident, some have already forgotten and become conceited again.</p><p></p><p>"If there could be a Blood Demon, there could be a second one. We can't become the unlucky ones."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang looked at his son seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Father," Shen Haizhou nodded, hesitating for a moment before putting on a flattering smile and said, "Father, can I discuss something with you?"</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang eyed his son.</p><p></p><p>"Father, can you lend me your collection of erotic art? I have a friend who can refine them into a treasured artifact..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfilial son, when did you sneak a peek at your father's collection?" Shen Wang's expression darkened. "Are you itching for a beating?"</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't hit me, I can lend you my own hard-collected treasures in exchange to let you take a look..."</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, not studying the Dao but always obsessing over these things, I'll beat you to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Grandpa, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hastily cried for help.</p><p></p><p>"Unfilial brat, stop!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Taiweiwen appeared with an imposing aura. "Haizhou, come to Grandpa, your face is all swollen from the beating, you unfilial grandson, how dare you do this to my grandson!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not like that, Father, this scoundrel actually coveted my collection of erotic art..."</p><p></p><p>"You still have the nerve to say that, isn't it you who corrupted my grandson?" </p><p></p><p>"Father, I was just following your example..."</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, you unfilial son, daring to slander your father..."</p><p></p><p>The Shen Clan descended into chaos, like they were under attack, if one didn't know the situation, they would have thought the Shen Clan was being invaded.</p><p></p><p>While walking, Yu Gao was coughing up blood, his complexion deathly pale. Although his injuries were not light, he was still extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>When Zhu Liang received the news of the Jade Spirit Sect's crisis and wanted to return to rescue them, Yu Gao had stubbornly blocked him for a long time. This injury was worth it in exchange for the Jade Spirit Sect's treasury being plundered.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

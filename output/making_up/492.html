        <h1>Chapter 492</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The battle was about to break out, but Tiansa showed no signs of making a move. Instead, he continued speaking: "Dragon Realm Lord, you should know what this is, right?"</p><p></p><p>As Tiansa spoke, he raised his hand, revealing a pink flower petal in his palm. It emanated a pink light that seemed capable of bewitching people's hearts and making them become entranced.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Lie's gaze focused as he said in a deep voice: "What does this have to do with my granddaughter being tricked by you and falling into the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Tiansa sighed and said: "Dragon Realm Lord, you've misunderstood. Since you recognize what this is, let me explain the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>"By chance, I discovered where your granddaughter was. Her mind had been bewitched, and what bewitched her was related to this object.</p><p></p><p>"At the time, the situation was urgent. I didn't have time to inform the Dragon Realm Lord, but I also couldn't bear to see a young member of the True Dragon clan fall into crisis, especially since she's the Dragon Realm Lord's granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>"Whether to make the Dragon Realm Lord owe me a favor, or to thwart the enemy's plot, I had to take action.</p><p></p><p>"However, that space was rather special. Trying to rescue her back to the Dao Realm would have been extremely difficult and complicated, and we could have easily encountered enemy interference.</p><p></p><p>"With no other choice, I could only let your granddaughter fall into the Divine Realm. I figured that with her strength, she would surely be safe in the Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ao Lie let out a cold laugh and said: "Tiansa, was the collapse of the Dao Realm's Heavenly Ladder related to you? Was my granddaughter's fall into the Divine Realm connected to this?</p><p></p><p>"Show me evidence. This object alone is not enough to convince me!"</p><p></p><p>Tiansa sighed and said: "I know the Dragon Realm Lord will be suspicious, but every word I say is true. Yes, the collapse of the Dao Realm's Heavenly Ladder was related to my plans, but my plan was simply for the unification of Heaven and Earth. Which of the Dao Realm's lords doesn't know this? But Dragon Realm Lord, you must understand that not everything goes according to plan. There are always unexpected changes. Your granddaughter falling into the Divine Realm merely accelerated the collapse of the Dao Realm's Heavenly Ladder. This was due to poor communication between myself and my subordinates in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I had already instructed my subordinates in the Divine Realm to look after your granddaughter and not harm her. Unfortunately, Xu Yan appeared..."</p><p></p><p>As he finished speaking, Tiansa's face was full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Realm Lord, to be honest, it was precisely because your granddaughter was subdued by Xu Yan that I feared you would misunderstand and think I was behind it. That's why I delayed visiting you.</p><p></p><p>"But since the Dragon Realm Lord has come today, let's clear things up. As for the evidence you want, I do have some. Although it's not much, it's enough to prove that I, Tiansa, did not plot against your granddaughter!"</p><p></p><p>As Tiansa spoke, he waved his hand and a scroll opened up. Ripples flowed across the scroll, and then a scene appeared. It showed a space filled with pink light, and within the pink glow, an incredibly alluring figure was faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>Not far in front of the alluring figure was a jade-white, flawless true dragon, clearly enraged!</p><p></p><p>"This is a scene I hurriedly captured in the scroll. I think it should serve as evidence."</p><p></p><p>Tiansa waved his hand, sending the scroll flying to Ao Lie.</p><p></p><p>By now, Ao Lie had transformed into human form, with short dragon horns on his head and an orange-red beard. His eyes were filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>He took the scroll and examined it closely, then burst out in angry curses, "That slut Mei Wu, how dare she plot against my granddaughter! She's gone too far in offending dragons. Does she really think I, Ao Lie, can't deal with her?"</p><p></p><p>Tiansa said in a solemn voice: "Dragon Realm Lord, don't be careless. This Mei Wu woman is incredibly powerful. Her bewitching abilities in particular are extremely difficult to guard against!"</p><p></p><p>"That Mei Wu slut is nothing. Her bewitching powers only work on weaklings," Ao Lie said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He then added: "Tiansa, this was a misunderstanding. I, Ao Lie, am not an unreasonable dragon. Consider this object as an apology for the misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ao Lie waved his hand and sent over a box.</p><p></p><p>"As for your kindness in saving my granddaughter, I, Ao Lie, will repay you another day!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Ao Lie led his group of powerful beings away in a grand procession, returning to the Dragon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tiansa watched the True Dragon clan depart, the corner of his mouth curling up slightly. He turned and returned to the Tiansa Realm, thinking to himself: "Mei Wu, don't blame me for sending you a powerful enemy. You're just too difficult to deal with."</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the Dragon Realm, Ao Yuxue's father Ao Ming looked at his father and asked: "Father, Mei Wu has gone too far in plotting against Yuxue like this. She's insulting our True Dragon clan. When will you take action to subdue her?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie looked somewhat uncomfortable, his eyes shifting slightly as he said: "That Mei Wu slut is not easy to deal with. She's so seductive that as soon as I see her, my whole body heats up and I get very agitated, which affects my ability to use my powers. Let's put off revenge for now. We'll wait for Yuxue to return and get the full story before making a decision!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming: ?? He looked at his father strangely, wondering if the old man was unable to resist Mei Wu's bewitching powers and that's why he was holding back.</p><p></p><p>And so, a great battle was dissolved into nothing.</p><p></p><p>Many realm lords were waiting for Ao Lie to leave the Tai Cang world and go settle accounts with Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, there was no movement from the True Dragon Realm. Ao Lie did not arrogantly and domineeringly head beyond the world to attack Mei Wu's lair.</p><p></p><p>"This old dragon, could it be he doesn't believe what I said? Based on my understanding of him, he shouldn't be so perceptive!" </p><p></p><p>Tiansa frowned, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Realm, at the place where the Shadow Ground Realm was descending, many powerful beings gathered, waiting for the Shadow Ground Realm to stabilize before descending into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With Heaven and Earth unifying, it's a time of great change. If we enter the Divine Realm, could we obtain some heavenly opportunities to break through our own limits?"</p><p></p><p>"Even in the Dao Realm cultivation is difficult. Even if we obtain some heavenly opportunities, we won't be able to improve much. It's a matter of innate talent!"</p><p></p><p>A group of martial artists stood at the edge of the descending Shadow Ground Realm. They could see that inside the realm, spiritual mist was thick, dao principles were manifesting, and dao rhythms permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Most of the martial artists preparing to enter the Divine Realm were at the Heaven Unity realm. They all intended to seek opportunities to advance further and break through to the God Venerable realm during the unification of the Dao and Divine Realms and the great changes in Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Among them were also some God Venerable realm martial artists. These higher level martial artists were all on missions assigned by their respective realms to descend into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Several God Venerable martial artists noticed a figure flitting past and their gazes sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme Being!"</p><p></p><p>"Even Supreme Beings want to enter the Divine Realm? Could it be that there really will be great opportunities in the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"They're probably going after Xu Yan. That dragon subduing technique is too tempting."</p><p></p><p>"How could a Divine Realm martial artist have such a powerful dragon subduing technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because of the great changes in Heaven and Earth that such a prodigy appeared."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists discussed quietly among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting to enter the Shadow Ground Realm and through it enter the Divine Realm, whether to seek breakthrough opportunities during the unification of the Dao and Divine Realms, or to carry out assigned missions. Their purposes varied.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the tremors from the Shadow Ground Realm's descent gradually weakened. The time to enter the Shadow Ground Realm was drawing near.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura approached from afar.</p><p></p><p>The group of Heaven Unity realm and even God Venerable realm martial artists all changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Supreme Unity Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Two martial artists with powerful auras approached from the distance, arriving before the Shadow Ground Realm and silently observing it.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Supreme warriors of the Taihe Realm! Among the 300 realms of the Dao Domain, the Taihe Realm is extremely powerful and widely recognized as a great realm. Moreover, it is said that Taihe, the founder of the Taihe Realm, is still alive in the world, just not having appeared in public for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Any warrior with some background knows that Taihe is an ancient lord of a small world, and his strength ranks at the forefront among that batch of small world lords.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he has a deep relationship with the lord of the Taicang World, which is why the first level of the Divine Realm is the Taihe Level, and the Dao Domain Ladder was established in the Taihe Level.</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Level is the territory of the Taihe Realm in the Divine Realm. When the Shadow Realm fell, the Taihe Level was the first to be impacted. The current sect master of the Taihe Sect, a subordinate sect of the Taihe Realm, perished when the Dao Domain Ladder collapsed.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme warrior of the Taihe Realm descended, many warriors felt tense. Was the Taihe Realm about to display its power? In the distance, another powerful aura emerged.</p><p></p><p>Another supreme warrior descended.</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme warrior of the Taikun Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Taikun Realm is also a great realm, but it is rumored that Taikun, the founder of the Taikun Realm, has already perished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the current lord of the Taikun Realm is a true disciple of Taikun, and a Realm Lord level powerhouse, one of the outstanding figures among the third generation of Taicang powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Although his fame is not as resounding as Tianshas, no one dares to underestimate the current Taikun Realm Lord, Jiang Feng!</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more supreme warriors appeared.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two unparalleled domineering auras approached from afar. The powerful supreme aura was not concealed at all, fully displaying arrogance and dominance.</p><p></p><p>The warriors all changed their expressions and looked towards the newcomers.</p><p></p><p>"It's the supreme warriors of the Tiansha Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Tiansha Realm has been stirring up storms in the Dao Domain, and the current great changes in the world are also related to the Tiansha Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Tiansha Realm Lord has killed the Shadow Realm Lord, his notoriety is widespread, and many weaker realm lords are extremely wary of him.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme warriors of the Tiansha Realm descended, the supreme warrior of the Taihe Realm, who had been silently waiting for the Shadow Realm to stabilize, coldly spoke: "The Tiansha Realm collapsed the Dao Domain Ladder, causing the death of our subordinate sect master and heavy losses to the Taihe Level. Shouldn't you give an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>"What explanation does your Taihe Realm want? If you're not as skilled, just accept it. If you're not convinced, then let's settle it with our abilities!" </p><p></p><p>The supreme warrior of the Tiansha Realm said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, warriors below the Divine Lord level changed their expressions and hurriedly retreated, moving away from the area where the supreme warriors were.</p><p></p><p>The Tiansha Realm is as domineering and arrogant as ever.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The supreme warrior of the Taihe Realm erupted with momentum and said coldly: "Don't think your Tiansha Realm is invincible! Do you really think you can bully my Taihe Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, if you're not convinced, then let's settle it with our abilities!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme warrior of the Tiansha Realm sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, fine, fine!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme warrior of the Taihe Realm took a step forward and raised his hand, launching a powerful attack directly at the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The battle between supreme warriors thus erupted!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle that erupted between the two supreme warriors was much more intense than the commotion of the entire Shadow Realm falling. As the battle became more and more fierce, even the other supreme warriors couldn't help but retreat a distance.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Taihe Realm's supreme warrior was within expectations, after all, it was a great realm of the Dao Domain, and Taihe was an ancient lord of a small world.</p><p></p><p>But the strength of the Tiansha Realm's supreme warrior surprised everyone. In the battle with the Taihe Realm's supreme warrior, he didn't seem to be at a disadvantage at all, no wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>And how powerful must Tiansha himself be? Could he already contend with Taihe?</p><p></p><p>"If Taihe wants an explanation, then let's fight. Let's settle it with our abilities!"</p><p></p><p>The other supreme warrior of the Tiansha Realm actually took the initiative to challenge another supreme warrior of the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's fight!"</p><p></p><p>With the honor of the Taihe Realm at stake, they naturally couldn't back down.</p><p></p><p>Boom, as soon as both sides moved, they unleashed fierce killing moves.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the falling Shadow Realm, a battle between supreme warriors erupted. Spiritual energy churned, the laws of heaven and earth fluctuated, and the power of the Dao occasionally surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The winds and clouds stirred, ripples spread, and the intense battle attracted everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>What no one noticed was that a shadow-like figure, silently and without a sound, as if glued to the ground, took this opportunity to slip into the still turbulent Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Shadow Realm, the power of the Dao surged, and the laws of the small world emerged, seemingly wanting to suppress the intruder.</p><p></p><p>That shadow-like figure merely revealed a trace of the power of law, and the laws of the Shadow Realm calmed down. The figure continued forward, heading towards the depths of the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm was shrouded in mist and shaking constantly. At this time, it was undoubtedly extremely dangerous inside the Shadow Realm. Even if a supreme warrior entered, they could easily perish.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong a supreme warrior is, they are ultimately not the lord of a small world and cannot withstand the suppression of a small world.</p><p></p><p>Although Realm Lord level powerhouses can resist the shaking of the Shadow Realm, the fall of the Shadow Realm involves the laws of the Taicang World. No matter how strong a Realm Lord is, they cannot resist the laws of the Taicang World. That's why even someone as strong as Ao Lie doesn't dare to forcibly descend to the Divine Realm at this time.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Shadow Realm, there was a place like an abyss, shrouded in thick fog, emitting a cold and chilly air, desolate and deep.</p><p></p><p>The shadow-like figure stopped, took out a silver pearl, and crushed it with a pop. The broken pearl spewed out a cloud of gray mist, which instantly entered the cold and deep abyss.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a voice came from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Has it started?"</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord, it has started, but there were some unexpected developments."</p><p></p><p>The voice from the abyss showed a hint of surprise: "Unexpected? Did someone interfere in advance? Was it Taihe? Or Taiyao, or even Xiaoyao?"</p><p></p><p>"None of them. There were some unexpected developments in the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>The shadow-like figure began to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Subduing? The Dragon Subduing technique?" </p><p></p><p>The voice from the abyss was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, so Lord Tiansha ordered me to descend to the lower realm in advance to seek the Dragon Subduing technique. If we obtain the Dragon Subduing technique, the True Dragon clan will also be under control."</p><p></p><p>The shadow-like voice respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"For Tiansha to send you, Yinjue, personally, it seems that the person behind Xu Yan is not weak. Since that's the case, I will smooth out the laws of the Shadow Realm to let you pass through smoothly."</p><p></p><p>"The person behind Xu Yan is very likely a supreme warrior, and among supreme warriors, their strength is also extremely strong. Lord Tiansha's intention is for me not to engage in direct combat, so I'm asking to borrow the Realm Lord's Mist Beast True Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Yinjue said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Could the opponent be a Realm Lord? Otherwise, why would it be necessary to borrow the Mist Beast True Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>The person in the abyss wondered.</p><p></p><p>"According to Lord Tiansha's judgment, the possibility of a Realm Lord is low, but it can't be completely ruled out. To be on the safe side, if it really is a Realm Lord, or even an unfamiliar Realm Lord, with the Mist Beast True Spirit, I would have a slight chance to escape. Even if I can't escape, if the Mist Beast True Spirit is killed, you, Realm Lord, would know immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tiansha's meaning is, if it really is a Realm Lord, and an unfamiliar one at that, then only you, Realm Lord, can personally take action to eliminate them!"</p><p></p><p>Yinjue conveyed Tiansha's orders.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

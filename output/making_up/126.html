        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a look of regret on his face when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke up, "I want to buy spiritual medicine. Do you have any sixth-grade spiritual medicine here?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's smile froze on her face as she looked at Meng Chong suspiciously. How could he just ask for sixth-grade spiritual medicine right off the bat?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, we don't have any sixth-grade spiritual medicine here."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued with a regretful expression, "Then what about seventh-grade spiritual medicine?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's smile became increasingly stiff, and the scene of that young master taking out five spirit stones to buy spiritual medicine came to her mind. </p><p></p><p>This one, could it be that he would take out five spirit stones as well? "Young master, we don't have seventh-grade spiritual medicine either!"</p><p></p><p>In the entire Tieshan County, it was rare to see anyone purchase spiritual medicine above ninth-grade, and even ninth-grade spiritual medicine didn't have many buyers. </p><p></p><p>It was usually the major powers of Tieshan County that would purchase them. </p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, it was difficult to afford them, and even if they could afford it, they would usually just buy the lowest-grade ones. It was more cost-effective to buy medicinal pills or elixirs rather than low-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>As a result, she had encountered two people inquiring about sixth-grade and seventh-grade spiritual medicine.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have seventh-grade either?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong furrowed his brows. This Tieshan County Tianbaoge was just an insignificant branch, all because Tieshan County was too small.</p><p></p><p>He took out five spirit stones and placed them on the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Look, how much spiritual medicine can I buy with these?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's mouth twitched. Those familiar five spirit stones confirmed it - they were from the same village.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, with five spirit stones, you can buy one Water Spirit Grass and one Strengthening Bone Flower. The Water Spirit Grass is three spirit stones, and the Strengthening Bone Flower is five spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a disappointed look on his face. These spirit stones were too easily spent.</p><p></p><p>"Can I use gold to purchase them? How much can I buy with ten thousand taels of gold?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought about it. If he could use gold to purchase, he wouldn't be short on money, as the Emperor of Wu owed him at least a hundred thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's smile became awkward as she said, "I'm sorry, but our Tianbaoge does not accept gold."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, as if she thought of something, she said, "Gold can only be used to purchase common cultivation techniques, at a hundred taels of gold per book."</p><p></p><p>Tieshan County was a remote place, so cultivation techniques were not as prosperous.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbaoge had cultivation techniques for sale, common ones, but for ordinary people, they were still precious.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people didn't easily obtain spirit stones, so they introduced the option of using gold to purchase techniques.</p><p></p><p>This was the only thing that could be purchased with gold at the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was dumbfounded. Spirit stones were too easily spent, he was too poor.</p><p></p><p>How could he earn more spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>"Then give me one Strengthening Bone Flower."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, young master, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant turned around and from a shelf behind the counter, opened a compartment and took out a sealed spiritual herb - the Strengthening Bone Flower! "Young master, please take good care of it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the Strengthening Bone Flower, his heart bleeding. His entire wealth, five spirit stones, had just bought him this one spiritual herb.</p><p></p><p>As he left the Tianbaoge, he pondered, "I have to find a way to earn more spirit stones. I'll take this Strengthening Bone Flower back and give it to my junior sister. She's currently at the Golden Bone stage and wants to refine the Evergreen Bone, which isn't easy.</p><p></p><p>"With this Strengthening Bone Flower, it will be much easier for my junior sister to refine the medicinal pill and cultivate the Evergreen Bone."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Meng Chong left Tieshan County, preparing to return to Yunshan County to deliver the Strengthening Bone Flower to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he left Tieshan County, he realized he was being followed.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows, he looked at the Strengthening Bone Flower in his hand. "I was careless, didn't hide it. Has someone set their sights on it? I wonder if this person has any spirit stones on him?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Meng Chong's eyes lit up, as if he had found a way to obtain spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He pretended not to have noticed the follower and walked along casually.</p><p></p><p>"Good sir, I have a request for you!"</p><p></p><p>After leaving Tieshan County, on a remote path with no one around, a person suddenly jumped out.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the newcomer, a scholarly-looking man with a pale face, evidently injured. And he was actually a Patriarch-level cultivator! "The Strengthening Bone Flower is not even a rare spiritual herb, yet a Patriarch-level cultivator has set his sights on me? And Tieshan County is not a remote place, why would a Patriarch be here?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What request do you have of me? Could it be that you've set your sights on my Strengthening Bone Flower?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong's grin, the man's expression became increasingly fierce, and his already imposing figure seemed like a ferocious beast about to unleash its savagery.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly regretted it, he shouldn't have approached this person, but there was no turning back now, and there was no one more suitable than him.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, his aura surged, revealing his Patriarch-level cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Good sir, you've misunderstood. I have a request for you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his brow, not here to rob him?</p><p></p><p>"What is your request?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Meng Chong showed no fear despite his Patriarch aura, Meng Shu felt even more regretful. He might have found the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I have an item stored at the Tianbaoge in Qinglin City, and I'd like to hire you to retrieve it for me. I will greatly reward you for this!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu took a deep breath and spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Qinglin City? Meng Chong furrowed his brow, where was that?</p><p></p><p>"What kind of reward are we talking about?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu raised one finger. "An eighth-grade spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up. An eighth-grade spiritual herb was truly precious.</p><p></p><p>"I speak no falsehoods!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I accept!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong agreed without hesitation. As for whether there were any dangers in retrieving the stored item, he didn't even consider it.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Shu's Patriarch-level strength, a single punch could kill an ordinary person. What danger could there be? Schemes and tricks were nothing before absolute power.</p><p></p><p>However, he should still maintain some caution.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we set out for Qinglin City now then?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I still have something to take care of. Let's meet here again tomorrow at this time."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>He needed to send the Strengthening Bone Flower back to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu agreed readily.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take my leave then."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu cupped his fists and his figure flickered, quickly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong narrowed his eyes. That person's movement speed was swift. After a moment of contemplation, he realized that the item Meng Shu wanted him to retrieve was likely being watched by someone.</p><p></p><p>"An eighth-grade spiritual herb, that item must be of great value."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself. If Meng Shu had any ill intentions, he wouldn't hesitate to take him down.</p><p></p><p>With a step, Meng Chong's figure instantly vanished, heading towards the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, even most great Patriarchs would be unable to track him silently, so Meng Chong wasn't worried about being followed as he went to the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit surprised to see Meng Chong back from the Inner Realm so soon.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, this is a Strengthening Bone Flower. With this spiritual herb, it will be easier for you to refine the Evergreen Bone."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed. "Thank you, Second Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>With this Strengthening Bone Flower and the Water Spirit Grass, she could refine an even more potent Evergreen Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, do you know where Qinglin City is?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked, "Qinglin City?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head and looked at Zhou Ying, "Aunt Zhou, do you know about it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying pondered for a moment and said, "Qinglin City is located at the border of Lanping Prefecture and Yunjiang Prefecture, thousands of miles away from Tieshan County."</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, are you going to Qinglin City?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there are some lively things to see there, so I plan to go take a look," Meng Chong said without mentioning the matter of retrieving the item.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple is going to the inner domain," Meng Chong said after returning the Wallflower.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Meng Shu met Meng Chong, Meng Shu had already arrived, driving a carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Warrior, from today on, you will be my coachman, escorting me to Qinglin City..." Meng Shu said while disguising himself.</p><p></p><p>"Coachman or whatever, I just want to ask, do you have money?" Meng Chong asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The reward for the Grade 8 spirit medicine," Meng Shu replied, taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's just the Grade 8 spirit medicine. Come, let's write a contract, you owe me two Grade 8 spirit medicines," Meng Chong took out paper and a pen.</p><p></p><p>"No, what do you mean two Grade 8 spirit medicines? It's one, I'm hiring you to go to Qinglin City and retrieve the item in storage, the reward is one Grade 8 spirit medicine," Meng Shu hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see, helping you retrieve the item in storage is one Grade 8 spirit medicine, and pretending to be your coachman is another one, so that's two, right?" Meng Chong nodded, making it clear.</p><p></p><p>"No, I think you misunderstood, pretending to be the coachman and retrieving the item are one task, the reward is one Grade 8 spirit medicine!" Meng Shu was a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glared at him and angrily said, "One Grade 8 spirit medicine, and you want me to be your coachman and retrieve the item? Am I that cheap? You're insulting me!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura emanated from Meng Chong, making Meng Shu swallow hard, regretting that he might have found the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said cautiously, "Since we can't agree on the price, shall we call off the deal?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, "Calling it off is fine, but you have to compensate me, after all, I've wasted a lot of time on this deal, let's say 1,000 spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu jumped in anger, his Patriarch-level aura bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>"1,000 spirit crystals? This is robbery!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised an eyebrow and sneered, "Oh, so a Patriarch is impressive? Trying to scare me? You were the one who came to me, and now you want to back out, don't you have to compensate me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu took a few deep breaths, suppressing his aura and continuing his disguise. "Alright, two Grade 8 spirit medicines then!"</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it." Meng Chong handed him the contract.</p><p></p><p>"Come, sign your name."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu took the pen and signed his name on the contract.</p><p></p><p>"Warrior, what shall I call you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu asked after completing his disguise and getting into the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"It's me, Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glanced at the contract and put it away.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Brother Meng, please take care of me on this trip," Meng Shu cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Which way is Qinglin City?"</p><p></p><p>"From here..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong drove the carriage towards Qinglin City, while Meng Shu suppressed his aura and rested in the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, do you have any enemies? I think I saw someone up ahead who might try to block our way!"</p><p></p><p>Less than a day after leaving Tieshan County, Meng Chong spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu's expression changed, and he lifted the carriage curtain to look ahead. An elderly man was floating in the air, inspecting the passing people and carriages.</p><p></p><p>A Patriarch-level cultivator! His expression kept changing. How did they track him down all the way to the remote Tieshan County?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, can you make sure the other party doesn't inspect the carriage? Can you do it?" Meng Shu asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>His disguise might not be able to deceive a Patriarch-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If his whereabouts were exposed, they would surely guess that he was going to Qinglin City.</p><p></p><p>"But that's a Patriarch, it's very dangerous..." Just as Meng Shu was pondering how to conceal it, he heard Meng Chong say solemnly, "If you pay more, I can try my best to keep it hidden, I absolutely won't let you be exposed..."</p><p></p><p>"Greedy bastard!" Meng Shu cursed inwardly. He really had picked the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>However, in the entire Tieshan County, only the mighty and powerful Meng Chong was the most suitable to retrieve that item.</p><p></p><p>"100 spirit crystals!" Meng Shu gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Are you trying to get rid of a beggar?" Meng Chong was dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>The carriage was getting closer and closer to the Patriarch, and his gaze had also fallen upon them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu gritted his teeth and said, "100 spirit crystals, no more!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem!" Meng Chong agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"The person in the carriage, come out!" The blocking Patriarch spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Scram!" Meng Chong directly roared, his powerful aura instantly bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>"A Patriarch is also doing the job of blocking the road and robbing, not ashamed at all. The person in the carriage, you can't see them either?" Meng Shu in the carriage was terrified.</p><p></p><p>"This guy, is he really reliable?" His attitude was so bad, and he was about to fight a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" The Patriarch was enraged.</p><p></p><p>But before he could make a move, Meng Chong glared at him and his formidable aura exploded, "You want to die?"</p><p></p><p>His hand gripped the hilt of his blade.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu swallowed hard, this guy's strength was truly terrifying. At this moment, he felt that the one driving the carriage was not a human, but a fearsome beast!</p><p></p><p>The blocking Patriarch also turned pale with fright, retreating several steps. He took a deep breath and said, "I was in a hurry to find an enemy, and I offended you, please forgive me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong waved the whip in his hand and said, "Just a 'sorry' and it's over? Compensation!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch was dumbfounded, compensation? "Sir, you're really..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Meng Chong glared at him, and the Patriarch immediately cowered.</p><p></p><p>He took out a spirit token and tossed it to Meng Chong, saying, "100 spirit crystals, I'm truly sorry!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, sensible." Meng Chong nodded in satisfaction, pocketing the spirit token, and his aura receded as he drove the carriage away.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man watched the departing carriage in silence. What was this? A Patriarch actually did such a thing, he must be really poor! "Who is in the carriage? A great Patriarch acting as a coachman, could it be a powerful Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly man was shocked. The coachman's strength was so formidable, the burst of aura had given him a suffocating feeling.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

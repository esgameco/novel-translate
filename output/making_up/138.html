        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It turned out that someone was impersonating Young Master Xie! Unforgivable! Although this person also looked young and handsome, he was still far inferior to Young Master Xie, especially in terms of his aura, which was completely out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Who gave him the nerve to dare impersonate Young Master Xie? Cui'er was so enraged that she jumped up, shrieking, "Shameless villain, how dare you impersonate Young Master Xie! Quickly, someone come and kill him! Senior Patriarch, please come!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded and hurriedly explained, "Please let me explain, I am truly Xie Lingfeng from Sword Saint Cliff, I came here to..."</p><p></p><p>"Audacious villain, daring to impersonate Young Master Xie, you deserve to die!" </p><p></p><p>A furious roar interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Patriarch surged, and a huge palm came crashing down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan!</p><p></p><p>He heard Cui'er's shrill scream, especially about the impersonation of Young Master Xie, and was immediately alarmed. He rushed out.</p><p></p><p>One look and he was enraged. How dare someone come and impersonate Xie Lingfeng, a crime worthy of death!</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, he struck! Boom! Xie Lingfeng struck out with a palm, the powerful force instantly sending Yan Kuan flying.</p><p></p><p>"You third-rate Patriarch, how dare you act so brazenly in front of our young master?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan glared angrily at Yan Kuan.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan was furious, "Damn it, I've been looked down on again!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, someone!" </p><p></p><p>He roared for help.</p><p></p><p>This was the Marquis Du's manor, where Patriarchs were no shortage. There were Peak Patriarchs and Grand Completion Patriarchs stationed here! "With your meager strength, you dare impersonate Young Master Xie? Young Master Xie's strength could easily crush me with a single palm!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I am truly Xie Lingfeng from Sword Saint Cliff, I came here to look for a friend..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was at a loss, these people wouldn't even give him a chance to explain.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Die!"</p><p></p><p>However, a blade light flashed across, a Patriarch warrior had struck.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan coldly snorted, drawing his sword and unleashing his Raging Wind Sword Technique, engaging the opponent and quickly gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!" </p><p></p><p>In the Marquis Du's manor, a powerful aura appeared, a Grand Completion Patriarch! Xie Lingfeng's expression tightened, he thrust out a sword, unleashing his Flying Rainbow Sword Technique, directly forcing the opponent to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, immediately another Grand Completion Patriarch joined the attack, the two teaming up to assault him.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng coldly snorted, unfolding his Myriad River Sword Technique, the surging sword qi, single-handedly holding his ground against the two Grand Completion Patriarchs without falling behind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Kuan sneered, "Insects know nothing of Young Master Xie's greatness, Grand Completion Patriarchs are merely slapped away by Young Master Xie, your meager strength dares to impersonate him?"</p><p></p><p>He drew his weapon, charging towards Hu Shan, joining forces with the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle raged intensely, Hu Shan and Xie Lingfeng retreating together.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, let's withdraw, the Marquis Du's manor has Grand Patriarchs, if this misunderstanding escalates, it will be disastrous!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said with a grim face.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also troubled, unable to clear the misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>He had become the impersonator, and was even looked down upon! Fuck! I'm an Initial Patriarch, able to single-handedly hold my ground against two Grand Completion Patriarchs, which Initial Patriarch in the Inner Realm can do that? Yet I was still looked down upon, it's simply unjust!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Myriad River Sword Technique suddenly became even more fierce, the sword lights flashing amidst the surging sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Flying Rainbow Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>Puchi! Puchi!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it forced the two Grand Completion Patriarchs to hastily defend and retreat.</p><p></p><p>And Xie Lingfeng, thrusting out another sword, drove back another Patriarch, and even stabbed Yan Kuan on the shoulder. "You third-rate Patriarch, you have no right to speak!"</p><p></p><p>After driving away the Patriarchs of the Marquis Du's manor, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan hurriedly departed.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan was furious, a third-rate Patriarch?</p><p></p><p>This is too much, if Young Master Xie was here, I would definitely offer two Grade Seven Spirit Herbs, and take his life!</p><p></p><p>In the Hearing Willow Pavilion, Du Yuying had prepared a zither, ready to play a piece to entertain guests.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er returned, indignant.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, it's so vile, someone impersonated Young Master Xie!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying immediately showed an angry expression.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarchs are still trying to capture him, I don't know the outcome."</p><p></p><p>"Go, let's see what kind of villain this is!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying angrily went outside.</p><p></p><p>The battle had already ended.</p><p></p><p>"Did they capture him?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan was bandaging his wound, "He escaped, his strength is not weak!"</p><p></p><p>"Escaped? Absolutely cannot let him flee the Du Commandery!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying hurriedly left, "I'll go find the Lord, have him send Peak Patriarchs to hunt him down!"</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis Du's manor is too bullying, Young Master, let's return to Sword Saint Cliff, have my father come and teach them a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Don't trouble Uncle Hai, let's just leave."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>They hastily fled Du Commandery, the next step was to find Xu Yan's whereabouts. After all, Sword Saint Cliff was a top-tier force, obtaining news from the martial dao world would be relatively easy.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Star Lake Unparalleled Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan exclaimed, "Unexpectedly, Xu Yan is really living it up!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng confirmed that Xu Yan had come to the Inner Realm, and even went to the Unparalleled Pavilion under his name.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Gege must be there to cultivate his mind."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's eyes lit up, "Why didn't I think of going to the Unparalleled Pavilion to cultivate the mind?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Unparalleled Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan then set off for the Unparalleled Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the Marquis Du's manor, Cui'er was packing her luggage, saying, "Miss, that villain escaped, he might do something to tarnish Young Master Xie's reputation.</p><p></p><p>"The recent rumors in the martial dao world say that Young Master Xie went to the Unparalleled Pavilion, and didn't spend a single penny, it must be that villain impersonating him, defaming Young Master Xie.</p><p></p><p>"How could Young Master Xie possibly go to the Unparalleled Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"He's young and carefree, why couldn't it be him? Moreover, didn't they say he went there to cultivate his mind?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and pack, it's time to return to the Seven Star Academy, the teacher has likely found a way to resolve the problem with my body."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, does that mean you'll soon break through to the Patriarch realm?"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed inwardly, becoming a Patriarch was not so easily achieved...</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was almost the holy land of the martial dao in the Inner Realm, recruiting martial arts disciples from all over, cultivating one Patriarch after another, even Grand Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Inner Realm, many forces and sects were founded by former students of the Seven Star Academy, establishing their own schools after studying there.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion in the Inner Realm was the largest commercial force, with deep foundations, considered the number one supreme force in the Inner Realm. The only one that could rival its influence was the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy had always not participated in the disputes of the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is the mission of the Seven Star Academy to promote and research the martial arts, recruiting the most talented individuals from all over the world, regardless of their origins or backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the prosperity of the martial arts, the Seven Star Academy is unparalleled, as it has the most extensive and comprehensive martial arts teachings.</p><p></p><p>The founding ancestors of the three major nations were all once students of the Seven Star Academy, and even the current emperors studied there in their youth.</p><p></p><p>Many impoverished youths have come to the Seven Star Academy seeking to cultivate the martial arts, enduring arduous training, and then soaring to the realm of master and even grand master.</p><p></p><p>Over the long history of the inner martial arts world, there have been top powers that collapsed and faded into obscurity, and there have also been powers that declined and lost their former prestige. </p><p></p><p>But the Seven Star Academy has always stood firm, its lineage never broken, always at the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts techniques and secret arts that have been lost to the outside world can often be found within the Seven Star Academy. If they are not even present there, then it truly means they are lost forever.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, the Seven Star Academy has faced many threats, but none have been able to shake it in the slightest. Instead, those who dared to provoke the Seven Star Academy were suppressed and destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Even a dynasty that once dominated the inner world, crushing many powerful forces and forcing countless ancient families and sects to submit, still failed in its attempt to subjugate the Seven Star Academy and bring it under its control.</p><p></p><p>In the end, that dynasty collapsed. This battle revealed only a glimpse of the terrifying depths of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Grand masters emerged one after another, wielding long-lost supreme techniques and unheard-of secret arts, using their absolute superiority to force the dynasty's strongest to submit and acknowledge the Seven Star Academy's transcendent status, beyond the dynasty's control.</p><p></p><p>This battle weakened the dynasty's strength, leading to its eventual fragmentation into the three major nations of the present day.</p><p></p><p>After this event, the world realized that the Seven Star Academy was home to a group of scholars deeply devoted to the martial arts, whose mastery of techniques, understanding of the martial dao, and research prowess were unmatched by any other force in the world.</p><p></p><p>These martial arts scholars were the true foundation of the Seven Star Academy. No one knew how many of them there were, and even some of the renowned grand masters outside might secretly be members of this group.</p><p></p><p>The current Patriarch of the Seven Star Academy was renowned as the number one grand master in the world, but their identity, whether male or female, was known to only the top grand masters.</p><p></p><p>The three Vice-Patriarchs were also fearsome grand master experts.</p><p></p><p>The highest levels that could be accessed within the Seven Star Academy were the Supervisors, Grand Instructors, and Instructors. As for the rumored martial arts scholars, one could only encounter them by chance.</p><p></p><p>The Instructors ranged from masters to those not lower than the third-grade martial artist realm, responsible for teaching the initial martial arts cultivation to the students.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Instructors ranged from grand masters to masters, with no Grand Instructor below the master realm.</p><p></p><p>They were responsible for teaching the third-grade and above students, or the exceptionally talented students.</p><p></p><p>The Supervisors were the core of the Seven Star Academy, overseeing and maintaining the academy's rules, and punishing any Instructors who violated them. Each Supervisor was a grand master expert.</p><p></p><p>Students who could be accepted as disciples by the Supervisors were all individuals of extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star City, the outer city of the Seven Star Academy, was surrounded by seven cities. Many martial artists came here seeking opportunities, making friends in the martial arts, or hiding from their enemies.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was built into the mountains, with pavilions, towers, and buildings densely packed. At regular intervals, there were training platforms for the students to exchange and spar.</p><p></p><p>These platforms were also where external challengers could come to compete and exchange martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy always welcomed external challengers to come and exchange, compete in the martial arts, with countless talents from all forces seeking to make a name for themselves here every year.</p><p></p><p>To gain access to the Academy's collection of classics, one had to overcome a series of challenges and sparring matches, passing one layer after another.</p><p></p><p>Since the founding of the Seven Star Academy, the strongest external challenger had only managed to pass through seven layers and enter the seventh layer of the collection.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Thousand Star Lake, Xu Yan had accumulated a large fortune, with over 300,000 spirit crystals and more than 20 spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>With his newfound wealth, he could afford to spend a bit.</p><p></p><p>On the way to the Seven Star Academy, Xu Yan deposited his spirit herbs and other items at a celestial treasure pavilion for safekeeping.</p><p></p><p>After a long journey, he finally arrived at the Seven Star Academy, his purpose being to delve into the academy's collection and truly understand the martial arts of the inner world, to refine and integrate them into his own path.</p><p></p><p>Boom! On the first layer of the Seven Star Academy's training platform, a figure was sent flying and crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A student of the Seven Star Academy stood on the platform, fists clasped, saying, "Apologies."</p><p></p><p>The young man who had been knocked down got up, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his expression somewhat dejected, unable to even pass the first layer.</p><p></p><p>"Another failure."</p><p></p><p>"The training platforms of the Seven Star Academy are not easy to overcome, even the first layer is this difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's too hard. I'm among the top talents in my prefecture, but I can't even get past the first layer!"</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists sighed and discussed amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>The challengers who came to test the training platforms were all young, being top talents in their respective regions, full of ambition and confidence before the challenge.</p><p></p><p>But most of them ended up failing at the first layer.</p><p></p><p>"Another challenger has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"This one looks very young, even younger than me. I wonder if he'll be able to get past the first layer."</p><p></p><p>"I doubt it. At his age, he's probably only at the third-grade realm. His martial arts are insufficient, he'll likely not even last ten moves on the first layer!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Yan ascend the platform, the group of young martial artists discussed him dismissively, not expecting much.</p><p></p><p>On the first layer training platform, a Seven Star Academy student stood proudly, awaiting Xu Yan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around and was slightly surprised, "How come there are no master realm experts? The strongest here is only at the first-grade realm."</p><p></p><p>He had already killed many masters, thinking they were everywhere, but now he realized that masters were not actually that common.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like masters aren't as abundant as I thought."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mused to himself, having become accustomed to slaying masters. </p><p></p><p>He had no interest in wasting time on the first layer challenge, as those third-grade realm cultivators were too weak, not even worth a single breath to defeat.</p><p></p><p>So he simply bypassed the first layer platform and continued upwards.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

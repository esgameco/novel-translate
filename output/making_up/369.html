        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Die!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow did not expect this, so when Xu Yan made his move, he instinctively disengaged from his fight with Cheng Zhan, wanting to quickly subdue Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The result, a powerful slash, and the sword light circled within the sword wheel, then counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He charged forward with his bloody red sword, unleashing a powerful killing move.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was unafraid, the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword technique in motion, successively unleashing divine abilities like True Dragon's Wrath, Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers, and the Peerless Heaven Sword, engaging the opponent in fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he felt the same sensation as when he fought the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>When he fought 726 back then, he had broken through to the initial stage of the Divine Ability realm during the battle. This Blood Shadow was slightly weaker than the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>With his initial Divine Ability realm attainment, Xu Yan found this battle easier than the one with the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow was also greatly shocked, his strength clearly superior, yet he could not kill the opponent. He could not even break through the opponent's defenses, each attack seemingly sinking into a quagmire, even being counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" he asked in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Deity Xu Yan!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was using the Blood Shadow to temper himself, to refine his sword dao and divine abilities, to strengthen his own power.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Meng Chong, with his fists and sword, unleashed the terrifying might of the Great Sun Divine Obliteration, almost sweeping them away single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>A flying ship re-emerged from the ravine, hovering in midair.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the battlefield, the cultivators of the Wanlei Sect were now in grave danger, all severely wounded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others acted forcefully, almost single-handedly slaughtering those Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fought alone, comparable to a True King Venerable Blood Shadow, although he was at a disadvantage, even having to dodge at times, he remained undefeated.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword divine ability, he continuously tempered his own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his finger, silently and imperceptibly, a sword intent had already landed on the Blood Shadow fighting Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Pu! In an instant, that Blood Shadow did not even have time to let out a miserable cry before turning to ash and dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was greatly astonished, yet his heart was overjoyed, an extraordinary expert had come to their aid?</p><p></p><p>Pu pu!</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Blood Shadows all turned to ash and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan panted heavily, looking at the extraordinary long ship, his heart shaking, from the Spiritual Realm?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Yan was still in a fierce battle with that Blood Shadow, he moved to go forward and assist, to slay that Blood Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to intervene." </p><p></p><p>A voice entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan took a deep breath, leading the severely wounded cultivators to the Qingqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>He respectfully bowed to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the pale-faced and severely wounded cultivators behind Cheng Zhan, he calmly said, "Heal your wounds."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Meng Shu Shu, Zhou Ying, and Yue'er immediately went forward to attend to the cultivators, diagnosing their injuries and then providing them with medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were dumbfounded, looking at the diagnostic spiritual tools with strange expressions, especially when the medicinal pills entered their mouths, they were instantly shocked to find their injuries rapidly recovering.</p><p></p><p>What kind of healing medicine was this?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" </p><p></p><p>The cultivators were deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank us, this is not free, there is a diagnosis fee to be paid, just give an estimate of the treatment value."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators twitched their mouths, but immediately took out their storage bags, extracting several spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a divine-grade spiritual herb, and there were even a few that surpassed the spiritual herb grade, divine medicines!</p><p></p><p>"Miraculous Reviving, with my severe injuries, to be able to recover six or seven tenths so quickly, is truly incredible. </p><p></p><p>This diagnosis fee, I hope the young lady will not find it lacking, if it is not enough, I am willing to write an IOU, which I will repay in the future!"</p><p></p><p>One of the cultivators said solemnly with a cupped fist.</p><p></p><p>They were all at the Refining Reality Realm, known as True King Venerables in the Divine Realm. With their current injuries, it would likely take half a month or more to recover.</p><p></p><p>But now, in just a short time, they had recovered six or seven tenths, and would fully recover in two or three days.</p><p></p><p>This diagnosis fee, in their eyes, was not too much, but too little!</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's eyes shone brightly, worthy of the Divine Realm, these powerful experts were so generous. Those few spiritual herbs, were they the legendary divine medicines? The Spiritual Realm could not produce divine medicines, divine treasures were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, they were not so uncommon, but these few divine medicines looked extraordinary, definitely not ordinary divine medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Your goodwill is enough, let's just take this diagnosis fee." </p><p></p><p>Yue'er waved to collect the fee, then took out a few small bottles, giving one to each person, saying, "These are healing medicinal pills, take them."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were inwardly excited, they knew the miraculous effects of these medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they were also very curious about why the Spiritual Realm would have such powerful experts and miraculous healing medicines, but they dared not ask out loud, so they quietly looked towards Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Here, with Cheng Zhan as the leader.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow fighting Xu Yan was now filled with fear, no longer wanting to fight, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>But before he could get far, a large hand grabbed him and pulled him back.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Yan, using the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand to grab the Blood Shadow back.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat there calmly, not in a hurry to ask Cheng Zhan some questions, but focused on observing the battles of Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong finished killing the last one, he looked up at the True King Blood Shadow still fiercely battling his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, I will assist you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong soared into the air, his form shrinking to normal size, the boundless divine tide covering his body, holding his sword as he charged forward.</p><p></p><p>"Today, we brothers will slay the True King Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao laughed loudly, the myriad of soldiers flying out from his armory, the Heavenly Earthly Mysterious Formation appearing, instantly enveloping the Blood Shadow.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought for a moment, ultimately not intervening, but returning to the Qingqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Crimson Cat let out a roar and charged forward.</p><p></p><p>But in no time, it was knocked down from the sky, crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, its skin was thick and its defense strong, although uninjured, that blow still hurt it, making it bare its teeth in pain.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, the Crimson Cat deflated, turning into a chubby cat, first going to Li Xuan's feet to curry favor, then coming to Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>It let out pitiful meows, indicating it was injured and wanted medicinal pills to heal!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Cheng Zhan and the others momentarily did not know what to feel, why did they always feel that the people here were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's so unusual? The battle in the distance was becoming increasingly fierce. It was three against one, and that Blood Shadow wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Surging Tide was immeasurable, and his defense was unparalleled. He was not the least bit afraid of the opponent's attacks, fully demonstrating the ferocity and domineering nature of his physical body. What was even more terrifying was that under the containment of Fang Hao and Xu Yan, Meng Chong directly closed in for close-quarters combat!</p><p></p><p>While the Blood Shadow's strength was indeed formidable, his physical body was far inferior to Meng Chong's. Once it came to close-quarters combat, the Blood Shadow was completely on the defensive, being beaten until his skin was torn and his flesh was shredded.</p><p></p><p>The outcome had already been determined.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently. His three disciples were all very powerful, each with their own strengths. Fang Hao's mystical techniques had also displayed their tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>That Blood Shadow's strength was undoubtedly much greater than any of them individually, but he was unable to break through Xu Yan's defenses, dooming him to ultimately perish!</p><p></p><p>"An early or mid-stage True Monarch Celestial cannot break through Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword, which means that Xu Yan is invincible against ordinary True Monarch Celestials.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's physical body is so formidable, and he also has the Surging Tide technique, so an early-stage True Monarch Celestial cannot inflict any real harm on him.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao, relying on the Heaven and Earth Odd Techniques and formations, is also unafraid of early-stage True Monarch Celestials."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan assessed the strengths of his three disciples.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary True Monarch Celestials cannot pose a threat to Xu Yan's three.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Cheng Zhan, and he could learn about the situation in the Divine Realm from this person.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" Cheng Zhan respectfully bowed and asked cautiously, "May I ask if you are from the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was deeply puzzled in his heart. How could the Spirit Realm have such a powerful expert? A Deathless Celestial? Just now, he had already seen that behind this mysterious boat, there were cultivators from the Thundercloud Mountain Villa of the Spirit Realm, which was a subordinate sect of the Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, there were spirit body geniuses, which must be the ones cultivated by the Thundercloud Mountain Villa this time. Therefore, he could be certain that these people all came from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes and no," Li Xuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was taken aback. Yes and no?</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, but did not dare to ask further, so he respectfully said, "May I ask, senior, how is the Spirit Realm doing?"</p><p></p><p>After all, the collapse of the Divine Bridge and the death of the elders going to the Spirit Realm meant that the Spirit Realm had encountered a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is fine," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan wanted to ask what had happened in the Spirit Realm, why the Infernal Abyss Celestial Cavern had appeared in the Spirit Realm, and who had killed that elder. However, he felt that he was not qualified enough to inquire about such trivial matters from the senior.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Cheng Zhan did not continue to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently nodded in his heart. This guy still had a sense of propriety, so he asked in a calm tone, "Tell me, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>He was naturally asking about the current situation in the Divine Realm's Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and the others also looked over.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, where powerful experts were numerous, was actually in such chaos, seeming to be beaten into a sorry state, not even as good as the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were also very curious about what had happened, what kind of enemy they were facing.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's heart stirred. This senior must have gone to the Spirit Realm to seclude himself, and had only now returned to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for why he went to the Spirit Realm, which had relatively sparse spiritual energy, to seclude himself, Cheng Zhan could only speculate that powerful experts might have some special preferences, or that their state of mind was something that weak people like them could not understand.</p><p></p><p>At present, the Qinghua Realm was facing a severe crisis. All the major Celestial Caverns were in danger of being lost, and within the Qinghua Realm, the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master had broken through to the Deathless Celestial realm, causing a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Although he was now being contained by a Deathless Celestial, the other Deathless Celestials had to guard the Celestial Caverns to prevent the Infernal Abyss Blood Spawn from breaking out.</p><p></p><p>If the Qinghua Realm had one more Deathless Celestial at this moment, it would be enough to change the situation and pacify the chaos, even to the point of joining forces with another Deathless Celestial to kill the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master! Cheng Zhan's eyes revealed a hopeful look, and his expression became even more respectful. "To report to the senior, the Qinghua Realm is currently facing the ravages of the Infernal Abyss Celestial Caverns..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thunderous sound rang out, followed by a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>That Blood Shadow finally could not hold on any longer and was punched through the chest by Meng Chong. Xu Yan seized the opportunity to strike with his sword, instantly slaying the opponent.</p><p></p><p>In the thunderous sound, that Blood Shadow was completely annihilated and turned to ashes in an instant! Cheng Zhan watched with a heart full of fear and awe. Although that Blood Shadow had been greatly consumed by the prolonged battle with him, Xu Yan's three had defeated a stronger opponent against the odds, which was extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>What geniuses they were! And he felt that the martial arts practiced by Xu Yan's three seemed unusual, with some differences from the martial arts of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he did not dwell on it too much, after all, a Deathless Celestial possessed unique martial arts, and it was not an unbelievable thing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's three had returned, with an air of lingering satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, satisfied with the performance of his three disciples.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Cheng Zhan, he gestured for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"...The Qinghua Realm has three major Infernal Abyss Celestial Caverns, each with a Deathless Celestial guarding it. And every so often, a great battle will erupt, and the cultivators of the Qinghua Realm take pride in entering the Celestial Caverns to slay the Blood Servants and Blood Slaves, and also to obtain cultivation resources from this..."</p><p></p><p>As Cheng Zhan described, the others gained a more comprehensive understanding of the current situation in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Chaos! The Qinghua Realm was in great chaos, even on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Great Yue Nation, which had almost fallen, with Blood Slaves rampaging and Blood Servants slaughtering everywhere, sacrificing city after city, with extremely heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Martial Gate and the Myriad Thunder Sect were now unable to seek aid, and could only defend their own territories.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm had numerous Celestial Caverns, both large and small. Some had already become ruins and no longer posed a threat, while others contained Blood Servants and Blood Slaves, always ready to invade.</p><p></p><p>And the three major Celestial Caverns, each had a Infernal Abyss Blood Spawn lurking, each one a existence comparable to a Deathless Celestial, extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Infernal Abyss? How did the Celestial Caverns come about? Can they only passively defend and not counterattack?" Xu Yan asked the questions on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, he still did not fully understand what the Infernal Abyss was, or where the Infernal Abyss Blood Servants came from.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan paused for a moment, but then realized that the senior had probably not told his disciples about the Celestial Caverns, so Xu Yan did not understand.</p><p></p><p>He then explained, "The Infernal Abyss is rumored to be outside the heavens and earth, always wanting to invade and devour this world. The Infernal Abyss Blood Servants are the cultivators of the Infernal Abyss, divided by strength into True Monarch Celestial realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Slaves are Infernal Abyss cultivators below the Refined Law Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are also Blood Slaves that are from our Divine Realm cultivators. They have betrayed us and accepted the infusion of Infernal Abyss blood, becoming bloodthirsty Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Some Blood Servants have also fallen from Divine Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Servants have no names, only numbered titles, while only the Blood Spawns have names..."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan began to explain the rumors about the Infernal Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

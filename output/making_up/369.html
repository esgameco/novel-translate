        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>That blood shadow had not anticipated this, so when Xu Yan struck, he quickly disengaged from his battle with Cheng Zhan, intending to swiftly subdue Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when the powerful sword strike came down, the blade light circled once within the sword wheel, then counterattacked back.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>That blood shadow was extremely astonished. </p><p></p><p>Raising his blade, a crimson blade light shone as he immediately unleashed a powerful killing move.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained fearless, activating the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword. Divine skills like True Dragon's Fury, Sword Mountain River, and Heaven-Defying Sword were used in succession as he engaged in fierce combat with his opponent.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he felt the sensation of battling the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Back when fighting the 726 Blood Disciple, he had broken through to the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Skill realm during battle. This blood shadow's strength was somewhat weaker compared to the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>At the small accomplishment stage of Divine Skill realm, Xu Yan found fighting this opponent a bit easier than battling the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>That blood shadow was also quite shocked. His strength was clearly greater than his opponent's, so why couldn't he kill him?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even break through his opponent's defense. Every attack seemed to sink into a quagmire, and would even be counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" he demanded with a gloomy gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan!" Xu Yan replied coldly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was using the blood shadow to temper himself, honing his sword techniques and divine skills to strengthen his own power.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Meng Chong's fists and blade unleashed the terrifying might of the Great Sun God Annihilation, almost completely dominating the fight.</p><p></p><p>A flying ship re-emerged from the canyon, hovering in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the battlefield. The Wanlei Sect martial artists were now in grave danger, all having suffered serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others attacked forcefully, slaughtering those blood shadows in an almost one-sided massacre.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fought alone against a blood shadow comparable to a True King Celestial Lord. Though at a disadvantage and sometimes having to dodge, he remained undefeated.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword divine skill, he continuously used this to temper his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his finger, silently and imperceptibly, a sword intent had already landed on the blood shadow fighting Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Puff! In an instant, that blood shadow didn't even have time to let out a miserable scream before turning to ash and dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was stunned, but at the same time overjoyed in his heart. A supreme expert had come to their aid?</p><p></p><p>Puff puff!</p><p></p><p>The remaining blood shadows all turned to ash and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan panted heavily as he looked towards that extraordinary long ship, startled in his heart. They came from the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan still battling that blood shadow, he moved to assist and kill the blood shadow.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to intervene."</p><p></p><p>A voice transmitted into his ear.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan took a deep breath and led the few severely injured martial artists to the Changqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the senior for saving our lives!" he said respectfully, bowing to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pale-faced, gravely injured people behind Cheng Zhan, he said calmly, "Treat your wounds."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Meng Shushu, Zhou Ying and Yue'er immediately came forward to attend to the martial artists, diagnosing their injuries and then providing medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were dumbfounded, looking at the diagnostic spirit tools with strange expressions. Especially when they took the pills, they felt their injuries rapidly recovering, which left them extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>What kind of healing medicine was this?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much!" the martial artists said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"No need for thanks, this isn't free. You still need to pay the consultation fee. Just name a price for what you think the treatment is worth," Yue'er said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The corners of the martial artists' mouths twitched, but they then took out their storage bags and retrieved several spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a divine-grade spirit herb, and there were even a few that surpassed the spirit herb grade - divine medicines!</p><p></p><p>"Such miraculous healing! My injuries were so severe, yet they've recovered 60-70% so quickly. It's truly incredible. </p><p></p><p>This small consultation fee, I hope the young miss doesn't find it too meager. If it's not enough, I'm willing to write an IOU and will certainly pay the rest in the future!" one martial artist said solemnly, cupping his fists.</p><p></p><p>They were all at the Tempering Truth realm, known as True King Celestial Lords in the Divine Realm. With injuries like theirs, it would normally take over half a month to recover.</p><p></p><p>Now, in such a short time, they had recovered 60-70%. To fully recover to peak condition would only take 2-3 days at most.</p><p></p><p>This consultation fee, in their view, wasn't too much - it was too little!</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's eyes lit up. As expected of the Divine Realm, these experts were so generous. Those few herbs were the legendary divine medicines, right? The Spirit Realm couldn't produce divine medicines, and even divine objects were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, they weren't so uncommon, but these few divine medicines were clearly extraordinary, definitely not ordinary divine medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Your sentiment is enough. I'll just take this consultation fee." Yue'er waved her hand to collect the fee, then took out a few small bottles and gave one to each person, saying, "These contain healing pills. Take them."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were extremely excited in their hearts, knowing the miraculous effects of these pills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they were now also very curious why there were such powerful experts from the Spirit Realm? And how they had such miraculous healing medicines? But they didn't dare to ask, so they quietly looked towards Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Here, Cheng Zhan was the leader.</p><p></p><p>The blood shadow fighting Xu Yan was now terrified in his heart and no longer wished to continue fighting, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could escape far, a large hand grabbed him and pulled him back.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Yan who had used the Great Plucking Hand to grab the blood shadow back.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat calmly, in no hurry to question Cheng Zhan about some matters, but instead focused on watching the battle between Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong killed the last person, he looked up at the True King blood shadow still fiercely battling his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, let me assist you!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong soared into the air, his body beginning to shrink back to normal size. Divine waves covered his body as he wielded his blade and attacked.</p><p></p><p>"Today, we brothers will slay a True King Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao laughed loudly. From his weapon box, myriad weapons flew out. The Heavenly Earth Wondrous Gate formation appeared, and a great array activated, instantly enveloping that blood shadow.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought for a moment, but ultimately didn't join the fight, instead returning to the Changqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The red cat let out a roar and attacked.</p><p></p><p>But after a short while, it was beaten and fell from mid-air, crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, its skin was thick and tough, with extremely strong defense. Though uninjured, that fall still hurt enough to make it grimace.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, the red cat deflated, turning into a small fat cat and returning to the Changqing Pavilion. It first acted cute at Li Xuan's feet, then came before Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!" </p><p></p><p>It let out pitiful meows, indicating it was injured and needed medicine to heal!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Cheng Zhan and the others didn't know what to feel. Why did they get the sense that the people here all had...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Something unusual? The battle not far away was becoming more intense. With three against one, that Blood Shadow wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Divine Waves were immeasurable, and his defense was unparalleled. He wasn't afraid of the opponent's attacks at all, fully displaying the ferocity and dominance of his physical body. Even more terrifying was that under Fang Hao and Xu Yan's containment, Meng Chong directly closed in for close combat!</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood Shadow's strength was formidable, his physical body was far inferior to Meng Chong's. Once in close combat, the Blood Shadow was at a disadvantage everywhere, getting beaten until his skin split and flesh tore.</p><p></p><p>The outcome was already decided.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently. His three disciples were all very strong in combat, each with their own strengths. Fang Hao's mystical techniques also demonstrated great power.</p><p></p><p>Although that Blood Shadow's strength far surpassed any one of Xu Yan and the others, he was unable to break through the defense of the three of them, which meant he was destined to fall in the end!</p><p></p><p>"An early or mid-stage True King Celestial Lord cannot break through Xu Yan's Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword. This means Xu Yan is undefeatable against ordinary True King Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's physical body is formidable, and he also has the Divine Waves technique. Early-stage True King Celestial Lords cannot inflict much damage on him.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao relies on mystical techniques and formations, and is also not afraid of early-stage True King Celestial Lords."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made judgments about the strength of his three disciples.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary True King Celestial Lords posed no threat to Xu Yan and the other two.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Cheng Zhan, from whom he could learn about the situation in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan bowed respectfully and cautiously asked, "May I ask if senior is from the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was very puzzled in his heart. How could there be such a strong expert from the Spirit Realm? An Immortal Celestial Lord? He had already seen earlier that behind this mysterious ship were cultivators from the Thunder Cloud Manor of the Spirit Realm, which was a subordinate sect of the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd were spirit body geniuses, who must have been cultivated by the Thunder Cloud Manor this time. Therefore, it could be confirmed that these people all came from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and no," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was stunned. Yes and no?</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled in his heart, but didn't dare to ask further. So he respectfully said, "May I ask senior, how is the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>After all, with the collapse of the divine bridge and the death of the elder who went to the Spirit Realm, it meant that a great disaster had occurred in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is fine," Li Xuan said in a flat tone.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan wanted to ask what exactly had happened in the Spirit Realm, why the Netherworld Abyss had appeared there, and who had killed that elder.</p><p></p><p>But on second thought, he realized he might not be qualified to ask the senior about such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Cheng Zhan didn't continue to ask further.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly, thinking this Cheng Zhan fellow knew his place. So he asked in a calm tone, "Tell me, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>What he was asking about, of course, was the current situation in the Qinghua Border of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others all looked over as well.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, with its numerous powerful martial artists, was actually in such chaos, as if beaten badly by enemies, not even as good as the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were also very curious about what changes had occurred and what kind of enemies they were facing.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's heart stirred, thinking this senior must have gone to the Spirit Realm to live in seclusion, and was only now returning to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for why he went to live in seclusion in the Spirit Realm where spiritual energy was relatively scarce, one could only speculate that powerful experts all had some special preferences, or that the mindset of experts was not something that weak people like them could understand.</p><p></p><p>Currently the Qinghua Border was facing a severe crisis, with various great abysses nearly falling. Within the Qinghua Border, the Blood Shadow Tower Master had broken through to become an Immortal Celestial Lord, creating quite a calamity.</p><p></p><p>Although he was now being contained by an Immortal Celestial Lord, the other Immortal Celestial Lords all had to guard the abysses to prevent the Netherworld Blood Scions from breaking out.</p><p></p><p>If the Qinghua Border had one more Immortal Celestial Lord at this moment, it would be enough to change the situation and stabilize the chaos.</p><p></p><p>They could even join forces with another Immortal Celestial Lord to kill the Blood Shadow Tower Master! A look of expectation appeared in Cheng Zhan's eyes. He took a deep breath, his expression becoming even more respectful, "In response to senior, the Qinghua Border is currently facing the ravages of the Netherworld Abyss..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, with a loud boom, a scream was heard.</p><p></p><p>That Blood Shadow finally couldn't hold on any longer. Meng Chong's fist punched through his chest, and Xu Yan took the opportunity to slash down with his sword, instantly killing the opponent.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous sound, that Blood Shadow was completely annihilated in an instant, disintegrating into ashes! Cheng Zhan watched with shock and fear. Although that Blood Shadow had consumed a lot of energy from fighting him for a long time, Xu Yan and the other two had still defeated a stronger enemy from a disadvantaged position, which was extremely astonishing.</p><p></p><p>What incredible geniuses they were! Moreover, he felt that the martial arts used by Xu Yan and the other two seemed unusual, with significant differences from the martial arts of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't think too deeply about it. After all, it wasn't inconceivable for an Immortal Celestial Lord to possess unique martial arts. It only showed that this expert's martial arts were one of a kind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other two returned, looking as if they still hadn't had enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, satisfied with the performance of his three disciples.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Cheng Zhan, gesturing for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"...The Qinghua Border has three great Netherworld Abysses. Each abyss has an Immortal Celestial Lord guarding it. Moreover, a great battle erupts every once in a while. The cultivators of the Qinghua Border take pride in entering the abysses to kill Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves, and also obtain martial resources through this..."</p><p></p><p>As Cheng Zhan narrated, everyone gained a more comprehensive understanding of the current situation in the Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>Chaos! The Qinghua Border was in great chaos, even on the verge of falling.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Great Yue Kingdom, which had almost fallen. Blood Slaves were rampant, Blood Disciples were killing everywhere, sacrificing one city after another, with extremely heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Martial Gate and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect were now powerless to seek help, and could only defend their own territories.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Border, there were many abysses of various sizes. Some abysses had already become ruins and no longer posed a threat, while others contained Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves, ready to invade at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the three great abysses, each had Netherworld Blood Scions eyeing them covetously. Each Netherworld Blood Scion was a being comparable to an Immortal Celestial Lord, extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Netherworld? How did the abysses come to be? Can they only defend passively without thinking of counterattacking?" Xu Yan voiced his confusion.</p><p></p><p>Until now, what the Netherworld was and where the Netherworld Blood Disciples came from were all vague and unclear.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was stunned for a moment, but then realized that Xu Yan was young, and the senior probably hadn't told his disciple about the abysses, which was why he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>So he began to explain, "The Netherworld, according to legend, exists outside of this world and has always wanted to invade and devour this world. The Netherworld Blood Disciples are cultivators from the Netherworld, classified according to their strength, equivalent to the True King Celestial Lord realm. Blood Slaves are Netherworld cultivators below the Condensed Law Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, some Blood Slaves also come from cultivators of our Divine Realm who betrayed us and accepted the infusion of Netherworld blood essence, turning into bloodthirsty Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Some Blood Disciples also come from fallen Divine Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Disciples don't have names, only numerical designations. Only Blood Scions have names..."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan began to explain the legends about the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

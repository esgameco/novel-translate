        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the divine abilities realm, the confident Li Xuan was in a great mood. He then summoned the Crimson Cat and instructed it on the demonic martial dao, how to refine the demonic spiritual essence, and how to cultivate the demonic divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>After instructing the Crimson Cat, the delighted Li Xuan raised his hand and used a demonic technique to impart the demonic martial dao to Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well and break through soon!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was extremely excited and hurriedly kowtowed to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>He had already obtained the demonic martial dao from the Crimson Cat, but found it difficult to comprehend. Under the Crimson Cat's guidance, he had just about grasped the basics.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan directly used the demonic technique to impart the demonic dao into Yu Xiaolong's consciousness, allowing him to instantly comprehend the cultivation of the demonic martial dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yu Xiaolong was not an ordinary beast, as his spiritual intelligence had already awakened. Under Li Xuan's demonic technique, he was naturally able to quickly comprehend the demonic dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also used the demonic technique to impart the demonic dao to Xiao Ha.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Crimson Cat felt some pressure, fearing that Yu Xiaolong and Xiao Ha would surpass it. As the rightful Demonic King, it could not allow its juniors to exceed it.</p><p></p><p>So it cultivated even more diligently, slightly relieved that Yu Xiaolong and Xiao Ha's cultivation speed was still slower than its own.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat then became arrogant again, going to poke at Yu Xiaolong, flaunting its might as the Demonic King.</p><p></p><p>Then, it extended a paw and slapped Xiao Ha to the ground with a "croak!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Ha let out a light cry.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat was satisfied, as this frog recognized it as the true king from the bottom of its heart. After flaunting its might, the Crimson Cat did not forget to act cute and sweet in front of its master, then went to flatter Suling Xiu, maintaining its image as the mighty Demonic King on the outside, but a cute and chubby cat on the inside.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, his fat tiger had truly become a spiritual being!</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the divine abilities realm, Xu Yanming was greatly invigorated, as he had already mastered the martial dao cultivation method, only needing to cultivate and enhance his strength.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended the divine spiritual and divine abilities realms, I must strive to break through the divine will realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the divine will realm, he would need to ponder how to accumulate a solid foundation to prepare for the breakthrough to the divine spiritual realm and his own transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures of the Yushen Sect, the Shu family, and the Dai family are indeed plentiful, and my junior sister has also refined many elixirs. However, to accumulate a solid foundation for the breakthrough to the divine spiritual realm, it may still be lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Especially high-grade treasures or those with unique divine effects, I will need to go out and search for them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming had already started planning for the accumulation of his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The resources he currently had were indeed abundant, but to fully complete his own foundation and break through the divine spiritual realm, it was still not enough. What he lacked the most were treasures with special divine effects.</p><p></p><p>"The higher the realm, the more one needs to accumulate a solid foundation, and the higher the grade of spiritual items required, even needing some spiritual herbs with special effects.</p><p></p><p>"But the spiritual domain is so vast, and there are so many powerful sects, accumulating a foundation should not be too difficult, it's just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming decided that after breaking through the divine will realm, he would leave Yuzhou and venture to the other states to prepare for the accumulation of his foundation.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yuzhou was the weakest and most prosperous of the eighteen states in the spiritual domain, naturally the home of the supreme sects.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering the martial dao cannot be lacking, Luo Xinting is too weak, not enough to temper the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming inwardly planned, his future opponents would have to be at the refining spirit realm before he would even spare them a glance, no matter how talented they were!</p><p></p><p>In the manor, it was like a secluded paradise, undisturbed by the outside world.</p><p></p><p>After settling her grandfather, Yue'er hurriedly searched for Xu Yanming's whereabouts, but had been unable to find him these past days.</p><p></p><p>Now, how should she continue the search?</p><p></p><p>"Could Xu Yanming be hiding in the capital of Zheng State, or somewhere near it?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was anxious, according to her grandfather's words, the strongest experts of the Qianwu Palace would soon arrive in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yanming, hurry and escape, the strongest experts are coming to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was left with no choice, she could only continue searching while loudly calling out.</p><p></p><p>Her idea was simple, if Xu Yanming was still paying attention to the outside news, her loud calls would surely reach his ears.</p><p></p><p>Searching and calling out all the way from the capital of Zheng State, Yue'er's expression became increasingly anxious. This way of searching also risked exposing her and her grandfather's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't find him tomorrow, I'll have to stop, or else we'll be targeted and be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>She just hoped that Xu Yanming could get the news, so she kept calling out along the way. Many martial artists in the capital of Zheng State naturally heard her.</p><p></p><p>They were greatly astonished, the strongest experts were coming to kill Xu Yanming?</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual domain, those who could be called the strongest experts were undoubtedly the powerful figures of the supreme sects.</p><p></p><p>Which supreme sect's strongest expert had made a move? Since it was a supreme sect's strongest expert, how could Xu Yanming escape? Even those behind him would surely perish.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the battle of geniuses, where the great momentum descended like a dragon, had shocked and amazed all the onlooking martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, in their fixed mindset, the strongest experts of the supreme sects were invincible, true supreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in everyone's eyes, no matter how strong Xu Yanming's master was, they would be no match for the strongest expert.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yanming, hurry and escape, flee to the Azure Sea, that's your only chance of survival, the strongest expert will be here soon to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's figure flew past the manor from a distance, her voice echoing far and wide.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the manor was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming's figure instantly disappeared from the manor.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, was that the young lady?</p><p></p><p>"The strongest expert is coming to kill Xu Yanming? Which supreme sect has made a move? Bullying the weak, huh? He just broke through the divine abilities realm, perfect to test the might of my divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan coldly chuckled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, seeing Yue'er calling out so loudly to search for Xu Yanming, he even suspected that the arrival of the strongest expert was just an excuse.</p><p></p><p>To lure Xu Yanming out?</p><p></p><p>"Could this young lady have developed feelings for Xu Yanming?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought strangely.</p><p></p><p>His senior disciple was handsome and had monstrous talent, it was not surprising that he could captivate such a young lady.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was about to go to the next big city when a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"You were looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming asked Yue'er.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yanming!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er was overjoyed, Xu Yanming had appeared too quickly, she was a bit distracted and almost stumbled into his embrace, but managed to stabilize herself in time.</p><p></p><p>However, she was only a foot away from Xu Yanming.</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming nodded. "What did you come find me for? The strongest expert is coming to kill me, how did you get this news?"</p><p></p><p>"It was my grandfather who said it, the strongest expert of the Qianwu Palace is coming to seize your sword dao, even shamefully claiming that your master stole the Qianwu Palace's secret techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanming heard this and was furious. "The Qianwu Palace, huh? Good, good, good, I, Xu Yanming, will remember this. So shameless, eh? I'll use the Qianwu Palace as a stepping stone to reach the peak of the spiritual domain!</p><p></p><p>"I'll destroy the Qianwu Palace, let's see if they're still shameless or not!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er: ...</p><p></p><p>That's the supreme sect, has Xu Yanming already gone mad enough to use the supreme sect as a stepping stone?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But this madman has quite a lot of charm!" Xu Yan said. "The Chongwu Palace is a supreme spiritual sect, with extremely powerful experts. The supreme experts of the Chongwu Palace are not something that you and your master can contend with. You should flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Retreating to the vast blue sea is the only chance you have at survival!"</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan's madness made her heart flutter, she still tried to persuade Xu Yan to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Flee? Ridiculous!" Xu Yan sneered. Even though he was no match for the supreme expert, in front of his master, they were merely insignificant insects.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not Yue'er's fault, as she was an outsider and did not know the true strength of Xu Yan's master, whose existence was close to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where is your grandfather? Why haven't I seen him come?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Yue'er had come with good intentions to deliver the news, so he should express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's expression darkened as she replied, "My grandfather is seriously injured, very, very seriously. He may not have much time left!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Yue'er's eyes reddened. With her grandfather's death, she would have no more family in this world, no one to rely on.</p><p></p><p>"Injured? Bring your grandfather here, my disciple sister can treat him!" Xu Yan said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible, my grandfather's injury has reached his very foundation, it cannot be healed," Yue'er said sadly.</p><p></p><p>"Others may not be able to treat him, but my disciple sister can. Bring your grandfather here, don't worry, any so-called supreme expert is nothing!" </p><p></p><p>Since Yue'er's grandfather was so seriously injured, and she had come to inform them, Xu Yan felt that he should lend a hand, since they were in need.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's cultivation was in the Pill Dao Martial Dao, and she had never treated such a severe injury, especially for a powerful martial artist. This would be a good opportunity for her to display her skills and gain more experience in pill medicine.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let me ask my grandfather," Yue'er said, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait for you here!" Xu Yan said, thinking it over. He couldn't let his guard down, in case it was a trap. For safety's sake, he decided to wait here. This place was close to the manor, so even if a powerful expert came, his master could immediately intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Yue'er nodded and swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>At Moon Bright's hiding place, not far from the capital of Zheng Kingdom, Yue'er hurriedly returned and said, "Grandfather, I've found Xu Yan. He said he can treat your injuries."</p><p></p><p>Moon Bright gave a bitter smile and said, "My injuries cannot be healed. Black Liang will soon arrive in Yuzhou. What do you think, should we try to escape with Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er thought for a moment and replied, "Xu Yan won't flee. His master is probably very strong, and not afraid of the supreme expert."</p><p></p><p>Moon Bright furrowed his brow and sighed, "I know his master's strength is formidable, but he may not know the terrifying power of the supreme experts of the Chongwu Palace."</p><p></p><p>He paused, then said, "Alright, let's go see him. I'll tell him about the might of the Chongwu Palace's supreme experts."</p><p></p><p>With great effort, he stood up. His aura was extremely weak, his face deathly pale, as if he could collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's eyes reddened, and she silently swore to avenge her grandfather. Supporting him, they left the hiding place and arrived before Xu Yan after a while.</p><p></p><p>"The injury is indeed quite serious," Xu Yan remarked, inwardly shocked upon seeing Moon Bright's condition. This injury was so severe, yet Moon Bright could still hang on for a few more years, which amazed him.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu Yan, this old man's injuries are hopeless. However, I still want to advise you to flee quickly. The might of the supreme experts cannot be underestimated!" Moon Bright said, panting.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. Come with me, your injuries, though severe, may not be incurable!" Xu Yan said without further ado. </p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the supreme experts of the Chongwu Palace were invincible, only because they did not know the true strength of Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Moon Bright could only think that he would try to persuade Xu Yan again after meeting his master.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er supported her grandfather and followed behind Xu Yan. Soon, they arrived at a dense forest, and after Xu Yan descended, they entered a manor. </p><p></p><p>Yue'er was greatly surprised, as there had been no manor visible from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a simple formation," Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Formation?" Moon Bright murmured to himself, never having heard of such a thing. He was even more in awe of Xu Yan's mysterious master's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his master could truly match the supreme experts of the Chongwu Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Disciple sister, come take a look and see if you can heal him," Xu Yan said as they entered the manor. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up and couldn't help but exclaim. This old man was in a truly miserable state. When he had first seen him, the old man had some physical flaws, which were likely old injuries. </p><p></p><p>But now, his special physique had completely collapsed, and the injuries had reached his very foundation. It was amazing that he could still live for a few more years.</p><p></p><p>"His spiritual body is gone!" Li Xuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Yue'er, he realized this girl had remarkable natural talent. Her spiritual body talent was exceptional, and the cultivation method she practiced was also extraordinary. Her strength was even greater than Luo Xinting's.</p><p></p><p>"This injury is extremely severe, it has reached his foundation!" Su Lingxiu said, her face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>In her cultivation of the Pill Dao Martial Dao, she finally had the chance to display her skills.</p><p></p><p>"However, the problem is not too big. I can heal him, it's just that his..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu paused, unsure how to describe Moon Bright's condition.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke up at this time: "His spiritual body has collapsed, his foundation is completely lost."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded: "Yes, the special physique's talent has collapsed, the foundation is lost. Restoring it will be quite difficult."</p><p></p><p>Moon Bright was greatly shocked. His injuries could be healed? And his lost spiritual body and foundation could even be restored, though with some difficulty?</p><p></p><p>He was filled with disbelief, feeling that they were boasting.</p><p></p><p>But Yue'er was overjoyed. Grabbing Su Lingxiu's hands, she exclaimed excitedly, "Sister, can my grandfather really be healed?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Su Lingxiu said proudly. "As long as he's not dead, he can be healed!"</p><p></p><p>"That's wonderful, that's wonderful! Thank you, Brother Xu Yan, thank you, sister!" Yue'er cried tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Moon Bright looked at Li Xuan and said, "The supreme expert of the Chongwu Palace, Black Liang, is on his way to Yuzhou. I think it's best we lay low for now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly, "It's no problem, they are mere insects!"</p><p></p><p>Moon Bright: ...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood the source of Xu Yan's madness - it came from his master, who was even more unrestrained! They were of the same lineage.</p><p></p><p>And now, Moon Bright felt somewhat complex. An insignificant insect had injured him so severely, so what did that make him? Less than an insect?</p><p></p><p>He had originally intended to persuade them to flee, but the result was - they weren't afraid at all, even viewing the supreme expert as an insect. This left him unsure of how to continue persuading them.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

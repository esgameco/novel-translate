        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It was a gift bestowed upon me by the senior."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér said with a look of honor.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was shocked beyond measure, "The power of the laws of heaven and earth can also be bestowed upon people?" "It's nothing worth mentioning," Li Xuan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the power of the laws of heaven and earth was gathered and condensed into numerous law pills, which he casually tossed onto the table. </p><p></p><p>He said indifferently, "If you need them, just take them!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was so stunned that she couldn't speak. She casually sifted through them, and these law pills refined from the laws of heaven and earth, what a remarkable feat!</p><p></p><p>"I dare not accept the senior's generous gift."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou calmed her shocked emotions and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, Xin Mengrou's character was not bad, but Cai Lingér was quite different, her eyes were glued to the law pills on the table without blinking.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come here, there's no need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, thank you very much for your generosity, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou pondered for a moment and took two law pills, saying, "Two is enough!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, and with a wave of his hand, he tossed the remaining law pills to Su Lingxiu, letting his disciple study them slowly.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér had a disappointed look on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Greed leads to ruin!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Cai Lingér was being greedy."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér lowered her head in shame.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou pondered for a moment and respectfully asked, "May I ask the senior for guidance on my martial cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>She had already reached the peak of the Spirit Realm, and wanted to break through to the next level, but it was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, with the law pills, she was closer to the next realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled slightly and said, "When it is a dream, it is a dream, when it is a dream, it is also not a dream, the illusory is reality, and reality is illusory, like an illusion, like the truth, it is a dream but not a dream, it is true but not true..."</p><p></p><p>After a series of profound instructions, Li Xuan finally said to the pensive and somewhat bewildered Xin Mengrou, "If you can comprehend the profundity of this, you can forge your own path, breaking free from the constraints of the martial arts you cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, you can be considered the patriarch of a certain Dao."</p><p></p><p>As for whether Xin Mengrou could achieve this, Li Xuan didn't care. If she could, it would be thanks to the guidance of this eminent person; if she couldn't, it would be because her comprehension was lacking and she couldn't grasp the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he wouldn't lose anything, and could still display the bearing of a great figure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his profound instructions were not without basis, there was some underlying theory.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was deeply shocked, the more she pondered, the more she felt that the senior's guidance was profoundly extraordinary, as if it contained the ultimate truths of heaven and earth. If she could truly comprehend it, she might be able to forge her own martial path.</p><p></p><p>"The martial art I cultivate is the Taixuan Divine Art, which has been successfully cultivated by only a few throughout history, and I am the only one in the Taixuan Sect in the past ten thousand years who has succeeded in cultivating it...</p><p></p><p>"If I can comprehend the senior's guidance, I will be able to transcend the Taixuan Divine Art and forge a martial path that is comparable to or even surpasses the Taixuan Divine Art."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>She had a lofty status in the Taixuan Sect because she had successfully cultivated the Taixuan Divine Art, this extraordinary martial art.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xin Mengrou stood up and respectfully bowed, "Xin Mengrou thanks the senior for the guidance!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since she was not an enemy, and had the opportunity to come here and witness his eminence, and obtain some opportunities, it was a normal thing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xiu Yuying was Xin Mengrou's bloodline, so they had some connection.</p><p></p><p>Having received the guidance and obtained the law pills, and confirmed that Xu Yan's master was not the Blood Spirit Sect's successor, Xin Mengrou did not linger too long and took her leave.</p><p></p><p>She needed to return to the Taixuan Sect to ponder the senior's guidance!</p><p></p><p>After Xin Mengrou left, Cai Lingér also went back to continue studying and refining the law pills.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun and Su Lingxiu met, and naturally they couldn't avoid catching up. Su Lingxiu introduced Yue'er to each other, and the three women gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued to refine the medicinal pills, but now she had an extra hand, which was Zi Yun.</p><p></p><p>After paying his respects to the master, Meng Chong recounted his experiences and insights in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Evergreen Pavilion, a young man approached.</p><p></p><p>As he appeared, all the cultivators in the queue immediately made way for him.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xiang Mingmao, here to visit the Pill Medicinal Immortal Lady!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Er looked up at the young man, in a purple robe, exuding a noble aura, his seemingly amiable expression still unable to completely conceal his deep-seated arrogance.</p><p></p><p>A genius from the Great Zhou Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party's identity was extraordinary, possibly a prince or royal scion of the Great Zhou, Stone Er didn't care. Su Lingxiu was busy now, how could she have time to see an outsider?</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion Master is not available today, come back another day, next!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's eyes flashed with anger, he, the crown prince of the Purple King lineage, the heir apparent of the Purple King, was actually treated so lightly? However, he did not immediately lose his temper, after all, the Evergreen Pavilion was quite remarkable, so he spoke up again, "Please inform her that the Crown Prince of the Purple King of the Great Zhou has come to visit the Pill Medicinal Immortal Lady."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao had a suppressed anger in his heart, when had he ever begged like this before? "I already said she's not available, not even if the Emperor of Great Zhou came would she see you!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Er rolled his eyes and continued, "Next!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's face immediately turned ashen, and the cultivators behind him were so frightened that they hastily retreated, not daring to step forward. They were also shocked, this manager of the Evergreen Pavilion was too arrogant, openly saying that even the Emperor of Great Zhou would not be seen? This was within the borders of Great Zhou, didn't he fear offending the Imperial Clan?</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man beside Xiang Mingmao immediately roared angrily, "You, a subordinate of the Evergreen Pavilion, dare to be so arrogant? Dare to belittle our Great Zhou Emperor, you have a lot of guts!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The aura of a powerful expert erupted, pressing towards Stone Er.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In front of Stone Er, a layer of radiant light rippled out, with purple lightning swirling around, this was the activation of the defensive formation of the Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The formation of the Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship, although set up by Fang Hao, had also been casually strengthened by Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Even Xin Mengrou could not break through the formation of the Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship, unless the spirit crystals were exhausted and could no longer sustain the formation.</p><p></p><p>Stone Er was calm and composed, suddenly not caring about the other party's outburst, instead he dug in his ear and said, "I'm just telling the truth, even if the Emperor of Great Zhou comes today, he won't be able to see the person. If you think you can cause a ruckus here, feel free to try."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Stone Er finally understood the joy of the strong, like Xu Yan, everyone said he was arrogant, but everyone also acknowledged his strength! "So this is what it feels like to be arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Stone Er sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao and his guards looked at the rippling purple lightning, and their eyes couldn't help but narrow, the rumors about the Evergreen Pavilion being a divine artifact were indeed true.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be rude!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao frowned and looked at</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His guard spoke in an apparently rebuking tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The guard immediately lowered his aura.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Elixir Immortal Lady is not receiving guests today, I will come again tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao smiled and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow? It won't work even if you come tomorrow, as she still won't see outsiders."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao suppressed his anger but did not lash out, and instead asked, "When does the Elixir Immortal Lady have time to receive guests?"</p><p></p><p>"How would I know? I can't decide that!" Shi Er rolled his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This sight almost made Xiang Mingmao lose control of his emotions.</p><p></p><p>He turned around and left with a dark face.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a bad mood today, the Changqing Pavilion is not accepting patients today!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er looked displeased and directly activated the formation to close the reception portal, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he was delighted, "Although I'm not a strong cultivator, I've experienced the joy of the strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's matter was just a small incident, and no one paid attention to it.</p><p></p><p>As Shi Er said, even if the Great Zhou Emperor came, they still wouldn't see Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>The news of Xiang Mingmao being turned away spread in the Small Star Lake, and the Great Zhou cultivators were all waiting to see whether Xiang Mingmao, the Young Master of the Purple King lineage and one of the Great Zhou Imperial prodigies, would swallow this humiliation.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Xiang Mingmao came again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the one receiving him was Meng Shushu, as Shi Er had gone to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xiang Mingmao, the Young Master of the Purple King of the Great Zhou, here to visit the Elixir Immortal Lady."</p><p></p><p>While speaking, he handed over a box.</p><p></p><p>"A small token of sincerity, I hope you will accept it!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu opened the box and glanced at it, seeing a divine-grade spiritual herb, but divine-grade herbs were nothing new to her, so she didn't find it particularly precious.</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion Master is busy refining elixirs today and has no time to receive guests!"</p><p></p><p>While saying this, she took the spiritual herb and took out a small bottle, the kind that only holds a single elixir pill.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Reviving Pill, a healing elixir that can restore even the foundation of Transcendent Cultivators. Considering your sincere offering, I'll sell it to you at a discounted price."</p><p></p><p>Exchanging a divine-grade spiritual herb for a Reviving Pill was already showing great favor to the Great Zhou Imperial House.</p><p></p><p>This was Meng Shushu's thinking.</p><p></p><p>But Xiang Mingmao did not think so, his heart burning with fury. As the Young Master of the Purple King, one of the Great Zhou prodigies, wherever he went, he was always surrounded by admiration, yet he was turned away again!</p><p></p><p>"When will the Elixir Immortal Lady have time to receive guests?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao took a deep breath to calm his raging heart and asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pondered for a moment and said, "She will only receive guests when the Pavilion Master is free from her elixir research. During this time, no one is allowed to disturb her."</p><p></p><p>It was understandable that the Elixir Immortal Lady would not receive guests while researching elixirs.</p><p></p><p>So Xiang Mingmao patiently asked, "When will the Elixir Immortal Lady emerge from her seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>"How would I know? You can come ask every day, whether you can see her or not depends on your luck."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will come again tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao could only leave.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao came again, and this time the one receiving him was Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>"I am..."</p><p></p><p>"No guests allowed!"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Zhou Ying directly interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's face flushed red, his forehead veins bulging, about to lose control of his anger.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Xu Yan returned.</p><p></p><p>He directly stepped into the Changqing Pavilion, and Xiang Mingmao, seeing this, could no longer hold back his fury. "Why can he enter? Yet you keep me, the Young Master, outside. Are you Changqing Pavilion disrespecting my Great Zhou Imperial House?"</p><p></p><p>This was the last straw!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced back, at the Great Zhou Imperial prodigy? His cultivation was not weak, having refined a strand of Heaven and Earth's spiritual essence, but this level of strength was nothing to him now, just a slap could crush him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the interest to attack, turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao was enraged, "What kind of gaze is that? So disdainful, so contemptuous? Your Changqing Pavilion is within the borders of my Great Zhou, how dare you be so arrogant and disrespect my Great Zhou, do you really think..."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's mentality had completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw a beautiful goddess-like young lady hurriedly run out of the Changqing Pavilion, excitedly calling, "Big Brother, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Then he saw another beautiful woman closely following, also excitedly greeting the man.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a figure in purple robes appeared in his sight.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun!</p><p></p><p>The Princess of the Qing King's Mansion, that lowly woman!</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun! Although she is the Princess of the Qing King's Mansion, she is not of the Great Zhou Imperial bloodline, a woman from a lowly place, yet you let her enter the Changqing Pavilion, while rejecting me, a Great Zhou Imperial prodigy. Your Changqing Pavilion is truly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"You are disrespecting my Great Zhou Imperial House, disrespecting my Purple King lineage!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiang Mingmao completely erupted in fury, shouting wildly.</p><p></p><p>In the Changqing Pavilion, Xu Yan had returned, and Su Lingxiu and the others happily came out to welcome him. But then they heard an angry voice raging outside the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun looked up, puzzled, "What is he doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"You know him?" Su Lingxiu asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master of the Purple King of the Great Zhou, he and my Qing King's Mansion don't get along well. That guy is so arrogant, he has often secretly undermined me, saying that people from lowly places like me are not worthy of entering the Great Zhou Imperial House, that I am sullying his Great Zhou and the Qing King's Mansion has fallen."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun had an indignant and disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>"I see, no need to bother with him, let him rave on."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu understood, calling Zhou Ying back and directly activating the formation.</p><p></p><p>Then the siblings and sisters continued their reunion undisturbed, even blocking out the sound.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xiang Mingmao went mad, attacking the Changqing Pavilion airship together with his guard.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu couldn't be bothered to deal with it. There had been people trying to attack the Changqing Pavilion airship before, even a powerful cultivator from a transcendent sect had made a move.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xiang Mingmao attacked, he triggered the defensive formation of the airship, and a purple lightning bolt thundered towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's guard's face changed drastically, his figure moving to block in front of Xiang Mingmao, shouting, "Young Master, quickly escape!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! He unleashed a full-powered strike to block the purple lightning, but his body was now emitting black smoke.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's expression changed drastically, frantically retreating, roaring, "The Changqing Pavilion has the audacity, this is provoking my Great Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another bolt of lightning shot out, the guard roared furiously, exerting his full strength, but was still killed by the lightning strike! The entire Small Star Lake shook, and all the cultivators were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion dared to attack the Purple King's Young Master? This was challenging the Great Zhou Imperial House! Especially on Great Zhou soil, how could the Great Zhou let this go?</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao was also terrified, never expecting that they would be so heedless of his identity and directly try to kill him.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly fled, fearing that if he was delayed even a moment, he would be blasted.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

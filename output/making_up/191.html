        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Azure-Faced Man?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>One of the three great mysterious and powerful forces - the Azure-Faced Man!</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here, sir?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor asked with puzzlement. </p><p></p><p>Since it was not a powerful expert from the Qingqing Pavilion, he felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, are you not resentful and dissatisfied with the Qingqing Pavilion? Perfect, I also have some matters to attend to, we can collaborate. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Azure-Faced Man said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"How shall we collaborate?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Azure-Faced Man looked at him without answering.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor took a deep breath and said, "Please, let's discuss in the Imperial Study."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Yue Emperor is wise!" </p><p></p><p>The Azure-Faced Man smiled and stepped into the Imperial Study.</p><p></p><p>The forces that had previously mobilized peak grand masters to participate in the attack on the Qingqing Pavilion, all had the Azure-Faced Man visit them in secret.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain had become turbulent due to the mysterious Azure-Faced Man.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the discussion on how to convert the inner domain martial arts to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts had just concluded.</p><p></p><p>After research, the general direction of converting to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts had been clarified, but the implementation would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"For those below the First Realm, to convert to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts, the first step is to cultivate the blood qi, and this difficulty is relatively low. If there are blood qi elixirs to assist, along with methods to refine the blood qi, it would not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"However, after the conversion, since the foundation was not solid from the beginning, the strength would be relatively weaker compared to the orthodox Great Wilderness martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan summarized.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's martial art was at the Fourth Realm after conversion, while in the inner domain, the Third Realm was when the martial arts foundation was truly solid. Therefore, conversion at the Fourth Realm was relatively easier.</p><p></p><p>But after the Third Realm, even with the assistance of blood qi elixirs and the refinement of blood qi, the martial arts foundation would be difficult to change, so they would be weaker than the orthodox Great Wilderness martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, they would still be stronger than the inner domain martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, once the conversion method was circulated, many martial artists below the First Realm would want to convert their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But there was a prerequisite - the need for blood qi elixirs. This meant that not all martial artists could convert, as they might not be able to afford the blood qi elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts lies in the mastery of the Heaven-Earth Bridge. Even if one refines the true qi, without the Heaven-Earth Bridge, one cannot be considered a Great Wilderness martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"However, for martial artists at the Grand Master realm, their foundation is already fixed, so they cannot establish the Heaven-Earth Bridge, which is a problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>For Grand Master martial artists to convert, in addition to refining the true qi, the Heaven-Earth Bridge is the key. Without the Heaven-Earth Bridge, they cannot directly absorb the spiritual energy from heaven and earth to refine into true qi.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they can only transform it into the inner domain martial artist's internal martial qi, and then refine it into true qi through cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the other martial arts scholars were not discouraged, but rather excited, "We will continue to research, perhaps we can find an alternative method."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. He would not spend too much time on the conversion method, as he had just broken through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm and had more martial insights to organize.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan guided Xie Lingfeng on sword dao cultivation, such as how to comprehend oneself and how to attain sword heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>Whether Xie Lingfeng could ultimately attain sword heart clarity depended on him alone, and Xu Yan had already provided all the guidance he could.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the mountain peak of Canglan Island, Xu Yan began to settle his mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"My shijie should have dissected those corpses, will she have any harvests? Can she refine a certain elixir to transform the meridians into a Heaven-Earth Bridge? Although it would only be a pseudo-Heaven-Earth Bridge, it would still possess the abilities of the Heaven-Earth Bridge, and thus allow the conversion to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, feeling that this method might be feasible. Once the Qingqing Pavilion moved to Canglan Island, he could have his shijie explore this.</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, after the battle with the Qingqing Pavilion, it gradually became peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Although there were underlying currents, on the surface, the martial arts world remained harmonious and calm, with few conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Elixirs were selling well in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>The methods of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts were also gradually spreading out.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Seven Star Academy opened a Great Wilderness Martial Arts course, causing some ripples in the calm martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was unaware of the underlying currents in the outside world, and even if he knew, he would not have cared.</p><p></p><p>He was currently settling his mind.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of his master's hand slashing and extinguishing the soul of the Hidden Pavilion Lord emerged.</p><p></p><p>That strike had directly annihilated the Hidden Pavilion Lord's soul. The mysterious fluctuations in that instant were etched in Xu Yan's memory, and he was now contemplating that mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>From the battle with the Blood Demon King, Xu Yan realized that if he mastered his master's soul-extinguishing technique, killing a Half-Step Celestial Being would not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"If the enemy also possesses the means to slay the soul and spirit, how should I defend against it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>This was more difficult to defend against than any attack.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan contemplated, at one moment, two sword lights appeared before him, circling and rotating endlessly, as if they would never cease.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious fluctuations rippled within the sword wheel, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"No, I cannot integrate it into the sword wheel, I cannot unleash it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Mountain-River Sword Intent emerged, the rivers and mountains flowing, as if encompassing the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Mountain-River Sword Intent surged, and the outlines of the actual heavens and earth appeared within the illusory image - this was the second realm of the Mountain-River Sword Intent! After breaking through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm, Xu Yan could finally manifest the second realm of the Mountain-River Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>"I should start from the sword intent. If I can comprehend the sword intent that can slay the soul and spirit, combined with the sword dao's killing techniques and martial arts divine abilities, the killing power would be even stronger! And not only can it attack, but it can also defend!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was stirred. He had found the direction for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Life-and-Death Sword Wheel appeared again, merging into the Mountain-River Sword Intent. Within the mountain and river, the sword wheel revolved, with endless transformations between life and death, killing and changing.</p><p></p><p>For several days, Xu Yan tried to comprehend the sword intent, but he still had not made any breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the Life-and-Death Sword Wheel had become more complete and powerful, with more killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>And when unleashing the killing power, there was a faint aura of death.</p><p></p><p>"Is the direction I'm cultivating wrong? The Life-and-Death Sword Wheel is something I comprehended from the Taiji, but I've only grasped the superficial aspects."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, sitting motionless on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew, entering through the collar, filling his chest, and brushing past his sleeves.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a flash of insight occurred in Xu Yan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Bagua contains the profound mysteries of heaven and earth. Xun, the wind, the wind enters through every crevice... I should use this as the direction to comprehend a new sword intent."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan became excited.</p><p></p><p>He had found the direction for his cultivation, and began to carefully contemplate the gentle breeze, with the Bagua diagram and its many mysteries emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Yan sat on the mountain peak, cultivating and comprehending the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was in another place, contemplating himself and the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan had cultivated for a while, feeling bored, so he propped up a small boat and drifted on the Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others continued to diligently study the martial dao, day and night, as if they knew no fatigue.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Desolation City, Li Xuan's peaceful days remained the same.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around the Great Desolation City, he ultimately felt a bit bored.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Innate Realm, Meng Chong was now accumulating his foundation, settling himself, preparing for the breakthrough to the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he could now start to break through to the Profound Realm, like Xu Yan, he wanted to refine and transform himself at the moment of the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he was elevating his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already given him guidance, and Meng Chong had also found the way to accumulate his foundation in preparation for the transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has fully mastered the Domineering Saber Intent, and your Domineering Saber Intent has also improved."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's saber intent had improved.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued to research the Elixir Martial Classics, and it seemed she had made some gains. Li Xuan felt that obtaining the next level of the Elixir Martial Classics would not be too far away.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation had entered the right track, with more and more martial artists, but it still lacked Innate Realm martial artists from the Great Desolation, and the foundation was ultimately not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"It's 130 now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's Hundred Martial Shadows had already reached 130.</p><p></p><p>This meant that there were 130 martial art beginners.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion was preparing to move. The Iron Mountain County area was ultimately a remote border region, relatively barren, and still too far from the prosperous inner domain.</p><p></p><p>But it was suitable for the development of the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also preparing for the move, packing up all kinds of things, filling two large baskets, which were hung on the back of the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Refinement Room left a production line to maintain the elixir needs of the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>The remaining elixir production lines were all transferred to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the preparations are complete. We'll go to Canglan Island and meet the senior brother tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was also excited. Although it was carrying the luggage as a laborer, this was a good opportunity to curry favor with Su Lingxiu, so it worked very hard. If it could please Su Lingxiu, it would not lack elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Su Lingxiu and the others set out for Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion in the Great Desolation City was still preserved, with the elder of the Evergreen Pavilion, the County Magistrate of Yunshan, left to take care of the affairs of the Evergreen Pavilion in the Great Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, Kou Ruozhi, and others also went to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat carried two large baskets on its back, with Li Xuan and Su Lingxiu sitting on it, and it also pulled a large cart, effortlessly without any sign of strain.</p><p></p><p>The huge Red Cat naturally attracted the attention of many people along the way.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island was located on the Cangjiang River, so after leaving the Iron Mountain County area and entering the Cangjiang River basin, they switched to taking a boat.</p><p></p><p>A large boat was docked on the Cangjiang River, which was prepared by the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Traveling by boat was naturally slower than the speed of martial artists, but it was more leisurely.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, Li Xuan sat in a chair, and on the small table next to him was a pot of Mist Spiritual Tea and a plate of pastries made by Su Lingxiu using spiritual fruits and other methods similar to elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>Drinking the spiritual tea and eating the spiritual pastries, appreciating the beautiful scenery along the Cangjiang River, this was truly living.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Yan seemed to be surrounded by a gentle breeze, yet also a sense of ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>The soft wind blew, as if not blowing on the physical body, but into the spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He was immersed in his insights, vaguely perceiving that a sword intent was about to be comprehended.</p><p></p><p>On the entire Canglan Island, only Hu Shan was an idle person.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the Great Perfection Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>Bored, he was sailing a small boat on the Cangjiang River, and when the mood struck him, he would set up a fishing rod and fish on the river.</p><p></p><p>A few miles outside Canglan Island, there was a patch of aquatic plants, and a small boat drifted over and stopped near the plants, a fishing rod extending out from the boat.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was leisurely fishing.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly understand the state of mind of the seniors. As a Great Perfection Master, I'm enjoying the mundane life, just like the seniors, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought happily to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, while fishing, Hu Shan's nose twitched a few times, and a faint fragrance appeared on the boat.</p><p></p><p>"This scent..."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan swallowed hard, beads of sweat appearing on his forehead, and his neck seemed to stiffen, but he could only grit his teeth and slowly turn around to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>On the boat, a purple-robed woman had appeared, her appearance enchantingly beautiful, with a hairpin on each side of her head.</p><p></p><p>The hairpins had jade pearls hanging down, and a phoenix with outstretched wings was lifelike on the purple jade pearls.</p><p></p><p>These hairpins were supreme treasures! Invaluable! What made Hu Shan's heart pound even more was the strength of the purple-robed woman!</p><p></p><p>A Great Master! A Great Master woman had silently appeared on his boat, and it was clearly not with good intentions! Hu Shan put down the fishing rod and respectfully cupped his hands, "I am Hu Shan, the sword cultivator from the Sword Saint Cliff, and my father is Hu Hai, the disciple of the Sword Sovereign Xie Tiangheng. I wonder what the Great Master has come for?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, he brought up his father Hu Hai and the Sword Sovereign Xie Tiangheng, hoping to intimidate the woman.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman was clearly taken aback for a moment, but then she laughed coquettishly, "So you're the son of Hu Hai. This is interesting. I've come here not to trouble you, but to ask about a person."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's heart skipped a beat. Hearing that the woman was looking for someone, he immediately thought of Xu Yan. But why would a Great Master be looking for Xu Yan? Even a Great Master would be courting death by provoking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, who are you looking for?" Hu Shan asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>If she was looking for Xu Yan, he could take her to him. After all, someone was going to their death, and Hu Shan didn't mind escorting them.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he finished speaking, slap! A palm strike hit him across the face from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! Am I so old that you call me 'Senior'? I'm not much older than you!" the purple-robed woman scolded angrily.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's heart was about to explode with anger, but since he was weaker, he could only swallow his resentment, secretly remembering the woman's appearance and planning to have his father intervene. "No, Xu Yan, as long as he takes action, the enemy won't even leave behind ashes!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought furiously, but on his face, he showed a fearful expression and hurriedly said, "My apologies, I was disrespectful. May I ask who the lady is looking for?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman nodded in satisfaction and said, "I'm looking for that very strong and powerful Meng Chong who can strangle Great Masters with his bare hands. Do you know where he is?"</p><p></p><p>The woman's eyes were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong?" Hu Shan was stunned. He wasn't looking for Xu Yan, but Meng Chong?</p>

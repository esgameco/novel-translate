        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A faint bloody aura permeated the Serpent Peak Skyhole, as if there was a foreign essence condensing inside.</p><p></p><p>Every Skyhole guarded by a Blood Child was as vast as a small world.</p><p></p><p>"Although this is also a Netherworld Skyhole, it's somewhat different from the one in the Qinghua Realm. The bloody aura here is more intense, and there seems to be a foreign essence."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the aura of the Netherworld? Could it be that the fabric of space-time is more fragile here, allowing the Netherworld aura to gather without dispersing?"</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan walked through the Skyhole, he noticed the differences and couldn't help but wonder silently.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that treasures like the Blood Heart Fruit appear because the Netherworld aura gathers and merges with the essence of this world?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the entrance of the Serpent Peak Skyhole, a great city had been built. Any enemies from the Netherworld wanting to break out of the Skyhole would have to defeat this defensive city.</p><p></p><p>To some extent, the Dagaishan side held an advantage, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to build a defensive city inside the Skyhole.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the city was a tall tower, with a vague but powerful aura emanating from it. That was where the Wan family elder, an Immortal Venerable powerhouse, was stationed.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Heart Fruit grows in the depths of the Skyhole, at the core of the Netherworld camp. It may exist in other places, but it's impossible to find. So the most efficient way is to go to the depths of the Skyhole to pick it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked towards the depths of the Skyhole, vaguely sensing some battles in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He had learned from other martial artists that the Wan family was planning to launch an attack against the Netherworld side in twenty days, pushing towards the depths of the Skyhole to harvest the Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family had offered generous rewards for this, and some unaffiliated True King Venerables were gathering to lend their strength.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty days is too long."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't wait twenty days. Every day was extremely precious to him.</p><p></p><p>"In this Skyhole, only the Blood Child poses a threat to me. As long as I avoid the Blood Child, the rest of the Blood Disciples are not worth worrying about."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan headed towards the depths of the Skyhole.</p><p></p><p>Since a major battle had just ended, there were only sporadic conflicts and skirmishes in the Skyhole. Most Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves had returned to their base, with only a few patrolling outside.</p><p></p><p>"Can I impersonate a Blood Disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly thought of this question.</p><p></p><p>"Mimicking the aura of a Blood Disciple doesn't seem too difficult. I could blend in with their aura..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered this idea.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't considered impersonating a Blood Disciple before, but now he suddenly had this thought in order to harvest the Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"However, Blood Disciples all have blood-red skin. Even the strongest Blood Disciples, while not as red, still have some redness to their skin.</p><p></p><p>"To impersonate a Blood Disciple, I first need to make my skin blood-red."</p><p></p><p>Mimicking the aura wasn't difficult, but how could he imitate the blood-red skin?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, then thought of the first realm of martial arts, the Blood Essence Realm. If he could make his blood essence rise to the surface of his skin, wouldn't that turn it blood-red?</p><p></p><p>"It's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became secretly excited. "I just need to avoid that Blood Child, and I definitely won't be discovered. That Blood Child won't pay attention to every Blood Disciple returning anyway. I'll pick the Blood Heart Fruit and leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I'm exposed after getting the Blood Heart Fruit, I can still retreat."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan believed that with his escape speed, he could return to the defensive city at the Skyhole entrance before the Blood Child could catch up to him.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder would naturally come out to resist the attacking Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>"I'll impersonate a patrolling Blood Disciple."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began searching for Blood Disciples in the Skyhole.</p><p></p><p>Finally, near the outer edges of the Skyhole's depths, he encountered a Blood Disciple leading a patrol of over a dozen Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! To avoid creating a big disturbance and risking the failure of his impersonation plan, Xu Yan immediately used his Sword Realm technique, instantly enveloping the patrol group.</p><p></p><p>Puff puff!</p><p></p><p>Those Blood Slaves instantly turned into bloody mist and perished.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple was shocked. He held his blade, striking out fiercely to try to resist the attack while calling for help.</p><p></p><p>But within the Sword Realm, no sound could travel outward.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword intent was sharp, and sword light swept through. In just a few breaths, that Blood Disciple was killed!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and retrieved the Blood Disciple's blood bead, directly storing it on his person. He also took the clothes and the crimson long blade.</p><p></p><p>He changed into the Blood Disciple's clothes and hung the crimson long blade at his waist. After pondering for a moment, he slightly adjusted the muscles of his face, changing to roughly resemble that Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he stirred up his long-unused blood essence, turning his skin a light red color.</p><p></p><p>The aura around him gradually changed, matching the blood bead he carried. At this moment, Xu Yan was indistinguishable from a Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't be discovered, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan examined himself, and after making sure there were no flaws, he set off towards the depths of the Skyhole, to the core of the Netherworld territory.</p><p></p><p>As for the small team of Blood Slaves he was supposed to be leading, if they disappeared, they disappeared. He could claim they were attacked and the Blood Slaves were killed.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing had happened more than once or twice before.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xu Yan had heard that some Blood Disciples, when injured and their blood power was severely depleted, would even devour their subordinate Blood Slaves to replenish themselves.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't even a secret in the Netherworld anymore.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he went into the Skyhole, the more intense the bloody aura became, reflecting all around, with a gloomy essence permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he encountered several patrol teams. They didn't say anything to him, this lone Blood Disciple, but their expressions seemed to assume he had encountered an attack, been injured, and devoured his subordinate Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Huge blood-red stone houses were arranged in rows, forming lines. Looking out, one could see in the center of the stone house cluster a towering, enormous stone house with blood light flashing at its top.</p><p></p><p>That was where the Blood Child resided.</p><p></p><p>Around the Blood Child's towering stone house, the inner circle was where the Blood Disciples lived, while the outermost circle was for the Blood Slaves. Xu Yan noticed that the Blood Slaves didn't have individual stone houses to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciples had their own independent stone houses. The strength of the blood light on the stone houses indicated the relative strength and status of their occupants.</p><p></p><p>"Which stone house is mine?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I'm here for the Blood Heart Fruit, not to live here. But where is the Blood Heart Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered the stone house cluster, trying to act as normal as possible, pretending to be familiar with the surroundings while secretly searching for the location of the Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Is that a Blood Heart Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan saw not far ahead, in front of a Blood Disciple's stone house, a blood-red plant growing like a vine. The plant grew along the stone house, and an egg-sized, heart-shaped blood-red fruit hung from the vine.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strolled over casually, as if taking a leisurely walk, and came to the stone house, right under the Blood Heart Fruit. He examined the Blood Heart Fruit for a moment, then reached out and picked it.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The door of the stone house opened, and a Blood Disciple walked out, glaring at him angrily: "Eight Six Seven, this is mine!"</p><p></p><p>Eight Six Seven? Xu Yan's heart skipped a beat, then he understood - this was the code number of the Blood Disciple he was impersonating.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, come, come, come, here's a chance to make merit!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved closer</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He casually put his arm around the other's shoulder, acting very familiar, and pulled him into the stone house.</p><p></p><p>"I have an excellent plan that can earn great merit. Since this thing belongs to you, let's join forces and split the credit..." Xu Yan spoke in a mysterious tone, lowering his voice as if afraid outsiders would overhear this opportunity for achievement.</p><p></p><p>That blood disciple was a bit confused - was he really so familiar with 867?</p><p></p><p>"What opportunity for achievement?" </p><p></p><p>He still instinctively asked.</p><p></p><p>The two of them entered the stone house, and everything inside fell into Xu Yan's view. To his surprise, there were even two blood heart fruits on the table.</p><p></p><p>"These blood heart fruits seem to have no use for blood disciples, and are just eaten as spirit fruits?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was slightly surprised, but then thought that the netherworld creatures were ultimately different, practicing different martial arts, so he wasn't too surprised.</p><p></p><p>Blood heart fruits, as special treasures, only had miraculous effects for the martial artists of this world.</p><p></p><p>"These are very useful, they can attract people..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward and picked up the blood heart fruits, saying as he put his arm around the blood disciple's shoulder again: "Brother, listen to me, I have a big plan..."</p><p></p><p>"876, why do I feel like something's off about you!"</p><p></p><p>That blood disciple suddenly frowned, looking somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>"Because I..."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A sword pierced the blood disciple's heart, instantly extinguishing his life force. As the other looked on in disbelief, Xu Yan slowly said: "...am not blood disciple 876."</p><p></p><p>Poof! The blood disciple turned to ash and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan collected his blood bead, and changed his aura, transforming into the blood disciple he had just killed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if there are any other treasures."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began searching the stone house.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he found this blood disciple's name: 666.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am blood disciple 666!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He put on blood disciple 666's clothes, walked out of the stone house, and continued searching for blood heart fruits. These were treasures, and the Wan family was offering high rewards to obtain blood heart fruits.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family was the hegemon of Mount Dagai, ruling over the Mount Dagai region with abundant resources and countless heavenly and earthly treasures. It would be perfect to exchange blood heart fruits for the special treasures he needed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went directly to the neighboring stone house, knocked on the door, and a blood disciple opened it, looking at him puzzled, "Old Six, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"It's like this..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan casually put his arm around the other's shoulder, entering the stone house while closing the door behind him. This series of actions was extremely practiced, as if he had done it countless times.</p><p></p><p>"I came today, Old Six, because I have a big plan to achieve merit that I want to share with you. You know about these fruits, right? Actually..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the blood heart fruit on the table while speaking mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>That blood disciple asked curiously: "What plan? You fool, what kind of plan could you have?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan confirmed that this blood disciple had a very good relationship with blood disciple 666, after all they were neighbors. And judging by the other's expression, he seemed somewhat surprised that his old neighbor's personality had changed.</p><p></p><p>So, this person couldn't be left alive, otherwise there was a risk of exposure.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you just don't understand, I've always been steady..."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! With one arm around the other's shoulder, he stabbed a sword into his heart, extinguishing his life force and preventing him from making even the slightest sound before death.</p><p></p><p>That blood disciple was stunned - Old Six actually wanted to kill him! After dealing with the blood disciple, Xu Yan pocketed the blood heart fruit, walked out of the stone house, pondered for a moment, then headed towards the next stone house.</p><p></p><p>"Damn pauper, not even a single blood heart fruit!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cursed silently as he walked out of a stone house.</p><p></p><p>This was already the eighth stone house he had visited, and it turned out not all blood disciples had blood heart fruits.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's a blood heart fruit here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan casually picked a blood heart fruit growing outside a blood disciple's house. After waiting a while with no one coming out, it seemed they weren't home, so he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"This blood child's power is not weak, likely commanding hundreds of blood disciples. The closer to the center, the stronger and higher-ranking the blood disciples.</p><p></p><p>"This also means these blood disciples possess more resources."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then slowly walked towards the inner row of stone houses.</p><p></p><p>Using blood disciple 666's identity, he visited one blood disciple after another.</p><p></p><p>"The number of blood heart fruits is still too few. I've killed over a hundred blood disciples but only collected about thirty blood heart fruits. I don't know if blood heart fruits are effective every time they're consumed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan lamented inwardly that blood heart fruits were very rare even on the netherworld side.</p><p></p><p>Along this journey, over a hundred stone houses had been emptied, their owners all killed by him posing as blood disciple 666.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family should thank me for weakening this heavenly cave's strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't I think of impersonating a blood disciple when I was in the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The stone houses before him were the innermost circle of blood disciple dwellings, and also the largest row of stone houses.</p><p></p><p>This meant the blood disciples in these stone houses were the strongest, certainly existences comparable to peak True King Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"After all, I'm not a real blood disciple. If I encounter careful scrutiny, I'll still be exposed, so I must be more cautious."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knocked on the stone house door.</p><p></p><p>The owner of this stone house had such a high status and position, they must have many treasures, right? Surely they wouldn't lack fruits like blood heart fruits?</p><p></p><p>It's just that their strength was too great, so he had to kill them in one strike without making a sound, otherwise alarming that blood child would be big trouble.</p><p></p><p>The stone house door opened, and a burly blood disciple with a fierce face appeared. Xu Yan was about to follow the usual routine when the other spoke first, asking with a puzzled look: "Little Six, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. "Blood disciple 666 serves under this person's command. This is not good."</p><p></p><p>With so many blood disciples, there were naturally squad leaders, divided into many teams. Judging from this blood disciple's tone and expression, blood disciple 666 clearly belonged to his squad.</p><p></p><p>"Big news!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said in a deep voice, with a solemn expression, entering the stone house directly as if the big news in his mouth couldn't be known by others.</p><p></p><p>"What big news?"</p><p></p><p>The fierce-faced blood disciple frowned, looking somewhat displeased, but only displeased, not wary. After all, since the netherworld invaded this world, there had never been a case of someone impersonating and infiltrating.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't hide their auras from each other, just as netherworld blood disciples and blood slaves couldn't impersonate and infiltrate the forces of this world.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan entered the stone house, he saw several blood heart fruits on a plate on the table. He inwardly marveled that as expected of one of the strongest blood disciples, the treatment really was good.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I heard from the Wan family's side..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan leaned close to this blood disciple, lowering his voice and speaking with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

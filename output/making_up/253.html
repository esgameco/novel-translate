        <h1>Chapter 253</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned, his heart skipping a beat as he revealed a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>"What does the senior brother mean?"</p><p></p><p>He swallowed, finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"Set up a formation, use the Refining Celestial Cultivators to practice, and I'll also try the power of the sword formation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>The departure of the brown-robed warrior was precisely to lure the Refining Celestial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I also want to try the power of the hidden blades."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"I, I also want to try!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu also had an excited expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>With the master guarding them, even if the Refining Celestial Cultivators were too powerful, they wouldn't be in danger even if they couldn't defeat them.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's use the Refining Celestial Cultivators for practice!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was boiling with enthusiasm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>To advance against the tide, that is the true mark of a strong person, and he still lacked some courage.</p><p></p><p>As a wandering cultivator, the majesty of the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families towered above him, making him lack the spirit to advance against the tide. This was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Break through the heart's barrier and look down on the Spiritual Sect and Aristocratic Families!</p><p></p><p>"I've already refined some formation tools these days, so setting up the formation won't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Although the Mysterious Armory was not fully refined, he had refined some formation tools. The Illusory Confusion Formation, the Phoenix Fire Deadly Formation, and the even higher-level Bewildering Reversal Formation could all be deployed.</p><p></p><p>"Good! We brothers shall advance against the Refining Celestial Cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a smiling expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this elder brother Xu Yan was very capable, and he truly possessed the fearless and advancing spirit.</p><p></p><p>Peerless experts all rise up in this way.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan has the bearing of a protagonist!</p><p></p><p>The four brothers left the manor and searched for a suitable place to set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked down and instantly found an excellent terrain, which was not only a good place for formation deployment but could also enhance the power of the Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Formation.</p><p></p><p>With the formation tools in hand, the formation was quickly set up. After the formation was completed, Fang Hao did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>He had a serious expression, beginning to draw restrictions, fusing them with the formation, and then deploying the Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Formation, fully utilizing the insights he had gained in the Extraordinary Martial Dao during this period.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, second brother, sister, wear these formation pearls, and you won't be affected by the formation."</p><p></p><p>He handed three formation pearls to Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them took them.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu held an iron shovel, feeling a bit nervous, after all, they were about to fight the Refining Celestial Cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao stood in the center of his Extraordinary Formation, waiting for the Refining Celestial experts to arrive. His palms were sweating, as this was the first time he had faced Refining Celestial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rose into the air, standing on a large tree, waiting for the enemy to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure disappeared into the formation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formation had not yet fully activated and was in a hidden state.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, two figures flew swiftly from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng and Ke Lin Ping, upon receiving the news, were transmitting messages back to the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family while rushing to the outskirts of the Zheng National Capital, where Xu Yan had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan and Meng Chong had joined forces to slay a Refining Celestial Cultivator, if they encountered one alone, they might be in danger. But with the two of them working together, there was no such concern.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Xu Yan is actually hiding in the Zheng Nation. Could it be related to the Zheng Nation?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The Zheng Nation does not participate in the martial arts conflicts of the Jade State. Although we have offered a bounty for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, they will not get involved, and they won't even pass the information on to us.</p><p></p><p>"Backed by the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, they are truly enviable!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lin Ping said enviously.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Zheng Nation was indeed secretly sheltering Xu Yan, they dared not act against the Zheng Nation, except on the orders of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect. No power in the Spiritual Realm would dare to rashly attack the Zheng Nation.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm's gate has been closed, and the Zheng Nation's task has also been lost. Could it be that they still..."</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng said, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm's gate has been closed, but that doesn't mean it no longer exists. It naturally needs guardians, and the Zheng Nation's task will continue."</p><p></p><p>Ke Lin Ping sighed.</p><p></p><p>It would have been better if this task had been given to the Jade Spirit Sect. With the Jade Spirit Sect's strength and the backing of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, dominating the Jade State would be a matter of time, becoming a powerful sect among the top-tier Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the task belongs solely to the Zheng Nation's royal family! No one dares to interfere.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, is that... Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ke Lin Ping's expression changed as he said.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng looked up and exclaimed with delight, "Yes, it's Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, immediately becoming excited, as with their strength, capturing Xu Yan would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>They immediately moved, their spiritual power surging out, rushing towards Xu Yan with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you will pay with your life!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng roared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan seemed to be taken aback, turning and retreating into the forest below.</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lin Ping said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual power had already locked onto Xu Yan, and the two pursued him closely.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure disappeared into a large formation, and Su Ling Xiu was nervous, tightly gripping the iron shovel, watching the two descending figures.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was even more anxious, his palms sweating, as this was the first time in his life he had seen the lofty Refining Celestial Cultivators, and the first time he would act against them.</p><p></p><p>With a rumble, the spiritual power surged as Shu Lian Cheng and Ke Lin Ping entered the formation. Fang Hao took a deep breath, stepping forward as the power of Heaven and Earth gathered.</p><p></p><p>The Extraordinary Formation was activated, with mists shrouding everything, directions becoming confused, and Phoenix Fire surging forth!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lin Ping's expression changed, and he quickly retreated, but behind him was the terrifying Phoenix Fire, and the spiritual power he sensed was all shrouded in mist. He had lost his direction!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was as if he had fallen into a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Ke Lin Ping gripped a large axe in his hand and roared furiously, bringing it down towards the Phoenix Fire!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Fire surged, the axe's power terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression changed slightly, but he remained calm. He shifted his feet, and the Extraordinary Formation changed, the power of the formation surging, redirecting Ke Lin Ping's attack to where Shu Lian Cheng was.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng, upon entering the formation, also sensed something was amiss and became alert, gripping a pair of short spears in his hands, warily watching his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Ke brother?"</p><p></p><p>He did not receive a response from Ke Lin Ping.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an axe beam slashed out from the mist.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng's expression changed, his two spears slashing out, and with a boom, he was forced to retreat two steps, though he had blocked the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Ke brother, it's me!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly called out in warning.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, another axe beam came slashing from the side.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng hastily blocked it.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>He felt a chill in his heart, this place was extremely strange, his spiritual power was being interfered with, and he had lost his sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another axe beam came slashing.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lian Cheng's heart sank, realizing he couldn't continue like this, so he struck out towards the direction of the attack.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping was attacking, wanting to escape this place, when suddenly a sharp spearhead appeared, slashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shu!" </p><p></p><p>Colin Ping hurriedly moved to defend.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao was panting heavily. Although he had used the strange terrain and formations to shift the attacks of Colin Ping and Shu Lianchen, his cultivation was ultimately lower.</p><p></p><p>He was about to reach his limit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up: "I'll take care of this one!"</p><p></p><p>He pointed at Colin Ping.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Jade Spirit Sect was a bit stronger in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll go deal with that one from the Shu family!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping took a deep breath, a wave-like ripple appearing on his head as his spiritual power condensed. His aura kept rising, wanting to break through the mist and find a way out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed drastically and he let out a low roar, swinging down an axe.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A young figure emerged from the mist.</p><p></p><p>Faint winds swirled around, layer upon layer, exuding an aura of ruthlessness that chilled the bones.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu Yan!" </p><p></p><p>Colin Ping gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect is so powerful, since you dare to pursue me, then be prepared to pay the price. Today, I will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a sword formation appeared around Colin Ping, with countless sword energies interconnected in a special pattern.</p><p></p><p>The faint winds circled within the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping was alarmed, what kind of sword art was this? Unheard of, unseen before!</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators of the second-rate sects and families are no match for my Jade Spirit Sect. Xu Yan, your strength is formidable, but you underestimate the Heavenly Cultivators of the top-tier sects."</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping sneered.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power surged, forming a vague human-shaped ripple above his head. Streams of power converged.</p><p></p><p>A white glow flashed on his body, the axe in his hand gleaming with sharp edges, with layers of axe shadows appearing around him.</p><p></p><p>A heavy aura radiated out from him, seemingly able to resist the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, Colin Ping was indeed an elder of the Jade Spirit Sect. Although they were both at the Qi Refining stage, his spiritual power and martial arts were superior to Dai Sheng's.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of an elder of a top-tier sect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression became slightly more serious.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng and that other Qi Refining cultivator were only the weak ones among the Qi Refiners. Although they might be stronger than the wandering cultivators, they were still considered weak among the sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping probably wasn't one of the stronger ones either.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect was known as the number one sect in Yuzhou, ranked among the top-tier sects in the Spiritual Realm, but they were only at the lower end of the top-tier.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll use you to test my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, the sword formation activated, sword beams emerging, the aura of slaughter surging, even the mist dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, I'll take care of this formation."</p><p></p><p>He spoke at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Came Fang Hao's voice from the mist.</p><p></p><p>Colin Ping's expression was grave, this strange place was actually a man-made formation? What kind of technique was this? His killing intent grew even stronger, he had to kill Xu Yan, had to eliminate this hidden danger, otherwise the Jade Spirit Sect would be in peril! He couldn't let him continue to grow.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! </p><p></p><p>As Fang Hao relinquished control of this formation, in an instant, the formation transformed into a sword formation, the mist filled with the sword intent of the Xun Wind, the Phoenix Fire becoming the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Colin Ping roared, the axe shadows surging like a violent wind, the human-shaped ripple on his head emanating a spiritual pressure that merged into the axe shadows.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood still, tapping his finger, the sword formation rotating, the mountains and rivers surging, enveloping all the attacks, the Phoenix Fire transforming into densely packed sharp swords, sweeping in like a torrent.</p><p></p><p>This battle, he was here to temper the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Meng Chong took action, turning into a six-zhang tall golden armored giant.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen let out a low roar, a cold glint flashing in his eyes: "Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked, a six-zhang tall golden armored giant, it was real, not an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>This Meng Chong, could he be a giant?</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm, when had there ever been such a huge person? Meng Chong's punch struck out, Shu Lianchen's dual halberds slashed, directly breaking through Meng Chong's armor, exposing his flesh, even leaving a shallow wound on his body.</p><p></p><p>However, the indestructible divine armor immediately recovered, that tiny wound was of no consequence to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Refiners are truly too strong, even with my indestructible golden body, I cannot fully defend against them."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen was even more shocked, what a terrifying physique was this?</p><p></p><p>Boom! He unleashed his dual halberds, frantically slashing towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, the soil flew up, a huge sword came slashing up from below, majestic and unparalleled, as if it could cleave the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen's expression changed, his dual halberds forcefully pressing down.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The big sword shattered, but in the moment the sword broke, sword light surged in the air, suddenly slashing down.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this sword come from?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was grave, although he had reached the Sword Concealing realm, concealing swords without form, killing without a trace, there was no place in heaven and earth without a sword, it was just that Shu Lianchen's strength was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>He had exerted his full strength, but still could not defeat the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen was a bit flustered at first, but ultimately he was a Qi Refining cultivator, experienced in battle, and soon stabilized himself, unleashing ferocious attacks with his dual halberds.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's armor kept shattering and reforming under the attacks, his flesh covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, Shu Lianchen felt his body sinking, as if trapped in a swamp, a sweeping iron shovel form surging towards him.</p><p></p><p>A young girl, tense yet excited, wielding an iron shovel attacking him!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was nervous yet excited, the Great Marsh Divine Shovel had finally seen action, replying: "Your grandma - no, no, I'm not that old to be your grandchild!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen's nose was almost crooked from anger, suddenly his dual halberds broke through Meng Chong slightly, his figure moving, rushing towards Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Phoenix Fire surged like a giant python, sweeping in from the side as the mist enveloped, Su Ling Xiu had already disappeared!</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong used his hand as a sword, striking down with the Boundless Divine Slash!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Shu Lianchen's heart was horrified, frantically activating his spiritual cultivation technique, his spiritual power gathering but not dispersing, his dual halberds sweeping, attacking Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Rumble! </p><p></p><p>The spiritual power surged, that strike had almost cleaved his spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This is... an art that attacks the spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Such an art that targeted the spirit, there were only a few powers in the Spiritual Realm that possessed it, and without exception, they were all core secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Without true transmission, it could not be cultivated!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you people?"</p><p></p><p>"The ones who will kill you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Suddenly, fine beams of light shot over, that young girl had reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Fire and mist also emerged, binding him.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, when he struck out with his dual halberds, his expression suddenly changed drastically, the target in front of him was actually a rock, while the girl was in another location, one of the fine golden needles had pierced his arm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the pierced area seemed to be losing vitality!</p><p></p><p>Shu Lianchen was horrified, hurriedly shaking off the needle.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

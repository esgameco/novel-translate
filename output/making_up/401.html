        <h1>Chapter 401</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, that True King Celestial Lord was injured, and his soul was torn apart by Xu Yan's Xun Wind Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Once the soul was injured and weakened, the Heavenly Will Mind Control easily took control of him.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, confess everything completely," Xu Yan ordered after controlling the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Charming Witch's enchantment, the Heavenly Will Mind Control was clearly more marvelous. The two True King Celestial Lords simply could not resist the mysterious heavenly will in their souls.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even though they were controlled, the Charming Witch's enchantment had not disappeared and still existed.</p><p></p><p>Even the Charming Witch herself could not discover that the people she controlled had already been controlled by Xu Yan, truly acting according to Xu Yan's will.</p><p></p><p>This was also Xu Yan's intention in controlling these two - at a critical moment, he could catch the Charming Witch off guard and create trouble for her.</p><p></p><p>The two True King Celestial Lords confessed all of the Charming Witch's plans in detail.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly delighted - the Seven Wonders Divine Flower was actually real. The Charming Witch had really gone to great lengths to lure him in.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had confirmed the Seven Wonders Divine Flower actually existed, he was even more determined to meet the Charming Witch.</p><p></p><p>"That Demon Witch Sky Cave cannot accommodate experts comparable to Immortal Celestial Lords entering. So no matter how strong the Charming Witch is, she won't reach the level of an Immortal Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Charming Witch's power is somewhat special and cannot be viewed ordinarily. Even a normal Immortal Celestial Lord could fall into her trap if careless."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, silently evaluating in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch's power was rather special, and her most terrifying aspect was devouring soul power.</p><p></p><p>"A soul is just a soul. My martial dao primordial spirit is not comparable to a mere soul. Wanting to devour a martial dao primordial spirit is a pipe dream for the Charming Witch, who isn't even an Immortal Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not take the Charming Witch's soul-devouring power very seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, even with her talent, it would not be easy for her to devour the soul of someone at the same level.</p><p></p><p>As for a martial dao primordial spirit, it was absolutely impossible for the Charming Witch to devour it with her abilities.</p><p></p><p>"My primordial spirit has defensive power, so I'm not afraid. If I catch her off guard and disguise my Xun Wind Sword Intent as a soul for her to devour..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered how to disguise the Xun Wind Sword Intent as a soul for the Charming Witch to absorb. It was a problem.</p><p></p><p>"There's always a way..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Xu Yan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>"Gather all your people, one by one..." Xu Yan ordered the two True King Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The two True King Celestial Lords hurriedly and respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>Deep in their consciousness, they were still clear-headed, and their scalps tingled. Xu Yan's methods were too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Their instincts told them that the beauty in the Demon Witch Sky Cave was likely to suffer greatly this time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was in no hurry to go to the Demon Witch Sky Cave. Instead, he used the Heavenly Will Mind Control to control the True King Celestial Lords sent out by the Charming Witch to find him, one by one.</p><p></p><p>These True King Celestial Lords never imagined their comrades would betray them. With no guard up at all, they were suddenly ambushed and easily controlled by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After controlling them one by one, Xu Yan's next step was to figure out the details of the Demon Witch Sky Cave - whether it truly could not accommodate otherworldly experts at the Immortal Celestial Lord level.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, he finally confirmed that the Charming Witch's strength inside the sky cave had not reached the Immortal Celestial Lord level.</p><p></p><p>It was just that her power seemed rather strange and special to Cang martial artists, making it difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>But for Xu Yan, this was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>"You are in great danger now. Your souls could be devoured at any time. I have a method that may be able to keep your souls intact at the critical moment," Xu Yan said to the group of True King Celestial Lords he controlled.</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch would not spare these True King Celestial Lords and would eventually devour their souls.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he could make some plans.</p><p></p><p>Next, a strand of Xun Wind Sword Intent was fused into each True King Celestial Lord's soul, merging with their souls indistinguishably.</p><p></p><p>Since the Xun Wind Sword Intent targeted souls, it could naturally fuse into souls. Especially with these True King Celestial Lords actively fusing it in, the Xun Wind Sword Intent would not be detected.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan swallowed several pills, fusing the Xun Wind Sword Intent into them and hiding them inside his body.</p><p></p><p>These pills were refined by Su Lingxiu and called False Soul Pills. They possessed soul aura and could transform into soul form to deceive people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also had the effect of nourishing the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wanted to use Xun Wind Sword Intent to impersonate a soul to deceive the Charming Witch, so he thought of the False Soul Pills, which could come in handy.</p><p></p><p>"What strange pills. Sometimes they can actually be useful," Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister had refined too many pills, including many strange ones with special effects. Now these False Soul Pills could be put to use.</p><p></p><p>"What will happen when the Charming Witch absorbs the Xun Wind Sword Intent?" Xu Yan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>With all preparations complete, it was time to meet the Charming Witch!</p><p></p><p>Thousand-Layered Mountain, Demon Witch Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sky cave was like a beauty's boudoir, elegantly arranged and fragrantly enchanting. Pink flowers were systematically arranged.</p><p></p><p>In front of a small building was a blooming seven-colored flower, surrounded by a halo, giving a sense of divine wonder.</p><p></p><p>"Where are they?" The Charming Witch lazily lay on the bed in the elegant small building, with several beautiful maids serving her on the left and right.</p><p></p><p>In fact, these maids were no longer the people they once were.</p><p></p><p>Several True King Celestial Lords knelt outside the small building, their bodies trembling slightly, appearing quite uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"We've discovered his whereabouts and are trying to lure him here. We believe it won't be long before he enters," one True King Celestial Lord said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so. Otherwise, there's no need for useless people to exist," the Charming Witch said, licking her red lips with her tongue as she stared at the True King Celestial Lords as if looking at delicious food.</p><p></p><p>"He's here! Xu Yan is preparing to enter the sky cave!" Two True King Celestial Lords excitedly entered from outside the sky cave to report.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!" The Charming Witch was delighted, a cold glint flashing in her enchanting eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't Xu Yan said to be coming to the sky cave?" A day later, the Charming Witch asked with some anger.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is cautious and is investigating all around. We dare not approach for fear of arousing his suspicion. We believe he will enter the sky cave in the next few days," a True King Celestial Lord said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"He'd better!" The Charming Witch took a deep breath, cold light flashing in her eyes, her thoughts unknown.</p><p></p><p>Another day passed.</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch was getting impatient. A True King Celestial Lord quickly returned from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Good. Prepare to seal off the escape route from the sky cave!" The Charming Witch immediately ordered.</p><p></p><p>Pink light permeated the sky cave. These True King Celestial Lords hid in the pink light according to the Charming Witch's instructions, concealing their forms.</p><p></p><p>"We can't let him be alerted!" After pondering for a moment, the Charming Witch gradually retracted the pink light in the sky cave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sky cave was close to the entrance...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the celestial cave was no different from ordinary ones, with no unusual features.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is in my hands. Let's see if you come to save him, and how you'll do it!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu secretly gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan arrived at the entrance of the celestial cave. His aura changed slightly, lowering to that of someone who had just entered the Mystical Power realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Wonders Divine Flower is mine."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered the celestial cave, pretending not to notice the hidden True Kings and Celestial Venerables. He cautiously and slowly made his way deeper into the cave.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the elegant small building, he saw the Seven Wonders Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>Originally cautious, he suddenly increased his speed, instantly appearing before the flower. He reached out and plucked it, putting it away.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, since you've come, don't leave!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu walked out of the small building.</p><p></p><p>"It's you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pretended to change expression, his form suddenly retreating as if wanting to flee far away.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, is big sister so scary that you want to leave as soon as you see me? You've already got the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, why not stay and play with big sister?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu laughed seductively, pink light emanating from her, filling the entire celestial cave with a pink mist.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the cave, those True Kings and Celestial Venerables revealed themselves and slowly approached, blocking the escape route.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was solemn as he held his sword, his aura erupting, looking ready to fight to the death at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he breathed a sigh of relief. The Seven Wonders Divine Flower was successfully obtained. What came next would be much easier. From entering the cave, he had pretended to be cautious in order to deceive Mei Wu and obtain the flower.</p><p></p><p>Everything had gone smoothly so far. Next was how to trick Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>Pink light suffused the air, and Mei Wu became extremely seductive, as if able to stir one's primal desires.</p><p></p><p>Especially for hot-blooded young men, it was easier to lose oneself in this seduction.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of seductive power is this?" Xu Yan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder those True Kings and Celestial Venerables had fallen for it. Mei Wu's seductive power was extremely strong and strange.</p><p></p><p>"However, it has no effect on me!"</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Xu Yan appeared to be struggling hard to resist the seduction and maintain his mental clarity, but internally he was completely calm.</p><p></p><p>Whether due to the wonders of the Wisdom Sword realm, which was already beyond demonic obstacles and all illusions ineffective against him, or the Small Heavenly Dao Eye that could see through illusions, he could ignore Mei Wu's seductive power.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, what do you think of big sister?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's eyes grew brighter, her aura fragrant and enchanting. No matter what type of woman Xu Yan liked, in his eyes she would appear as that type.</p><p></p><p>How many in the world could resist such extreme beauty?</p><p></p><p>Let alone a young man like Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to bewitch me!"</p><p></p><p>Sweat beaded on Xu Yan's forehead as he let out a low roar and swung his sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was sharp and unrivaled in its killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu raised her delicate jade fingers and flicked them. With a clang, she deflected the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, as expected of that hateful fellow's disciple, you do have some extraordinary qualities. To be able to hold on until now, I want to see how long you can last!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan to be able to maintain his mental clarity until now without completely succumbing, he was indeed an unparalleled genius, much stronger than those True Kings and Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted coldly, veins bulging on his forehead. He let out a low roar as sword light surrounded him, layers of sword intent like surging waves encircling his body to resist the seduction.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his form shifted, instantly changing positions as if trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, don't think of leaving. Let your master come save you."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu looked at Xu Yan's teleportation technique with new respect.</p><p></p><p>"You can't keep me here!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan teleported again, and this time he actually escaped through the blockade of True Kings and Celestial Venerables, rushing straight for the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Useless, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu raised an eyebrow as she looked at the group of True Kings and Celestial Venerables. Now that Xu Yan had come, these useless ones were no longer needed.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, be good and listen. You can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>A slender jade hand suddenly reached out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan swung his sword to slash at it, but the slender jade hand coiled around him, capturing both him and his sword.</p><p></p><p>"What a handsome little brother!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's eyes shone brightly as she stared at Xu Yan. Those eyes seemed to contain a mesmerizing beauty.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gritted his teeth and persevered, appearing to be struggling hard to maintain his mental clarity, looking as if he could succumb at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu smiled like a flower.</p><p></p><p>"Go spread the news that Xu Yan is in my hands. Let's see how his master comes to save him!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu pointed at one of the True Kings and Celestial Venerables as she ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>That True King and Celestial Venerable hurriedly bowed respectfully and retreated, quickly leaving the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the remaining True Kings and Celestial Venerables changed slightly as they realized something was amiss in the depths of their hearts, but they were unable to struggle or resist.</p><p></p><p>"One by one, don't resist now."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>One after another, the True Kings and Celestial Venerables came forward. Mei Wu opened her small mouth and sucked out their souls, swallowing them.</p><p></p><p>Thud! After having their souls sucked out, the True Kings and Celestial Venerables left behind soulless physical shells.</p><p></p><p>After she had sucked in all the souls of the True Kings and Celestial Venerables, Mei Wu's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, she felt these souls seemed somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>The taste of the souls seemed to have a kind of... spicy feeling?</p><p></p><p>"To think you could persist until now? That's quite rare. I'll take your soul then. With your soul in my possession, let's see how your master saves you!</p><p></p><p>"If he wants to get his disciple's soul back, we'll have to see what your master has that's worth trading.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, remember some advice: the rarer the treasure, the harder it is to obtain. There are always risks involved.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, that's assuming you have a next time."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu smiled brilliantly, her tender white hand caressing Xu Yan's cheek as she sighed: "Such a handsome little brother. With this body, big sister can play for many years!"</p><p></p><p>She opened her small mouth, using her soul-devouring power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan felt a special force seemingly wanting to envelop and bind his primordial spirit, trying to suck it out of his body.</p><p></p><p>However, because the martial arts he cultivated were not from the Tai Cang system, and he had condensed a martial primordial spirit, this suction force actually could not envelop or bind his primordial spirit. The power of his spirit platform could resist this suction force externally.</p><p></p><p>"Here it comes!"</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was prepared. He poured the fake soul pill and the false soul fused with the wind sword intent into this suction force all at once, letting Mei Wu suck it into her body.</p><p></p><p>As Mei Wu sucked it in, she was stunned for a moment. Why was this boy's soul so vast? But after a moment's thought, she understood. After all, he was the disciple of an extremely powerful being, so it was normal for him to be special.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with this boy's soul? It's too spicy. What kind of soul is this exactly? I've devoured countless souls, but I've never eaten a spicy soul before!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was confused. The taste of this soul was too spicy!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

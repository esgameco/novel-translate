        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood was boiling, and a restlessness was brewing within.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot underestimate the people of the world. This woman's bewitching techniques are as if naturally endowed, and her strength is not weak either. And I am still young, at the age most susceptible to being swayed by female charms.</p><p></p><p>"She has somewhat unsettled my heart, my state of mind is still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my master said, 'With no woman in one's heart, the cultivation is as if divine.' I am still far from reaching that profound realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath, silently calming himself down. However, the faint lingering fragrance of the woman in white, that intangible, natural aura that constantly captivated the soul, seemed to have already enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>Making his heart increasingly restless.</p><p></p><p>"This bewitching power is too strong, it has actually stirred my heart. If this woman were to make the first move, would I be able to guard my mind and spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He stole a glance at the woman in white. Her eyes were bright as stars, sitting beside him, her slender jade feet kicking the water, without any superfluous bodily movements.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even see her countenance, yet it was enough to make his heart feel unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"When my master encountered this woman at my age, how did he deal with it? Otherwise, how could he have imparted to me the 'no woman in one's heart' profound realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Returning to the original, the technique approaching the Dao, my heart is restless because I do not understand myself. Only by understanding myself can I eliminate all external interference and not be disturbed by bewitchment.</p><p></p><p>"If my heart does not move, then nothing can move my heart."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had a realization.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers emerged in his mind. Within the mountains and rivers, he saw the peerless beauty of the Wondrous Pavilion, the dance he had witnessed, all the bewitchment were now presented.</p><p></p><p>Making the mountains and rivers even more beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the figure of the woman in white also appeared in the mountains and rivers, as if sitting by the stream, kicking the water, her eyes bright as stars.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's heart calmed down, no longer restless. Understanding himself, the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers became more complete.</p><p></p><p>"If my junior brother were to break through, opening the apertures of the Great Sun Golden Body, he should nurture the sword within the apertures. And I shall nurture the myriad beings and the sword within my heart in this Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, Xu Yan, have attained the clarity of the Sword Heart!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan's Sword Heart had reached great perfection.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers nurtured the myriad beings and the sword within his heart, laying the foundation for the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a smile, looking at the woman in white beside him, no longer a trace of restlessness. Her bewitchment had been nurtured within the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white felt a chill in her heart, she looked at Xu Yan in astonishment. In that moment, she vaguely sensed a faint, elusive aura from him.</p><p></p><p>She realized that Xu Yan was no longer restless, seemingly unaffected by her bewitchment.</p><p></p><p>"Truly the first genius of the Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>She sighed inwardly, wanting to have a chance to witness his strike, but it seemed extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white raised her hand and removed the veil from her face.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a peerless countenance, in that instant, the heavens and earth seemed to have lost their colors, with only this visage being the sole beauty of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, is your heart made of iron?" the woman in white said softly.</p><p></p><p>She extended her slender jade finger and gently poked Xu Yan's chest, the coquettish gesture stirring endless desires, enough to make one's blood boil.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Xu Yan remained calm and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>In the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers, that woman in white also opened her eyes and extended her slender jade hand... All the bewitchment was but a part of the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was the master of the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers, controlling everything.</p><p></p><p>"You are the most bewitching and heart-stirring woman I have ever seen, yet you still cannot disturb my heart. Instead, you have made my Sword Dao even more resolute."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white's smile faded, her brows slightly furrowed, yet even so, it was still enough to stir one's desires.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fixed on Xu Yan, her heart unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that with my unique constitution, after cultivating this technique, there are few men in the world who can resist my enchantment, and I can control men to serve me.</p><p></p><p>"Even ordinary masters can be disturbed by me, wishing to throw themselves into the flames for me. Those below the First Rank of martial artists have no way to resist me."</p><p></p><p>Yet, the young man before her could not be stirred in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you are truly the most extraordinary man in the world, I admire you greatly!" the woman in white sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then spoke, "I have a friend who also cultivates the Sword Dao, perhaps he could come and temper his heart here as well?"</p><p></p><p>He thought of Xie Lingfeng, using his name as an excuse.</p><p></p><p>"Xie brother also needs to temper his heart, otherwise how can he advance in the Sword Dao? Coming here to temper his heart would be the best, let me arrange an opportunity for him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I shall see if your friend can also remain unaffected, just as you are," the woman in white smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" Xu Yan clasped his hands in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>His heart had been tempered, and he had even broken through to the clarity of the Sword Heart, further realizing the meaning of nurturing the myriad beings and the sword within his heart. It was time for him to leave.</p><p></p><p>The next destination, the Seven Star Academy! Xu Yan looked at the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers, which contained all the scenes he had witnessed in tempering his heart, and pondered, "Let's call it the Myriad Phenomena of the Mountains and Rivers. When I perfect the Myriad Phenomena of the Mountains and Rivers, how powerful will my Sword Dao be?"</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with anticipation, he had grasped the direction for the advancement of the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>"The matter here is concluded, I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood up and cupped his hands in farewell.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white smiled sweetly, "Sir, is there nothing else you desire from your visit here?"</p><p></p><p>"Desire?" Xu Yan paused, falling into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the woman in white stood up, her smile radiant, her expression filled with tenderness, her voice even more gentle, "Sir, the beauty of the Wondrous Pavilion is unparalleled in the world. To come here and leave empty-handed, would that not be a pity?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes immediately lit up as he said, "Do you have any gifts to offer?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in white: ...</p><p></p><p>"What kind of gift would the sir like?" </p><p></p><p>If it's a gift for Xie Lingfeng, then so be it.</p><p></p><p>With such a genius, there are few in the Inner Realm who can match him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any sixth-grade spirit medicines?" Xu Yan asked eagerly, "If not, even ten or eighty thousand spirit crystals would do."</p><p></p><p>The woman in white's smile froze, completely dumbfounded. You're the genius of the Sword Saint Cliff, how could you still be lacking in spirit crystals? Demanding money like this? "Sir, of course we have spirit crystals, but there are no gifts given away for free in this world..."</p><p></p><p>Ten or eighty thousand spirit crystals were not something the Wondrous Pavilion couldn't provide. If they could establish a relationship with Xie Lingfeng, in the future, when someone wanted to harm the Wondrous Pavilion, they would have to think twice with such a connection.</p><p></p><p>But before she could finish speaking, Xu Yan shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I won't take anything that's not given freely!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes had a dark expression on her face. "You've gotten used to freeloading, haven't you? Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, if you have time, you may come visit me again."</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see about that."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an evasive look on his face. After descending from the top floor of the Wushuang Pavilion, there was a gathering of many martial artists below, looking at a portrait.</p><p></p><p>A manager of the Wushuang Pavilion spoke up: "Gentlemen, whoever finds clues about this woman will receive a 10,000 spirit crystal reward. If you can bring her back to the Wushuang Pavilion unharmed, you will receive a Grade 7 spirit herb, 100,000 spirit crystals, and 7 days of free entertainment at the Wushuang Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Such a generous reward made the martial artists at the Wushuang Pavilion all eager.</p><p></p><p>Even Grandmasters could not be exempt.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this woman, and why is the Wushuang Pavilion offering such a high reward for her? Could it be that she escaped from the Wushuang Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible for someone to escape from the Wushuang Pavilion once they've entered. It's simply not feasible."</p><p></p><p>"I must go investigate this woman's whereabouts. 100,000 spirit crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had just come down, suddenly had a gleam in his eyes. 100,000 spirit crystals and a Grade 7 spirit herb? This reward was truly generous.</p><p></p><p>He became interested, as this seemed like an opportunity to make a fortune. He had escorted Du Yuying and killed many Grandmasters, but had never earned 100,000 spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>So he walked up and asked, "Could it be that she is an enemy of the Wushuang Pavilion? That's why they're offering such a high reward."</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, don't misunderstand. The Wushuang Pavilion is only acting as an agent in this bounty. The one who commissioned it is someone else."</p><p></p><p>The Wushuang Pavilion manager explained.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan approached and took a look at the portrait. His gaze immediately turned cold.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Lingxiu! The one being hunted was actually Su Lingxiu!</p><p></p><p>"The mastermind behind the persecution of my shijie (sworn sister) has commissioned the Wushuang Pavilion to offer this bounty. Their strength must not be weak. But since I've encountered this, how can I let them succeed?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with murderous intent, but his expression remained calm. He stepped forward and took the portrait.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what are you doing?" The Wushuang Pavilion manager frowned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had directly gone to the top floor of the Wushuang Pavilion, and not many people had seen him, so they did not recognize him as "Xie Lingfeng" for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"I'm familiar with this woman, I think I've seen her somewhere before. I'll take this bounty."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>"Really?" The manager was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, quickly take me to collect the reward."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan urged.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>The manager hurriedly led Xu Yan out of the Wushuang Pavilion's main hall, while the other martial artists looked disappointed. The bounty had just been announced, but someone had already snatched it.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few people whose gazes flickered, seemingly contemplating something, and they quietly left the Wushuang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you can leave the clues here. After we confirm them, you can collect the reward."</p><p></p><p>They arrived at a study, and the manager spoke with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. "No, the reward for the clues is too little. Whoever finds the person, I'll take them there, and the reward should be a Grade 7 spirit herb and 100,000 spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>"This..." The manager was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to know the person's whereabouts, don't be stingy. It can't be less than 100,000 spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The manager pondered for a moment and said, "Alright, young master, you leave the clues here. After we confirm them, we'll give you the full 100,000 spirit crystal reward. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered and said, "To be honest, I don't trust you. What if you catch the person and then refuse to give me the crystals, claiming the clues were wrong? Then I would have wasted my efforts. Give me the crystals first, and I'll personally take you there. If we don't find her, I'll return the money in full!"</p><p></p><p>The manager had a helpless expression on his face and smiled, "Young master, you jest. The Wushuang Pavilion's reputation..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you secretly keeping the reward for yourself? That's why you're reluctant to let me see, afraid of exposing your embezzlement? Could it be that the actual reward is 1 million spirit crystals, and you're only offering 100,000?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly had a realization and stared at the manager.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The manager's face darkened, and after a moment, he nodded. "Then, young master, please wait a moment. I'll notify the client. I must remind you, though, to be careful when you take them there."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "Careful of what? Are you going to kill me to cover it up?"</p><p></p><p>The manager's mouth twitched. "Don't misunderstand. The client has nothing to do with the Wushuang Pavilion. I'm just reminding you to be cautious, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>"Then, young master, please wait."</p><p></p><p>The manager left.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the portrait of Su Lingxiu in his hand, his gaze cold and ruthless. Since they are the enemies of his shijie, they are also his enemies. When dealing with enemies, he cannot show any mercy!</p><p></p><p>"Shijie is worried about my safety in the inner realm and didn't tell me about the troubles she's facing. Now it seems the other side's strength is formidable, to the point of commissioning the Wushuang Pavilion for a bounty.</p><p></p><p>"It appears they don't know that shijie has fled to the Borderlands, and the Grandmaster from before hasn't sent any news back.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've encountered this, I'll take their spirit crystals, and their lives as well!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The Wushuang Pavilion manager had even warned him to be careful of being killed to cover it up, which showed that the client was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The manager returned.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed the manager and left the Wushuang Pavilion, boarding a small boat and heading out towards the Thousand Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, have you reconsidered? With the Wushuang Pavilion as the intermediary, we can ensure your safety, and the other side won't dare to deceive you."</p><p></p><p>The manager spoke.</p><p></p><p>"This woman must be extremely important to them. 100,000 spirit crystals seems a bit too little. I'll negotiate the price with them directly."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The manager: ...</p><p></p><p>The boat reached the outskirts of the Thousand Star Lake, where two figures in black robes stood amidst the flowers and grass, their faces obscured.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart grew cold as he saw them. These were two Grandmaster-level martial artists, one at the peak and one at the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Their attire and appearance were exactly the same as the previous Grandmaster.</p><p>This was an extremely powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"These two gentlemen are the ones the young master has information about."</p><p></p><p>The manager spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster at the pinnacle looked at Xu Yan and asked in a deep voice, "Are you truly saying you've seen the woman in the portrait?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I've seen her treating people's illnesses in a certain place before."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the two black-robed figures' eyes gleamed with excitement. The urgency in their tone was evident.</p><p></p><p>"Where is she? Hurry and tell us!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained calm and collected as the boat continued towards the outer reaches of the Thousand Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you there, but you need to have the spirit crystals ready first."</p><p></p><p>As the boat reached the shore, Xu Yan got off and looked at the black-robed figures.</p><p></p><p>The Wushuang Pavilion manager had already left, believing that Xu Yan was courting death and would be killed to cover it up.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete.)</p>

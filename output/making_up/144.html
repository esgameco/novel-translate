        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After staying here for a few days and saving a lot of spirit crystals, I should give some guidance to Leng Qiu.</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu was immediately energized, for this was a true master of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"Then how should I cultivate correctly?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed a tree branch, saying, "I won't teach you too much more, as the sword dao is too profound, and you may not be able to comprehend it all at once. In the future, you can ask Brother Xie for guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will teach you the sword technique, which is also the sword technique of your Sword Saint Cliff. It is the Myriad River Sword Technique that I have improved upon."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xu Yan swung the tree branch, with sword qi surging, demonstrating and explaining the Myriad River Sword Technique to Leng Qiu step by step.</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu watched solemnly, afraid of missing any detail.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan finished, he tossed the tree branch and said, "How much you can remember and learn depends entirely on you."</p><p></p><p>He then turned and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Where can I find you, Senior Brother Xie?"</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"In the Treasure Trove of the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>The Treasure Trove had countless classics, and he wanted to browse through them, expand his knowledge. A true warrior is not a reckless person.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan always remembered his master's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Soon after he left, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Leng Qiu, where is Brother Xu?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xie, you've finally come. He went to the Treasure Trove of the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu, who was still pondering the sword technique Xu Yan had taught, turned around and joyfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, did you really tell him that he can use your name for anything he encounters in the inner realm?"</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched, and he coughed dryly, saying, "You don't need to ask about the matters between me and Brother Xu."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Treasure Trove of the Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>In the Treasure Trove of the Seven Star Academy, on the ninth floor, Xu Yan was browsing through the remaining classics. After finishing them, he went to the eighth floor to continue his reading.</p><p></p><p>The more he read, the more he felt amazed. "No wonder my master said not to be arrogant. Coming to the inner realm, I need to read more. The martial arts techniques and secret arts in the inner realm are too numerous, including sword techniques, spear techniques, and blade techniques, as well as various biographies and cultivation insights, and methods to deal with powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Although these techniques and secret arts are relatively weak, they can be used for cross-reference, allowing me to gain new insights. I can extract the essence and integrate it into myself, encompassing the myriad techniques."</p><p></p><p>After browsing through the martial arts classics of the Seven Star Academy, Xu Yan felt that his knowledge had greatly expanded, making it easier for him to comprehend the martial arts his master had taught.</p><p></p><p>A figure entered the Seven Star Academy, holding a folding fan and chatting casually with an instructor.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Senior Brother Yin Hong has already broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm."</p><p></p><p>The instructor sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It was with the help of a benefactor, just a stroke of luck. I just recently broke through," Yin Hong said modestly.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was still the same as before, with many talented cultivators from the inner realm coming to study, hoping to receive guidance from renowned masters.</p><p></p><p>He himself was once a student of the Seven Star Academy. After reaching the Saint realm, he left the academy and ventured into the inner realm, breaking through to the Grandmaster realm. However, he was unable to break through to the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>He remained at the threshold of the Great Grandmaster realm, residing on Canglan Island and becoming a renowned expert in the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After receiving help from a benefactor, the last time he took action, he ended up retreating in defeat.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was Sword Saint Cliff's Xie Lingfeng who intervened, his benefactor did not blame him for his failure, but instead bestowed upon him a sixth-grade spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>With his accumulated cultivation over the years, he finally broke through to the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Seven Star Academy to help his benefactor, seeking out talented students to recruit, and also to maintain the long-standing relationship with the academy.</p><p></p><p>"I just arrived in Seven Star City and heard that Sword Saint Cliff's Xie Lingfeng has already passed the Nine-Layer Tempering Arena? Is our Seven Star Academy really being overshadowed by Sword Saint Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong seemed somewhat resentful.</p><p></p><p>Being defeated by Xu Yan and forced to retreat in disgrace, he was still harboring a grudge.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't fear Sword Saint Cliff, he would have immediately sought out Xie Lingfeng for a reckoning after breaking through to the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Xie Lingfeng was the genius of Sword Saint Cliff, and as a mere Great Grandmaster, if he dared to bully Xie Lingfeng, he would be crushed to dust in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even his benefactor would not be able to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was not just the genius of Sword Saint Cliff, but also the current Sword Sovereign, the only son of Xie Tiangheng, a Great Grandmaster ranked among the top five in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng is a prodigy, and our generation of the Seven Star Academy has no one who can match him. How can we deal with this?" The instructor shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't the academy elders do anything about it?" Yin Hong asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What can the elders do about the affairs of the younger generation? Besides, Elder Fu Dajianshe has already intervened, and the matter has been settled. Geniuses have their own rules, and our Seven Star Academy has always valued geniuses, not suppressing them."</p><p></p><p>The instructor gave Yin Hong a strange look.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like Yin Hong harbored some resentment towards Xie Lingfeng. However, although Yin Hong was once a student of the Seven Star Academy, he had long since become independent outside, and had no right to interfere with the academy's affairs, so the academy naturally would not get involved in his matters.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yin Hong did not continue to say anything. Trying to incite the Seven Star Academy against Xie Lingfeng was clearly impossible. He could only endure the resentment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, Sword Saint Cliff was someone he could not provoke.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xie Lingfeng?" Yin Hong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"In the Treasure Trove, he's been there for two days already," the instructor replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I've had the chance to meet him before, and it's been a while since I've seen him. I'd like to take a look at the genius's demeanor."</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong smiled and headed towards the Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Du Yuying and Cuier were also heading towards the Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, when will Xu Yan come out?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Treasure Trove, a group of Seven Star Academy students had gathered, all waiting for Xu Yan to emerge. Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were mixed among the crowd, also waiting for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan entered the Treasure Trove, access had been temporarily restricted to prevent these students from disturbing him. Even if they entered, they could only stay on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>As outsiders who had not passed the Tempering Arena, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan naturally could not enter.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did enter the Treasure Trove, they would not be able to find Xu Yan, as he was on the eighth or ninth floor.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, look at all these geniuses from the Seven Star Academy, they're all here for Xie Lingfeng. If I dare to reveal my name, what do you think will happen?" Xie Lingfeng said, on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, they have no right to look down on you. Although your strength may not be as great as Xu Yan's, which of these people can be your match?" Hu Shan comforted.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded, for this was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not as good as Brother Xu, in the inner realm, I am still one of the top figures in the younger generation, and there are few who can match my sword dao."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xie Lingfeng straightened his back.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xie Lingfeng spotted a familiar figure, and his pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Why is she here?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan curiously followed his gaze, and there was a woman in plain clothes, her face covered by a veil, making it impossible to see her features. By her side stood an elderly woman - that was the Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, do you know her?"</p><p></p><p>"The one from the Matchless Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the woman in plain clothes did not seem to have any seductive intentions, she was just a delicate young woman, and her face could not be seen, that was all.</p><p></p><p>However, Xie Lingfeng was extremely wary of her in his heart. Among his peers in the Inner Realm, this woman was the only one he was wary of.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a shrill scream came: "Miss, Miss, it's him, the evil villain who is impersonating Young Master Xie!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng: !!!</p><p></p><p>He turned around and saw the maid from the Du Marquis Mansion, who was now glaring angrily, and next to her stood another woman also wearing a veil.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's gaze was cold as she stared fiercely at Xie Lingfeng, "Sir, why are you impersonating Young Master Xie? Are you trying to tarnish his reputation again?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a misunderstanding..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"What misunderstanding? Aren't you called Xie Yan?" </p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes looked at him with a questioning gaze.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng suddenly felt immense pressure, as everyone was glaring at him, seemingly ready to scold him and drown him in saliva.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they could use force, they would probably rush up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, fortunately, the Seven Star Academy here does not allow fighting!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said with relief.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xie Lingfeng was at his wit's end, a figure walked out of the Typical Repository.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Xie Brother, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw Xie Lingfeng and immediately walked over excitedly.</p><p></p><p>As for Du Yuying and the woman in plain clothes, he simply ignored them...</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng felt a sense of relief, grabbing Xu Yan's hands excitedly, his eyes brimming with tears, "Brother Xu, you've finally come out!"</p><p></p><p>If he didn't come out soon, Xie Lingfeng wouldn't be able to hold on.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was a bit dazed, "Brother Xu"? Wasn't that Xie Lingfeng?</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the woman in plain clothes also had expressions of surprise on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Brother, your reputation is really useful, without your name, I wouldn't have been able to reach the ninth floor."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>"Useful is good, useful is good!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng showed a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xie, you're not..."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was already dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan seemed to have just noticed Du Yuying and greeted her, "It's been a while, are you a student of the Seven Star Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's mood was complex as she softly said, "Yuying is grateful for the Young Master's escort, may I ask how the Young Master wishes to be addressed?"</p><p></p><p>It was already very clear that this person was not the Sword Saint Cliff's Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Well, this..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head, not knowing whether to say his own name.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was shocked, such a prodigy, who had passed the nine-story Arena, was actually not the Sword Saint Cliff's Xie Lingfeng?</p><p></p><p>He had used Xie Lingfeng's name to enter the Typical Repository.</p><p></p><p>And the real Xie Lingfeng didn't seem to care, he let Xu Yan use his name.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was afraid that Xu Yan would continue to use his name and establish a reputation, which he wouldn't be able to bear, so he hurriedly whispered, "Brother Xu, your strength is powerful, and you are roaming the Inner Realm, how can you not have any reputation?</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you take this opportunity to spread your reputation, just like me, Xie Lingfeng, who is also known as the 'Sword Immortal Xie Lingfeng', I've killed many evil Demonic Cultivators for this reputation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought it made sense, he was already at the peak of the Innate Realm, even Grand Masters couldn't do anything to him, and he had come to the Inner Realm, so he couldn't just have no reputation at all. "My Master said I have the bearing of a Sword God, I must become a Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan suddenly became spirited and clasped his fists, "I am the Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng: ...</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>As usual, so arrogant, Sword God?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Cliff, how would he see this? "So it's Young Master Xu."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying spoke softly, her gaze a bit complex.</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes had a strange expression, this young man was actually not from the Sword Saint Cliff, where did he come from? So arrogant, he had already called himself the Sword God! Even the current Sword Master, the great Xie Tianheng, who was renowned as the number one expert in the Inner Realm, did not dare to call himself the Sword God!</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was in a puzzled mood, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you impersonate someone else's identity and sneak into the Typical Repository, are you mocking the Seven Star Academy?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone present was stunned.</p><p></p><p>That's right, since he was not Xie Lingfeng, but had used Xie Lingfeng's name to enter the ninth floor, this was deceiving the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed the voice and raised his eyebrows, "Oh, it's you, the half-baked one. Huh, you've actually broken through? It's not easy!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong was furious when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>He had been harboring a lot of anger, because he was in awe of the Sword Saint Cliff and dared not have any thoughts of retaliation.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was pleasantly surprised to find that the other party was not Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>And he had even used the name to sneak into the Typical Repository, the strong ones of the Seven Star Academy should come out to uphold the rules, right? But when he opened his mouth, he was disdained.</p><p></p><p>Half-baked? "Insulting the Grand Master, you're looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yin Hong's aura erupted, like a majestic divine might, surging outward.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice came, and Yin Hong's aura was immediately suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's heart trembled, and he hurriedly restrained his aura, bowing and saying, "Greetings, Grand Tutor!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian looked at Xu Yan with a complex expression, thinking he was the genius of the Sword Saint Cliff, but it turned out to be someone impersonating the name! How dare he? "Grand Tutor, this person..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong pointed at Xu Yan and spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"You half-baked thing, you're so arrogant, daring to point at me? If a single palm can't explode you, I, Xu Yan, will take your life!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was angered.</p><p></p><p>What kind of thing is this, trying to intimidate him?</p><p></p><p>He's looking to die!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat down cross-legged with a solemn expression, looking at these martial arts scholars - they were all people obsessed with the martial arts, perhaps with unique understandings of the martial way.</p><p></p><p>Or they might have cultivated some extraordinary martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, there isn't a single one who cultivates the true martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at these martial arts scholars, secretly surprised, "Could it be that the Seven Star Academy also doesn't have the true martial arts? If that's the case, the inner domain martial artists are truly pitiful!" These were all fanatical martial arts enthusiasts, if he told them the truth that what they cultivated was false martial arts, they probably wouldn't be able to bear the blow.</p><p></p><p>"So, I'll just expound on some martial arts fundamentals, and won't mention the true and false, lest they can't handle it.</p><p></p><p>"Although they cultivate false martial arts, but through long-term research, they might have some unique insights."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought this way, and his spirits were suddenly lifted, looking forward to this martial arts discussion, hoping to gain some harvest.</p><p></p><p>"For the martial arts discussion, should the young friend first expound on his own understanding of the martial arts, or should we start first?" asked one of the martial arts scholars.</p><p></p><p>"You all are older, so you can start first," Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me start the discussion. I've always believed that the martial arts are about empowering oneself, pursuing one's own transcendence. Starting from the Nine Grades of Body Refinement, strengthening the physique, enhancing one's strength..."</p><p></p><p>The first martial arts scholar began to expound on his own understanding of the martial arts, explaining each martial arts realm one by one.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened silently. Although he had a general understanding of the inner domain martial arts, the specific differences between each realm were not detailed.</p><p></p><p>Listening to this martial arts scholar's exposition, his understanding of the inner domain martial arts became more detailed.</p><p></p><p>"Master didn't talk about the true and false martial arts for a reason. This inner domain martial arts is actually a complete martial arts system, just not perfect enough.</p><p></p><p>"Or you could say, they haven't cultivated to the fundamentals.</p><p></p><p>"Like the Nine Grades realm, it belongs to body refinement, just strengthening the physique, enhancing strength and toughening the bones and tendons, but without tempering the skin, bones, and viscera.</p><p></p><p>"It seems they only cultivate on the surface, without delving into the depths."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed as he listened.</p><p></p><p>The first martial arts scholar had expounded from the Nine Grades realm all the way to the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Xu Yan had a complete understanding of the cultivation of inner domain martial artists. He sighed inwardly, "Although the system is complete, the cultivation always gives a sense of being superficial, so calling it false martial arts is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the other martial arts scholars expounded on the martial arts, and each martial arts cultivation had its differences, but they all did not transcend the framework of the inner domain martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, it's your turn now!" the last martial arts scholar, after finishing his own understanding of the martial arts, smiled and looked at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. This martial arts discussion was not without harvest for him. These martial arts scholars were obviously more knowledgeable about the inner domain martial arts than the martial artists outside, and their research was deeper.</p><p></p><p>It gave Xu Yan some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the martial arts is the most important. My master once said, 'The tree that can fill the arms grows from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rises from a heap of earth.' Therefore, the beginning of the martial arts lies in refining the skin, refining the bones, refining the viscera..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts scholars were dumbfounded, and Fu Yunian beside them also had a bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>Refine the skin? Refine the bones? Refine the viscera? How to cultivate? "Young friend, young friend, please stop for a moment, what is this refining the skin, refining the bones, refining the viscera? Is this how the martial arts are cultivated from the beginning?" asked one of the martial arts scholars in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Xu Yan nodded solemnly and said, "The true martial arts are about tempering oneself from the inside out and from the outside in, an all-round refinement, to transcend the mundane, to achieve immortality!"</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts scholars swallowed hard, this vision was a bit too high.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, who has achieved immortality?</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, tell us more about this refining the skin, what is it about?" asked one of the martial arts scholars curiously.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method they had never heard of had piqued their curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the skin, the first step is to sense the blood qi, and use the blood qi to temper the skin. Once the skin is refined, even ordinary knives and swords will find it difficult to harm..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" exclaimed one of the martial arts scholars excitedly. "Even for a Third Grade martial artist, relying solely on their own physique, they would not be able to achieve the feat of being unharmed by knives and swords. According to what the young friend said, this is just the first step of martial arts cultivation, it's absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>The rest nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at them with a pitiful gaze, they were frogs in a well, truly terrible. When he told them the sky was vast, they immediately jumped up and denied it, claiming the sky was just this small!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of gaze is that?" the martial arts scholar with dark circles under his eyes said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"Being unharmed by ordinary knives and swords after refining the skin is not strange at all. As for what you said about Third Grade martial artists, their cultivation method is different, the toughness of the skin is only slightly stronger than ordinary people, naturally able to withstand the harm of knives and swords.</p><p></p><p>"Just because you have never seen or heard of it, does not mean it does not exist."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan retracted his gaze of looking at a frog in a well.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I absolutely do not believe it, and that blood qi, how to activate and temper the skin, it's not credible!" the martial arts scholar shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Don't interrupt, let the young friend continue to speak," another martial arts scholar said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you continue!" Xu Yan continued, "After refining the skin, it's time to refine the bones. Refining the bones can be divided into Iron Bones, Copper Bones, Gold Bones, and Jade Bones. Iron Bones are just ordinary, Copper Bones are already quite good, while Gold Bones, even if buried underground for thousands of years, will still remain indestructible. As for Jade Bones... I don't think there's a need to say more."</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts scholars listened in a daze, hearing about Iron Bones, Copper Bones, Gold Bones, it all sounded so mysterious and incredible, it didn't seem credible at all.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Xu Yan with skepticism, this young man, could it be that he had read some fabricated novels and was now confused? Fu Yunian also had an expression of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!" the martial arts scholars said, suppressing their curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"After refining the bones, it's time to refine the viscera... When the tendons and bones thunder, the blood qi is like a fierce storm, then it reaches the Blood Qi Realm... Connecting the Heaven and Earth Bridge, inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, refining it into the Primordial True Qi, that is the Primordial Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan expounded the martial arts completely.</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts students all stared with wide eyes, completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Are you just making this up?" one of the martial arts scholars couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>This was just too mysterious, talking about tendons and bones thundering, blood qi like a fierce storm, connecting the Heaven and Earth Bridge, inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Blood Qi Realm, Primordial Realm? </p><p></p><p>Where in the martial arts were there such realms!</p><p></p><p>"How could this be made up?" Xu Yan looked at them with the gaze of looking at frogs in a well, and stretched out his hand, "Look at my arm, knives and swords can't harm it."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, what you said is not realistic at all," a martial arts scholar shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If the martial arts Xu Yan expounded really existed, then what they cultivated would be so weak in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Both in terms of the mystical nature and the terminology, it was several levels apart.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's discuss and see if what I said is true or false."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's discuss then."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary!" </p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts scholars displayed their own martial arts and expounded on the fundamentals and strengths of the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After a lengthy discussion of the martial arts,</p><p></p><p>All the martial arts scholars were dumbfounded, with an expression of disbelief on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Both in terms of theory, Xu Yan's was more profound and sounded stronger, and even in terms of actual strength and the profundity of the martial arts, he had crushed them.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, they were greatly shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"There is such a martial art in the world? Is there something wrong with what I've cultivated?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the martial arts scholars fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood up, revealing a satisfied smile. These fellows have now realized how insignificant they are, haven't they? Realized how weak the martial arts they've cultivated are?</p><p></p><p>"You all should go back and ponder deeply, perhaps you will gain some insights?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned and left. He also had some new ideas, preparing to find a place to complete the separation of his true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, don't be in a hurry to leave, discuss it further with us."</p><p></p><p>A martial arts scholar called out.</p><p></p><p>After this discussion of the martial arts, they felt that their understanding of the martial arts seemed to have collapsed, their state of mind shaken, even doubting whether the martial arts they had cultivated for half their lives were wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have time now, we'll talk another time!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went downstairs.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian saw him off and couldn't help but ask, "Were those things you said just made up to deceive them?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The more obsessed with martial arts someone is, the more trapped they are in the abyss of martial arts, the more easily their state of mind will be shaken and the more they will doubt the martial arts they have cultivated when they encounter the true principles of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists like Fu Yuntian, they don't have such strong self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>"These martial arts scholars are truly passionate about the martial arts. If I want to spread the true martial arts, starting from them would be a good approach."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian opened his mouth but ultimately did not continue to ask.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts discussion had obviously defeated the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Whether Xu Yan's exposition of the martial arts was fabricated or not, that group of martial arts scholars had all been struck hard, and naturally they had been defeated.</p><p></p><p>As he came out of the Treasure Vault, Xu Yan saw a large crowd outside, all there to observe him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young master!" </p><p></p><p>A young female martial artist shouted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Xie Lingfeng? So young!"</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy! If I had his prodigy, wouldn't I have no worries about not having a junior sister to pursue me?"</p><p></p><p>"No, as long as I have half the handsomeness of Xie Lingfeng, I wouldn't lack junior sisters either!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not linger, he just wanted to find a place to live and complete the separation of his true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie's reputation is growing bigger and bigger!"</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, feeling happy for Brother Xie.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands towards Fu Yuntian and his figure flickered, quickly disappearing into the crowd and striding out of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian's pupils contracted, what fast footwork! Xu Yan hurriedly left the Seven Star Academy and headed for the nearest Seven Star City, planning to find a place to temporarily reside and complete the separation of his true qi, and then break through to the peak of the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Treasure Vault of the Seven Star Academy, after reading many classics and discussing the martial arts with the group of martial arts scholars, he had gained some new insights.</p><p></p><p>He could quickly complete the separation of his true qi! Once the separation of true qi was complete and he had comprehended the profundity of true qi, breaking through to the peak of the Xiantian Realm would be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"I need to cultivate, staying at an inn won't do, I need to find a secluded courtyard, but the price will probably not be low."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt stingy at the thought of having to spend a large amount of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Although he had more spirit stones now, if he used them to buy spirit medicines, it would still be a lot. Calculating it, he was still quite poor.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where Sister's enemies are, if I can set up a few branches, I might get rich quickly."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed over and blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sword Saint Cliff Cold Autumn, may I ask why you are impersonating my teacher brother?"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, a disciple of the Sword Saint Cliff?</p><p></p><p>He immediately said unhappily, "Don't talk nonsense, what do you mean by impersonating? I have Brother Xie's permission for this!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn was taken aback. "My teacher brother allowed you?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Brother Xie said that in the Inner Realm, I can use his name for anything!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You must have misunderstood, Brother Xie allowing you to use his name doesn't mean..."</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn was a bit confused. Xu Yan looked at him like he was an idiot and said, "Are you stupid? You don't know how to properly use a name? Do you think you can just say you're Brother Xie's friend and people will listen to you? Others can also say they're Brother Xie's friends, it has no deterrent effect."</p><p></p><p>"You don't even know how to properly use a name? Of course I just report that I am Xie Lingfeng, look, I was able to enter the Seven Star Academy's Treasure Vault, didn't I?"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn was dumbfounded, his mouth agape, not knowing how to refute this.</p><p></p><p>This made so much sense! </p><p></p><p>How could a friend of Xie Lingfeng have more influence than Xie Lingfeng himself?</p><p></p><p>"Is it really with my teacher brother's permission?"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>How could his teacher brother let someone use his name like this?</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan affirmed.</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes lit up, he put his hand on Cold Autumn's shoulder, full of enthusiasm, and said, "Tell Brother Xie, I, Xu Yan, have come to the Inner Realm, I've helped him gain fame, no need to thank me!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn's mouth twitched, he didn't know what expression his teacher brother would have when he learned that his name had shaken the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I've already notified my teacher brother, he should be on his way to the Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn felt that this young man called Xu Yan was a bit too enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"Cold Brother, you are a disciple of the Sword Saint Cliff, you have a residence in Seven Star City, right? Is it an independent courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Sword Saint Cliff has a few villas in Seven Star City, and I live in one of them."</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn nodded truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Great, let's go, I'll stay at your villa for a few days while I wait for Brother Xie to come."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted. </p><p></p><p>He had already used Brother Xie's name, so staying at the Sword Saint Cliff's villa was no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn's head was spinning, he had a somewhat absurd idea that the other party seemed to be here to freeload a place to stay.</p><p></p><p>"Since he is a friend of my teacher brother, it's only reasonable for him to stay at the villa for a while."</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed Cold Autumn to a villa in Seven Star City, which was one of the Sword Saint Cliff's villas in the city. It was relatively secluded, and there were no other Sword Saint Cliff disciples there for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Possibly the other disciples were staying at the other villas.</p><p></p><p>"This is secluded enough, even if I make some commotion, it won't disturb others."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

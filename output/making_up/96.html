            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 96: Nurturing the Sword with Intent, the Great Sun Golden Body</p><p></p><p>After passing on the method of nurturing the sword to Meng Chong, Meng Chong never parted with his sword from then on, constantly nourishing it with his qi and blood, while also pondering how he could nurture the sword with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Whether Meng Chong could nurture the sword and awaken the sword spirit, Li Xuan could only wait for time to give him the answer.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Meng Chong's cultivation did not slack off, but instead became even more diligent.</p><p></p><p>The completion of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had been shuttling back and forth between Yunshan County, East River Prefecture, and the Qi Kingdom's capital, becoming more and more proficient and profound in the Heaven Thunder Flash Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation also did not slack off, and the small completion of the Xiantian Realm was not too far away.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered that it was about time to pass on the cultivation methods above the Xiantian Realm to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Xu Yan's shuttling between the three places was nothing more than wanting to quickly improve the strength of his parents and others. Once they had sufficient strength,</p><p></p><p>he could then go and venture into the Inner Domain without worry.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had long yearned for the Inner Domain. In his eyes, the Borderland was too boring, with hardly any cultivators.</p><p></p><p>From Xie Lingfeng's words, he knew that the Inner Domain was vast, with numerous sects and countless cultivators, the cultivation world of the Inner Domain was extremely prosperous, far beyond the barren Borderland.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators should go and roam the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's help, the Xu family members' cultivation did progress faster, but to reach the level of entering the cultivation world, it would still take a considerable amount of time.</p><p></p><p>As for reaching the Xiantian Realm, given their current cultivation progress, they probably wouldn't have any hope of doing so within ten years.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had entered the stage of nurturing the sword, spending most of his time between the mountains and forests outside the city, or sitting on the hillside.</p><p></p><p>He was seeking the enlightenment of nurturing the sword, wanting to enter the realm of nurturing the sword with intent, nurturing the sword with the mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't know whether he had made any progress. After all, this nurturing the sword method was something he had created, and his realm was far stronger than Meng Chong's.</p><p></p><p>However, such a mysterious nurturing of the sword, he was still unable to discern the specific progress.</p><p></p><p>He didn't pay too much attention to it either, as long as Meng Chong didn't neglect his cultivation, even if he couldn't nurture the sword or awaken the sword spirit, as long as his realm continued to improve, he would continue to receive the feedback from the golden finger.</p><p></p><p>That day, he was studying an ancient parchment.</p><p></p><p>He decided to change his method, only studying the first page and the first pattern of the ancient parchment each day, focusing on one page, perhaps he would gain some harvest.</p><p></p><p>A golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has completed the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, your physical body has been promoted, the defense of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering has been enhanced, and your true qi has slightly increased."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had completed the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, breaking through to the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, the next step would be perfection.</p><p></p><p>He also received the feedback from the golden finger, although Meng Chong's realm was one major realm lower than him, the feedback was relatively less.</p><p></p><p>But his physical body had also increased by more than double.</p><p></p><p>The defense of his Great Sun Golden Bell Covering had also increased by more than double, and his true qi had increased by about 80%.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, satisfied with the harvest from the golden finger feedback.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to pass on the physical cultivation method of the Xiantian Realm to Meng Chong, hoping that he can comprehend it before reaching perfection, so that I can also obtain the physical cultivation of the Xiantian Realm."</p><p></p><p>The integration of orthodox cultivation and physical cultivation, would it bring even greater harvests?</p><p></p><p>Just like the Diamond Vajra Bone + Jade Bone, transforming into the Xiantian Spiritual Bone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of expectations, with both orthodox cultivation and physical cultivation reaching the Xiantian Realm, his strength would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if he was surrounded by five or six great sect masters, he would be able to easily defeat them.</p><p></p><p>Even their physical defense would be unable to break through his.</p><p></p><p>Outside Yunshan County, on a small mountain peak, Meng Chong sat cross-legged, gripping the sword hilt. At this moment, he seemed to have sensed a mysterious feeling.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand seemed to be responding to his heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had already been nurturing the sword with his mind.</p><p></p><p>During this period of sword nurturing, he could vaguely perceive the changes in the sword in his hand, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what exactly had changed.</p><p></p><p>He had even been tempted to draw the sword out several times.</p><p></p><p>But he ultimately resisted.</p><p></p><p>"Withdrawing the sword midway would ruin everything, I cannot draw the sword!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to cultivate while trying to resonate with the sword.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Bell Covering had finally been completed, and the perfection was not far away.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can succeed in nurturing the sword and awaken the sword spirit before breaking through to the Xiantian Realm."</p><p></p><p>The earlier he awakened the sword spirit, the stronger his potential would be.</p><p></p><p>Awakening the sword spirit at the Qi and Blood Realm would be different from awakening it at the Xiantian Realm. </p><p></p><p>A cultivator who awakens the sword spirit at the Qi and Blood Realm would naturally be stronger than one who awakens it at the Xiantian Realm when they both reach the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hoped that he could awaken the sword spirit at the Qi and Blood Realm, so that his foundation and potential would be stronger.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was cultivating and nurturing the sword.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have a flash of insight.</p><p></p><p>"When I cultivate the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, my heart is filled with the Great Sun, its meaning is clear. Whenever my heart is filled with the Great Sun, resonating with the Great Sun in the sky, the cultivation speed would increase, and the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering would have a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should nurture the sword in the same way? If my heart's sword resonates with the sword in my hand, this would be nurturing the sword with intent.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true way of nurturing the sword, only by doing so can I awaken the sword spirit.</p><p></p><p>"But how do I make my heart's sword resonate with the sword in my hand?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know what his heart's sword looked like.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, as long as I persevere, I will eventually be able to make my heart's sword resonate with the sword in my hand."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As he cultivated, his heart was filled with the Great Sun, gradually resonating with the Great Sun in the sky, his body feeling as if it was being forged in a furnace, with the sound of a golden bell ringing within.</p><p></p><p>With his continued cultivation, Meng Chong gradually sensed a sword's outline emerging in his heart's Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>The sword was hidden within the Great Sun, seemingly being tempered and transforming.</p><p></p><p>As he cultivated, the outline of the sword became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>"This is my heart's sword!</p><p></p><p>"I am tempering my heart's sword with the Great Sun, and if I can make it resonate with the sword in my hand, this would be nurturing the sword with intent, nurturing the sword with the mind, nurturing the sword with the body!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a moment of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I cultivate steadfastly, step by step, without haste or impatience, I will gradually be able to make my heart's sword resonate with the sword in my hand, gradually entering the realm of nurturing the sword with intent and nurturing the sword with the mind."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He knew that he had finally grasped the correct way of nurturing the sword, and with time, he would surely be able to nurture the sword and awaken the sword spirit.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to cultivate step by step, steadfastly.</p><p></p><p>After gaining the insight of nurturing the sword with intent, Meng Chong became even more diligent in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He wished he could cultivate day and night.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he cultivated, his heart was filled with the Great Sun, resonating with the Great Sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The knife in his heart gradually became clearer, its outline becoming more distinct, and he was one step closer to resonating with the knife in his hand, cultivating the realm of the knife with his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation requires a balance of work and rest, resonating with the great sun in the sky, but it ultimately consumes one's mental energy and cannot be sustained. If one stubbornly persists, it may damage one's mental state and harm oneself."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong withdrew his mental energy, no longer resonating with the great sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Once one's mental state is damaged, it takes a considerable amount of time to recover, and it will only hinder one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That day, during Meng Chong's cultivation, he suddenly felt a stirring in his heart, and the knife in his hand seemed to have entered his heart, as if resonating with his mental state, merging with his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The knife in his heart became clear at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, it became identical to the knife in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The knife in his heart resonated with the knife in his hand!</p><p></p><p>"This is cultivating the knife with my heart, with my intent. I have finally truly begun to cultivate the knife. As long as I persist, one day when the knife and I resonate, when my heart is the knife's heart, my soul is the knife's soul, that will be the day I draw the knife, and the awakening of the knife's spirit."</p><p></p><p>"I have just begun to cultivate the knife, just started to cultivate it with my heart and intent."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how long it would take to complete the cultivation of the knife, to awaken the knife's spirit.</p><p></p><p>But he firmly believed that as long as he persisted, there would come a day when the knife's spirit would awaken.</p><p></p><p>A figure descended beside him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hurriedly stood up and greeted, "Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his disciple, and his spirit seemed a bit different. Could it be that the cultivation of the knife had made progress?</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't see anything obvious, his gaze seemed to have seen through everything.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will teach you the method of the innate physical body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed and said, "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"You should ponder and comprehend it well. When you have fully comprehended it, and your qi and blood are complete, you can then break through to the Innate Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan hoped that Meng Chong could comprehend the technique soon.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had one hand behind his back, his gaze looking into the distance, with a mysterious aura enveloping him, fully displaying the bearing of a superior person.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the physical body lies in the profundity of the physical body. A powerful physical body means a powerful self, opening up the secret treasures of the physical body, and strengthening the divine power of the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke word by word.</p><p></p><p>He began to explain the technique of the Innate Realm of the Dao of the physical body that he had already prepared.</p><p></p><p>"The foundational technique of the Dao of the physical body is the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering. Of course, the foundation of the Dao of the physical body is not limited to this one technique, but the one I'm teaching you is the most powerful foundational technique of the Dao of the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was praising himself.</p><p></p><p>He muttered in his heart, "I didn't say anything wrong. After all, besides the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, I can also edit the Dragon Roar Iron Cloth Armor, so it's definitely not just one foundational technique."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened attentively, afraid of missing any word.</p><p></p><p>"To break through the Innate Realm of the Dao of the physical body, one must also penetrate the Heaven and Earth Bridge. This is the foundation, the unchanging principle. But unlike the orthodox martial arts, after opening the dan tian and sea of qi, the cultivation of the Dao of the physical body lies in opening the acupoints!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>"I will teach you the Great Sun Golden Body, opening the thirty-six golden body acupoints, activating the power of the physical body, and cultivating the profundity of the physical body within the acupoints. Each of the thirty-six golden body acupoints contains a unique profound change.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, cultivating the thirty-six acupoints, harmonious and unified, the golden body is immortal, the divine power is boundless..."</p><p></p><p>After the realm of qi and blood, when entering the Innate Realm, how should one cultivate the Dao of the physical body? Li Xuan had spent some time refining and perfecting this.</p><p></p><p>In orthodox martial arts, one opens the dan tian and sea of qi, circulating true qi through the celestial circulation. The sea of qi is vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>This is the cultivation of orthodox martial arts. Since the Dao of the physical body focuses on the physical body, it naturally differs from the cultivation of orthodox martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But if one does not circulate true qi through the celestial circulation, how can the physical body become powerful and possess great might?</p><p></p><p>That is to open the golden body acupoints, using the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to cultivate the acupoints, infusing it into one's body. When all thirty-six acupoints are opened, it would be equivalent to the realm above the Innate Realm in orthodox martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Each acupoint contains a unique profundity, and with each acupoint opened, the physical body will be strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he created the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dao of the physical body also opens the sea of qi, its focus is not on the sea of qi, but on using the sea of qi as a foundation to open the golden body acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-six golden body acupoints each have their own profundity. When a acupoint is opened and cultivated to perfection, if the physical body is injured, the profound power of the acupoint can instantly heal the wound... Once these acupoints are activated and cultivated, they can also expel toxins from the outside..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained one by one how to open and cultivate the golden body acupoints.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just the theoretical foundation. The specific cultivation and practice still depend on Meng Chong's own comprehension and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only when he successfully comprehends and cultivates it will he truly possess the Great Sun Golden Body technique.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened carefully, his expression filled with excitement. This Great Sun Golden Body is so powerful and profound.</p><p></p><p>Opening the thirty-six golden body acupoints, each one containing its own profundity.</p><p></p><p>When the thirty-six acupoints are unified, the golden body is immortal!</p><p></p><p>While explaining, Li Xuan also pointed out the general locations of the thirty-six acupoints for Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He had put a lot of thought into these thirty-six acupoints.</p><p></p><p>The acupoints were not randomly made up, but carefully selected by him based on the acupoints he knew from his previous life. The thirty-six acupoints form a cycle.</p><p></p><p>As for why it's thirty-six acupoints, it's because he couldn't remember more. </p><p></p><p>In order to form a cycle and have a higher chance of successful cultivation, after much contemplation and reduction, he settled on thirty-six acupoints.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, it matches the number of the celestial stems.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, once you have successfully opened and cultivated all thirty-six golden body acupoints, harmonious and unified, you will gain the transformations of the golden body. This is the profundity of the celestial stems. With a thought, your physical body will become boundless, transforming into a thirty-foot golden body, with formidable might!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's blood boiled with excitement, wishing he could immediately cultivate the Great Sun Golden Body and open all thirty-six golden body acupoints to perfection.</p><p></p><p>A thirty-foot golden body!</p><p></p><p>Directly transforming into a small giant!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how he would be able to fight others, crushing them like small mice with this powerful body, he was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciple's flushed and excited face, Li Xuan was very satisfied. The Great Sun Golden Body he had created was indeed very powerful and profound.</p><p></p><p>A thirty-foot golden body, it sounded mighty!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body has already transcended the Innate Realm and reached the realm above the Innate. As for how the Dao of the physical body should progress and be cultivated further, Li Xuan had a direction and outline, but had not yet edited it out.</p><p></p><p>This requires waiting for the orthodox martial arts to be edited out first, so he can have a reference.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation of the Dao of the physical body is an extension of the orthodox martial arts system.</p><p></p><p>This is also why Li Xuan only perfected the Great Sun Golden Body after having the realm above the Innate Realm in mind, finally editing out the thirty-six acupoints opening with the profundity of the celestial stems, transforming into a small giant, based on this foundation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

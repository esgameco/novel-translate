        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire inner domain has been quietly undergoing some changes. </p><p></p><p>It's as if there is a big hand behind the scenes, guiding the direction of everything.</p><p></p><p>Until this day, the Seven Star Academy suddenly announced a name change. From now on, the inner domain will no longer have the Seven Star Academy, but only the Great Desolate Martial Arts Academy! The status of the Seven Star Academy in the martial arts world of the inner domain is self-evident. Its sudden transformation into the Great Desolate Martial Arts Academy is like a huge rock being dropped into the calm lake.</p><p></p><p>Those powerful experts who know the inside story have all expressed their support.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, voices advocating the inner domain to be renamed as the Great Desolate also emerged.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the pressure on the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom has increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Desolate has remained inactive, as if replacing the Greatè¶ŠKingdom has already satisfied them.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil outside does not affect Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat acts like a chubby cat, scurrying in front of Su Lingxiu, acting cute to beg for medicinal pills as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pinches it a bit and gives it a bottle of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er has been frowning lately, as the Red Cat has made an extremely outrageous request.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat wants a large golden chain that can grow and shrink, so that when it manifests its huge true form, the golden chain can still hang around its neck. When it reduces its size, the golden chain will shrink accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just being unreasonable? Shi Er is so angry that he is about to explode. The Red Cat is getting revenge!</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat thinks its request is very reasonable, and keeps asking Shi Er for the golden chain every few days. If Shi Er can't provide it, the Red Cat will just pin him down in the mud with a paw.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan is sitting in a chair, holding the Taicangshu in his hands, indifferent to the grudge between Shi Er and the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Without pressure, where does the motivation come from? Shi Er has started to cultivate diligently, wanting to improve his strength so that he can beat up the Red Cat, although this wish of his is basically impossible to realize. But his diligent cultivation is still commendable.</p><p></p><p>Above the Lingting, the Dao Golden Book opens, and Li Xuan is writing martial arts cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods above the Shenyi Realm have been compiled, and Xu Yan is not far from fully comprehending the Tongxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Dao Golden Book emits a golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the initial form of the Danyi Martial Classic, you have obtained the second layer of the Danyi Martial Classic."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu has been delving into the Danyi Martial Classic, and finally has a harvest.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reveals a smile, the second layer of the Danyi Martial Classic. The art of medicinal pills is more complete, and the Danyi Martial Way has more and more powerful techniques, especially the Golden Needle Acupuncture and other methods, which are already very profound.</p><p></p><p>"Transmit the second layer of the Danyi Martial Classic to Su Lingxiu, so as to shorten the time for her to perfect it and research the third layer of the Danyi Martial Classic as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smilingly calls Su Lingxiu over.</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Tongxuan Realm for some time, your Void Pill Refining Art has also basically entered the door, and you have also comprehended the Danyi Martial Classic quite well. Today, I will pass on a new Danyi Martial Classic to you. You must diligently research and study it."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu is extremely excited, nodding her head and saying, "Yes, Master, your disciple will definitely work hard to study it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan transmits the second layer of the Danyi Martial Classic to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the second layer of the Danyi Martial Classic, Su Lingxiu has a sudden realization. The parts she couldn't understand before now make sense.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of insight appear in her mind, as if she has found the direction to continue her research on the Danyi Martial Classic.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continues to research the Danyi Martial Classic, while also cultivating the Void Pill Refining Art, and preparing the pills needed for the realms beyond the Tongxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong are once again comprehending the Bagua, the Life and Death Sword Wheel, and the Xun Wind Sword Intent, all of which are comprehended from the Bagua, continuously improving their own strength. The Bagua is a path.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong is also comprehending to improve the Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>Time passes peacefully, and half a year has gone by.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the peak of the Tongxuan Realm, your Shenyi Realm has advanced to the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan has broken through to the peak of the Tongxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a month after Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Tongxuan Realm peak, Meng Chong also broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the initial stage of the Tongxuan Realm, your Great Sun Golden Body has reached perfection (Tongxuan Realm)."</p><p></p><p>Their strength has been further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>In the following three months, Xu Yan and Meng Chong have successively comprehended new martial arts from the Bagua, and their strength has been continuously soaring.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu has also successfully comprehended a Great Marsh Divine Hoe, finally having a powerful offensive martial art in addition to the Xun Wind Divine Needle.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done, it's time to pass it on to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighs, the cultivation methods above the Shenyi Realm have finally been compiled one by one. It's time to pass them on to Xu Yan. Once Xu Yan comprehends them, his realm will continue to rise.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island remains peaceful, like a secluded land.</p><p></p><p>But the inner domain is full of unrest. The matter of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm has spread among the grand masters.</p><p></p><p>The fact that inner domain cultivators who enter the Gate of the Spiritual Realm will be despised and bullied has also become widely known.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some grand masters initially did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>After entering, they either died or were expelled.</p><p></p><p>Some grand masters even knelt and begged to enter the Spiritual Realm, hoping to obtain the cultivation method of the Martial Dao Celestials, but they were only mocked for their inferior talents, not qualified to obtain the Celestial's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>There have been dozens of grand masters who joined forces to forcibly enter the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, but they were all killed, and their bodies were thrown out.</p><p></p><p>Now, the anger of the grand masters in the inner domain is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the senior on Canglan Island who does not oppress others with his realm, the Celestials of the Spiritual Realm are simply trash!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a deep admiration for the powerful cultivator on Canglan Island arises.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gate of the Spiritual Realm has not disappeared, it no longer opens. According to the people inside, they were "pestered to death by a bunch of pigs and dogs!"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Water Star Palace is one of the Spiritual Realm's major sects, although it is not as powerful as the top-tier sects, it is still a top-tier force in its own territory.</p><p></p><p>In a elegant pavilion, a beautiful woman frowns and says, "What's wrong with Jiao Ming? It's been so long, and he still hasn't come back."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, perhaps Jiao Ming is delayed because he is playing around in the inner domain," a maid-dressed woman replies.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman snorts, "The barren inner domain is full of lowly pigs and dogs, what is there to play around? Jiao Ming is so incompetent, when he comes back, I will have to discipline him."</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman named Tang Jinyan speaks with disdain towards the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>The maid nods in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, she asks, "Miss, if you let Jiao Ming go to the inner domain to capture someone, and if the master finds out, what will we do?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan snorts coldly, "Where is he? Even if he knows, what can he do? Does he think I will kill myself just because of a bastard child in the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>"That womanizer has been running around everywhere, and now he has even gone to the inner domain, that den of pigs and dogs, and left behind a bastard child. It's embarrassing, I, Tang Jinyan, can't even control my own husband. I've become a laughingstock."</p><p></p><p>"If people find out that my husband has gone to the inner domain, that place of pigs and dogs, and left behind a bastard child, how can I still have any face?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan becomes angrier and angrier as she speaks.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But Miss, what if the young master cares about that person? Moreover, if they have exceptional talent, once the Wood family knows about it, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant still expressed some concern.</p><p></p><p>"Care? What right does he have to care? I am his wife, doesn't he care about me? Talent? That kind of pig-dog place called the Inner Realm is full of lowly people, what kind of talent could they possibly have?" It's just defiling the Wood family bloodline. If the Wood family elders knew about this, in order to not let the Wood family be disgraced, they would have already eliminated the bastard child."</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"That bastard Jiao Ming, likes to play around in lowly places, huh? You tell Pinger to go to the Inner Realm, capture the person, and tell Jiao Ming that if he doesn't immediately come back, he can just stay in that lowly place from now on."</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant responded.</p><p></p><p>At the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, between two great mountains, a grand palace was built in front of the Gate. Two middle-aged men were guarding the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Two figures descended from the sky and entered the palace, replacing the people responsible for guarding the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Spiritual Realm has been open for almost a year, the pigs and dogs from the Inner Realm, either killed or thrown back, why haven't you closed the Gate of the Spiritual Realm yet?</p><p></p><p>"It's not time yet to open the Gate of the Spiritual Realm and allow those with Jade Tokens from the Inner Realm to enter."</p><p></p><p>The replacing warrior frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Ming from the Water Star Palace went to the Inner Realm and has not yet returned. According to the rules, we need to wait for him to return before we can completely close the Gate of the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>The original guard spoke.</p><p></p><p>After the handover was completed, one warrior sighed, "The Blood Demon has already died without even leaving ashes, how could he still rise again? Isn't this being too cautious?"</p><p></p><p>The other warrior sighed, "The calamity of the Blood Demon, even Cultivated Celestial Beings were terrified of it. You know, the Blood Demon had risen and fallen three times. Didn't we also think that we had completely exterminated him before?"</p><p></p><p>"But the result? He rose again, and the blood calamity swept through the Inner Realm once more."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the four of them fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon, a figure that could not be bypassed in the history of the Spiritual Realm's martial dao.</p><p></p><p>A truly monstrous demon of slaughter, who had sacrificed countless martial artists with blood. Rising and falling three times, even the lofty Cultivated Celestial Beings, how many of them died at his hands?</p><p></p><p>In the final battle, the Blood Demon fled into the Inner Realm, and a group of experts pursued him there, but none returned! The second time experts entered the Inner Realm, they erased the existence of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm and many records related to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though the one from the Taixi Sect had entered the Spiritual Realm and killed the Blood Demon, no one dared to be careless. The Gate of the Spiritual Realm was completely closed, and the intention of those Cultivated Celestial Beings was nothing more than to cut off the possibility of the Blood Demon's return to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao of the Inner Realm ultimately has its limits. Even though the Blood Demon had sacrificed the Inner Realm with blood, he could not recover his peak strength.</p><p></p><p>When the time is ripe, entering the Inner Realm again will have the opportunity to completely exterminate the Blood Demon within.</p><p></p><p>According to the timeline, the Gate of the Spiritual Realm is also about to be restored and opened, and the intelligence planted in the Inner Realm indicates that the Blood Demon has disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, he has not appeared, so he might have truly died.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years ago, the playboy from the Wood family went to the Inner Realm and stayed there for many years, seemingly also searching for the traces of the Blood Demon, but found nothing. The Blood Demon should have died completely."</p><p></p><p>One warrior spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He continued thoughtfully, "Jiao Ming is from the Water Star Palace, the wife of the playboy from the Wood family is the young lady of the Water Star Palace. Jiao Ming going to the Inner Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Another person interrupted him with a smile, "These matters are not our concern. We are just following the orders of the major Spiritual Sects to guard the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing too much is not a good thing, and meddling too much is even worse. Just do your own duty."</p><p></p><p>The rest nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a graceful figure approached.</p><p></p><p>"Open the Gate of the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>A woman in a pink dress, her jade-like face flushed with coquettishness, exuding a charming aura.</p><p></p><p>The warriors guarding the Gate of the Spiritual Realm were startled and dared not look at her too much.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly opened the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the woman entered the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, one of them asked in surprise, "Is she the one from the Water Star Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, her name is Pinger. It is said that she..."</p><p></p><p>He lowered his voice and said, "It is rumored that she is rather promiscuous, often flirting with young and handsome men. You can see her always putting on a coquettish appearance."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, I have a rough appearance, otherwise I could also have some fun with her."</p><p></p><p>One of them sighed as he touched his face.</p><p></p><p>The other three nodded in agreement. Pinger was beautiful and alluring, and it was said that she knew many techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spiritual Realm opened again.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion all felt a chill in their hearts. How could there be more people coming?</p><p></p><p>It was a woman.</p><p></p><p>Pinger walked out of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, looking around, her brows slightly furrowed, showing a somewhat disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>"The place of the lowly people, the spiritual energy is indeed scarce."</p><p></p><p>She murmured.</p><p></p><p>She came to the Inner Realm to find someone, but she didn't know where the person was.</p><p></p><p>"That bastard Jiao Ming, coming to the Inner Realm and not returning for a long time, could it be that he is captivated by the beauties of the lowly place? Or is he indulging in the beauties of the lowly place?"</p><p></p><p>Pinger cursed.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the lowly place has women with decent appearances, how beautiful can they be? Even if they are beautiful, they are still just lowly people."</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Jiao Ming's inefficiency, how could she have come to the Inner Realm? Suddenly, she looked up at a distant peak.</p><p></p><p>Her figure moved, heading towards that peak.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion all changed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Master, she's here!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man's expression was also a bit gloomy. He held a jade token in his hand and slightly bowed, transmitting a voice, "Everyone, be respectful."</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion felt a chill in their hearts. They knew that the experts from the Spiritual Realm would not hesitate to kill if provoked.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly bowed, waiting for the distinguished guest.</p><p></p><p>Pinger floated over gracefully. Seeing the posture of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion experts, she revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>"The lowly people are indeed sensible. Well, I won't punish you."</p><p></p><p>Pinger said, then asked, "Where is the one who entered through the Gate of the Spiritual Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was a Martial Dao Celestial Being. After entering the Inner Realm for such a long time, he must have caused quite a commotion. Any force in the Inner Realm should know where he is.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Celestial Being, we do not know where that senior is. After he entered the Inner Realm, we have not heard any news about him."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Pinger's brows furrowed, her gaze becoming a bit cold as she looked at the purple-crowned man.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I am telling the truth and would never dare to deceive you!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man was covered in cold sweat as he hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

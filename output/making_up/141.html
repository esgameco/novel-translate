        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sheathed his sword and looked at Fu Yuntian, saying, "I'm going to the ninth floor now. You can send the ten peak sect masters, and I'll defeat them all before going to the Storehouse."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian's mouth twitched, "You're so direct."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and said, "You've already cleared the trials, you can go directly to the Storehouse."</p><p></p><p>Ten peak sect masters at once? That's meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head and said, "I still want to fight the ten peak sect masters because I haven't tried it before and want to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian: ...</p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!" Fu Yuntian nodded and told Ding Yan to find the people.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily went up to the ninth-floor arena.</p><p></p><p>"What was the name of that sword technique you just used?" Fu Yuntian asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon's Roar of Heaven and Earth," Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon's Roar of Heaven and Earth?" Fu Yuntian murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>On the ninth floor, the ten peak sect masters had all arrived, including Ding Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, I'd like to experience that sword technique of yours again," Ding Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other nine peak sect masters also had grave expressions. This young man had formidable strength, defeating Ding Yan with a single sword strike. </p><p></p><p>Probably only a great sect master could match him.</p><p></p><p>Where did this prodigy come from?</p><p></p><p>"I'll let you experience it again," Xu Yan also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword, and a golden giant dragon circled around him.</p><p></p><p>The ten peak sect masters were not weak in strength, stronger than Yin Hong and comparable to two or three of him. </p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan couldn't afford to be careless at all.</p><p></p><p>"Please!" The ten peak sect masters didn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Boom! They instantly attacked, two working together to unleash their combined strike techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust out his sword, the sword qi surging, the golden dragon charging and crashing. One person against ten peak sect masters! The watching martial artists were all greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Many young martial artists, who were geniuses from various places, couldn't help but sigh. The gap between people was really too large!</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu frowned, wondering why that surging sword qi seemed a bit like the Myriad River Sword Qi? "I've seen my senior use it before, and it's similar to this sword qi, just not as powerful."</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu even suspected that the Sword Sovereign Cliff's Myriad River Sword Art was a simple version of the sword art this young man was using.</p><p></p><p>"I thought my senior was the number one in the younger generation in the Dao of the Sword, but I never expected there to be someone even stronger than him!"</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly. "I'm not even as good as my senior, and compared to him, I'm completely out of reach."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Leng Qiu sighed and lamented, "There are people beyond people!"</p><p></p><p>On the arena, suddenly, the Dragon's Roar resounded, and the mountains and rivers appeared.</p><p></p><p>The circling golden dragon seemed to have entered the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Poof! One sect master was sent flying out.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Poof! Two more sect masters were defeated.</p><p></p><p>Howl! The second Dragon's Roar rose, still with the mountains and rivers appearing, and one sect master after another was sent flying out.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian watched silently, his heart greatly shaken. "What kind of sword art is this? Unless one possesses absolute strength to break through it, there is no way to defeat it!"</p><p></p><p>Even he, facing this sword, had no choice but to rely on the absolute strength of a great sect master to forcefully break through it.</p><p></p><p>"If he were a great sect master, even if he had just entered that realm, I would not be his match!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>He was a great accomplished sect master, and among the great sect masters, he was a top-tier existence.</p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that Xie Lingfeng, the genius of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, is the strongest in sword dao talent in the past thousand years. Could he be Xie Lingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian couldn't help but suspect.</p><p></p><p>"But his age doesn't seem to match Xie Lingfeng's... No, for a martial artist of such strength, his appearance may not necessarily match his age."</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng is also only around twenty years old, and his youthful appearance could make him look a few years younger."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he became more and more convinced that Xu Yan was Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the inner realm, there was only one person with such sword dao talent, and that was Xie Lingfeng of the Sword Sovereign Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Only the number one sect in the inner realm, the Sword Sovereign Cliff, could possibly cultivate such a powerful and extraordinary sword dao prodigy.</p><p></p><p>"I lost again!" Ding Yan looked at the sword tip at his throat, his face full of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>On the arena, nine sect masters had fallen, leaving only him standing.</p><p></p><p>He suspected the other party had intentionally left him for last.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sheathed his sword and sighed, "The ten peak sect masters of the Seven Star Academy are indeed formidable. I felt quite a bit of pressure in defeating them!"</p><p></p><p>What the hell are you saying?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was all at a loss for words, not knowing whether he was praising the Seven Star Academy's sect masters or belittling them.</p><p></p><p>Ten peak sect masters only gave you a bit of pressure? Xu Yan also realized that his words could be misinterpreted as belittling the Seven Star Academy's sect masters, and he still needed to go to the Storehouse to read the martial arts classics.</p><p></p><p>So he added sincerely, "I'm being honest. The sect masters outside the Seven Star Academy are relatively weak, and I basically killed them with a single sword strike."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>Please don't say anymore! Are sect masters like cheap cabbage that you can kill with a single sword strike? Fu Yuntian's mouth twitched, this tone, if you didn't know better, you'd think he was a great sect master, killing sect masters with a single sword strike? Even a great sect master wouldn't dare to say such boastful words.</p><p></p><p>He's truly young and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>No, this is beyond arrogance!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Fu Yuntian, "I've already cleared the ninth floor. Can I go to the Storehouse to browse the martial arts classics now?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian nodded, "You can, follow me."</p><p></p><p>He walked towards the inner court of the Seven Star Academy, and Xu Yan followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the martial artists mostly didn't follow, they didn't have the qualifications to go, and could only leave to spread what they had witnessed in the Seven Star City.</p><p></p><p>This young man is too much of a prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Defeating ten peak sect masters of the Seven Star Academy single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the inner realm, it would be hard to find a second such monstrous young man.</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu followed behind, this sword dao prodigy of a young man had almost become his idol of worship. He must find an opportunity to get to know him better.</p><p></p><p>If he could get some guidance from him, his own sword dao would certainly make a great leap forward!</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was in an uproar, a young man had cleared the nine-floor arena, defeated Ding Yan with a single sword strike, and defeated ten peak sect masters alone.</p><p></p><p>Countless students were shocked, where did this genius come from, to be so monstrous! They hurried towards the Storehouse, wanting to catch a glimpse of this young man.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Storehouse, the news had spread quickly, and the nearby Seven Star Academy students had already gathered. They saw the handsome young man following the Elder Supervisor Fu.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were Ding Yan and the other senior apprentices, as well as over a dozen visiting geniuses who had also cleared the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, although you have cleared the nine-floor arena, the ninth floor of the Storehouse requires a certain status to access. Otherwise, you can only view the collections below the eighth floor."</p><p></p><p>He paused at the entrance of the Storehouse, "May I ask how you are addressed?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up at the tall building, this was the Treasure Pavilion of the Seven Star Academy, which collected many martial arts techniques and annotations from previous masters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he believed this was not the true core collection of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Even the ninth floor was not the core collection, but it still stored many rare martial arts techniques, even some that had been lost to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to extract the essence and integrate it into myself. This is enough, but I don't know what level of techniques the ninth floor contains.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy has a long history of inheritance, and there is a group of martial arts scholars. I wonder if they have the true martial arts lineage? I'll take the opportunity to discuss martial arts with them, perhaps I can gain something."</p><p></p><p>"Mastering one thing leads to understanding of others."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, and then asked, "What techniques are stored on the ninth floor?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian did not hide anything and said, "Some secret techniques that have been lost to the outside world, such as martial arts that damage one's own foundation to temporarily surpass one's own strength, as well as techniques that harm others, like killing techniques and methods of refining one's own essence and blood."</p><p></p><p>"These techniques are not suitable for widespread dissemination, as they may cause great harm. However, they do contain some unique insights, after all they are still a part of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"So they have not been destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the ninth floor also has many legitimate secret techniques and skills, so not just anyone can enter the ninth floor."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood now.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the evil techniques of the Demonic Sect, like the one used by that Blood Heartless fellow, which involved the evil practice of absorbing others' essence and blood.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan cupped his hands and said, "I see, I am Xie Lingfeng, should I be able to enter the ninth floor?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian had a look of "I knew it" on his face, his guess was correct - in the current Inner Realm, aside from Xie Lingfeng, there could be no other such peerless sword dao prodigy.</p><p></p><p>The group of Seven Star Academy disciples were all shocked, this was the first sword dao prodigy in a thousand years from the Sword Saint Cliff?</p><p></p><p>He was truly extraordinarily powerful! The Sword Saint Cliff, the number one sword dao sect in the Inner Realm, indeed.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Xie Lingfeng, no wonder!" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, I should have guessed it was him."</p><p></p><p>"I just heard that Xie Lingfeng was playing at the Matchless Pavilion, and he didn't even need to pay a single spirit stone, and he even met the rumored beauty there."</p><p></p><p>"Whew! So envious! To go to the Matchless Pavilion without spending money, this is the treatment of a peerless prodigy, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not just a peerless prodigy, he's also handsome, which girl wouldn't be captivated? So envious!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Seven Star disciples discussed animatedly, with admiration, jealousy, reverence, and even infatuation.</p><p></p><p>The name Xie Lingfeng spread like a whirlwind throughout the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>But Cold Autumn was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Xie shixiong? Impossible! This person is actually impersonating Xie shixiong? Where did he get the gall!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cold Autumn wanted to step forward and expose him, but then he thought, "If I expose him and he's not Xie shixiong, wouldn't that mean there's someone surpassing my Sword Saint Cliff's sword dao?" Moreover, this person didn't even say he was from the Sword Saint Cliff, what if they just happened to have the same name...</p><p></p><p>"No, the way he's acting, he's not at all worried about being found out by the Sword Saint Cliff or my shixiong, could it be that he's familiar with my shixiong?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't act rashly, I have to notify my shixiong!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Autumn thought this and hurriedly left, he had to send a message to his shixiong to tell him there was a suspected impersonator here.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's you, Young Friend Xie, of course you can go to the ninth floor. Please, go ahead!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, thinking, "Xie ge's reputation is really useful, this time I've helped boost his fame, when he finds out, he should be quite happy, right?"</p><p></p><p>He followed Fu Yuntian into the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Young Friend, do you want to go directly to the ninth floor, or look through the floors one by one?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian asked.</p><p></p><p>"Can I come anytime to browse the collection?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the densely packed bookshelves, the number of books was countless.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have passed the Combat Platform can come here to browse at any time within a year."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the ninth floor and look from top to bottom."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>The basic and common martial arts texts were practically useless to him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there might be exceptions.</p><p></p><p>But the higher the level of the texts, the more valuable they would be, and the more he could gain from them.</p><p></p><p>As they headed towards the ninth floor, Xu Yan spoke up, "I've heard the Seven Star Academy has a group of martial arts scholars, the masters of the dao. I'd like to discuss martial arts with them, is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian's brow furrowed slightly as he pondered, then nodded, "Possible."</p><p></p><p>Considering Xu Yan's prodigious talent, he might have extraordinary insights on the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the ninth floor, there were fewer bookshelves and the collection was much smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Young Friend, feel free to look around."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian sat down on a chair.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and randomly walked over to a bookshelf, pulling out a book and flipping through it.</p><p></p><p>The books were hand-copied, not the original texts, but even so the copies were quite aged, the pages yellowed.</p><p></p><p>This was a secret martial arts technique. </p><p></p><p>In the outside world, it was considered a lost art - a method that damaged one's own essence and foundation to temporarily unleash power beyond one's own.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flipped through it, then shook his head slightly, it was too inferior.</p><p></p><p>He put it down and continued browsing.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian kept a close eye on Xu Yan, seeing him flip through the books quickly, finishing one and then moving on to the next. </p><p></p><p>Most of the texts, he would shake his head after looking at them.</p><p></p><p>He's looking down on them!</p><p></p><p>"What a prodigy!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Cliff has produced another prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had browsed through more than half of the ninth floor's collection, the various secret techniques and skills were numerous, but those that caught his eye were almost none.</p><p></p><p>"They're all too weak, and rather ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not entirely useless, let me organize them a bit, perhaps I can still gain some insights on the martial dao from them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put down a text.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to discuss martial arts with those scholars, to verify our understandings."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Fu Yuntian.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian nodded, standing up, "Just a moment."</p><p></p><p>He floated away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued browsing the texts while waiting.</p><p></p><p>He was very much looking forward to these Seven Star Academy martial arts scholars, whether they had unique insights on the martial dao, and if any of them had cultivated the true martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The sound of footsteps on the stairs rose, and over a dozen peak Martial Grandmaster experts walked up.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned to look, his brow furrowing slightly - how come they were all just Martial Grandmasters? Not a single Great Grandmaster among them?</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian smiled, "Martial Grandmasters are already the pinnacle of the martial dao. As for Great Grandmasters, they wouldn't come to discuss the martial dao with juniors."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, Fu Yuntian didn't say it directly, but he understood - the Great Grandmaster martial arts scholars would not come discuss the martial dao with someone of his level. </p><p></p><p>If he hadn't fought his way up, with his powerful strength, and used Xie Lingfeng's name to enter, these Martial Grandmaster scholars might not have even come to see him.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Young Friend Xie."</p><p></p><p>The group of martial arts scholars sat down cross-legged, their expressions solemn.</p><p></p><p>It was clear they were deeply passionate about the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Out of the ten of them, nine had dark circles under their eyes!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, the matter of Song You has nothing to do with our Song family. We are completely loyal!" the head of the Song family hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!" Yan Shanhe let out a cold laugh. "You still try to quibble at this point? Song You is a member of your Song family. The so-called expulsion was nothing but a ruse. Did you think you could extricate your family from this affair so easily?</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know how great your Song family's ambitions are?"</p><p></p><p>How could Yan Shanhe believe the words of the Song family head? In the entire Divine Realm, no one had ever used such a method to seek revenge through others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his only son had been severely injured in an attack, and he had recently received secret intelligence. He hadn't had time or inclination to verify its authenticity yet.</p><p></p><p>In his extreme anger, how could Yan Shanhe believe the Song family head's explanations?</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe raised his hand and struck out with his palm, personally moving to suppress the Song family head.</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Celestial Lords and the warriors of the Myriad Treasures Alliance all attacked as well. The battle erupted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>How could the Song family's strength compare to the Myriad Treasures Alliance? And with the top Immortal Celestial Lord Yan Shanhe taking action, the outcome was already decided.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that resistance was futile, the Song family head tried to flee. However, he faced not only Yan Shanhe, but also the blockade of other Immortal Celestial Lords. There was no way for him to escape.</p><p></p><p>As the battle concluded, the once mighty Song family was wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe's face was extremely gloomy. At the end of the battle, when the Song family head, an Immortal Celestial Lord, saw that he could not escape, he resolutely chose to self-destruct rather than be captured alive, not giving Yan Shanhe any chance to take him prisoner.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, we found some things while searching the Song family residence," an Immortal Celestial Lord came to report.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe swept his gaze over, his expression cold. It was indeed evidence of the hidden forces of the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect.</p><p></p><p>Right after, another warrior from the Treasure Protection Squad came to report that they had found some clues about the Song family's plot to assassinate Yan Shanhe's disciple, Yan Ping.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. It really was the Song family. Not content with killing my disciple, they even dared to plot against my son. The Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect, is it? How wonderful!" Yan Shanhe's expression was extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>"Contact the other forces. We'll work together to wipe out the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect within the Changyu Border Region. Don't let a single one escape!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe was filled with rage at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he hadn't paid much attention to the schemes of the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect, since there was a tacit understanding between the Myriad Treasures Alliance and the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect wouldn't target the Myriad Treasures Alliance, and in return, the Myriad Treasures Alliance wouldn't target them or provide information about them to other forces.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect had broken this understanding, the Myriad Treasures Alliance naturally had to retaliate!</p><p></p><p>The news that the Song family in Baimu City had been wiped out, that they were an important force of the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect in the Changyu Border Region, and that the Myriad Treasures Alliance had joined in to take revenge against the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect, instantly shook the entire Changyu Border Region.</p><p></p><p>By now, with both the Hundred Battles Hall and the Myriad Treasures Alliance taking action, the other members of the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect in the Changyu Border Region were stunned. Why had this suddenly happened? The time wasn't right yet, many plans hadn't been completed. How had the Hundred Battles Hall and the Myriad Treasures Alliance acted in succession?</p><p></p><p>It was becoming impossible to stay in the Changyu Border Region.</p><p></p><p>When Song You heard the news of the Song family's destruction, tears of excitement welled up in his eyes. "Father, Mother, I have avenged you!"</p><p></p><p>"And Brother Meng, I, Song You, will never forget this debt of gratitude!"</p><p></p><p>Now, he was the only one left of the entire Song family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Myriad Treasures Alliance had put out a high bounty.</p><p></p><p>"So the Song family really was a force of the Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shaking Sect. How does it feel now that you've tried to frame me?" Meng Chong, who was on his way to Changyu City, sneered.</p><p></p><p>It was time to leave the Changyu Border Region and continue wandering through the various regions of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>When he was still a thousand miles from Changyu City, just as Meng Chong was preparing to change his appearance to avoid searches and cross the border to leave, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Meng Chong was startled, then hurriedly bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded. This fellow Meng Chong had plundered a branch of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, accumulating quite a few treasures. He was no longer short of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why have you come?" Meng Chong was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Just wandering around, and thought I'd check on you all." Li Xuan walked with leisurely steps, and Meng Chong followed closely.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any questions about martial arts, you can ask now," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, Master!" Meng Chong was overjoyed. He then began to ask his master about some doubts he had regarding the Dao of the Blade, the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, and some aspects of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. The questions Meng Chong asked were relatively simple, so there was no need for profound and mysterious answers. He could give some straightforward guidance.</p><p></p><p>So, Li Xuan carefully instructed Meng Chong on martial arts, especially regarding the third level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, and finally on the realm of the Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>As for divine abilities, he had explained most of what needed to be explained, and simply passed on a more complete manual of divine abilities to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>With communication talismans available for messaging each other, Meng Chong could discuss and seek advice from Xu Yan if he had any doubts, which made things much easier for Li Xuan as their master.</p><p></p><p>Walking leisurely while instructing Meng Chong on martial arts, they were not far from Changyu City now, and could see its border gate in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand now. I will definitely comprehend the third level as soon as possible!" Meng Chong said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded, then said, "Since that's the case, I'll pass on to you the physical cultivation technique beyond the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Physical cultivation focuses on the body. The third level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars can truly achieve a state where each acupoint is like a star, forming a body like the universe. However, the stars in the acupoints are still just newborn stars.</p><p></p><p>"Gathering ten thousand stars, the boundless universe. I will pass on to you the Indestructible Body of the Boundless Universe."</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars was the Indestructible Body of the Boundless Universe. After careful consideration, Li Xuan had decided on this name.</p><p></p><p>Gathering ten thousand stars to form the boundless universe! Meng Chong was excited in his heart, but his expression was solemn as he listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to explain the Indestructible Body of the Boundless Universe, how to strengthen the stars, how to gather the stars, and how to form the body of the boundless universe with ten thousand stars.</p><p></p><p>"The boundless universe establishes the way of the physical body, opening up the universe within the body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained once, then let Meng Chong digest it on his own.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong immersed himself in the Indestructible Body of the Boundless Universe, digesting its profundities and memorizing the profound methods of physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>Two figures flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, where do you think you're escaping to?" </p><p></p><p>It was the two Immortal Celestial Lords who had been pursuing Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan cast an indifferent glance, then continued walking leisurely. When Meng Chong looked up, he saw that under his master's single glance, the two approaching Immortal Celestial Lords had turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>"To turn Immortal Celestial Lords to ash with just a glance, what realm must one reach to be able to do that?" Meng Chong marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Master's strength was truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Were you able to remember it all?" Li Xuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there were some parts I couldn't memorize completely!" Meng Chong said with an embarrassed smile, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, and so he explained it once more.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After explaining it three times, Meng Chong thoroughly memorized the technique. Li Xuan then passed on to him the Eye of the Heavenly Way. As for when Meng Chong would be able to cultivate it, that remained unknown.</p><p></p><p>After all, although he had laid the foundation with the Minor Eye of the Heavenly Way, cultivating the true Eye of the Heavenly Way was far beyond Meng Chong's current abilities.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the technique to Meng Chong and guiding him on the martial path, Li Xuan naturally enhanced Meng Chong's jade talisman again, and then imparted some martial arts experience to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is about to fall into chaos, which is also the time for prodigies to rise. If you want to make a resounding name for yourself, now is a good opportunity," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely become famous throughout the Divine Realm and make everyone know the name of Meng Chong, the Celestial God," Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with a smile, "I won't see you into the city then."</p><p></p><p>With one step, he vanished from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head, grinned, and strode towards Changyu City, his form and appearance changing in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The Song family had been destroyed, and as for the Treasure Alliance, he hadn't suffered any losses. It was Yan Shanhe who was jumping with anger, not him, Meng Chong. There was no need to continue entangling himself in the Changyu Border.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was vast. He would roam through various borders and meet many of the powerful experts of this Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked at a leisurely pace, crossing the Changyu Border and traversing the wilderness directly towards the Yuanping Border where Jiang Buping was located.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come out, he needed to guide all three disciples.</p><p></p><p>"It's time for Jiang Buping, this abandoned son, to rise up. As Jiang Buping emerges again, it will surely attract attention, especially since he is unaffected by the Immutable Qi.</p><p></p><p>"When the Jiang clan of the Taikun Border gets the news, they will likely send powerful experts to find him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's identity destined him to not have a smooth path, but to rise through constant killing.</p><p></p><p>And the Extreme Soul Martial Arts was precisely a martial art of extreme killing.</p><p></p><p>"Even Immortal Celestial Lords cannot break Jiang Buping's immutable soul. At Jiang Buping's rate of cultivation, it won't be long before he can kill Immortal Celestial Lords."</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Martial Arts killed the soul. With Jiang Buping's current strength, if an Immortal Celestial Lord was slightly careless, their soul would be injured.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Jiang Buping to kill an Immortal Celestial Lord alone, he still lacked some strength.</p><p></p><p>"The show of an abandoned son rising up and overturning a great clan is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan moved leisurely and freely across the wilderness towards the Yuanping Border.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Changyu Border, Xu Yan raised his hand and subdued a True King Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, you will be called Shadow One, infiltrate the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes flashed coldly. It was time to counter-infiltrate the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time, Xu Yan took action against the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, starting from controlling one person, gradually expanding to dozens of people, and figuring out many of the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows' strongholds.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Treasure Alliance was also cracking down on the Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows, many strongholds were taken out by the Treasure Alliance. Xu Yan couldn't help but sigh that the Treasure Alliance's intelligence capabilities were indeed powerful, to be able to investigate so many Heavenly Killers and Earth Shadows strongholds.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Border, at横峰山 (Hengfeng Mountain).</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen's face was extremely gloomy. Such a big disturbance had occurred in the Changyu Border, and a long-hidden branch with considerable strength had been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because Wu Rang made reckless plans?" Sky Seventeen asked angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, Wu Rang is said to be in seclusion and hasn't come out. It's probably not related to him, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, tell him that as a Killing Heavenly Killer, he shouldn't deploy missions recklessly. He only needs to kill people!"</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen's face was still unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir. But what about the Changyu Border now?"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Sky Seventeen's eyes as he said in a deep voice, "Since Yan Shanhe of the Treasure Alliance wants to fight, since the major forces of the Changyu Border want to fight, then let them fight. Let the Changyu Border fall into chaos."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Sky Seventeen said coldly, "The preparations for the spirit crystal mine in the Changyu Border have been made. I didn't want to take action now, but since the Changyu Border insists on chaos, then let's act."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I'm afraid the time isn't right."</p><p></p><p>"If the Changyu Border is to be in chaos, then the time is right. Whether it's early chaos or late chaos, it will eventually be chaos. Pass down the order, activate that treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>After his subordinate left, Sky Seventeen's gaze looked towards the Qinghua Border, his brows tightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Until now, there had been no news from the Qinghua Border, as if the entire Qinghua Border had been sealed off.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the previous action against the Qinghua Border had ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>"Was targeting Xu Yan and Meng Chong a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen felt heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>There was no news from the two Nine-Leaf Heavenly Killers who went to assassinate Xu Yan. It was probably not as simple as failure, but more likely that they had perished! Xu Yan didn't have this level of strength, so it was very likely that a stronger expert had intervened.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the available information, there had been no battle of powerful Immortal Celestial Lords in the Changyu Border, which meant that the two Nine-Leaf Heavenly Killers had been easily killed with a wave of the hand.</p><p></p><p>"Above Immortal? When did an expert above Immortal come to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Will they come to the Nine Mountains Border? I shouldn't expose my strength now, I should avoid it for a while. It's just the right time to speed up that matter."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Sky Seventeen immediately left the Nine Mountains Border.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the Yuanping Border, there was a celestial cave, which was the Immutable Celestial Cave. Immutable Qi permeated the celestial cave, and any martial artist who entered the cave would be extra cautious.</p><p></p><p>Once the soul was contaminated by the Immutable Qi, one would lose their intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Due to the perennial permeation of Immutable Qi in this celestial cave, some special treasures were born, which could be used to refine divine weapons and enhance the firmness and endurance of divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there existed a kind of fierce beast in the celestial cave, rumored to be a true spirit from beyond the sky. Due to years of erosion by the Immutable Qi, it couldn't develop intelligence like spirit beasts and was no different from ordinary wild beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, this true spirit from beyond the sky had an extremely strong physical body and was violent by nature. Its flesh and blood were great medicinal ingredients that could restore depleted blood essence and could be used to concoct precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>It also had the effect of strengthening the physical body. Because of this, the martial artists of the Yuanping Border were mostly muscular and had much stronger physical strength than the martial artists of the Changyu Border.</p><p></p><p>This was the unique physical advantage of borders with Immutable Celestial Caves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man in the celestial cave held a cold and sharp spear, emitting a point of cold light. This cold light seemed to pierce not into the flesh, but into the soul and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A fierce beast, its body wrapped in white flames and covered with huge scales, with a giant head bearing a huge single horn, roared as it charged towards the young man.</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment the young man's spear thrust out, the roar stopped. The violent look in its eyes instantly lost its light, and its charging body collapsed halfway through.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of secret technique is this, to easily break through the Giant Armored Beast's defense?"</p><p></p><p>"But there's not a single wound on the Giant Armored Beast's body!"</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists watching from afar were shocked by this scene.</p><p></p><p>The Giant Armored Beast, named for its giant armor, was known for its strong defense. Even True King Celestial Lords found it troublesome, and breaking through the Giant Armored Beast's defense was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Today, the crowd of martial artists saw someone kill a Giant Armored Beast with one spear thrust, how could they not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

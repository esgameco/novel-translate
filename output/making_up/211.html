        <h1>Chapter 211</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>During the time that the two of them had left Canglang Island, such a major event actually occurred? It directly impacted the situation in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"My master is too powerful. If I had even one-tenth of his strength, I would already be proud of myself."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed with some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>The master's expectations for him were not high. As long as he had half the strength of the master at his peak, the master would be satisfied. </p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan felt deeply ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention half, he didn't even have one-tenth of the master's peak strength.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the master was unwilling to take me as a disciple back then. It's really because I was unable to meet the master's minimum requirements."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan finally deeply understood why the master had been unwilling to take him as a disciple before.</p><p></p><p>Although his natural talent was not bad,</p><p></p><p>he ultimately could not meet the master's minimum requirements.</p><p></p><p>"It was my sincere heart for the martial dao that moved the master, and thus he took me as a disciple, coming out of seclusion and entering the world freely to experience life.</p><p></p><p>I absolutely cannot let the master down. I must continuously improve my own strength!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought resolutely in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also deeply ashamed, as he didn't even have half the strength of the master at his peak.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the faces of Bai Yunxiang and Pang Yu twitched, what was going on with these two senior brothers?</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Xu, the storm has passed, no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang spoke up to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and sighed, "The master's expectations for me were actually already very low, but I still failed to meet the master's expectations."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang curiously asked, "What were the expectations of the revered master?"</p><p></p><p>"The master said that as long as I had five-tenths the strength he had at his peak, the master would be satisfied. But I don't even have one-tenth of the master's peak strength!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and sighed, his expression full of guilt towards his master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded in agreement, "Big brother is right."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang and Pang Yu were completely stunned, their minds receiving a thousand blows, almost unable to resist cursing out loud.</p><p></p><p>The two of you are already absurdly strong, able to kill those at the same realm as easily as crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Yet, you don't even have one-tenth the strength of your master at his peak?</p><p></p><p>Fuck! When I was at the same realm, I had already surpassed my master. Is our master really that trash?</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang and Pang Yu were at a loss for what to feel at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"The gate of the Spirit Realm has opened, and a Martial Dao Celestial has emerged."</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Yan who broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>"I am already aware of this matter."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang's expression became extremely grave as he spoke in a deep voice, "The gate of the Spirit Realm has opened, the blessings and disasters are unknown. A Martial Dao Celestial has entered the inner domain, what are his intentions? Whether he will bring disaster to the inner domain is unknown, we can only be cautious and hope he does not cause trouble."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu nodded and said, "The gate of the Spirit Realm has opened more than once before, the Demonic Lord emerged from it, causing chaos in the inner domain. The Demonic Cult is still not to be underestimated, the Killing Cultivation Technique has left lingering disasters until today."</p><p></p><p>He sighed and continued, "I hope this Martial Dao Celestial is not like the Demonic Lord."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Xu Yan and said, "Young friend Xu, you must be more careful in your actions recently, to avoid provoking the Martial Dao Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "You two don't need to be so nervous, a single Martial Dao Celestial is not a serious matter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Bai Yunxiang became very serious and said, "Young friend Xu, I know you are very strong, but a Martial Dao Celestial is not something to be taken lightly. To them, even Half-Step Celestials are just cripples, the gap is so vast, it cannot be compared!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand and said, "It's really not that serious, he's not one of the stronger Celestials, no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang sighed inwardly, Xu Yan was still young and impulsive, extremely powerful, able to kill Half-Step Celestials with ease. He probably thought a Martial Dao Celestial would be no different.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, he was still youthfully arrogant, a bit inflated.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, let me give you a piece of advice, try your best not to provoke that Martial Dao Celestial. Although your revered master is very strong, there's no need to bring trouble to him, right?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang spoke up to advise him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked innocent as he said, "I didn't provoke him, he provoked me. This matter is really not that serious, I just killed him."</p><p></p><p>Killed...?!</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang and Pang Yu's eyes widened, almost popping out.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Dao Celestial, a mighty and lofty existence.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was killed by Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, what are you saying?"</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu even doubted if he had misheard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked annoyed, it's just killing a minor Celestial, why are they making such a big deal out of it.</p><p></p><p>It's not like he killed a Cultivated Celestial!</p><p></p><p>"I killed him with just three strikes."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out the storage pouch of the deceased, his expression full of disdain and contempt.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is a pauper, there's nothing valuable in here, just a few fifth-grade spirit herbs that have some worth..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang looked up at the sky, completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The rumored Martial Dao Celestial had just entered the inner domain, and he was already killed by Xu Yan? And Xu Yan even found him to be a despicable pauper...</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu grabbed his own hair, at this moment he didn't even know what emotion he was feeling.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang took a deep breath and solemnly asked, "Young friend Xu, how did you...no, how did he provoke you?"</p><p></p><p>That Martial Dao Celestial, he couldn't have come after Xu Yan, right?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned angrily and said, "Who knows what his problem was? I was in the Ice Palace killing that evil Ice Lord, and he just showed up.</p><p></p><p>He started by asking where someone was, I don't know who he was asking about.</p><p></p><p>When I just asked him a question, he arrogantly insulted me, calling me a pig-dog thing.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't tolerate that, so I just killed him."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang and Pang Yu mourned for the unknown Martial Dao Celestial for a while, that guy really went looking for death, provoking the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two of them felt somewhat melancholic. Before Xu Yan appeared, they had considered themselves among the top experts in the inner domain, with few opponents.</p><p></p><p>But after Xu Yan showed up, they realized their strength was completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly felt a sense of sadness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still so young, yet he killed a Martial Dao Celestial with just three strikes.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan said it was three strikes, it must be true. In contrast, they couldn't even withstand a single finger from a Celestial.</p><p></p><p>This gap, just thinking about it made them feel hopeless!</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy has a long heritage, I came to learn more about the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>This was the main purpose of his visit to the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded beside him.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Spirit Realm had appeared, and one day they would have to go to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>As their strength increased, they would find the inner domain too small.</p><p></p><p>"You'll have to ask Elder Pang about that, the academy's records about the Spirit Realm have been erased, only the Martial Dao Scholars have passed down some information orally."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxiang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he added, "The founding principle of the Seven Star Academy is not without reason. The founding patriarch, although from humble origins, obtained opportunities in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The secrets passed down by each Academy Master are that the founding patriarch went to the Spirit Realm. The gate of the Spirit Realm opens periodically, and our Seven Star Academy has a quota to enter."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But ever since the Demon Lord incident, the gates to the Spiritual Realm have been closed, and it is no longer possible to enter the Spiritual Realm, so the quota no longer exists."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Bai Yunkong sighed. Since he had already mentioned it, he might as well tell the whole story.</p><p></p><p>"According to the secret passed down by the Sect Master of the Seven Star Academy, after the Demon Hunt of a myriad years, the gates to the Spiritual Realm will be reopened, and the academy will be granted quotas to enter the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the core secret of the Seven Star Academy, and aside from me, no one else knows of it."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"There is such a thing?" Pang Yu exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"It's been almost a thousand years since the Demon Hunt, right? Speaking of which, those Demon Children are quite remarkable to have lived to this day."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu sighed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao scholars of the same generation as the Demon Children had all long since passed away.</p><p></p><p>The events of the past had been buried in the dust along with the deaths of these people.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Lord was truly extraordinary!" Pang Yu exclaimed sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Demon Children had lived to the present day, with such longevity, was undoubtedly connected to the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at the Half-Step Celestial Realm, they would not have been able to live for thousands of years under normal circumstances!</p><p></p><p>Again, the Demon Lord!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong exchanged a glance, somewhat in awe. The Demon Lord was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>If not for their good fortune in encountering Meng Chong, the Demon Lord might have risen again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had seen the mural of the Demon Lord's life, knew that the Demon Lord had risen and fallen more than once.</p><p></p><p>Each time they were crushed, they eventually rose again, sweeping back in.</p><p></p><p>"The closing of the gates to the Spiritual Realm and the erasure of its records were probably to prevent the Demon Lord," Xu Yan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Next, Pang Yu also told Xu Yan everything he knew about the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"For those from the Inner Realm, the situation in the Spiritual Realm is not good. It is rumored that unless one obtains the proof of the Spiritual Realm's forces, entering the Spiritual Realm will inevitably lead to becoming a slave.</p><p></p><p>"Even if one has the proof, there is no guarantee of becoming a disciple; one may still end up as a slave.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is very tyrannical!"</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu sighed and lamented, "When the news of the Spiritual Realm's gates spreads, so many people will long to enter the Spiritual Realm, not knowing that in the Inner Realm, they can be highly esteemed and enjoy reverence.</p><p></p><p>"But once they go to the Spiritual Realm, they can only be slaves and servants."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong fell silent. The powerful figures of the Spiritual Realm actually treated the martial artists of the Inner Realm in such a way.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Jiao Ming's lofty and disdainful attitude, as well as his opening words of "you pigs and dogs," Xu Yan was certain that Pang Yu's words were true.</p><p></p><p>"Heh! Those Spiritual Realm experts are all in need of a beating. When I enter the Spiritual Realm, I'll see how they keep their high and mighty airs, and I'll trample them all into the dust!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>As for the proof of the Spiritual Realm's forces that Pang Yu mentioned, it was most likely the Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy must have had the Jade Token in the past, as there was a quota, but it is unknown which Spiritual Realm force they were connected to.</p><p></p><p>Even if one obtains the Jade Token to enter, the treatment would still be inferior to that of the native disciples of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>They would even face unfairness and oppression, which was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong and Pang Yu exchanged a glance, not doubting Xu Yan's words. If he were to enter the Spiritual Realm, those who wanted to make him a slave would truly be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan now possessed the power to slay Celestial Realm experts. </p><p></p><p>How powerful would he become in the near future?</p><p></p><p>"I, as an Inner Realm martial artist, can only rely on Xu Yan to stand tall and proud."</p><p></p><p>The two of them thought to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, since you are a Martial Dao Scholar of our Seven Star Academy, you can enter the Scholar's Pavilion to peruse the classics, and you may gain some insights."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much." Xu Yan clasped his fists excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Scholars were the core of the Seven Star Academy, and the classics stored in the Scholar's Pavilion must involve more extensive and profound martial arts secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Can my junior brother also go and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu glanced at Meng Chong. Although this reckless youth was weaker than Xu Yan, he could not find a second person to match Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The principle of the Seven Star Academy cannot be violated. Meng Junior, you can enter by being granted the title of Martial Dao Scholar."</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong agreed readily.</p><p></p><p>Then he stared at Pang Yu and asked, "With the title of Martial Dao Scholar, how much spirit stones can I get per year? I don't ask for much, even a little less than my senior brother is fine."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong and Pang Yu's mouths twitched, these two were truly cut from the same cloth!</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Having Xu Yan and Meng Chong take on the titles at the Seven Star Academy was actually to the academy's benefit, as they would be able to bask in their glory.</p><p></p><p>Paying a small amount of spirit stones was only reasonable.</p><p></p><p>When these two eventually display their prowess in the Spiritual Realm, the reputation of the Seven Star Academy will also shine brighter.</p><p></p><p>At most, they can make up for it in the future by recruiting more wealthy disciples.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong, led by Pang Yu, entered the core of the Seven Star Academy, the Scholar's Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, a group of Martial Dao Scholars, with dark circles under their eyes, were writing and drawing, researching martial arts, and some were even trying to cultivate the new martial arts secrets they had just explored.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong's mouths twitched, these were truly a group of martial arts fanatics.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know where the Seven Star Academy had found so many of these obsessed martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's arrival, the group of Martial Dao Scholars rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Xu, it's been a while. I have a martial arts question regarding the Great Wilderness Martial Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Xu, you look even more handsome. I recently researched a martial arts secret based on the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Teacher Xu, I've been dreaming about you every night..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Martial Dao Scholars, dumbfounded, as they bombarded him with endless questions, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Especially the one who claimed to dream about him every night, she was a woman with a somewhat pretty appearance, if not for the faint dark circles under her eyes and her disheveled hair.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu shouted sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you yelling, you cowardly old thing? I created a new martial arts secret just the other day, and you didn't even dare to cultivate it!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you have no spirit of martial arts exploration at all!"</p><p></p><p>"If you weren't so strong, I'd kick you out for sure."</p><p></p><p>Several white-haired Martial Dao Scholars immediately started criticizing Pang Yu with their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The one who called Pang Yu a cowardly old thing had one leg slightly deformed, seemingly having just recovered from an injury.</p><p></p><p>One of his arms also looked withered, with some healing ointment applied.</p><p></p><p>Pang Yu's face turned black, and a powerful aura surged forth, as if he was about to suppress the entire group.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, seeing Pang the old man just ruins my mood."</p><p></p><p>"Scatter, scatter..."</p><p></p><p>The group of Martial Dao Scholars shouted as they dispersed, each returning to their own business.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 443</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the purple-robed youth spoke, he paused again, scratching his head with a troubled expression. Finally, he said somewhat irritably, "Anyway, all you need to know is that I understand this world very well, very well indeed. After all, I am... I have that certain identity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly, "I naturally know what you are. Since I said you only understand the surface of this world and don't know what's missing, I obviously have some basis for that."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked surprised, "You know who I am?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then tell me, what am I?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth became interested.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand to point up at the sky, then down at the ground, and finally pointed at the purple-robed youth, smiling without speaking.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth was confused.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed and said, "You young friend are quite foolish if you can't understand even this."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth scratched his head and said glumly, "Who knows what you mean by pointing here and there? Can't you just say it directly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, "I've already spoken directly. It's a pity you're too foolish. Think about it carefully yourself."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth looked at him suspiciously, seeming lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Why do all these powerful people have this habit? They never speak directly and always like to beat around the bush!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped his tea, maintaining an air of mystery and an expression of having already seen through everything.</p><p></p><p>In fact, although Li Xuan knew about the purple-robed youth's background - that he was not a being from within this world, and not even a living being - he could not know his specific identity.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had reached the Realm of Heaven and Earth cultivation and practiced the Eye of the Heavenly Way, he was still limited in his understanding of certain aspects and could not fully comprehend what the purple-robed youth was.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also because the one who had sealed the purple-robed youth here was too powerful. Even if Li Xuan used the Eye of the Heavenly Way with his current strength, he could not completely penetrate the concealment to directly perceive the youth's essence.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan did know that the purple-robed youth must have some connection with the owner of the Tai Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>In the small stone house, Li Xuan and the purple-robed youth chatted idly, their topics constantly expanding from the world to ancient times, and then to beyond the world.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth clearly knew many secrets of the world, but every time he reached a critical point, he would hurriedly close his mouth and say no more.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind, maintaining the appearance that he had already seen through everything, and that whether the purple-robed youth spoke or not was of no importance.</p><p></p><p>"I should be going now. I don't know when I'll come chat with you again, young friend," Li Xuan said as he stood up.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth's face was full of conflict, wanting to say something but hesitating to speak out.</p><p></p><p>"No need to see me off, young friend," Li Xuan waved his hand and turned to leave gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"Um... elder, when will you come again?" the purple-robed youth asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I come or not, what does it matter? I only came to chat because I saw you, young friend, confined here. Since we have nothing more to talk about, naturally this is the end. After all, we're not close," Li Xuan said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth scratched his head and said, "Next time, next time you come, let's talk about deeper things. Oh, by the way, my name is Tian Zi."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, "Tian Zi? Alright, I'll remember that."</p><p></p><p>With a step, he vanished from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't obtained any secrets of the world from Tian Zi's mouth on this trip, he had gained some useful information.</p><p></p><p>For example, his name.</p><p></p><p>And that there was not just one world, but that the world they were in was the strongest one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether this was actually the case remained to be verified.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tian Zi was in the Tai Cang world, so naturally he would speak in favor of the Tai Cang world.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Netherworld another world?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the otherworldly enemies in the Heavenly Abyss, who were probably beings from another world attempting to invade the Tai Cang world.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, the Tai Cang world didn't seem to be the strongest, did it?</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't necessarily so. Perhaps the Tai Cang world had once been the strongest, but had declined due to certain events?</p><p></p><p>The specific secrets of the world still needed further understanding to determine.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, a powerful being from another world?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached the peak of the Divine Appearance Realm and was preparing to break through to the Void Breaking Realm. He was probably already heading towards the trap set by Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the treasure Mei Wu brings out will be of some use," Li Xuan thought expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Qinghua Realm, Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh that Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were in a period of accumulation and would soon experience a great increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Once the Qinghua Array was fully set up, Fang Hao could use it to break through in one go, and his subsequent cultivation path would be much smoother.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for Su Lingxiu. Once the Heaven and Earth Divine Furnace was completed, she could use it to rapidly improve her alchemy and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the third level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, and you have broken through to the third level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Way opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. It wasn't easy, but Meng Chong had finally figured out the third level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>"My physical martial arts have also broken through to the Realm of Heaven and Earth, and my strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"That girl Su Lingxiu should also spend some time pondering the Heaven and Earth Realm techniques. The sooner she figures them out, the sooner my alchemy martial arts can break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself that he should find time to guide Su Lingxiu. She shouldn't focus solely on the Heaven and Earth Divine Furnace all day without putting some effort into the Heaven and Earth Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Guangyou Realm had a vast view with few visible mountains. Looking into the distance gave a sense of profound depth, which was how it got its name.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, can't wait any longer, can you? I'm here to trick you now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finally stepped into the Guangyou Realm.</p><p></p><p>The journey here had been delayed quite a bit by his revenge against Tian Sha and Di Ying, but now that he was about to break through to the Void Breaking Realm, it was time to come and claim the treasure from Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu must be getting impatient by now.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had made sure to visit the Demon Witch Heavenly Abyss in each realm from time to time, using this to send messages to Mei Wu that he was constantly searching for the treasure's hiding place, thus maintaining Mei Wu's patience.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Witch Heavenly Abysses are all connected. Mei Wu must be a powerful figure among the Demon Witches."</p><p></p><p>By now, some of the information could be pieced together.</p><p></p><p>"The Guangyou Realm has a smaller population, and there are fewer Heavenly Abysses here. Therefore, the martial artists of the Guangyou Realm are relatively idle."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked through the Guangyou Realm, heading towards that hidden Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"There are some unknown areas in the Guangyou Realm where few martial artists have set foot, and there have been no incidents of enemies from the Heavenly Abyss invading. This hidden Heavenly Abyss obviously has some restrictions that prevent it from invading the Guangyou Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the treasure map thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Besides Dun Wu, will there be other powerful figures in this Heavenly Abyss helping Mei Wu?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss had limits on the strength of those who could enter, so Mei Wu's options for helpers were limited.</p><p></p><p>If the upper limit of this Heavenly Abyss was relatively high, then besides Dun Wu...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There must be other powerful figures lying in ambush outside as well.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's no big deal. My strength now is not what it used to be," Xu Yan was not worried.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the small wooden sword given by his master, he could handle any unexpected ambushes.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xu Yan arrived at the location indicated on the treasure map. </p><p></p><p>Looking with his Little Heavenly Eye, he couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder no one has discovered this celestial cave. It's hidden so deeply and covered by earth spirit energy. Even an Immortal Heavenly Venerable who controls this realm might not be able to find it without careful inspection!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't rush in immediately. Instead, he first created some commotion. Otherwise, if he just went in directly upon arrival, wouldn't it make Mei Wu suspicious?</p><p></p><p>He had to create the impression that he had searched for a while and used various methods before finding a way to enter, in order to deceive Mei Wu and not expose his ability to see through illusions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the hidden celestial cave underground, scorching heat permeated the entire space. Flames of light surrounded the area, but the center of the cave was cool, without any sense of heat.</p><p></p><p>In a pool of water grew a jade bamboo about a foot long and as thick as a thumb, with only one leaf at the top.</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo was crystal clear, seemingly containing some profound patterns inside, as if embodying some ultimate principles, with the essence of the Dao lingering within.</p><p></p><p>Besides the jade bamboo in the pool, several Seven Wonders Divine Flowers and some unknown treasures grew around the water.</p><p></p><p>A stunningly beautiful and alluring woman, wearing a pink long dress, exuded great seductive power with her every move.</p><p></p><p>"That little bastard Xu Yan, why hasn't he come yet?" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu gritted her teeth, getting a bit impatient from waiting.</p><p></p><p>To get revenge and let Xu Yan know the consequences of offending her, Mei Wu, she had put in quite a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>To lure Xu Yan into the trap, she deliberately placed some treasures here.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Wonders Divine Flowers and other treasures were one thing, but the jade bamboo in the pool was a true heavenly treasure. Not to mention Immortal Heavenly Venerables, even warriors above that level would covet it if they saw it.</p><p></p><p>This was an item that could aid in comprehending the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The profound patterns inside the jade bamboo seemed to imbue it with the ultimate principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The hollow inside the jade bamboo was like a miniature universe, with the patterns representing the laws governing its operation.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this special quality that the jade bamboo was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, how much do you hate that kid? You even brought out this bamboo!" </p><p></p><p>A voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>A burly man appeared, with hair and beard that seemed to be burning like flames.</p><p></p><p>"Although this bamboo is precious, it's of no use to you and me. It's just a descendant of that one treasure bamboo from who knows how many generations ago."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu said dismissively. </p><p></p><p>Then she gritted her teeth and said: "If I don't bring out treasures precious enough, that bastard might not risk coming in!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, as long as you don't go back on what you promised me, Mei Wu," the man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Flame Demon, you can rest assured. As long as you help me capture this kid, I will definitely not go back on what I promised you," Mei Wu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, to capture this kid, you even agreed to this. It's clear how much you hate him. You can rest easy. With me, the Flame Demon, taking action, once he comes in, he won't be able to escape," the Flame Demon laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>His form turned into a ball of flame and dispersed on the spot, as if spreading throughout the entire celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu Yan, treasures aren't so easy to take. Once you come in, let's see how you escape from my grasp this time," Mei Wu gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>Besides hating Xu Yan, she hated Li Xuan even more.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan was his disciple, taught by that bastard!</p><p></p><p>"When your disciple falls into my hands, let's see what you can do!" Mei Wu's eyes were cold and fierce.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, that kid has appeared," the Flame Demon's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally here." Mei Wu breathed a sigh of relief, afraid that Xu Yan wouldn't come.</p><p></p><p>"Dian Wu, it's time to go in and deceive Xu Yan a bit."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's form disappeared as she went into hiding.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Dian Wu's figure entered the celestial cave and hid not far from the pool.</p><p></p><p>However, his hiding deliberately left some flaws. As long as Xu Yan got close, he would certainly discover him.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, good kid. Being able to resist my Dian Wu Evil Eye, I definitely can't let you grow up," Dian Wu laughed coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the celestial cave, with Mei Wu and Flame Demon in hiding, plus himself, once Xu Yan came in, he wouldn't be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>To deal with Xu Yan, he knew that Mei Wu had paid a price to bring in a decent treasure.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Outside the celestial cave, the commotion continued as Xu Yan searched for a way to enter.</p><p></p><p>However, after a while, the noise disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's form appeared as she looked at Dian Wu and asked: "Didn't the map you gave him tell him how to enter?"</p><p></p><p>Dian Wu's mouth twitched, "I was afraid it would be too obvious, so..."</p><p></p><p>Now Mei Wu became a bit anxious. What if Xu Yan couldn't find the way in? Fortunately, an hour later, there was noise again. Xu Yan hadn't given up.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you little bastard, you better find a way in," Mei Wu thought anxiously, afraid that Xu Yan might suddenly give up.</p><p></p><p>However, after a while, the noise disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Flame Demon, create some fluctuations to let Xu Yan find the way in," Mei Wu couldn't sit still anymore and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Dian Wu really isn't reliable!" Flame Demon said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Dian Wu's face was embarrassed, and he also cursed inwardly. Xu Yan seemed quite clever, how could he not even find the way in?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A stream of scorching energy gushed out through the entrance of the celestial cave, as if Xu Yan's series of probing had finally triggered the cave's energy.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. I thought it was just Dian Wu, but there's another one. Is this to seal off the celestial cave?"</p><p></p><p>"Directly using flames to seal the cave, wanting to trap me completely without giving me a chance to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw the commotion created by the Flame Demon.</p><p></p><p>"The strength is just so-so, not exceeding the Immortal realm. And they think this can trap me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment. In an instant, the distant forest turned into a series of long swords that flew over, overlapping with each other to form a short sword that fell into his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can trap you for a moment, that will be enough."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a plan. At the same time, an array disk appeared in his hand. Used unexpectedly, it would be enough to confuse Dian Wu for a moment.</p><p></p><p>And that moment would be enough for him to trick Mei Wu and get the treasures.</p><p></p><p>He made a show of creating more commotion, and finally found the method to enter. With a look of joy on his face, he cautiously and carefully entered the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone became alert and quietly activated their protective powers, ready to respond to any potential crisis.</p><p></p><p>The tunnel began slanting downwards, and based on the estimation, they seemed to have entered the swamp area.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint light appeared up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, especially the scout cultivator, who quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>The light grew brighter, and upon exiting the tunnel, they entered a tomb chamber dotted with what appeared to be stars.</p><p></p><p>"It's Moonstone, so many Moonstones!" </p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that the Azure Sky Leviathan loves Moonstones, so this might truly be the Azure Sky Leviathan's tomb!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the talented cultivators became excited.</p><p></p><p>Moonstone, with its moonlight-like glow, is one of the luminescent objects used in the Spiritual Realm. However, Moonstone is produced in the Misty State's Azure Sea, far from the Jade State, so the amount of Moonstone circulating in the Jade State is relatively scarce.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan entered the tomb chamber, he heightened his vigilance. Silently, within a ten-zhang radius around him, his sword intent had already enveloped the area, blending into the environment, making it difficult to detect. </p><p></p><p>Surrounding him were also faint swirling winds, as he had also activated his Gentle Wind Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the vast tomb chamber, it seemed as if a giant dragon was coiled up. In front of the dragon was a small tree about half a zhang tall, its branches twisting like a leviathan, the leaves a vibrant green.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald Leviathan Tree! On both sides of the coiled giant dragon, the ground was covered in a layer of fine brown vines, bearing small fruits.</p><p></p><p>Dragon's Eye Fruit! "It's the Emerald Leviathan Tree!"</p><p></p><p>The talented cultivators' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon's Eye Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>This place was undoubtedly the Azure Sky Leviathan's tomb, for only here would the Emerald Leviathan Tree and Dragon's Eye Fruit grow - third-grade and second-grade spiritual herbs, which, while not the rarest in the Spiritual Realm, were still considered high-grade.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald Leviathan Tree was rumored to have a powerful effect on physical bodies, able to nearly double the physical strength of even great Celestial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragon's Eye Fruit, it could strengthen one's divine sense, making one's divine soul more resilient. Once one broke through to the Refining Divine Celestial Cultivator realm, their refined divine soul would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>There were also rumors that the Dragon's Eye Fruit could increase the success rate of breaking through to the Refining Divine Celestial Cultivator realm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because the Dragon's Eye Fruit held no use for Refining Divine Celestial Cultivators that an agreement was reached, allowing the younger generation of each faction to come and explore, as well as compete.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon's Eye Fruit was more numerous, while there was only one Emerald Leviathan Tree, causing the atmosphere among the cultivators to become tense.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained calm, not rushing to collect the spiritual herbs. This was out of caution, letting the others explore first. Here, his strength was the greatest, and no one could contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing his brows, he stared at the coiled dragon, suddenly realizing that it was likely the sarcophagus of the Azure Sky Leviathan. Furthermore, the form of the giant dragon was not quite perfect, differing slightly from the true dragon form.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, Xu Yan's gaze sharpened as he looked towards the tomb's entrance. Just now, it seemed something had entered!</p><p></p><p>Since it had not entered the range of his sword intent, Xu Yan did not know what it was.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive hidden technique."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became alert, slightly expanding the range of his sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Emerald Leviathan Tree is mine, and I want three Dragon's Eye Fruits."</p><p></p><p>The young man from the Jade Divine Sect spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Shen Haizhou, then shifted to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I have no objections," Shen Haizhou said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators fell silent for a moment before nodding.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect was the number one spiritual sect in the Jade State. Both in background and strength, they had the qualifications.</p><p></p><p>"You, go and dig up the Emerald Leviathan Tree," the young man ordered a scout cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The scout cultivator, though not employed by the young man, dared not disobey, for this was the might of the number one spiritual sect in the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>Cautiously approaching, without any abnormalities or dangers appearing, he finally relaxed and began to prepare to dig up the Emerald Leviathan Tree.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression suddenly tensed, but he did not speak up or take action.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In a corner of the tomb, a sword-like light flashed, and in an instant, it pierced through the cultivator digging up the Emerald Leviathan Tree. Plop! The cultivator died!</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>"Who struck?"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the cultivators' expressions changed drastically. Surging with aura, weapons in hand, they warily distanced themselves from each other, on guard.</p><p></p><p>The young man from the Jade Divine Sect had a gloomy expression, a faint silver light emanating from his body as a long, narrow blade in his hand gleamed with cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Who struck? Is this a provocation against my Jade Divine Sect?"</p><p></p><p>That sword-like light had been too fast, flashing and disappearing in an instant. Everyone had let their guard down and failed to notice what it was.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly a sword light?</p><p></p><p>"Would you care to explain, sir?" the young man from the Jade Divine Sect asked, his gaze darkening as he looked at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, the only one with the strength to do this was Xu Yan, Shen Haizhou, or himself. And Xu Yan was the only sword cultivator among the three.</p><p></p><p>He was the prime suspect.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave the man a cold look, his gaze falling on the man's spiritual blade, deep in thought. "So this is a spiritual artifact from the Spiritual Realm. It's indeed much stronger than a treasure."</p><p></p><p>"I disdain to use such underhanded means of harming others in the dark," he replied coldly, continuing to look at the Emerald Leviathan Tree.</p><p></p><p>That sword-like attack just now had been incredibly fast, flashing and disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Was it a dart?" Xu Yan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The young man from the Jade Divine Sect had a gloomy expression as he looked at another scout cultivator, ordering, "Go, dig up the Emerald Leviathan Tree."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, sir!" </p><p></p><p>The cultivator, trembling with fear, remained vigilant and prepared to respond to any attacks.</p><p></p><p>The young man from the Jade Divine Sect kept his gaze fixed on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The others did the same.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, it was most likely that Xu Yan had struck.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator approached the Emerald Leviathan Tree, glancing sideways at Xu Yan. Seeing no immediate action, he finally relaxed a bit, but still did not let his guard down as he carefully prepared to dig up the tree.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The cultivator was instantly pierced through and collapsed, dead.</p><p></p><p>"Who, sneaking around and not daring to show themselves!" the young man from the Jade Divine Sect roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not made a move, which meant there was another powerful expert present.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xu Yan clearly saw what that flash of light was.</p><p></p><p>It was a snake!</p><p></p><p>"A spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen a spirit beast, and this snake was not weak in strength, especially in its speed and concealment abilities.</p><p></p><p>When it attacked, its entire body was crystalline, like a sword of light, and after the attack, it instantly changed color, blending into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The young man from the Jade Divine Sect, holding his spiritual blade, stepped towards the Emerald Leviathan Tree, coldly saying, "Let's see how you'll stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Emerald Leviathan Tree, he did not crouch down to dig it up, as that would leave him vulnerable and in danger.</p><p></p><p>"Come, dig up the tree!" he commanded another scout cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I... " The martial artist's face turned pale, and he shrank back in fear.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The genius who had recruited him suddenly struck, slaying him on the spot, and coldly said, "Defying the command of the Spirit Sect, you shall be executed!"</p><p></p><p>Pointing to another person, he said, "You, go dig up the Emerald Python Tree!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist's face turned pale, and he trembled as he approached the Emerald Python Tree, seeing the Jade Spirit Sect youth standing guard, and he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He bent down, preparing to dig up the Emerald Python Tree.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the light flashed again! The Jade Spirit Sect youth was well-prepared, his gaze cold, and he struck out with a sword.</p><p></p><p>However, the light suddenly made a turn, avoiding his sword, and with a pu sound, it pierced through the body of the martial artist who was about to dig the tree, then disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Spiritual Beast Clan!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Jade Spirit Sect youth shouted sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, how dare this beast be so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill this beast, and then discuss the ownership of the treasure!"</p><p></p><p>The group of geniuses were immediately enraged.</p><p></p><p>They prepared to strike and suppress the spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, this is a Fourth-Rank Spiritual Beast, it may even be a late Fourth-Rank Spiritual Beast," Dai Jun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A Fourth-Rank Spiritual Beast was equivalent to a small Celestial Being at the Gathering Spirit Realm. After realizing it was a spiritual beast, the group of geniuses scattered, and some even guarded the entrance to prevent the spiritual beast from escaping.</p><p></p><p>Although the tomb was vast, and the spiritual beast's concealment techniques were strong, now that it had been exposed, it would soon be discovered and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the light flashed again, but this time, it did not kill anyone, but shot towards a Moonlight Stone.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The Moonlight Stone disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, stop it!"</p><p></p><p>The group of geniuses were furious, and they all struck out, but since they were afraid of damaging the treasures in the tomb, they tried to restrain their attacks as much as possible to avoid causing any collateral damage.</p><p></p><p>The little snake moved incredibly fast, evading one attack after another, and each time it flashed, a Moonlight Stone would disappear.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the tomb began to grow darker.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect youth seized the opportunity, suddenly striking out with a powerful blow, and with a bang, the light was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>The group of geniuses all struck towards the fleeing light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had already arrived at the Emerald Python Tree.</p><p></p><p>He took out an iron shovel and started digging, letting the group of geniuses continue their pursuit of the little snake.</p><p></p><p>By now, the tomb had grown quite dark, especially around the Emerald Python Tree, as the group of geniuses had all focused their attention on suppressing the little snake, and they didn't notice Xu Yan digging up the Emerald Python Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald Python Tree was dug up, and after sealing it with a sealing talisman, it was stored in Xu Yan's storage bag. He had already learned the sealing technique from Meng Shu.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the group of geniuses were still furiously attacking the little snake, their curses echoing endlessly, but the snake was incredibly fast, and if they weren't careful, someone might get injured. And as long as it found an opportunity, another Moonlight Stone would disappear.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan guessed the snake's intention - once the tomb was completely shrouded in darkness, it would be the time for its hunt.</p><p></p><p>After digging up the Emerald Python Tree, he went to pick the Dragon's Eye Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched the person crouching on the ground, carefully picking the Dragon's Eye Fruit, without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou felt a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is all yours, brother!"</p><p></p><p>He stuffed the picked Dragon's Eye Fruit into Xu Yan's hand and then shuffled back.</p><p></p><p>"Let's pick them together, and hurry up."</p><p></p><p>After putting the Dragon's Eye Fruit into his storage bag, Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The tomb was quickly growing dark, and once it was completely dark, picking the Dragon's Eye Fruit would be more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Shen Haizhou hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>And so the two of them began to pick the Dragon's Eye Fruit, while the battle was growing more and more intense, and the tomb was becoming increasingly dark.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, we're done, they're all here!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Dragon's Eye Fruit was all picked, and Shen Haizhou handed them to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a greedy person, you can keep nine-tenths of the Dragon's Eye Fruit you picked," Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou cursed inwardly, "This isn't greedy?" "Brother, you're too generous, to take care of a complete stranger like this, I'm so grateful!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had a look of deep gratitude on his face.</p><p></p><p>He left a few Dragon's Eye Fruits behind, and the rest were all placed in Xu Yan's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sounds of battle suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The tomb had grown very dim.</p><p></p><p>Only the largest moonstone at the top of the tomb was still shedding its light, illuminating the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun and the others were now dumbfounded. "We were suppressing the spiritual beast, and you were secretly digging up the spirit herbs? And that bastard Shen Haizhou, he really is a disgrace to his family!"</p><p></p><p>The bloodied little snake, despite its incredible speed that allowed it to evade 99% of the attacks, was still injured in the fierce battle. Now, with its eyes wide open, white flames suddenly surged all over its body.</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you, I'll kill you, how dare you steal my spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The little snake instantly transformed into a thirty-foot-long crystal-clear snake, with white flames covering its entire body. It raised its head, its eyes glaring furiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Jade Crystal Snake!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun and the others also glared angrily at Xu Yan, "Hand over the spirit herbs, or else..."</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan ignored them, and instead looked at the Jade Crystal Snake with amazement, "It can speak?"</p><p></p><p>Even the Crimson Cat, a great demon, could not speak human language. </p><p></p><p>"Generally, spiritual beasts cannot speak human language. Only Sixth-Rank Spiritual Beasts can communicate through their spiritual consciousness. However, this Jade Crystal Snake is somewhat special - it can speak," Shen Haizhou explained while carefully backing away.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The Jade Crystal Snake roared in fury, its massive body striking down like a giant whip.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to act, but his expression suddenly changed, and his figure flashed, instantly appearing in a different position.</p><p></p><p>Spatial Displacement!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Jade Crystal Snake's huge tail slammed into the spot where Xu Yan had just been standing, shaking the entire tomb, with shattered stones and a cloud of black dust filling the air.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to hog the spirit herbs, hand them over!" The Jade Spirit Sect youth and the others roared, striking towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure flashed again, instantly changing positions, as the Jade Crystal Snake attacked once more.</p><p></p><p>A figure was stealthily moving along the tomb wall, slowly inching forward, its eyes fixed on the coiled dragon in the center of the tomb. </p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat were forming on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou swallowed hard, his heart trembling. In the moment the Jade Crystal Snake attacked, he saw a faint ripple of spiritual power emanating from the coiled dragon.</p><p></p><p>Was the Azure Sky Serpent still alive?</p><p></p><p>The mere thought of this possibility made his legs feel weak, so while the Jade Crystal Snake and the group of geniuses were all focused on attacking Xu Yan, he slowly moved towards the entrance, not wanting to draw any attention.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not immediately leave. </p><p></p><p>As he watched the chaos in the tomb, with Xu Yan constantly shifting positions in a mysterious manner, he was deeply shocked by his companion's formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Xu Yan appeared in front of the coiled dragon once more, and the Jade Crystal Snake's furious attack came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

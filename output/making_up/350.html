        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is the Sky Cave?" Xu Yan finally couldn't contain his curiosity and asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cave..." Li Xuan's gaze was deep as he slowly said: "When your strength becomes greater, your horizons broaden, and you understand more about heaven and earth, you will naturally come to know. </p><p></p><p>"If your master directly told you the root of it, you would lose the desire to seek it out, which may not be good. Having the desire to explore mysteries is the essence of pursuing the martial way..."</p><p></p><p>In truth, Li Xuan had no idea what the Sky Cave was. </p><p></p><p>As a transcendent master who had surpassed heaven and earth, an all-knowing teacher, he naturally couldn't say he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan spoke to his disciple with an instructive tone.</p><p></p><p>"Master is right!" Xu Yan was stunned for a moment, then nodded, feeling his master's words made sense. Losing curiosity about mysteries would lower one's desire to seek knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"Master is telling me to maintain a heart that seeks knowledge. The path of martial arts is long, and only by maintaining a seeking heart can one broaden one's horizons and forge one's own path in martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction, "I'm glad you understand your master's good intentions!"</p><p></p><p>Since the master had said this, Su Lingxiu, despite her curiosity, didn't dare to ask further and could only feel frustrated.</p><p></p><p>As the flying ship left Cloud State and entered Ice State territory, suddenly a group of people came fleeing in disarray.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, lend a hand and save Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>When Wu Tiannan saw the Changqing Pavilion flying ship, he immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, save Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Pavilion Master Lei Yun and the others hurriedly prostrated themselves and called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, this was their only hope.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou both believed that only the expert from Changqing Pavilion could save Spirit Realm, and they had always suspected that person might be a Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Even the Thousand Martial Palace Master and others had no choice but to prostrate themselves now.</p><p></p><p>No grudges mattered more than their lives.</p><p></p><p>They had to beg for help when necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others looked to their master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm as ever, holding a book and reading, showing no sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look at the Sky Cave," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship headed towards the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were extremely excited - was the senior going to subdue the Soul-Devouring Enchantress?</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master and others also had looks of anticipation. What level of strength did this mysterious expert have? Could he be even stronger than a Heavenly Venerate? Could he be the True King existence mentioned by that Heavenly Venerate?</p><p></p><p>As for what a True King was, they weren't very clear. In their knowledge, Heavenly Venerates who had condensed laws were already supremely lofty.</p><p></p><p>What realm was a True King? As they approached the Sky Cave, the aftershocks of the great battle had already dissipated.</p><p></p><p>That bed was floating above the Sky Cave, with the martial artists of Jingxue Palace once again standing gracefully in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the bed, a figure had just stopped struggling.</p><p></p><p>A delicate white hand was grasping the neck of that Heavenly Venerate, having devoured his divine soul, refined away his consciousness, and converted it into her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerate's corpse was gradually becoming withered.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Those who saw this scene felt their hearts trembling uncontrollably. Even the immensely powerful Heavenly Venerate had his divine soul absorbed!</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress looked towards the flying ship, her brows furrowing slightly. What kind of divine artifact was this? She didn't rush to attack, but continued refining the Heavenly Venerate's divine soul to strengthen herself.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the Sky Cave, streams of pink energy continuously surged up and entered her body, making her appear even more bewitching and also somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, slay this great enemy of the Sky Cave!" Xin Mengrou said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"No rush." Li Xuan glanced over and inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. The Enchantress's strength wasn't too great; he could annihilate her with one strike.</p><p></p><p>However, the source of her power came from the Sky Cave. Unless the Sky Cave was blocked off, it would be impossible to completely destroy her with one strike.</p><p></p><p>And blocking off the Sky Cave would require some effort.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze fell on her, his brows furrowing slightly. Something was off about the Enchantress, as if she wasn't made of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Similar to an avatar?"</p><p></p><p>"But not quite. It seems to be a body born through some method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is...?" Xin Mengrou was stunned. Why was there no rush?</p><p></p><p>"When her strength reaches its peak, I will naturally make my move," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of an expert! This is confidence, this is the demeanor of a great master, not taking advantage of others' weaknesses!" Wu Tiannan inwardly marveled.</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful figures all breathed sighs of relief.</p><p></p><p>The expert was directly giving the Enchantress a chance to refine the Heavenly Venerate's divine soul instead of striking immediately. This showed how confident and powerful he was.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Realm was saved!</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress would no longer be able to wreak havoc in Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the powerful figures were looking forward to the expert making a strong move to kill the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Sky Cave with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly the same as the cave he had seen in the Black Abyss of the Azure Sea. The only difference was that the cave in the Black Abyss was very small, while this cave was already enormous.</p><p></p><p>So this was the Sky Cave? He couldn't help but walk out of the Changqing Pavilion flying ship and approach the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, the cave seemed like a huge hole between heaven and earth, as if some powerful force had pierced through heaven and earth, leaving behind an enormous hole.</p><p></p><p>This was the Sky Cave!</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cave, a hole in heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"The Void-Breaking realm is not bound by the laws of heaven and earth, not restricted by the space of heaven and earth. It breaks open the void of heaven and earth and traverses across it."</p><p></p><p>"It has similarities to this Sky Cave."</p><p></p><p>"The difference is that Void-Breaking power crosses the void of heaven and earth, walking within the void, but does not leave a huge hole between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The reason the Sky Cave exists is that the endless power props open the laws of heaven and earth, props open the space of heaven and earth, allowing the Sky Cave to persist."</p><p></p><p>"It's also as if a hole has been punched through heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had some understanding in his heart. He gained a deeper comprehension of the Void-Breaking realm, and vaguely felt he was just a tiny bit away from comprehending the martial way of the Void-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he walked towards the Sky Cave. He wanted to take a look and see exactly what was going on with the Sky Cave, exactly how it had pierced through heaven and earth to form.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Cave in the Black Abyss of the Azure Sea was too small, with limited insights to be gained. But this Sky Cave was so enormous, allowing for clearer comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"What is Senior Brother doing?" Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The others were also puzzled. Was Xu Yan going to fight the Enchantress? He was indeed very strong, at the peak of Spirit Realm's young talents, and in terms of strength, also at the peak of Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he was still no match for a Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Even a Heavenly Venerate had been killed. After devouring the Heavenly Venerate's divine soul, the Enchantress had become even stronger. How could Xu Yan be her match?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, however, raised an eyebrow, secretly becoming excited.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing the Sky Cave, has Xu Yan gained some insights into the martial way of the Void-Breaking realm?"</p><p></p><p>"If so, he should be able to break through to the Void-Breaking realm soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. Although the Void-Breaking realm had not transcended heaven and earth, it was the foundational realm for transcendence.</p><p></p><p>And he had already mostly made up the realms above Void-Breaking.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan could comprehend the martial way of the Void-Breaking realm, he could pass on the martial ways of the realms above Void-Breaking to Xu Yan in advance.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it wouldn't be long before he could comprehend them?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is not far from the Divine Ability realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, once Xu Yan entered the realm of divine powers, he would receive divine power feedback.</p><p></p><p>"What a fragrant smell!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu suddenly looked up at Xu Yan, who was approaching the celestial cave, her eyes brightening sharply.</p><p></p><p>"However, why do I feel that something is off about him? It seems it would be extremely difficult for me to devour and absorb him..."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was somewhat puzzled. </p><p></p><p>She felt this person was rather unusual, and devouring him would be even more difficult than the Celestial Lord from earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother, are you lonely all by yourself? Would you like big sister to keep you company?" </p><p></p><p>In the Jingxue Palace, the Jade Palace Master walked towards Xu Yan with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><p>A faint pink light flickered in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The power of seduction surged forth continuously, as if trying to arouse one's primal desires.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Wu Tiannan couldn't help but warn.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan didn't even spare a glance. Whatever seductive power she had was completely ineffective against him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the Taicang Book and silently watched Mei Wu. If she were to make a move, he would cut her down! As for the likes of the Jade Palace Master, she was merely a trace of soul possession, not worth worrying about and incapable of posing any threat to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother..." </p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master drew closer and closer, the light gauze on her body about to fall off, revealing almost all of her delicate white skin, which had a faint pink tinge.</p><p></p><p>This scene of ultimate seduction seemed intent on stealing away Xu Yan's heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the other Spirit Realm experts stared with wide eyes, secretly shocked. Even at such a distance, and not being the target, they were still somewhat affected by that seductive power.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was facing this seduction head-on, and in the prime of youth - how could he possibly resist?</p><p></p><p>"Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"That bitch deserves to die!" </p><p></p><p>In the Changqing Pavilion, Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and struck out with his sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike erupted in an instant, as if rivers and mountains had converged, or as if all living beings had taken up swords to strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Jade Palace Master didn't expect Xu Yan to completely ignore her seductive powers.</p><p></p><p>Her expression changed as she hurriedly made a move to defend herself.</p><p></p><p>Puff! However, under this sword strike, the Jade Palace Master's physical body was instantly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The trace of soul that had possessed the Jade Palace Master's body was also split apart under the sword intent, finally dissipating into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu, who had been lounging lazily on the couch, suddenly changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword technique is this? It can even destroy a trace of my soul?"</p><p></p><p>She sat up in shock, looking at the young man who had walked to the edge of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother, you killed my servant..."</p><p></p><p>She raised a delicate white hand, about to grab Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Do not disturb my disciple's enlightenment." </p><p></p><p>A voice like thunder exploded in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Her raised hand instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's expression changed as she looked sharply towards the Changqing Pavilion, her expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly: "My name is something you cannot bear!"</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu stood up, and the Spirit Snow Palace warriors who had been surrounding the couch all collapsed to the ground, their souls returning to Mei Wu's body.</p><p></p><p>More pink light surged from the celestial cave, entering Mei Wu's body.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>"There is no name that I, Mei Wu, cannot bear!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained composed, "Not only can you not bear my name, even heaven and earth cannot bear it!"</p><p></p><p>Boasting was something he excelled at!</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others were shocked. So this is what a true expert was like?</p><p></p><p>He was truly on another level!</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Then I, Mei Wu, would like to experience..."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu stepped off the couch.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't reached your peak yet. Wait until you've reached your peak before we talk. For now, be quiet and don't disturb my disciple's enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura flashed briefly around Li Xuan as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's heart trembled, her expression extremely solemn. This person seemed truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath, silently standing in place, frantically refining the Celestial Lord's soul to increase her power while trying to draw as much power as possible from the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>Although the amount of power that could be drawn from this celestial cave was limited, every bit helped. Only by becoming stronger would she have a chance against this person!</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's expression was extremely grave. She couldn't understand why such a powerful person had appeared in the Spirit Realm, someone who gave her a sense of unfathomable depth.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze shifted slightly towards Xu Yan, who was staring intently at the bottom of the celestial cave. Her brows furrowed slightly - what was he looking at? Could he actually gain some insight from the celestial cave?</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, a pink lotus flower appeared above her head.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the lotus, Mei Wu's true form appeared. The celestial cave trembled slightly, expanding a tiny bit more.</p><p></p><p>Strands of pink energy continuously surged from the bottom of the celestial cave, entering the true form of Mei Wu in the center of the lotus.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently observed the celestial cave. The massive cave appeared to be underground, but it wasn't actually an underground cavern. Rather, it was a gray-black cavern space.</p><p></p><p>It was like a hole opened between heaven and earth. Strands of pink energy continuously surged from the gray-black bottom of the celestial cave, as if transmitted from beyond heaven and earth through this hole.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the celestial cave? Could it penetrate heaven and earth, with this energy coming from beyond?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered in confusion.</p><p></p><p>His insights into the Void-breaking Realm gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking the void, penetrating space, shattering space... Divine powers are the laws of martial artists, while divine manifestations control the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Using one's own laws to penetrate the laws of heaven and earth - how does one penetrate? </p><p></p><p>"This requires the power to break the void. How does one cultivate the power to break the void? Infiltration, expansion, tearing, penetration..."</p><p></p><p>As his insights deepened, Xu Yan's understanding of the Void-breaking Realm became increasingly clear.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he formed ideas about the power to break the void.</p><p></p><p>"The Void-breaking Realm represents a huge leap. Master has transcended heaven and earth, truly an expert beyond compare. Even the slightest hint of his true aura can bring turmoil to heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is because Master has surpassed heaven and earth, and breaking the void is clearly a foundation for transcendence. Only by possessing the power to break the void, to ignore the constraints of space in heaven and earth, can one lay the groundwork for transcendence.</p><p></p><p>"I see now, so that's what it is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood - so this was the nature of the Void-breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, numerous insights flooded his mind. He had nearly sorted out the martial way of the Void-breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With some time to organize and refine the technique, I will truly comprehend the martial way of the Void-breaking Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This trip had been worth it! Moreover, he had developed a strong interest in the celestial cave. Standing here, he vaguely sensed that there seemed to be some extraordinary auras within the cave.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't heavenly spiritual energy, but rather a kind of indescribable aura.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses, he looked at Mei Wu, whose aura had returned to its peak, then turned and went back to the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Mei Wu's aura hadn't strengthened further and had reached its limit, Li Xuan also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He had truly feared that she would keep growing stronger until she could contend with him. If he as the expert couldn't subdue her with one palm strike, it would damage his image.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't stop Mei Wu wasn't purely to show off, but because those strands of energy surging from the celestial cave also helped Xu Yan comprehend the methods of the Void-breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental reason he had refrained from taking action.</p><p></p><p>It's the last day of 2023. Happy New Year everyone! If you have monthly tickets, please vote! ^_^</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

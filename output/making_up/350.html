        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is the Heavenly Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could no longer suppress his curiosity and asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Abyss..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was pensive as he slowly said, "When your strength grows and your vision expands, when you understand more about the heavens and earth, you will naturally know what it is.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to directly tell you the root of it, you might lose the desire to seek it out. It is better to have the urge to explore the mysteries, for that is the essence of pursuing the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>In truth, Li Xuan did not know what the Heavenly Abyss was. As a peerless expert who had transcended the heavens and earth, the all-knowing master could not admit his own ignorance.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan looked at his disciple with an air of instruction.</p><p></p><p>"The master is right!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paused for a moment, then nodded, feeling that the master's words made sense. If one loses the curiosity towards mysteries, the drive to seek would diminish.</p><p></p><p>"The master is telling me to maintain a heart of exploration. The path of the Dao is long and arduous, only by keeping the spirit of seeking can one expand one's horizons and find one's own Dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with a look of satisfaction, "I'm glad you comprehend the master's intention."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the master's words, Su Ling Xiu, though still curious, did not dare to ask further, feeling dejected.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship left the Cloud State and entered the Ice State. Suddenly, a group of people came fleeing in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, lend a hand and save the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the flying ship of the Green Pine Pavilion, Wu Tiannan became greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, save the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of Thunder Cloud and others prostrated on the ground, pleading loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, this was their only hope.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou believed that the powerful expert of the Green Pine Pavilion could save the Spirit Realm, and they had long suspected that this senior might be the existence of the True Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sect Master of the Thousand Martial Pavilion and the others had to prostrate on the ground. </p><p></p><p>Whatever grievances, they paled in comparison to their lives.</p><p></p><p>They had to seek help, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others looked towards their master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still calm and collected, reading a book without any sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look at the Heavenly Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship headed towards the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were greatly excited, was the senior going to suppress the Demonic Sorceress?</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Thousand Martial Pavilion and the others also had an expectant look, what kind of power did this mysterious senior possess? Could it be stronger than the True Sovereign? Could it be the True King that the True Sovereign mentioned?</p><p></p><p>As for what the True King was, they were not too clear. In their knowledge, the Refined Law True Sovereign was already at the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>What realm was the True King? As they approached the Heavenly Abyss, the aftermath of the battle had already dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The floating bed was hovering above the Heavenly Abyss, and the warriors of the Serene Snow Palace were once again standing in front of the bed.</p><p></p><p>Within the bed, a figure had just stopped struggling.</p><p></p><p>A delicate white hand was grasping the neck of the True Sovereign, having devoured the True Sovereign's divine soul and refined it into her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The True Sovereign's body was gradually withering away.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Those who witnessed this scene felt their hearts tremble, the mighty True Sovereign had also had his divine soul drained.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sorceress looked towards the flying ship, her brows slightly furrowed. What was this divine artifact? She did not hurry to attack, but was instead refining the True Sovereign's divine soul to enhance her own strength.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the Heavenly Abyss, streams of pink energy were constantly surging up, entering her body, making her appear more bewitching and powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, slay the great evil of the Heavenly Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over, relieved in his heart. The Demonic Sorceress's strength was not too formidable, he could easily destroy her with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>However, her power was derived from the Heavenly Abyss. Unless he could block the Heavenly Abyss, he would not be able to completely annihilate her.</p><p></p><p>To block the Heavenly Abyss would require some effort.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze shifted, his brows slightly furrowed. The Demonic Sorceress seemed a bit unusual, as if she was not a flesh and blood being.</p><p></p><p>"Similar to a clone? But not quite, it seems to be a body born in a certain way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what is this?" </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was puzzled, why was he not hurrying?</p><p></p><p>"I will act when her strength reaches its peak."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The senior is truly remarkable, this is confidence, this is the bearing of a powerful expert, not rushing into danger!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts all felt relieved. </p><p></p><p>The senior directly gave the Demonic Sorceress the chance to refine the True Sovereign's divine soul, which showed his unwavering confidence and immense strength.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm is safe now! </p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sorceress will no longer be able to wreak havoc in the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone eagerly anticipated the senior's powerful strike to slay the Demonic Sorceress.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Heavenly Abyss, his expression one of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly the same as the cave he had seen in the Black Abyss of the Emerald Sea, the only difference being that the cave in the Black Abyss was much smaller, while this Heavenly Abyss was gigantic.</p><p></p><p>So this was the Heavenly Abyss? He couldn't help but step out of the Green Pine Pavilion's flying ship and approach the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, the cave seemed like a massive hole between heaven and earth, as if a powerful force had pierced through the heavens and earth, leaving behind this enormous abyss.</p><p></p><p>This was the Heavenly Abyss! "The Heavenly Abyss, a hole in the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"Transcending Boundaries, not bound by the laws of heaven and earth, not constrained by the spatial dimensions of heaven and earth, breaking through the void of heaven and earth, traversing the void of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It has similarities with this Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The difference is that the power of Transcending Boundaries, while crossing the void of heaven and earth, does not leave behind a massive hole between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of the Heavenly Abyss is due to the endless power that props open the laws and spatial dimensions of heaven and earth, allowing the Heavenly Abyss to persist.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if the heavens and earth have been pierced through with a hole?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a dawning realization, gaining a deeper understanding of the Dao of Transcending Boundaries. He felt that he was just a step away from comprehending the Dao of Transcending Boundaries.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he approached the Heavenly Abyss, wanting to take a closer look and truly understand how this Heavenly Abyss was formed by piercing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss in the Black Abyss of the Emerald Sea was too small, limiting his insights. This massive Heavenly Abyss would allow him to gain a clearer understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, what is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The others were also puzzled. Was Xu Yan going to fight the Demonic Sorceress? He was indeed very strong, the peerless genius of the Spirit Realm, and his strength could even rival the True Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But the True Sovereign had been killed, and after the Demonic Sorceress had devoured the True Sovereign's divine soul, her strength had grown even more. How could Xu Yan be her match?</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan's brows raised slightly, his heart secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is gaining insights into the Dao of Transcending Boundaries by looking at the Heavenly Abyss. This means he is about to break through the Transcending Boundaries realm very soon.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can pass on the cultivation methods beyond the Transcending Boundaries realm to him earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it won't be long before he comprehends the Dao of Mystical Enlightenment as well!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation. Xu Yan was already not far from the realm of Mystical Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unable to wait any longer, as soon as Xu Yan entered the Shen Tong Boundary, he would receive feedback from his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"What a fragrant scent!"</p><p></p><p>The Mei Wu suddenly lifted her head and looked towards the approaching Xu Yan, her eyes suddenly shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>"However, I feel that something is not quite right about him, it seems that I want to devour and absorb him, but the difficulty is extremely great..."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She always felt that this person was somewhat unusual, and absorbing him would be even more difficult than the previous Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, you are all alone, does sister want to accompany you?"</p><p></p><p>In the Quiet Snow Palace, the Jade Palace Master walked towards Xu Yan with a charming smile.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were faintly tinged with a pink glow.</p><p></p><p>Her bewitching power was constantly surging forth, as if it wanted to arouse the primal desires of the person.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan couldn't help but warn.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan didn't even glance at it, the bewitching power had no effect on him at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the Tai Cang Book and silently watched the Mei Wu, if she were to make a move, he would immediately slay her! As for the likes of the Jade Palace Master, they were merely a wisp of divine soul possession, posing no threat to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother..."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Palace Master drew closer and closer, her light veil almost leaving her body, revealing her delicate white skin that was faintly tinged with a light pink.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate bewitching scene, seemingly wanting to lure away Xu Yan's heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tian Hai and the other powerful cultivators in the Ling Domain were all wide-eyed, secretly shocked, even though they were at a distance and it was not directed at them, they were still somewhat affected by the bewitching power.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan faced this bewitchment, and being young and vigorous, how could he resist it? "Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"The bitch deserves to die!" </p><p></p><p>In the Long Qing Pavilion, Du Yu Ying and Yun Miao Miao cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Scram!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and instantly unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was instantaneous, like the convergence of mountains and rivers, or like the masses wielding a sword to strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Jade Palace Master did not expect Xu Yan to completely ignore her bewitching power.</p><p></p><p>Her expression changed, and she hurriedly took action.</p><p></p><p>Pu! But under this sword strike, the Jade Palace Master's physical body was instantly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The wisp of divine soul that was possessing the Jade Palace Master's body was also shattered and dissipated under the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The originally lazy Mei Wu lying on the couch suddenly changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword dao is this? It can even destroy my wisp of divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>She was shocked as she sat up, looking at the young man who had walked to the edge of the Tian Ku.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, you killed my servant..."</p><p></p><p>She raised a delicate white hand, about to grab Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Do not disturb my disciple's contemplation."</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice suddenly resounded in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Her raised hand immediately froze.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's expression changed, and she quickly looked towards the Long Qing Pavilion, her expression becoming increasingly grave.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly said, "My name is something you cannot bear to hear!"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu stood up, and the originally surrounding Quiet Snow Palace warriors all collapsed to the ground, their divine souls returning to Mei Wu's main body.</p><p></p><p>And in the Tian Ku, more pink light surged forth, entering Mei Wu's body.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>"There is no name that Mei Wu cannot bear!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still as calm as ever, "My name, not only can you not bear it, even the heavens and earth cannot bear it!"</p><p></p><p>Boasting, he was very good at it!</p><p></p><p>Fu Tian Hai and the others were greatly shocked, this was truly a powerful expert?</p><p></p><p>He was indeed too powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Then let Mei Wu experience it..."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu stepped out from the couch.</p><p></p><p>"You have not yet reached the peak, wait until you reach the peak, then we'll talk. For now, be quiet and do not disturb my disciple's contemplation."</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura flashed briefly around Li Xuan as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was greatly shaken, this person seemed to be truly powerful. </p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath and stood silently, frantically refining the Celestial Venerable's divine soul to enhance her strength, while trying to absorb as much power as possible from the Tian Ku.</p><p></p><p>Although the power that could be absorbed from this Tian Ku was limited, every bit of strength counted. Only by becoming stronger could she have a chance of dealing with this person!</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's expression was extremely grave, and she couldn't quite understand why the Ling Domain would produce such a powerful person, even giving her a sense of unfathomable depth.</p><p></p><p>Glancing slightly, she looked at Xu Yan who was staring at the bottom of the Tian Ku, her brows slightly furrowed. What was he looking at? Could it be that he could still sense something from the Tian Ku?</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, a pink lotus flower appeared above her head.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the lotus, Mei Wu's figure was revealed, and the Tian Ku trembled slightly, expanding a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of pink energy kept surging out from the bottom of the Tian Ku, merging into the central Mei Wu figure in the lotus.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently observed the Tian Ku, the vast Tian Ku, which seemed to be underground, was actually not an underground cave, but a gray-black cave space.</p><p></p><p>Like a hole opened in the heavens and earth, strand after strand of pink energy kept surging out from the gray-black bottom of the Tian Ku, as if they were transmitted from beyond the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Tian Ku? Could it be that it penetrates the heavens and earth, and this energy is coming from beyond the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The insights of the Pu Xu Boundary gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Pu Xu, penetrating the void, shattering the void... Divine abilities are the laws of the cultivators, the divine forms control the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Using one's own laws to penetrate the laws of heaven and earth, how to penetrate? </p><p></p><p>"This requires the power of Pu Xu, how to cultivate the power of Pu Xu? Permeate, expand, tear, penetrate..."</p><p></p><p>As the insights deepened, Xu Yan's understanding of the Pu Xu Boundary became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he had an idea of the power of Pu Xu in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Pu Xu Boundary is a huge leap, my master has transcended the heavens and earth, and is a true expert. Even a slight display of his true aura can bring turmoil to the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Because my master has already transcended the heavens and earth, and Pu Xu is obviously the foundation for transcending the heavens and earth, only by possessing the power of Pu Xu, the ability to disregard the constraints of the space of heaven and earth, can one lay the foundation for transcending the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I see, now I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly realized, so this is what the Pu Xu Boundary is all about.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many insights emerged in his mind, the martial dao of the Pu Xu Boundary was almost completely comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Spend some time refining and perfecting the cultivation method, the martial dao of the Pu Xu Boundary will be truly mastered!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>This trip was worth it! And he also developed a strong interest in the Tian Ku, standing here, he vaguely sensed that there seemed to be some extraordinary aura within the Tian Ku.</p><p></p><p>It was not the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but an indescribable aura.</p><p></p><p>Returning to his senses, he looked at the Mei Wu whose aura had already recovered to its peak, and then turned and returned to the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw that Mei Wu's aura had not further increased, it had reached its limit, and he also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that she would keep increasing her strength until she could contend with him, then his image as a powerful expert would be tarnished.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not stop Mei Wu was not just to show off, but because those strands of aura surging out from the Tian Ku also helped Xu Yan comprehend the Pu Xu Boundary.</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental reason why he did not take action.</p><p></p><p>It's the last day of 2023, wishing everyone a happy New Year!

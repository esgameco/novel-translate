        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Yao was extremely vigilant, as she was on guard against Di Ying.</p><p></p><p>Di Ying couldn't be too far from here, after all, Yu Yao had left a trace mark on Di Ying using a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Although she couldn't determine Di Ying's exact location, she knew that Di Ying was always lurking in the shadows, ready to strike and assassinate at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao didn't dare to be the least bit careless about Di Ying. Previously, she had been caught off guard and ambushed by Di Ying, nearly perishing as a result.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, beware of Di Ying!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Yao transmitted a message to Old Man Xiao while fending off Li Wu.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Lord's strength is still formidable!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong exclaimed admiringly as he rubbed his head.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, however, was somewhat anxious as he stared at the battle between Yu Yao and Li Wu. At this moment, he only regretted that his own strength was too weak to lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The auras of many Realm Lords came sweeping over from the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, these Realm Lords aren't all coming for you, are they?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"That's not possible, is it?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said uncertainly, "I only plundered the Tianshai Realm a bit and took Mei Wu's treasures, I didn't offend any other Realm Lords. Could it be that they're wary of me because of this and want to make a move?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt no guilt at all about plundering the Tianshai Realm's treasures or stealing Mei Wu's Qinglingyu Bamboo. </p><p></p><p>Tianshai and Di Ying had targeted him multiple times, so shouldn't they pay some compensation? It was perfectly reasonable for him to plunder the Tianshai Realm a bit. Besides, this could be considered Tianshai's ransom payment.</p><p></p><p>As for Mei Wu, she already viewed him as an enemy, so naturally he didn't need to be polite.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's voice rang out. At this moment, his aura was like a rainbow, as if he wanted to join the battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Tianshai, then at Di Ying hiding not far away, and raised an eyebrow, "This Tianshai does have some ability. No wonder he has such lofty ambitions, wanting to seize control of Heaven and Earth and become the Lord of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Among the group of Realm Lords, one spoke in a deep voice: "Elder Xiao Yao!"</p><p></p><p>This was one of the newly ascended Realm Lords, who clearly knew Old Man Xiao well and had even received guidance from him before.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not considered strong among the Realm Lords, they were still Realm Lords after all, and their strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these Realm Lords took a step forward, preparing to lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, several auras locked onto them, causing their expressions to change as they suddenly looked towards those few Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>"You've already sided with Tianshai?"</p><p></p><p>Those few Realm Lords did not answer, only saying indifferently: "Why meddle in affairs that don't concern you? This is a matter for the older generation. We who belong to the younger generation shouldn't interfere rashly."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's gaze was deep as he watched the battle between Old Man Xiao and Mei Wu, showing no intention of making a move. At the same time, he looked at the battle between Ao Lie and the Giant Demon, revealing a pondering expression.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie's strength was certainly no weaker than Xiao Yao's. Could the Dragon Subduing technique really be so terrifying as to subdue Ao Lie in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Tianshai always felt that Ao Lie didn't seem to be the kind of subdued being they subconsciously thought. No matter how you looked at it, Ao Lie showed no signs of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had received some kind of order before suddenly attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, today it's either you die or I perish!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu fought more and more fiercely, completely frenzied, in stark contrast to her usual seductive demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had been secretly on guard against that sword within her body causing trouble at a critical moment, but it never happened.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but suspect that Xiao Yao was unable to spare the attention to control this sword against her in the midst of the great battle.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, there was no need to be overly cautious anymore.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu unleashed her full strength, constantly launching killing attacks at Old Man Xiao. At this moment, the powerful abilities of the Seven Witches and Twelve Demons of the Witch-Demon World were fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Realm Lords from the Taicang World were extremely solemn. The strength of Mei Wu, this ancient Small World Lord, surpassed that of these Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Mei Wu's power was extremely strange. Although she was fighting frantically, at every moment there was a special seductive force.</p><p></p><p>If these spectators didn't guard their minds closely, they would develop a feeling of pity, a feeling of restlessness, wanting to lend a hand to Mei Wu, wanting to fight to the death for her! One can imagine the pressure faced by those directly confronting her.</p><p></p><p>"Even if three people joined forces, they might not be able to defeat Mei Wu!"</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Among the Seven Witches and Twelve Demons, Mei Wu was extremely special and also the most troublesome. Although her power didn't seem particularly strong, that constant temptation and seduction that affected the mind at all times was the most difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>"You think I'm afraid of you?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was also extremely annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, his aura surged, and as his majestic presence emerged, some insights about sensing the Heavenly Dao appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A vast energy surged out from within his body, and his whole being was shrouded in a faint aura of Heaven and Earth. As he raised his hand, it was with fierce and domineering fist power.</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes!"</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lords sighed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's strength was very powerful, but Old Man Xiao resisted her seductive force, and his vast fist power surged forth. Vaguely, Mei Wu seemed to be at a slight disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai actually wasn't making a move. Did he want to stand on his dignity and not join in the围攻?</p><p></p><p>"No rush, there will be a result soon."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai smiled slightly. Di Ying had already begun to slowly approach the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>If they were going to make a move, it had to be a fatal strike.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes, whose teacher was Taicang. If they couldn't deliver a fatal blow, he might escape.</p><p></p><p>Just like Yu Yao who had escaped with her life before.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, hand over your life!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a Realm Lord with murderous intent directly attacked Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord Wan Tao!</p><p></p><p>"It's Realm Lord Wan Tao!"</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lords who had received Old Man Xiao's kindness changed expression. Realm Lord Wan Tao was here to avenge his son! Although they had never seen Meng Chong before, he was too easy to recognize - bald head, muscular build, he was the only one in the small courtyard who fit the description.</p><p></p><p>"Targeting juniors, what kind of behavior is this!"</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord angrily said, about to intervene, but was locked onto by an aura. If he made a move, he would certainly be blocked!</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao broke the rules first, so Wan Tao can't be blamed!"</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord smiled sinisterly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yao was battling Mei Wu and couldn't spare any attention to save his disciple!</p><p></p><p>"You dared to kill my son, I'll tear you apart bit by bit and let you die in agony!"</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord Wan Tao's eyes were blood-red, his killing intent surging as he approached Meng Chong step by step. His powerful aura sought to oppress Meng Chong's spirit, to make him kneel and beg for mercy in fear and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>To let him feel what despair is!</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong just raised his hand to rub his head, completely unconcerned. For some reason, Realm Lord Wan Tao suspected he was seeing things.</p><p></p><p>Why did Meng Chong's eyes seem to be looking at a dead man?</p><p></p><p>That's absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>It must be that Meng Chong was too frightened, too desperate, causing this confused state!</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the courtyard was looking at Realm Lord Wan Tao, their eyes as if looking at a dead man, while also showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Finally they could see the Dao Ancestor take action again!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you killed my son,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I will not only crush your bones to dust and scatter them to the winds for destroying my son's remains, but I will also torture you bit by bit, making you experience pain and suffer in regret and despair..."</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord Wan Tao sneered viciously.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light snort rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the audacity to threaten my disciple in front of me, the Dao Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tao was stunned. Before he could react, his neck was suddenly gripped tightly by a hand that had appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Realm Lord Wan Tao turned pale with fright as he looked at the young man sitting casually in the chair, completely inconspicuous until now.</p><p></p><p>This glance would be his last.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Li Xuan reached out and grabbed, instantly crushing the previously murderous and vicious Realm Lord Wan Tao with one hand! His remains were completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord level powerhouse was annihilated in an instant, turning to dust and scattering.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have a chance to resist, crushed as easily as an ant!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The world shook for a moment. In one of the realms of the Dao Domain, the laws of heaven and earth reverted in an instant, having lost their controller!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Realm Lords looked at the young man in the chair in shock, feelings of terror surging in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming Realm Lords, they had not experienced the feeling of terror and fear. But now, those emotions flooded over them like a broken dam, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>That was a Realm Lord level expert!</p><p></p><p>Even though Wan Tao wasn't among the top Realm Lords, he was still a Realm Lord after all. </p><p></p><p>Since this person could crush Wan Tao with one hand, he could crush them too!</p><p></p><p>What an incredibly powerful being!</p><p></p><p>Was he the Lord of Heaven and Earth? But the Cang Heaven and Earth had no such lord, and this person didn't have the characteristics of the Cang Heaven and Earth Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Giant Demon frantically retreated, his expression terrified, no longer daring to continue fighting.</p><p></p><p>Even the crazed Charming Witch was frightened now, frantically backing away from the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Even Shadow, who was about to make a move, quietly distanced himself from the courtyard, not daring to make any more moves.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie and Tyrant Demon also stopped fighting.</p><p></p><p>Sky Fiend's expression was shocked as he stared intently at the relaxed young man sitting in the chair holding a jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Sky Fiend asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao looked shocked, staring at Li Xuan without blinking, not even noticing Wu Tiannan concernedly checking her for injuries beside her.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao swallowed hard. The Dao Ancestor either didn't act at all, or when he did, it was as swift as swatting a fly.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue timidly moved behind Xu Yan, her small hand gripping his clothes, secretly relieved that the Dao Ancestor hadn't crushed her grandfather in an instant! Clearly, the Dao Ancestor was not a bloodthirsty person, as long as one didn't offend him! "The Dao Ancestor was looking after me as a junior, that's why he didn't instantly crush grandfather. So I saved grandfather!" Ao Yuxue thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao, after calming his shock slightly, immediately glared angrily at Sky Fiend and said: "How dare you! Sky Fiend, hurry and thank the Dao Ancestor for sparing your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Dao Ancestor?" </p><p></p><p>Sky Fiend's eyes were sinister, with a hint of madness surfacing in their depths.</p><p></p><p>He had schemed for so many years, and was on the verge of success, only for a "Dao Ancestor" to suddenly appear and ruin all his plans.</p><p></p><p>How could Sky Fiend bear this!</p><p></p><p>Crazy thoughts kept surging, filling his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I, Sky Fiend, believe my talent and intelligence are second to none. I only lament being born in the wrong era. Otherwise, I would surely have a place among the Lords of Heaven and Earth, and would definitely be the strongest Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Since I missed the opportunity by being born in the wrong time, I'll create my own opportunity. No one can stop me!"</p><p></p><p>As Sky Fiend finished speaking, his form suddenly vanished from where he stood and shot straight up towards the sky, his palms violently striking the barrier between the Divine Realm and Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Descend!" Sky Fiend roared madly.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous boom, the world began to tremble slightly, as if something was entering it.</p><p></p><p>All the Realm Lords looked up in shock, seeming to realize something as their expressions changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Fiend, have you gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll destroy the world!"</p><p></p><p>Many Realm Lords became restless.</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch and others seemed to realize something, their expressions changing.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Fiend, are you trying to crash the entire Demon Witch World directly into this one?" Force Witch couldn't help but ask in horror.</p><p></p><p>Although their agreement with Sky Fiend was to guide the Demon Witch World to collide with Cang, it wasn't meant to be the entire Demon Witch World crashing in directly.</p><p></p><p>It was supposed to be done in stages, slowly and gradually.</p><p></p><p>If it crashed in directly, Cang would inevitably suffer great turmoil, countless would die, and it would even cause some damage to Cang itself.</p><p></p><p>"Should we stop him?" Giant Demon asked, feeling his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Sky Fiend was too crazy!</p><p></p><p>"Why should we stop him?" Charming Witch also had a crazed look. "If we don't take this gamble, how can we possibly stand a chance? How can we establish ourselves in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's join forces and help Sky Fiend, speed up the Demon Witch World's collision!" </p><p></p><p>Charming Witch rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>Force Witch and Giant Demon hesitated briefly, then gritted their teeth and rose into the air. There was no turning back now, they could only go all out.</p><p></p><p>"They've gone mad, completely mad!" Yu Yao's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The other Realm Lords also turned pale with fright. As Realm Lords, they could survive the impact as long as they avoided the center of the collision, able to withstand the aftershocks. </p><p></p><p>But if things went out of control, the Cang World would face a massive catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>The world was about to change completely. The Dao Realm and Divine Realm would cease to exist, perhaps even reverting to the world's most primordial state.</p><p></p><p>And being struck by such an impact, with constant turmoil, this would absolutely be the greatest calamity faced since the ancient heavenly wars!</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tai Miao's expression was shocked as he suddenly looked up, then turned to look at Sinking Witch and the other two. "Have you all gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>Sinking Witch and the other two also had drastic changes in expression. How could they be pulling the Demon Witch World to collide with Cang at this moment? And such a violent collision would inevitably cause turmoil in the Cang World, perhaps even triggering a great calamity! Although the Demon Witch World was broken and inferior to the Cang World, it was still a world after all, containing terrifyingly powerful world energy.</p><p></p><p>The Cang World suffering such an impact would inevitably trigger a great disaster, countless would die, and the Cang World itself would be affected, perhaps suffering even greater damage.</p><p></p><p>This was different from the original plan!</p><p></p><p>"Has Sky Fiend gone mad?" Sinking Witch turned pale with fright.</p><p></p><p>"Should we stop him?" Tyrant Demon said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Charming Witch's voice rang out, "Attack! Let's attack together, guide the worlds to collide. This is our only chance!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sinking Witch and the other two were shocked. Something must have changed in the Divine Realm, otherwise they wouldn't resort to such a risky move!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

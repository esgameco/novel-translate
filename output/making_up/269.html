        <h1>Chapter 269</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moon maiden was not the least bit afraid. She drew out a silver-white whip and cracked it, letting out a cold sneer. "You shameless old ghost of the Spiritual Sect, the moon maiden is not afraid of you!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were all stunned. Where did this young girl get the courage to challenge a Cultivated Celestial from the Spiritual Sect? Their gazes involuntarily turned to the old man leaning on a cane beside the young girl.</p><p></p><p>Two elders from the Jade Spirit Sect were about to rush towards the moon maiden, when suddenly a sword light slashed down like thunderous lightning.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The two Jade Spirit Sect elders' expressions changed, and they hastily moved to block the attack, retreating at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"She's right, the time has not come yet. Why the hurry? Hurrying to your deaths?" </p><p></p><p>A cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>In midair, a young man appeared arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were the burly Meng Chong and a slightly chubby young man.</p><p></p><p>Following closely behind the trio of Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and the other young man was a huge - was it a cat or a tiger? For a moment, the crowd couldn't quite make it out.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a magnificent tiger, yet it let out a "meow"...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the other powerful cultivators of the Jade Spirit Sect had grim expressions, glaring at Xu Yan, wishing to tear him to shreds!</p><p></p><p>Their gaze then fell on the few people sitting on the back of the giant cat behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They directly ignored Shi Er and the others, their gaze pausing briefly on Su Ling Xiu, then landing on Li Xuan - was this young man the one behind Xu Yan and Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Zhu Liang and the others had murderous intent, exchanging a look with the powerful Cultivated Celestial cultivators of the Sha family, reaching a tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>Today, Xu Yan must die, and all those related to him must die as well! The two Jade Spirit Sect elders who had originally planned to capture the moon maiden immediately retreated, and now it was a battle between geniuses.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the crowd, Xu Yan had come to his death. Xia Ming's true inheritance, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body of Lu Xin Ting - what a fearsome reputation. As a Celestial Immortal realm cultivator who could slay Cultivated Celestial realm cultivators, even if Xu Yan was extraordinary, he was still just a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>How could a wandering cultivator compare to the geniuses of the Spiritual Sect? This was an established notion.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Xu Yan?" </p><p></p><p>The moon maiden looked at Xu Yan curiously.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, glancing at the moon maiden. He was slightly surprised, as the young girl's strength was not weak, and she even gave him the feeling of being stronger than Lu Xin Ting.</p><p></p><p>His gaze paused for a moment on the old man beside the young girl. Xu Yan's heart trembled slightly - the old man was very strong, the strongest he had seen since entering the Spiritual Realm. The old man looked at Xu Yan with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Not the genius cultivated by some acquaintance as he had guessed, and his aura seemed a bit unusual, as if the martial dao he cultivated exceeded the old man's understanding.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the giant cat hovering in midair, arrogantly towering over everyone.</p><p></p><p>This giant cat was also somewhat unusual, seeming to be a spirit beast, yet lacking some of the aura of a spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>The young man sitting on the cat's back was calmly sipping tea, serene and unassuming, without any overbearing aura of a powerful cultivator, seeming quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Not an acquaintance."</p><p></p><p>The old man frowned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat on the crimson cat, looking down upon the crowd of Cultivated Celestial cultivators below, not even considering them worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>The Protector of the Way of the Crimson Abyss Sect's Second Elder, his strength was not weak, actually reaching the peak of the Cultivated Celestial realm, though he had only just recently broken through.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the old man beside the moon maiden, Li Xuan began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The old man's strength was very powerful, though both were at the peak of the Cultivated Celestial realm, the old man was significantly stronger than the Crimson Abyss Sect's Second Elder, and there seemed to be an unhealed old wound on him.</p><p></p><p>"A spirit body? It has just been shattered, and now his spirit body is in a broken state."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This girl, her talent is not bad."</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the moon maiden, realizing she was a spirit body genius.</p><p></p><p>"A bit inferior to Su Ling Xiu's spirit body, but still quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Spirit bodies were the pinnacle of talents in the Spiritual Realm, extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Even Treasure Bodies were not commonly seen, especially top-tier Treasure Bodies.</p><p></p><p>This was why Lu Xin Ting's reputation was so great - he possessed one of the Ten Great Treasure Bodies, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body, and had fully awakened its potential.</p><p></p><p>His strength far surpassed that of cultivators at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the old man, Li Xuan's gaze fell on the small palace atop a large tree, where the person inside, though only in the middle Cultivated Celestial realm, was actually stronger than the Crimson Abyss Sect's Second Elder.</p><p></p><p>"The true inheritance of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect? No wonder the Transcendent Spiritual Sect is so lofty, not even thirty years old, already in the middle Cultivated Celestial realm, and their strength nearly crushes the peak geniuses of the Spiritual Sects."</p><p></p><p>Although the young man in the palace was very strong, already in the middle Cultivated Celestial realm before the age of thirty, Xu Yan's current strength was still inferior to him.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was not yet twenty years old...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw through the cultivators around the arena - they were all just small fry, easily crushed. Even the old man beside the moon maiden was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Cui Hua Yu looked at Xu Yan, frowning and deep in thought, a rare sight as he was usually sickly. </p><p></p><p>"His aura is somewhat unusual, as if the martial dao he cultivates is quite special."</p><p></p><p>As a true inheritor of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, Cui Hua Yu's vision and understanding far exceeded that of Zhu Liang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not concealed his aura, so Cui Hua Yu was now intrigued.</p><p></p><p>Glancing up at the giant cat, he also slightly furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Not like a spirit beast, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>As a disciple of the Imperial Spiritual Sect, no one understood spirit beasts better than him.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there will be an interesting show."</p><p></p><p>Cui Hua Yu murmured lazily, then reclined back down.</p><p></p><p>In the spotlight of all eyes, Xu Yan stepped into the arena, looking indifferently at Lu Xin Ting, and suddenly let out a sigh. "So you are the Crimson Abyss inheritor, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body Lu Xin Ting? I'm a bit disappointed, your reputation is so grand, but your strength is just this?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xin Ting was taken aback, then his face flushed with anger, as golden light surged from his body.</p><p></p><p>All around, the cultivators fell silent, then quickly sucked in a breath. "Where does Xu Yan get the guts? Daring to look down on Lu Xin Ting's strength?"</p><p></p><p>"That's the Crimson Abyss inheritor, one of the Ten Great Treasure Bodies - the Divine Radiance Treasure Body. Yet in his eyes, he's not even worth mentioning?"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant, far too arrogant! A mere wandering cultivator dares to be so presumptuous?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xin Ting raised his golden halberd, pointing it at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll let this lowly wandering cultivator, all the lowly wandering cultivators in the Spiritual Realm, know what a Spiritual Sect genius is!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, golden light surged from Lu Xin Ting, the golden radiance shining in all directions, his powerful aura shocking all the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the other Cultivated Celestial cultivators all had grave expressions, inwardly marveling - truly a top-tier Spiritual Sect genius, truly one of the Ten Great Treasure Bodies.</p><p></p><p>At the Celestial Immortal realm, the aura he exuded was even more formidable than ordinary early Cultivated Celestial realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xin Ting's aura was surging, golden light flowing, his golden halberd shining with golden brilliance, the entire person like a divine god, his imposing presence...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wu Bufan.</p><p></p><p>"This Lu Xinting is quite formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was fixed intently on Xu Yan, but the young man remained calm and composed, his aura unperturbed, without any overwhelming presence.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you scared?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting sneered, holding a large spear as he approached step by step.</p><p></p><p>His aura kept growing stronger, the golden radiance on his body surging like a mighty flood, constantly pressing down on Xu Yan, as if trying to crush his will and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"A mere wandering cultivator, overestimating your abilities. The battle between geniuses is a mere facade, only I, Zong Xinting, am the true genius. What is this Xu Yan worth?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect smiled.</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Xu Yan can only show off his might in the declining Yuzhou. "</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang echoed with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>It was clear to everyone present that Xu Yan and Lu Xinting were not on the same level. One had a majestic aura, his divine radiance shining brightly, a formidable presence. </p><p></p><p>The other stood there, his aura unremarkable, as if already cowed by the divine brilliance.</p><p></p><p>This battle had no suspense.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to attack. Once Xu Yan is dead, Meng Chong and the others, including the forces behind him, will all be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang looked at Shu Zheng and the others, his killing intent palpable.</p><p></p><p>"They won't escape!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Zheng sneered.</p><p></p><p>The Elders of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Clan had already surrounded them in silence.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from other prominent sects were also secretly guarding against the powerful wandering cultivator faction.</p><p></p><p>The great battle was about to begin! Everyone was watching Xu Yan, who still stood there calmly, as Lu Xinting approached with his majestic aura and dazzling divine radiance.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel and beg for your life, and perhaps I will spare you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting's expression was cold, his tone indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"I'll return those words to you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan surveyed the many observers, including some from beyond Yuzhou. After this battle, his name as the Sword Immortal Xu Yan would likely gain some fame in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lu Xinting was renowned in Luozhou, and with his Crimson Abyss inheritance, divine body, and other accolades, the Crimson Abyss Sect had surely been extensively promoting him.</p><p></p><p>And if he were to slay Lu Xinting, his own fame would rise.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the one who kills you will be the Sword Immortal Xu Yan. Today, let the cultivators of the Spiritual Realm, let these sects, witness what a true Sword Immortal, what true sword dao, is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, his sword intent surging, "Someone offered me a spiritual sword to aid in killing you, but I refused. There is no one in this world who understands the sword dao better than my master.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will let you all witness the true sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xinting, you will die by my sword dao, becoming the first stepping stone for me to reach the peak of the Spiritual Realm. You should be proud, and die an honorable death!"</p><p></p><p>The observers were all stunned, their eyes wide at his arrogance. To call himself a Sword Immortal was one thing, but to claim that no one in this world understood the sword dao better than his master?</p><p></p><p>And for Lu Xinting to become his first stepping stone, worthy of a proud death? </p><p></p><p>This was an unparalleled arrogance!</p><p></p><p>"He's so arrogant!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er exclaimed, her beautiful eyes wide with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, is he even more arrogant than the Demon Lord of old?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er turned to her grandfather.</p><p></p><p>The elder was also somewhat dumbfounded, and replied after his granddaughter's question, "In all my life, I have never seen someone so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"This is too arrogant!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu poked her head out of the small palace, looking at the young man.</p><p></p><p>"In all my life, this is the first time I've seen someone so arrogant, it's simply boundless!"</p><p></p><p>Even the Blood Demon of old, in his heyday as a supreme genius, had never been so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient Myriad Star Geniuses, who could rival the Transcendent Spiritual Sect's patriarchs, had never had such arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was the first!  "I want to see why he is so arrogant, even more so than me, Cui Huayu. If he doesn't die, I'll have to learn from him, how to be so arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said with an admiring expression.</p><p></p><p>As for the protagonist, Lu Xinting, he was almost enraged.</p><p></p><p>To become a stepping stone, and worthy of a proud death? "Good! Good! Good! I want to see how you make me a stepping stone. I want to see where you get the gall to be so arrogant, so disdainful!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting sneered.</p><p></p><p>"You're mistaken, I, Xu Yan, am not arrogant, nor disdainful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward, proudly surveying the surroundings, "I only wish to let the cultivators of the Spiritual Realm witness what true sword dao is!"</p><p></p><p>The observers were all dumbfounded. This is not considered arrogant? You claim your sword dao is the true one?</p><p></p><p>You might as well just say: All of you here are frog-in-the-well!</p><p></p><p>"In all my life, I've never seen someone so arrogant. This trip was worth it!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it was worth it!"</p><p></p><p>The observing cultivators murmured in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xu Yan was to be defeated, they felt this trip was not in vain, for they had witnessed true arrogance.</p><p></p><p>This was true arrogance! Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly, watching his disciple show off. He was having trouble even drinking his tea.</p><p></p><p>However, after glancing at the Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect and the others, "Once my disciple is done with his show, it will be time for this master to put on a performance!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, alright. Let me, Lu Xinting, witness this sword dao of yours that makes you so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting was furious, his aura unmatched when he first appeared, earning praises without end. </p><p></p><p>But now, all the attention had been stolen by Xu Yan, leaving him with the feeling that he was the fool.</p><p></p><p>How could he swallow this humiliation?</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, he unleashed his full power, the golden radiance surging towards the heavens, his spear emanating waves of golden brilliance like crashing tides.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paused his steps, his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze calm and slightly disdainful, silently watching as Lu Xinting activated his techniques, revealing the might of his divine body.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like Lu Xinting is acting like a clown, as if he's impotently raging?"</p><p></p><p>One cultivator said in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood with his hands behind his back, his aura unperturbed, as if he didn't even consider Lu Xinting worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Lu Xinting was frantically unleashing his full power, his techniques and divine body pushed to the limit, appearing to be impotently raging.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The cultivator who had just spoken was instantly killed by a punch.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect's gaze was icy as he looked at the gathered observers, his killing intent palpable.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators immediately fell silent, daring not to say a word, for they knew their lives were at risk. </p><p></p><p>The one who had spoken his mind earlier had paid for it with his life.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

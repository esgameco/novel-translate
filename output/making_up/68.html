            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 68 Breakthrough to the Innate Realm (Seeking First Order)</p><p></p><p>Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the diligent cultivator Meng Chong, and could feel Meng Chong's physical body growing stronger every day. He was extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's physique is getting stronger and stronger, and it won't be long before he refines his Bronze Bone. Refining the Golden Bone should not be a problem for him.</p><p></p><p>"The Diamond Adamantine Bone, on the other hand, is a bit difficult."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique Xu Yan practiced was fabricated by Li Xuan, without any real reference. Xu Yan had to perfect it himself, so the difficulty was naturally higher than Meng Chong's.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was able to refine the Jade Bone by defeating the Fire-Maned Wolf, breaking through the shackles to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>For Meng Chong to refine the Diamond Adamantine Bone, he may also need to break through his own shackles.</p><p></p><p>"Where can I find the Fire-Maned Wolf? In the boundless mountains?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought: "It may not necessarily require the Fire-Maned Wolf. The key to the breakthrough is to break through the shackles, so..."</p><p></p><p>He came up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could help Meng Chong break through the shackles and refine the Diamond Adamantine Bone.</p><p></p><p>"Can Meng Chong refine the Golden Bone within a month? I don't think it's too far away."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated Meng Chong's cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>"Once Meng Chong enters the martial dao, I can obtain the Diamond Adamantine Bone. Jade Bone plus Diamond Adamantine Bone, how powerful would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the rewards he would reap after Meng Chong's breakthrough, Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>In his spare time, Shi Er was also diligently cultivating. He had already sensed his qi and blood and was preparing to refine his skin.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the martial dao requires talent. Shi Er's talent is far inferior to Meng Chong and Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed as he observed Shi Er's cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Even if the martial dao was widely disseminated, not many would be able to successfully cultivate to the entry level. However, with a large number of cultivators, the total number of successful entrants would not be too small.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has reached the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, and your qi and blood have doubled!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's qi and blood surged, instantly doubling.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. Xu Yan had already reached the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, and was not far from reaching the Qi and Blood Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>The second realm he had created in the martial dao was the Innate Realm, a true realm that transcended the mundane, where one could soar through the air and travel hundreds of miles in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This was the true bearing of a martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qi and Blood Realm could also allow for swift movement, it was not the same as true levitation. The two were completely different.</p><p></p><p>"After accepting the new disciple, the feedback from the Golden Finger has changed, and it has even mentioned the disciple's name."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan noticed the change in the feedback from the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>"Within a month, Xu Yan should be able to reach the Qi and Blood Perfection, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's cultivation speed, he should be able to reach the Qi and Blood Perfection within a month.</p><p></p><p>The question is whether he can comprehend the cultivation technique for the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he can succeed. My disciple must not disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had high hopes for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has successfully comprehended the Innate Realm cultivation technique you created, and you have broken through to the Innate Realm."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Li Xuan felt his qi and blood refining into the primordial true qi.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>It was as if thunder was rumbling within his body. A profound sensation arose in his heart, as if he could connect with heaven and earth, sensing the existence of the spiritual energy of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The bridge between heaven and earth was connected!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Guiding the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into his body, it was as if a storm had erupted within him. His dantian and qi sea had been opened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was completely immersed in the wondrous experience of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods of the Innate Realm suddenly appeared in his mind, how profound and mysterious they were!</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual energy of heaven and earth entered his body, his vast blood and qi were refined into the true Innate Qi. His physical body was undergoing a transformation, as if shedding the mundane world, and all the impurities were cleansed from his body.</p><p></p><p>His jade-like bones radiated a brilliant glow, his entire being was pure and flawless, without a trace of worldly impurities.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan broke through to the Innate Realm, his body underwent a wondrous transformation. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged into his body, and the true Innate Qi kept gushing forth.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the Bridge of Heaven and Earth was opened, it seemed to have connected the heavens and the earth, sensing the existence of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and guiding it into his body.</p><p></p><p>He opened up his Dantian sea of qi and refined the true Innate Qi.</p><p></p><p>His physical body underwent a transformation, his jade-like bones blossomed with radiance, achieving the Innate and flawless state!</p><p></p><p>The worldly impurities, at this moment, seemed to have been washed away, returning to the primordial state.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still sitting on the chair, as if nothing had changed, without any signs of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Xuan himself knew that at this moment, he had crossed a great divide and entered the Innate Realm!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Innate Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sensed his own state, his heart filled with excitement!</p><p></p><p>Good disciple!</p><p></p><p>He had actually comprehended the cultivation method of the Innate Realm in advance, and the golden finger had directly fed back his Innate Realm strength!</p><p></p><p>So even if Xu Yan had not broken through to the Innate Realm, as long as he comprehended it in advance, the golden finger would still provide the feedback.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's comprehension of the cultivation method meant that his breakthrough to the Innate Realm was a done deal.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan guided the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into his body, feeling the powerful force like a storm coming through the Bridge of Heaven and Earth. While he was excited, he also had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>Why did the spiritual energy of heaven and earth feel a bit too intense?</p><p></p><p>If not for the Bridge of Heaven and Earth connecting the heavens and the earth, he might not have been able to accommodate the spiritual energy entering his body.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy of heaven and earth can greatly increase one's strength, it is a powerful energy, so it being a bit intense is normal."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth being a bit too intense was not an unusual thing.</p><p></p><p>He did not delve deeper into this issue.</p><p></p><p>As long as the spiritual energy existed, as long as he could continue cultivating and grow stronger, the degree of intensity did not matter. </p><p></p><p>It would not cause any harm, whether it was gentle or intense.</p><p></p><p>"The Innate Realm has transcended the mundane, I can now say that I am no longer an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>"Pure and flawless, without a trace of worldly impurities, as long as there is the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, I can even live without eating or drinking."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly exhilarated, this was only the second realm in his martial dao, yet it was already so powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Innate cultivator, able to absorb and emit the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, could even live without food or drink.</p><p></p><p>"How long can one live in the Innate Realm? How long is the lifespan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly fell into deep contemplation. Cultivating the martial dao, the lifespan would naturally far exceed that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Even just at the Blood and Qi Realm, the lifespan was already extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, the exact limit was unknown.</p><p></p><p>"The lifespan of the Blood and Qi Realm will not be short, especially after refining the jade-like bones... let me ponder on this a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan closed his eyes, his mind clear, silently calculating the changes in the Blood and Qi Realm, as well as the changes after breaking through to the Innate Realm, in order to estimate the ultimate lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"After completing the refinement of the viscera, the viscera and organs will be strengthened, the vitality will increase, so the lifespan will be much longer than ordinary people... so, generally the Blood and Qi Realm can live for two to three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"After refining the golden bones, the lifespan will be even longer, at least over three hundred years, and the jade-like bones, five hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was suddenly shocked, had he miscalculated? If that was the case, just at the entry level of the martial dao, the lifespan could be so incredibly long?</p><p></p><p>"I calculated based on the changes in the body and the depletion of blood and qi after entering the martial dao, so the estimate should not be too far off, so the lifespan of the Innate Realm, over a thousand years?</p><p></p><p>"I've created this martial dao a bit too overpowered, the second realm already allows one to live over a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly exhilarated, at this moment he had a sense of intuition that the lifespan divisions of the martial dao had already been determined!</p><p></p><p>His calculations were accurate!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this intuition came from the feedback of the golden finger?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

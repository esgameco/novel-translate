        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng asked with puzzlement, "Young Master, it's not good, all the top masters under Heaven are going to attack Canglang Island!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan hurriedly said, "The Gate of the Spirit Realm, the legend of the Celestial Beings..."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan told Xie Lingfeng all the details about the Gate of the Spirit Realm and the legend of the Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Our Sword Sovereign Peak's top masters have all gone to find the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find my father!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng couldn't sit still and hurried towards the peak of Sword Sovereign Peak.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Sword Sovereign Peak, the gathered top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak included several white-haired elders whose sword auras were fierce, stirring the spiritual energy around them. Their eyes were imposing, and even peak master-level experts would feel a chill when facing them.</p><p></p><p>The door of the stone house on the peak opened. A tall figure walked out, his face resolute, carrying a precious sword on his back. His eyes were as sharp as sword light, and as he walked out, it was as if a sharp sword was being unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>This was Xie Tianheng, the current Sword Sovereign of Sword Sovereign Peak, the number one in the inner domain of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Has Sword Sovereign Peak encountered a powerful enemy?" Xie Tianheng frowned as he looked at the gathered top masters, including the elders of Sword Sovereign Peak.</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak were all filled with awe, realizing how powerful the Sword Sovereign was.</p><p></p><p>Even the elders felt a sense of reverence, as if the Sword Sovereign's sword intent was suppressing them.</p><p></p><p>One of the top masters hurriedly said, "Sword Sovereign, it's like this, the Gate of the Spirit Realm, the legend of the Celestial Beings... There might be a true Martial Dao Celestial Being on Canglang Island, and now all the top masters under Heaven have gathered, gathering their forces to force the Celestial Being to hand over that little Miss Su Lingxiu. I'm afraid they even have the intention to attack the Celestial Being."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, do you think we should also lend a hand? This is such a grand event, an opportunity to make our name in the history of the Martial Dao, Sword Sovereign Peak cannot miss it!"</p><p></p><p>Several top masters, including some elders, excitedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Xie Tianheng coldly snorted, silencing the noisy voices.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you all ashamed?" Xie Tianheng said with disdain, "We sword cultivators should dare to draw our swords against the strong, not rely on numbers and might to bolster our courage."</p><p></p><p>Pointing outside, Xie Tianheng said with contempt, "Those outside are all trash, seeing a Martial Dao Celestial Being, they are so scared that they band together to attack, not a single one dares to draw their sword alone against the Celestial Being. I, Xie Tianheng, am ashamed to be associated with them!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Sword Sovereign Peak upholds righteousness, with an unyielding sword spirit. To ally with those outside trash would be a disgrace. </p><p></p><p>"A Martial Dao Celestial Being? I, Xie Tianheng, will go and exchange pointers with him myself, I will not join forces with that trash!"</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak were all dumbfounded, looking at their Sword Sovereign in a daze. They had never seen him so arrogant, not even considering the other top masters under Heaven as worthy opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, that is a Martial Dao Celestial Being, an existence above the peak masters." An elder carefully reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Precisely because he is a Martial Dao Celestial Being, I am even more unwilling to join forces with the trash. I will personally go and exchange pointers with him. As sword cultivators, we should have the courage to draw our swords against the strong, only then can we cultivate our sword intent!" Xie Tianheng said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze across the gathered top masters, he coldly said, "Whoever dares to join forces with the trash, don't even call yourself a Sword Sovereign Peak cultivator, I won't accept that disgrace!"</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Father, don't be rash!" Xie Lingfeng's anxious voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master has arrived, the Young Master quickly persuade your father!" </p><p></p><p>"Quick, the Sword Sovereign wants to challenge the Martial Dao Celestial Being alone!"</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak hurriedly called out.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was a bit confused, what's going on, his father wants to challenge the Martial Dao Celestial Being alone?</p><p></p><p>"Lingfeng, don't you go down the wrong path, learning from the trash outside, relying on numbers and might to bolster your courage. We Sword Sovereign Peak cultivators are above that!" Xie Tianheng said with a benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his father say that Sword Sovereign Peak cultivators are above joining forces with the trash, Xie Lingfeng was overjoyed, as he knew his father would not participate in the attack on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>"Father is right!" Xie Lingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak: ...</p><p></p><p>After some further exchange, Xie Lingfeng finally understood the situation. He couldn't help but click his tongue, when did his father become so arrogant? Calling everyone outside trash, even the other masters were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Although Permit Yan seemed arrogant, it was based on his own strength! How could his father have such great strength to look down on the other martial artists as trash?</p><p></p><p>"Father, the one on Canglang Island is an acquaintance of mine, that senior..." Xie Lingfeng hurriedly explained his close relationship with Permit Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Cultivating the Martial Dao?" Xie Tianheng frowned as he looked at his son, but didn't say anything further, sensing that his son's strength was already not inferior to an entry-level peak master.</p><p></p><p>"Father, we should lend a hand to Canglang Island." Xie Lingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Since that senior you mentioned is invincibly strong, naturally there is no need for Sword Sovereign Peak to intervene. However, as your father, I will certainly go and exchange pointers with him!" Xie Tianheng said.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng hurriedly said, "Father, you are not that senior's match, you can't even defeat Permit Ge!"</p><p></p><p>"Lingfeng, what do you know?" Xie Tianheng said arrogantly, "It is precisely because he is strong that I must draw my sword against him. I, Xie Tianheng, have attained a profound realization of the Sword Dao during my recent seclusion, and I am the number one in the history of the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>"I must temper my Sword Dao, I must let this world know the might of my title as the number one in the Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng: ...</p><p></p><p>The top masters of Sword Sovereign Peak: ...</p><p></p><p>The inner domain was in turmoil, with one peak master-level expert after another appearing. All the peak masters were burning with passion, wanting to conquer Canglang Island, to defy the Celestial Being, and to share the opportunity of the Gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint efforts of the Half-Step Celestial Beings like the Demon Child and the Blue-Faced Man, as well as the former Vice Palace Master of the Seven Star Academy, the top masters under Heaven formed an alliance - the Subjugation Alliance! With a grand momentum, they threatened Canglang Island, directly demanding that the Celestial Being on Canglang Island hand over Su Lingxiu and reveal the secrets of the Gate of the Spirit Realm, or else they would annihilate them!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seven days after the Fa Tian Alliance was formed, they will invade and destroy Canglan Island! The once peaceful Canglan Island has once again been caught in the midst of a storm, this time far more severe than the last! The major powers of the Inner Realm and the greatest masters under Heaven have all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island is now facing the entire Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>The news has reached that Fei Xuan has landed on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Are those people crazy?" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er swallowed hard, his hand gripping the knife trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling's fair complexion turned pale. She never imagined that all of this was because of her?</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spirit Realm, the legend of the Celestials? What connection does she have with the Gate of the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Master, I... I'll go see them directly, so as not to implicate you."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling's eyes were red, her expression confused.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying looked at her with deep sympathy, his own eyes reddened, his heart restless as he kept glancing at the seated Li Xuan, afraid he would give up on the young lady.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He had originally taken Su Ling as his disciple because of her monstrous talent, as she was the most suitable person to cultivate the Pill Dao and Martial Dao. This was indeed the case - across the entire Inner Realm, there was no one more suited to cultivating the Pill Dao and Martial Dao than Su Ling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she now possessed the Spiritual Wood Body, her natural talent and aptitude being truly extraordinary. As long as she continued to cultivate the Pill Dao and Martial Dao, and reached the pinnacle of the Pill Dao Martial Canon, it would soon be time for her to break through to the next level.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew Su Ling was facing trouble, he had only thought it was because she had offended a major power, having an enemy in a powerful faction, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>This was nothing to Li Xuan - he would simply eliminate whoever dared to cause trouble. That's why he had eliminated the Yin Lou Sect Master and the Azure-Faced Man.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that was the end of it, but now Su Ling was involved with the Gate of the Spirit Realm, and the greatest masters under Heaven had gathered, forming this Fa Tian Alliance to attack.</p><p></p><p>This was practically making enemies of the entire Inner Realm's great masters!</p><p></p><p>This was no ordinary trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ling was his disciple, and he still needed her to continue advancing the Pill Dao and Martial Dao. No matter how big the trouble, he had to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was not only aimed at Su Ling, but also at him, the "Martial Dao Celestial". If he were to back down, how could he maintain his identity as a peerless expert?</p><p></p><p>"I have reached the Profound Enlightenment realm, and can single-handedly dominate the world - this is nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled lightly, his expression calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, what are you saying? These people are nothing to worry about."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling stared at him with wide eyes, asking, "Master, are you truly a Martial Dao Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>The others were also curious, looking at him intently.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glared, feigning anger, "Disciple, how dare you insult your master! Mere ants, the existence of a Martial Dao Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling and the others were shocked, a Martial Dao Celestial considered them mere ants? "Forgive me, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling apologized, massaging his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is this Gate of the Spirit Realm?" She asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"When your strength is sufficient, you will naturally know. This world is not really that complex, the feeling of complexity is simply due to a lack of power."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said without blinking.</p><p></p><p>Boasting! He was already accustomed to it. As the peerless expert, the secrets of this world were already thoroughly understood by him.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling and the others were shocked, but also felt he had a point - the so-called complexity and mysteries were indeed due to a lack of power.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Fa Tian Alliance will attack Canglan Island in seven days. Big Brother and Second Brother are not here, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>With her own strength, she could naturally handle a peak great master or two. However, the Fa Tian Alliance was said to have gathered the greatest masters under Heaven! This was an incredibly powerful lineup, not even her Big Brother and Second Brother combined could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh! As your master is incapable, I can only trouble myself."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling immediately felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and the others also felt embarrassed, feeling they couldn't even handle such a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"As I've said before, one person can dominate a thousand of the same realm, be invincible against ten thousand - you must not have believed it. Now is the perfect opportunity for you to witness how your master is unrivaled within the same realm, and how I will dominate the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, one hand clasped behind his back, looking up at the sky with a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling was inwardly shaken. In the past, at Iron Mountain County, she had indeed felt her master was boasting a bit.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful, how could one person defeat a thousand or ten thousand of the same realm? But now, she felt ashamed, and said, "Master, I believe you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled lightly, "Gathering the major powers of the world, the greatest masters under Heaven, threatening Canglan Island - these ants do not know their place. Then your master shall dominate this world, and see how these ants try to defy the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>He had realized that the trouble was now unavoidable, so he would act - dominate the invincible, let the martial artists of the Inner Realm know the true power of the Great Desolate Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Unrivaled within the same realm, dominating the world.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the faith of the entire Inner Realm's martial artists would change, wouldn't they? They would all ardently pursue and cultivate the Great Desolate Martial Dao, for there would be no better way to promote the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the years to come, the Inner Realm would no longer be the Inner Realm, but the Great Desolate!</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Spirit Realm, the abode of the Celestials? No matter how the Gate of the Spirit Realm can be opened, with Su Ling here, one day she will be able to enter the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Celestial is within the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>Since that is the case, he has nothing to fear. He will dominate the Inner Realm, using absolute strength to tell the martial artists of the Inner Realm what true invincibility is.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the martial arts of the Inner Realm, wanting to break through the Martial Dao Celestial realm, will be restricted. Only by entering the Gate of the Spirit Realm can one do so. But my Great Desolate Martial Dao has no such limitation.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Desolate Border can cultivate the martial arts, let alone the Inner Realm. Breaking through the Divine Meaning Realm is only a matter of time. Since there are no restrictions, one day in the future, the martial arts strength of the Inner Realm may even surpass that of the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's lips curled into a smile.</p><p></p><p>This is not trouble, nor a crisis, but an opportunity to truly shake the Inner Realm, to make the martial artists of the Inner Realm revere the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the Hundred Martial Shadows, their number already exceeding two hundred. If the entire Inner Realm's martial artists cultivated the Great Desolate Martial Dao, how powerful would the Hundred Martial Shadows become? If one day the enemy thought they had the numbers and strength to attack him, they would not know that the true numerical advantage was on his side.</p><p></p><p>Thousands, tens of thousands of Martial Shadows emerging together, what a magnificent sight, directly crushing the enemy!</p><p></p><p>The more Martial Shadows there are, the stronger they will become when fused together. The more Shadows, the more powerful fused Shadows there will be.</p><p></p><p>One person is an army of thousands and tens of thousands! The more Li Xuan thought about it, the more excited he became. This is the benefit of spreading the Dao to the world!</p>

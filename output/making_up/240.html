        <h1>Chapter 240</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The guard asked indifferently, "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Du Yuying opened her palm, revealing a jade token.</p><p></p><p>The guard initially paid it no mind, just glancing at it casually, about to turn his gaze away, when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is...the Taimai Jade Token? The Azure King's Jade Token from the Great Zhou?" He was greatly shocked. The one who had come to deliver the order this time was an elder from the Taimai Sect, and the current Azure King of the Great Zhou! The other guard quickly rushed towards the gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Please, young ladies, come in!" The remaining guard said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, leading Cui'er, and Yunmiao, leading her master and Ziyun, stepped into the Spiritual Realm, all somewhat guessing at the reason for the guard's change in attitude.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had once said that the Taimai Sect and the Great Zhou held an exalted status in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, wonderful news!" The guard hurried in, his face filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"What good news?" The King of Zheng furrowed his brow, the guard seemed a bit too unrestrained, he should be reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, prodigies have arrived in the inner realm holding the Taimai Jade Token and the Azure King's Jade Token!" The guard said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"What, truly?" The King of Zheng abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely true!" The guard said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, you two guards have done well, be promoted!" The King of Zheng said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>This time, the arrival of the elders from the Taimai Sect and the Azure King of the Great Zhou, and the prodigies holding these jade tokens, would surely bring him the Sect's commendation again!</p><p></p><p>The King of Zheng, smiling widely, led several of his ministers to personally welcome Du Yuying and the others. As for the maidservants entering the Spiritual Realm, that was not an issue, as long as the level of the jade tokens was sufficiently noble.</p><p></p><p>He was even more excited after taking a look.</p><p></p><p>They were truly prodigies!</p><p></p><p>As for Xie Tianheng and his son, he just glanced at them briefly, not bothering to pay them any attention.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's face darkened a bit, but since the other party was so powerful, he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Having just arrived in the Spiritual Realm, unfamiliar with the land, they would have to rely on the escort of the Zheng Kingdom to reach their destination.</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Zheng Kingdom, Xiang Qing and Ya Rong still sat in silence.</p><p></p><p>After the gate of the Spiritual Realm opened and the holders of the jade tokens entered, the gate would close, and for a long time, there would likely be no contact with the inner realm. It could be said that the martial path of the inner realm cultivators would be completely severed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a senior official of the Zheng Kingdom hurriedly rushed in, kneeling down and saying, "Venerable Elder, three prodigies have arrived from the inner realm, one holding the Great Zhou Jade Token, and two holding the Taimai Jade Token!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing furrowed his brow and asked, "Are you sure it's the Great Zhou Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou was the only dynasty in the Spiritual Realm not under the control of the Spiritual Sects and great families, its strength rivaling the powerful Spiritual Sects. Since it was a dynastic state, the cultivators at the lower levels of the Great Zhou fared better than others. Moreover, the lower-level prodigies also had opportunities for advancement, able to be cultivated and become important officials of the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Great Zhou had rarely issued jade tokens to the inner realm. Even if there had been some in the past, after the Blood Demon Incident, it was impossible for the inner realm to have the Great Zhou Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>"I have not made a mistake, Venerable Elder, they are indeed the Great Zhou Jade Token and the Taimai Jade Token!" The Zheng Kingdom official said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Bring them here," Xiang Qing said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong's brow furrowed slightly, but she did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Venerable Elder!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the escort of several of the King of Zheng's ministers, Du Yuying and the others arrived at the main hall, with Xie Tianheng and his son following.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ya Rong's expression changed, and she instantly appeared in front of Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing was also startled, looking at Du Yuying with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's expression changed, the sudden appearance of Ya Rong giving her a great sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your jade token?" Ya Rong's voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying opened her palm.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong took the jade token in her hand, examining it for a long time before returning it to Du Yuying, saying, "What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elder, my name is Du Yuying," Du Yuying said nervously.</p><p></p><p>"Du Yuying?" Ya Rong murmured, then said, "Come with me to the Taimai Sect."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Yunmiao and Ziyun, she asked, "Who else holds a Taimai Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elder, it is me," Yunmiao spoke up, handing over the jade token.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong looked at the jade token, her expression changing repeatedly. This token was exactly the same as Du Yuying's.</p><p></p><p>"How did you get this jade token?" Ya Rong took a deep breath and asked.</p><p></p><p>"My Ancestral Grandmother passed it down to me," Yunmiao replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Grandmother..." Ya Rong sighed, then said, "Then all of you come back to the Taimai Sect with me."</p><p></p><p>She returned to her seat, silently contemplating.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing transmitted a voice message, "That girl bears a strong resemblance to your esteemed teacher, could it be that she is..."</p><p></p><p>"Do not ask about things you should not!" Ya Rong coldly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing looked at Xie Tianheng and his son, as well as Ziyun, and asked, "Who holds the Great Zhou Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun raised her hand and said, "Venerable Elder, it is me!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see the jade token."</p><p></p><p>"Here, Venerable Elder!" Ziyun nervously handed over the jade token.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing waved his hand, and the jade token flew into his grasp. Upon seeing it, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>The Azure King's Jade Token!</p><p></p><p>"Where is the owner of this jade token?" Xiang Qing asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"He has already passed away. I buried him in the Hunting Demon Valley," Ziyun said softly.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing was silent for a moment, then said, "You will come with me to the Azure King's Manor, and I will take you as my adopted daughter."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun was stunned, quickly kneeling down and reverently kowtowing, "Ziyun pays respects to Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may rise," Xiang Qing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xie Tianheng and his son, Xie Tianheng felt a bit awkward. How was it that everyone holding a jade token seemed to be extraordinary, while his own jade token appeared rather ordinary?</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elder, this is my jade token!" Xie Tianheng took out the jade token.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing glanced at it, slightly surprised. After carefully examining Xie Tianheng and his son for a while, he pondered for a moment and said, "Come with me to the Great Zhou, I'll have someone escort you there."</p><p></p><p>The contemplative Ya Rong suddenly looked up, somewhat surprised. Xiang Qing was being so kind? She glanced at the jade token in Xie Tianheng's hand, and it dawned on her. No wonder Xiang Qing was being so generous, he must be wanting to establish connections there.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable Elder," Xie Tianheng said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The King of Zheng and the others were overjoyed, the jade tokens held by these people were all so extraordinary? Xiang Qing stood up and looked at the King of Zheng, saying, "You have handled this matter well. After the gate of the Spiritual Realm closes, go and claim your reward. The tasks of the Zheng Kingdom remain unchanged and will not be interfered with, but do not rashly get involved in any disputes."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable Elder. I will remember this and diligently carry out the tasks, without participating in any disputes!" The King of Zheng knelt down and expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>With these words, the Zheng Kingdom could continue to prosper.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing nodded, stepping towards the exit and saying, "As for the rest of you holding jade tokens, you can handle it yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong also immediately...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He got up and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianhe, Du Yuying, and a few others hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main hall, Xing Qing looked at Ziyun and the father-son duo of Xie Tianhe, and said, "If you have any parting words, say them here. When we'll see each other again is unknown."</p><p></p><p>After their farewells, the father-son duo of Xie Tianhe and Ziyun left with Xing Qing.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Cuier, Yunmiaomiao, and their master Wushuang followed Yarong to Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>And under Yarong's instructions, Du Yuying wore a veil.</p><p></p><p>After seeing them off, Zheng Huang and the others heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules, this matter must not be discussed or revealed in the slightest, or it will be punishable by death!" Zheng Huang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, don't worry, we all understand the rules!" the group of ministers said, bowing.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any important Jade Token holders left in the Inner Domain. Just complete the task according to the rules. When the time comes, close the gate to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As for the people of the Water Star Palace, don't bother with them. They are ignorant and don't know to come back, so let them not come back.</p><p></p><p>"This is the order of the Supreme Sect. No one is to disobey it!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>A month's time was the deadline to close the gate to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang and the others did not go to the main hall to stand guard, as the Supreme Sect Lord had left, so there was no need for them to personally stand guard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, they were all preparing to enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had passed on the cultivation methods of the Spirit Sense Realm and the Spirit Element Realm to his father Xu Junhe, ensuring that his father could continue cultivating smoothly after reaching the Profound Perfection stage.</p><p></p><p>He had also carefully imparted the key points of cultivating in the Spirit Sense Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu, she was busy refining pills, from Profound Realm pills to pills that could break through the Spirit Sense Realm.</p><p></p><p>This trip, they did not know when they would return.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and the others would remain in the Great Wilderness, developing it, and would not go to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe also knew that his strength was weak, and going to the Spirit Realm would only burden his son.</p><p></p><p>After passing on the cultivation methods to his father, Xu Yan also went to the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Everything was arranged, and there were only a few days left before the one-month deadline to the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was time to set out and enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Redcat, you have to eat well, I don't know when I'll be able to teach you to read again," Xu's mother said, rubbing Redcat's head.</p><p></p><p>Redcat was reluctant to part with Xu's mother. Without her pampering, it would have fewer pills to eat and a harder life ahead!</p><p></p><p>But it had to go to the Spirit Realm, where there were spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was a cultural tiger, a tiger with dreams. It wanted to become the King of Great Demons!</p><p></p><p>Only by going to the Spirit Realm could it have this opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanxi sighed, he had ultimately failed to find the fourth disciple in the Inner Domain. Hopefully the Spirit Realm would not disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>At the gate to the Spirit Realm, the strong experts of the Tianbaoge, the purple-crowned young man, cupped their hands and said, "Young Master Xu, don't worry, the Great Wilderness won't be in chaos, and it will surely have a day that can rival the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go in first!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan resumed the appearance he had when he returned to the Inner Domain, not entering the gate to the Spirit Realm in his true form, as he was being pursued by the Yushen Sect and the Shu Clan.</p><p></p><p>If the news of his return to the Inner Domain spread, it was hard to say that the people of the Yushen Sect wouldn't come to the Inner Domain to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan entered the gate to the Spirit Realm, Li Xuan calmly said, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, with Meng Chong following behind him, then Su Lingxiu, Zhou Ying, Meng Shushu, and Redcat.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a Jade Token?" the guard asked.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Meng Chong looked at the guard.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>The guard was about to drive them away in anger, but suddenly shrank his neck and said, "Go in."</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan's group entered, another guard spoke, "You're an idiot, these people look like they shouldn't be provoked, and they seem to have a connection with that previous one."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the reminder!" the guard cupped his hands, just now he had felt a sense of impending doom.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the gate to the Spirit Realm, Li Xuan felt his spirit soar, the spiritual energy in the Spirit Realm was truly abundant.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is so abundant!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked around with a complex expression, but also with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the main hall, Xu Yan was already waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said freely, "Anywhere is fine, just go wherever your heart desires."</p><p></p><p>The first thing he wanted to do after arriving in the Spirit Realm was to find a suitable practitioner of the Esoteric Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Yuxiaolong poked his head out of Xu Yan's sleeve and said, "I know a place, it's scenic and not too far from the capital of Zheng Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, "Then let's go there."</p><p></p><p>He then looked back at Redcat.</p><p></p><p>Redcat scampered over, its body shuddering as it transformed into a size as large as a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction, this Redcat mount would finally be useful.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on Redcat's back, with a tea table and chairs prepared, Su Lingxiu brewed tea for her master, Xu Yan and Yuxiaolong led the way, and Meng Chong looked around, not sitting on Redcat's back.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Meng Shushu had also wanted to go up on Redcat's back, but Redcat glared at the two of them, making them shrink back in dejection, only able to follow alongside Redcat.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the area around the gate to the Spirit Realm, Xu Yan resumed his true appearance, and the group headed towards the place Yuxiaolong had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, they encountered cultivators in the Spirit Realm along the way.</p><p></p><p>Thus, before they reached their destination, two figures descended, their Refining Spirit Celestial aura unrestrained, their piercing gaze fixed on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Yushen Sect and the Shu Clan, at the Refining Spirit Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know your crime?" the Yushen Sect elder said coldly, looking down on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for Redcat, the two Refining Spirit Celestials paid it no mind, as its strength was not strong, and they could easily crush it.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on Redcat's back, Li Xuan put down his teacup and looked up at the two Refining Spirit Celestials indifferently. "Insignificant creatures daring to be so presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>He was suddenly excited in his heart, finally, it was time for him as the teacher to display his strength.</p><p></p><p>Since he had obtained the Shenmi Technique, he could finally put it to use.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan killed a Small Celestial upon entering the Spirit Realm, and as his teacher, I will kill two Refining Spirit Celestials upon entering the Spirit Realm. Isn't that reasonable?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he raised his hand and slapped towards the two Refining Spirit Celestials! The combined force of the Banian Sword Intent, the Silence Sword Intent, and the Shenmi Technique was unleashed in a lethal strike!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were all greatly excited, their master had acted again! Every time their master acted, it gave them a tremendous shock.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Celestials of the Yushen Sect and the Shu Clan had their expressions change drastically, and they roared, unleashing their terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Above them, faint shadows appeared, too vague to make out any human form, they were directly using their most powerful secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Shadows emerged, this was the state of the Refining Spirit Celestials, using their utmost power.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan's strike was not something that a mere two Refining Spirit Celestial initial realm cultivators could withstand.</p><p></p><p>In the air, it was as if a black vortex appeared, devouring and annihilating everything! Boom! A palm strike descended, and the two Refining Spirit Celestials were reduced to ash and vanished without even a scream.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put down his hand, as if he had just swatted two insignificant ants, and picked up the spiritual tea that Su Lingxiu had just brewed and started drinking.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 489</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Taicang ultimately became history. The future world is the Dahuang world.</p><p></p><p>As Tianzi said, Taicang has died and Dahuang should be established. Since the Way of Heaven has already been established, it naturally needs to be continuously strengthened, and the Dahuang world needs to be constantly strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and others who followed Taicang have deep feelings for Taicang, and for the time being, they cannot accept Taicang becoming Dahuang.</p><p></p><p>However, Tianzi's identity is extraordinary after all, and closer to Taicang. Moreover, cultivating the Way of Heaven can open up the path forward, can continuously become stronger, and has the opportunity to avenge Taicang.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Old Man Xiao and others will not have any resistance.</p><p></p><p>After all, Taicang has ultimately fallen. If they can avenge Taicang, what does it matter if the world changes its name?</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether Old Man Xiao and others accept Taicang becoming Dahuang or not doesn't really affect anything. It's just that their strength is the strongest in this world, and they are also the easiest to break through.</p><p></p><p>Once they comprehend and cultivate the Way of Heaven, their enhancement of the Way of Heaven will be rapid, and they can also greatly improve the Way of Heaven in the shortest time.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Way of Heaven, the stronger the Heavenly Seal naturally becomes, and Li Xuan's strength will also become stronger.</p><p></p><p>These are all related to strength enhancement, so Li Xuan took the opportunity to give Old Man Xiao a concept of the Way of Heaven, laying the foundation for cultivating and comprehending the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was guidance from the Ancestor of the Way, and he naturally would not doubt it.</p><p></p><p>Once Old Man Xiao cultivates the Way of Heaven and his strength breaks through, the other realm lords will certainly be envious and devote themselves to comprehending and cultivating the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Heaven is not far off, the Way of Heaven of this world has already been born."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Heaven has been born?" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was shocked and couldn't help but carefully sense the world. The laws and principles of the world were all within his perception, with no other unusual aspects, and he did not detect the existence of the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Heaven has just been born and has not yet operated throughout the entire world. How could you sense it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>With a point of his finger, a strand of the Qi of the Way of Heaven floated in front of Old Man Xiao. He said, "Being able to see me is also your destiny. This strand of the Qi of the Way of Heaven, you should comprehend it yourself. When the Way of Heaven operates fully, you will have some basic understanding of the Way of Heaven, and it will naturally be much easier to cultivate the Way of Heaven in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor of the Way!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the profundity of this strand of the Qi of the Way of Heaven was something he had never seen or comprehended before. This strand of the Qi of the Way of Heaven vaguely had some similarities with the principles of the world.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the principles of the world, it was more profound, as if containing infinite wonders and unfathomable rules of the world.</p><p></p><p>Respectfully accepting the Qi of the Way of Heaven, he asked, "Ancestor of the Way, may I go seek out the location of the Way of Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "When you feel something in your heart, you can go seek it out."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you Ancestor of the Way for your guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, and this session of the Ancestor of the Way answering questions came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue and others left one after another. Old Man Xiao also retreated respectfully. Wu Tiannan hurriedly followed, wanting to ask Old Man Xiao about his martial arts guide sister.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, only the six master and disciples remained.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will tell you about this world and all things in it."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Way's halo spread out from Li Xuan's body, enveloping the five disciples.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use the profundity of the Ancestor of the Way's halo to teach his disciples about the Way, allowing them to have deeper insights and deepen their concept of the Great Way, laying the foundation for their future martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Xu Yan, who was not far from the Heavenly Realm, and the Establishing the Way Realm was also in sight. After he breaks through to the Heavenly Realm, the next realm should be taught to him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Meng Chong had not yet fully comprehended the Haotian Wuji Body, so this was also an opportunity to let him understand it soon.</p><p></p><p>While Li Xuan was teaching his disciples, the others were preparing to go into seclusion to comprehend what they had gained this time.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had been constantly thinking about his martial arts guide sister, putting even seclusion and comprehension behind, and hurriedly sought out Old Man Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you come from the Dao Realm, do you know my sister?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's face was full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"What's your sister's name?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was busy finding a place to comprehend the Qi of the Way of Heaven at this moment, but was also curious about Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide, wanting to confirm if it was the person he guessed.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know my sister's specific name."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>However, he took out a scroll painting and said, "This is my sister."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he opened the painting.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao looked at it and sighed inwardly, it was indeed the person he had guessed.</p><p></p><p>"So it's her. You will naturally have the chance to see her."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you know my sister, can you..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"When the time is right, you will meet. Why rush? This old man is going into seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Old Man Xiao disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had a helpless expression, and couldn't help muttering in his heart, "The old man is just being mysterious with his little bit of strength. No wonder his martial path has no future!"</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, Wu Tiannan took a deep breath, and his gaze became determined. He must train twice as hard and quickly improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>Go to the Dao Realm as soon as possible to find his sister!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan finished his teaching and let his disciples go comprehend on their own.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm was steady, not feeling any tremors in the world at all. With the return of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, both sword cultivators and body cultivators erupted in a strong wave of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already begun preparing for his breakthrough to the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan left his Extreme Soul Body behind, while his true self came to Dahuang, teaching Tianzi about the concept of the Way of Heaven, as well as how to utilize Old Man Xiao and the others. He also needed to remind Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Tianzi's youthful mentality, he might act willfully and miss the opportunity to quickly enhance the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao? That guy isn't dead yet."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi grumbled.</p><p></p><p>"He clearly knew I was locked up there, but never came to find me, and never brought me any good things. It's simply outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Then Tianzi became excited again and said, "I am the Way of Heaven, and these guys like Xiaoyao can no longer progress. Since they want to comprehend me, this Way of Heaven, it's truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend the Way of Heaven and cultivate it, it can't be so easy. They must pay something."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was already pondering how to torment these people in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Heaven is supremely impartial. The rules of the Way of Heaven operate the world and cannot be interfered with lightly. If the Way of Heaven is not impartial, it will lose its dignity and be detrimental to the world.</p><p></p><p>"However, whatever you want to do, as long as it's not according to the rules of the Way of Heaven, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had anticipated that Tianzi's youthful mentality would not be able to resist tormenting them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when letting him transform into the Way of Heaven, he left some leeway. Tianzi could act as an independent identity, but without interfering with the rules of the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Way..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Ancestor, I understand!" Tianzi nodded his head as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a lively temperament and youthful nature, he was not unaware of the gravity of things, and knew what would be beneficial for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao is still alive. Among the disciples Taicang taught, besides Xiaoyao, who else is there?" Tianzi sighed wistfully.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao, one of the Seven Heroes of Taicang, was one of the seven people with the strongest innate talents born at the beginning of Taicang's world. Taicang taught them one by one, so they can be considered Taicang's disciples.</p><p></p><p>"They were called the Seven Heroes of Taicang. Their strength was so great that even some of the minor world lords who followed Taicang were no match for them. What they lacked was probably only the opportunity to open the purple light of creation."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Heroes of Taicang were born in Taicang's world, one of the seven people with the strongest innate talents, rather than being born in the Unchanging Land like Taicang and others.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood now that Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide was also one of the Seven Heroes of Taicang.</p><p></p><p>Taking out tables and chairs, teapots and cups, Li Xuan also took out a stone jar and removed a few tea leaves from it to start brewing tea.</p><p></p><p>The tea in the stone jar was extraordinary. Just a few leaves exuded an aura of vibrant life force and pervasive Dao essence.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" Tianzi was startled, then immediately delighted. "Elder Ancestor, you have such good things, why are you only bringing them out now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, "What good things? In this Dao Ancestor's eyes, this tea is no different from the tea I've drunk before. When you fully comprehend the Dao and truly understand its meaning, all things in heaven and earth will appear the same to you. Perhaps then you'll understand the realm within this."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi pouted and said, "I feel like I'll never reach that realm."</p><p></p><p>Then, excitedly looking at the tea brewed from the few leaves, with some nostalgia and some sighing, he said, "Ah, Qingyu tea, it's been so long since I've had it."</p><p></p><p>"This tea was given to me by my disciple. He said he took it from the treasure vault of the Sea Spirit Clan," Li Xuan said as he poured a cup of tea and slowly savored it.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was the spirit of Taicang's world, and had stayed by Taicang's side for ages. If anyone understood Taicang and this world best, it would be Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had come here to further understand Taicang and the other world lords.</p><p></p><p>"That should have been meant for that Sea Spirit Queen woman," Tianzi said with a pout, then continued, "Qingyu tea is grown by the lord of the Qinglin world. Those qualified to drink Qingyu tea can be counted on two hands..."</p><p></p><p>Once he started talking, Tianzi went on and on without stopping.</p><p></p><p>He recounted the grudges and entanglements between Taicang and the other six world lords, as well as among those world lords themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The lord of the Qinglin world was originally a jade bamboo plant, the Qinglin Jade Bamboo. It grew in the Unchanging Land and somehow gained sentience, continuously growing stronger, even hunting true spirits to strengthen itself.</p><p></p><p>"She had a very deep relationship with Taicang, and Qingyu was quite favored by Taicang. He once intervened on Qingyu's behalf to suppress that Minyu fellow.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, Qingyu was able to become a world lord because Taicang helped her, assisting her in obtaining enough purple light.</p><p></p><p>"I even suspect that Qingyu's transformation into human form was influenced by Taicang..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi rambled on.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quite surprised. The lord of the Qinglin world was actually a bamboo plant? The jade bamboo that Xu Yan obtained from Meiwu was probably Qinglin Jade Bamboo, though it's unknown how many generations removed from the original root system.</p><p></p><p>As Tianzi continued his narration, Li Xuan gained a more detailed understanding of the seven great world lords.</p><p></p><p>The seven great world lords were Taicang, Wumo, Minyu, Aohong, Hongze, Fenyun, and Qingyu, each with an extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>Wumo opened up the Wumo world. He was once the strongest of the Wumo true spirits in the Unchanging Land, the first to gain intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Among his strongest subordinates were the Seven Witches and Twelve Demons, with Meiwu being one of the Seven Witches.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Meiwu is so powerful," Li Xuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Minyu was a ruthless and bloodthirsty person who enjoyed devouring fresh blood and practiced the Blood Demon Way. Minyu's relationship with Taicang was the worst.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Minyu's relationship with Qingyu was also extremely poor, almost to the point of being enemies.</p><p></p><p>And it was also because of Qingyu that Minyu once angered Taicang and was suppressed by Taicang single-handedly for ten thousand years as punishment!</p><p></p><p>Aohong could be called the ancestor of true dragons. He was also the first intelligent true spirit Taicang encountered while wandering the Unchanging Land, and was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Aohong was the lord of the True Spirit world and the overlord of true spirits, but among the true spirits, Tianhu had always been unwilling to submit, always believing that it was due to bad luck that he obtained less purple light than Aohong and thus lost to him.</p><p></p><p>A battle between dragon and tiger once erupted, but Tianhu was suppressed. Though resentful, he could only submit.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang once said that Aohong kept some purple light, allowing true dragons to transform into human form. It seems he used it for other purposes as well. It's precisely because of this that Aohong's strength is slightly weaker than Wumo's," Tianzi said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Hongze is the water spirit of the Unchanging Land, so the Hongze world has far more seas and lakes than land. It's a holy land for cultivating water-based martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Fenyun is the fire spirit of the Unchanging Land. The Fenyun world is scorching hot with many volcanoes. It's a holy land for cultivating fire-based martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Qingyu is the Qinglin Jade Bamboo, so the Qinglin world is a world of plant spirits, with abundant vegetation, tall mountains and deep forests, a place of divine herbs and treasures."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi explained the other six great worlds, finally sighing, "In the past, although there were conflicts between the martial artists of the seven great worlds, they still interacted with each other.</p><p></p><p>"For example, those cultivating water-based martial arts would all go to the Hongze world for secluded cultivation. Those seeking rare divine herbs would go to the Qinglin world..."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Unchanging Divine Palace changed all of this.</p><p></p><p>In one great battle, the seven great worlds were defeated. Even one as strong as Taicang fell. Of the remaining worlds, it seemed only Wumo and Minyu still existed.</p><p></p><p>But the Wumo and Minyu worlds were probably in ruins too, and the powerful beings of these two worlds were thinking of invading Taicang's world.</p><p></p><p>"The Unchanging Divine Palace." Li Xuan was curious about where exactly the Unchanging Divine Palace came from.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Land was vast and boundless. Could it be that they had always been wandering in the Unchanging Land and happened to wander into the area where the seven great worlds were located, coveting the hearts of those worlds? Taicang and the others had wandered the Unchanging Land for long ages but had never encountered the Unchanging Divine Palace, which shows how vast and boundless the Unchanging Land is.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the powerful beings in the Unchanging Divine Palace surpassed even Taicang's. Does this mean that they gained intelligence before Taicang, earlier than him?</p><p></p><p>Tianzi continued to chatter on, as if wanting to pour out all the words he hadn't spoken in these long ages.</p><p></p><p>After finishing talking about the other six world lords, he began to speak about Taicang's followers.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Taimiao was one of Taicang's followers, and moreover, someone who admired Taicang.</p><p></p><p>"That Taimiao woman, she was even jealous of me back then because Taicang was good to me. It made me so angry!" Tianzi cursed. "The way she looked at me was strange, as if she thought I was Taicang's plaything. That look was so envious, what nonsense, that woman is unreasonable..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 122: Fierce Battle with a Half-Step Grand Master, the Dragon's Roar in the Mountains and Rivers</p><p></p><p>A refined gentleman descended from the sky, his aura like a deep pool, as if he was accompanied by the might of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Floating three feet off the ground, his footsteps did not touch the earth, and he gently waved his folding fan, refined and easygoing. Dou Yuying and the others were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression also changed, his face becoming grave.</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Master? No, that's not quite right, it's because he's too weak? A trash Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple robe had the aura of a Grand Master, but Xu Yan, who had fought against a Grand Master before, quickly noticed something was off.</p><p></p><p>"This Grand Master-like aura of heavenly might is much weaker, although it is still powerful. It is not impossible to defeat him, but it won't be easy either.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a trash Grand Master? Is there really such a weak Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave, but he was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that among the Grand Masters, there are some this weak?</p><p></p><p>"Even the weakest Grand Master would have ten times the strength of a Master, but this one is only about five or six times stronger than a Master. He is far from having ten times the power.</p><p></p><p>"Even compared to the weakest Master, like Yan Kuan, he does not have ten times the strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was not undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>He was just puzzled as to why this Grand Master was so trash-like.</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying stepped out of the carriage, looking at the man in the purple robe, her brows slightly furrowed, and after a long while, she said, "Lord Yin Hong of Canglan Island?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!" </p><p></p><p>Yin Hong smiled calmly. "Since Miss Dou knows me, then you should obediently come with me."</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan came out of the carriage, his face deathly pale. His injuries had not fully recovered, and in his current state, he could still handle a First-Order Warrior. </p><p></p><p>But if Yin Hong attacked, he would be dead in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yin Hong, do you dare to interfere in the affairs of the Dou family? Beware that after this matter is resolved, the Grand Master of the Dou family will come to demand justice!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Since I, Yin, have made a move, naturally I do not fear the Grand Master of the Dou family. Moreover, I am taking Miss Dou away on the request of an esteemed person. I naturally have the means to handle this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, how would I, Yin Hong, dare to set foot here and take the young miss of the Dou family?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yin, you must think carefully. You are only a Half-Step Grand Master. Even if you eventually break through to become a Grand Master, do you think you can withstand the wrath of the master of the Dou family?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan glared angrily.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong had entered the Dou family's territory and was kidnapping the young miss of the Dou family. With the master's temperament, even if someone tried to mediate, he would not let it go easily.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's expression darkened as he coldly said, "You, a third-rate Master, what qualifications do you have to spout such nonsense in front of me? Do you wish to die?"</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's face turned iron-blue with anger. If it were an ordinary Master who insulted him like this, he would definitely have a seventh-grade spirit herb prepared and ask Xu Yan to take the person down to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>But this was a Half-Step Grand Master. </p><p></p><p>He was only one step away from becoming a Grand Master, and Xu Yan was ultimately just a Master-level warrior. </p><p></p><p>No matter how strong he was, he might not be able to handle this.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's aura became increasingly fierce as he coldly said, "Miss Dou, I don't want to kill anyone. Obediently come with me, or else... even the guardian you've summoned will die here!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying's heart sank, and she took a deep breath, saying, "Alright, I'll go with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Young miss!" </p><p></p><p>Cui'er immediately broke down in tears.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, remember to deliver the owed spirit herbs to this young man."</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young miss!" </p><p></p><p>Cui'er was in tears.</p><p></p><p>"It's best to be sensible and not ruin the harmony between us."</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He was about to take Dou Yuying away when a voice suddenly came, which he found extremely humiliating to hear.</p><p></p><p>"You scared me for a moment, I thought you were a Grand Master, but it turns out you're just a Half-Step Grand Master, a half-baked one at that!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>He had been wondering why this Grand Master was so weak, far below his understanding of Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>It turns out he was just a half-baked one, with only part of a Grand Master's aura, but not a true Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he need not fear him!</p><p></p><p>After being in the inner realm for so long, he had killed one Master after another, easily dispatching them with a single palm strike, without even needing to use his true strength.</p><p></p><p>This Yin Hong was a rare opponent.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended the true meaning of the Dragon's Roar, and my Sword of the Mountains and Rivers is not yet complete. Just as the mountains and rivers cannot be stagnant, I already have a direction to perfect it.</p><p></p><p>"I just need an opponent who can withstand my sword intent, battle with me, and surely I can perfect and gain a deeper understanding of a sword dao based on sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>The refined expression on Yin Hong's face suddenly turned cold. What did he mean by calling him a half-baked Grand Master who couldn't break through in one go?</p><p></p><p>Was this an indirect insult, calling him a waste?</p><p></p><p>Being stuck at the Half-Step Grand Master realm was something he had always been resentful about in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now being mocked so directly, how could he not be enraged?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his killing intent was palpable.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you are courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong opened his folding fan, and a mighty aura descended, with layer upon layer of surging power emanating from him, accompanied by the sound of crashing waves.</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was eager to try, but he still didn't forget that this was Dou Yuying's enemy, so he couldn't just jump in for free.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Dou, I'll help you fend him off. This half-baked one is not weak, much stronger than an ordinary Master. One seventh-grade spirit herb is not enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying was overjoyed. Since Xu Yan was willing to step in, it meant he could contend with a Half-Step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>It made sense, as he could easily kill a Master with a single palm strike, so he was probably not much weaker than a Half-Step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Five seventh-grade spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying happily extended a delicate white hand.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Another five seventh-grade spirit herbs, obtaining these herbs was not that difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, today, besides Miss Dou, all of you will die!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong was enraged.</p><p></p><p>They were openly negotiating and trading five seventh-grade spirit herbs to deal with him?</p><p></p><p>Did they think Yin Hong was so cheap?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the influential person behind him, who wanted Dou Yuying brought back unharmed, he wouldn't even spare Dou Yuying!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you trying to scare?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't a Grand Master, he had no fear!</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a Grand Master, if he couldn't defeat them, he could still escape.</p><p></p><p>Dou Yuying and the others quickly retreated, afraid of being caught in the crossfire.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong made his move, waving his fan, and a terrifying power like surging waves came sweeping towards them, its might shocking.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew his sword, and the sword intent of the Mountains and Rivers surged forth, thundering as it cleaved through the rolling waves, overthrowing the mountains and rivers, annihilating all life!</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's expression changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this?</p><p></p><p>Why did it have such a terrifying aura of slaughter, making him feel a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>"Cannot be careless!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he put aside his contempt, his expression becoming grave.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rise up.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of the folding fan, a powerful wave of energy descended from the sky with a thunderous boom, creating a deep trench in the ground, and the soil was swept up in the turbulent motion of the fan.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong, a half-step Grand Master, unleashed the full extent of his formidable power, as terrifying waves of force poured towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>His sword intent surged, and the sword qi flowed like a raging river, unceasing. He then slapped his left palm, roaring as a golden dragon burst forth to fiercely strike the crashing waves.</p><p></p><p>"Who will emerge victorious in this battle?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Du Yuying watched with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the intensity of the battle, it seemed that Yin Hong had the upper hand, as the rolling, crashing waves swept across the area, kicking up clouds of soil and carving deep trenches in the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yan, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying anxiously asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say!" </p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he lamented, "I can't even tell what's going on, the battle is too fierce, I can't clearly see the details of the fight!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took a deep breath and instructed a guard, "Hurry back and seek reinforcements!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss!"</p><p></p><p>The guard immediately sprinted away, not even bothering to ride a horse, his speed surpassing that of a horse.</p><p></p><p>"I hope they can hold on!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying wore a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, even the clan's Grand Masters may not be able to get here in time."</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying fell silent. She knew this, but as long as a Master arrived to aid them, the situation could be turned around.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fought with all his might, constantly unleashing his Mountain and River Sword Intent, and striking with his Descending Dragon Palm, but he was unable to break through the crashing waves of force.</p><p></p><p>"Since breaking through the Innate Realm, I haven't had such an exhilarating battle. A true warrior must comprehend the essence of the Dao through combat."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind was clear, his gaze resolute.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was currently at a disadvantage, he was not the least bit concerned.</p><p></p><p>"The Mountain and River Sword Intent lacks vitality, it is too desolate, and a true Mountain and River cannot be devoid of life. A lifeless Mountain and River is nothing but a barren wasteland."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently realized.</p><p></p><p>As the battle grew more intense, Yin Hong also seemed to want to end it quickly, to avoid prolonging the fight on Du Clan's territory. If the Du Clan mobilized a Grand Master to aid them, he would undoubtedly be doomed.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong roared, his folding fan opening and transforming into a gleaming cold light, shooting out amidst the crashing waves with lightning speed, aiming straight for Xu Yan's throat.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan's figure suddenly vanished, only to reappear at another location, a sword beam striking with unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>Shhh!</p><p></p><p>The clothes on Yin Hong's shoulder were slashed open.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's expression changed slightly, his heart filled with shock. "What kind of movement technique is this? So cunning and bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan disappeared again, reappearing at a different position.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's face darkened, and he returned the folding fan to his hand, leaping into the air and slamming his palms down, as if a crashing wave was pouring down, immediately causing the soil around them to explode.</p><p></p><p>The rolling soil transformed into surging waves, rushing in from all directions to assault Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slapped his palm, and eighteen golden dragons roared out, the Mountain and River Sword Intent surging forth to collide with Yin Hong's crashing waves.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power descended like a massive mountain, and the soil waves seemed to trap the golden dragons, as if they were sinking into a muddy quagmire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure flickered as he retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's killing intent was now palpable, his palms flashing as wave after wave of crashing force poured out, the soil constantly churning and rising, forming a tumultuous tide that threatened to engulf the eighteen mighty dragons.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Du Yuying was growing increasingly anxious.</p><p></p><p>It was now clear that Xu Yan had fallen into a disadvantageous position, and was in grave danger at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Yan remained calm, thrusting his sword again and again, the Mountain and River Sword Intent continuously manifesting, an aura of ruthlessness permeating the area as the eighteen dragons were shattered, his expression unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sense of deathly stillness emerged, the battlefield seeming to have entered a realm of profound tranquility. Even the weeds on the ground appeared to have lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's brow furrowed, his heart filled with trepidation. "What kind of sword technique is this? Why is it so bizarre?"</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's aura erupted, and the soil waves surged forth, intent on completely burying Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Now is the time!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes flashed with a brilliant light, and the collapsing Mountain and River suddenly burst with vitality.</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar resounded within the Mountain and River.</p><p></p><p>Awooo!</p><p></p><p>This dragon's roar seemed to contain the might of the heavens and earth, and in an instant, the skies darkened, the Mountain and River manifested, and a golden dragon soared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust out his sword, as if the Mountain and River enveloped the entire world, the golden dragon roaring like thunderous lightning, the sword intent shattering everything in its path, the dragon's roar shaking the very soul.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the crashing waves were destroyed, the countless swirling soil fragments seemingly becoming a part of the Mountain and River, the golden dragon soaring, its roar causing the winds and clouds to churn, as if the power of the heavens and earth was pouring forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p></p><p>One sword broke through the relentless waves, and another sword swept across the Mountain and River.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong felt a dragon's roar resonate in his mind, shaking his spirit, his breath momentarily halting. What was even more terrifying was that he seemed to see the boundless Mountain and River, and the golden dragon soaring through the skies.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar seemed to have drawn him into the Mountain and River, allowing him to feel the endless vitality, the grandeur of the Mountain and River, and the sight of the golden dragon soaring freely.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and River was beautiful, captivating him.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this was also a deadly killing intent!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>As a half-step Grand Master who had experienced countless battles, Yin Hong had also fought his way out of life-and-death crises before.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he let out a furious roar, biting down on his tongue and causing blood to gush out, his aura exploding as a terrifying wave of force enveloped his body.</p><p></p><p>The folding fan opened, its broad surface shielding the upper half of his body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he rapidly retreated.</p><p></p><p>The crashing wave of force swept through, as if parting the Mountain and River, as if breaking free from the majestic Mountain and River.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A powerful impact struck his chest, shaking his lungs, nearly causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>Shhh!</p><p></p><p>Even with the protective folding fan, he still felt a slight sting, as if an invisible force had pierced through the fan and struck his throat.</p><p></p><p>It had almost impaled him!</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's figure retreated rapidly, his heart trembling with fear as he looked at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He had almost been killed by that attack!</p><p></p><p>That sword strike was so terrifying, especially the roar that had shaken his mind, as if it had drawn him into a world of Mountain and River.</p><p></p><p>If he had not reacted quickly, he would have become a corpse by now!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword technique is this? It can even trap the opponent in an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's expression was unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement, "I have finally comprehended the essence of the Sword Dao. This is not just a sword technique, but the true Sword Dao, based on the foundation of sword intent and the art of killing."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I shall call this technique 'Mountain and River Dragon's Roar'."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and River Dragon's Roar had transcended the realm of mere sword techniques, and had become the true Sword Dao art!</p><p></p><p>Rooted in the foundation of sword intent, it manifested as the ultimate killing technique.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

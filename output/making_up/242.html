        <h1>Chapter 242</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young chubby boy seemed afraid that Li Xuan didn't know who Shen Daxiao was, so he added in a low voice, "A top-tier family, Shen Haizhu, the young master of the Shen family, he has praised this treasure highly!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhu? Li Xuan raised his eyebrows, wasn't this the young master from a prominent family that Xu Yan knew in the Spiritual Realm? So he became curious and smiled, "Oh, what kind of treasure has even the young master Shen praised so highly?"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, come, come, let me show you." </p><p></p><p>The chubby boy was overjoyed, another business opportunity had arrived, the name of young master Shen was really useful! Li Xuan wasn't afraid of being deceived, so he followed the chubby boy into the simple shop.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the simple shop, the disorderly arrangement of all the forging materials, as well as some strange-looking objects.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, my name is Fang Hao."</p><p></p><p>As Fang Hao spoke, he closed the shop door, afraid that Li Xuan would misunderstand, and explained, "This treasure needs to be a bit dark to fully appreciate it."</p><p></p><p>He then pulled out a box from behind the counter, opened it, and took out a box about a foot long and half a finger thick.</p><p></p><p>The box had a handle on each side, allowing it to be held with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao extended two brackets from the back of the box and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>With a mysterious and lewd expression, he said, "Big brother, you must watch carefully, this is a precious treasure I've painstakingly researched, even young master Shen has praised it highly."</p><p></p><p>He also revealed a jade token hanging at his waist, saying, "See, this is the jade token young master Shen gave me, I have a deep friendship with young master Shen."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled wryly, Fang Hao was afraid of having his treasure stolen, so he used Shen Haizhu's identity to intimidate people. And judging from the jade token at his waist, it did seem to be a token from a prominent family.</p><p></p><p>In a place like the Spiritual Realm where the hierarchy was so strict, Fang Hao could indeed intimidate many with Shen Haizhu's identity.</p><p></p><p>Curiously looking at the box on the table, it was square-shaped, with a handle on each side, and the front was smooth, like a mirror.</p><p></p><p>"This is a precious treasure."</p><p></p><p>This box was actually a precious treasure, but he didn't know what its function was.</p><p></p><p>It didn't look like a weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'd like to see how this treasure has earned young master Shen's praise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"You just watch, it definitely won't disappoint you."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had a lecherous expression.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the handle of the box with one hand and channeled his cultivation, infusing the precious treasure with a surge of power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the smooth surface of the box began to shine with light, and a graceful figure appeared on the mirror-like surface.</p><p></p><p>It was an exquisitely beautiful woman, and even more amazingly, the woman in the mirror image was completely nude.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, although he had guessed from Fang Hao's lecherous expression, he was still taken aback when he actually saw it.</p><p></p><p>But just when he thought the mirror image of the beautiful woman was already amazing, Fang Hao chuckled and the mirror surface shone again.</p><p></p><p>This time, two beautiful women appeared in the mirror, intertwined with each other, their graceful figures and postures constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was truly surprised this time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt like he was watching an erotic film from the past, except that the figures in the mirror were paintings rather than real people, and there was no sound.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, isn't it a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao grinned lecherously.</p><p></p><p>The mirror in the box continued to display the intertwining of the beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>After watching Fang Hao's demonstration, Li Xuan found that the scenes displayed by this treasure were limited, and the movements of the intertwining women were also limited.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was subject to certain restrictions.</p><p></p><p>"The price is 100,000 spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao opened with a hopeful expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Fang Hao, deep in thought. Was this a forging genius?</p><p></p><p>"Did you forge this treasure yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao became very proud and said, "In the entire Spiritual Realm, only I can forge this. It's a pity that the images are limited, but I will improve it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that the chubby boy seemed to be a talented person, perhaps the fourth disciple he was looking for was right in front of him? But he still needed to test him further.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's strength was not strong, he had just entered the Great Master realm.</p><p></p><p>At his age and with his strength, among the unaffiliated cultivators, he would be considered a genius-level talent.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Spiritual Sects and prominent families, he was only average.</p><p></p><p>"Besides this treasure, do you have any other precious treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of treasure do you want?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao didn't beat around the bush, and dragged out another box from behind the counter.</p><p></p><p>He could sell anything he had, recently he had bought a batch of materials and was almost broke.</p><p></p><p>Young master Shen hadn't come by for a while, he didn't know where he had gone.</p><p></p><p>Without young master Shen as a cash cow, his items weren't selling at all.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen this?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a treasure that resembled a pair of goggles, put them on his eyes, channeled his cultivation, and the treasure immediately emitted a beam of light that illuminated the dim shop.</p><p></p><p>"This is essential for entering dark places, although it consumes a lot, it's still very useful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, this thing was indeed unique, but the consumption was too high. Which cultivator exploring dark places would constantly drain their own peak condition to maintain two beams of light, making themselves an easy target?</p><p></p><p>Cultivators mostly chose moonlight stones or night pearls as illumination, not this kind of treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Fang Hao's creation had a high cost, not only could he not sell it at a high price, he couldn't even recover the cost.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also felt a bit embarrassed, put down the treasure, and muttered, "This is an unfinished product, in my original design, you just need to glare and it would shoot out an attack to kill the enemy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, it was an interesting idea, but the difficulty was too high, Fang Hao clearly couldn't achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then took out a claw from the box and put it on his hand. He raised his hand and swiped forward, and the claw emitted a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>"Despicable person, look at my claw!"</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Xuan was that this claw could actually make sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao swiped again, and the claw made a beast's roar.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, it let out a man's angry shout.</p><p></p><p>"For now, these are the only three sounds it can make. When attacking enemies, it can distract their attention, so it's still quite practical."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>In his original design, a swipe of the claw would emit something like a demonic sound to intimidate the enemy, but the end result was only sound effects without any intimidating effect.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he researched, he couldn't achieve what he had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>"Are all these treasures forged by you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked, looking at the miscellaneous treasures in the box.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He then asked expectantly, "Big brother, which one do you like? I can give you a discount!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye looked at it more and more, and felt that Fang Hao was quite compatible. This little chubby guy had some extraordinary ideas in his mind, and his talent was not bad. He was just the right person to cultivate the Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you make these unconventional treasures? They look a bit like chicken ribs."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The forging in the Spirit Realm has become uninteresting to me, and my dream is to become the number one forging family in the Spirit Realm," Fang Hao said with a determined gaze. "Only by surpassing everyone and creating new forging can I achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"As a wandering cultivator, how can you establish a family?" Li Xuanye asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I know it's difficult, but if I don't try, how can I be content?" Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Is your forging technique inherited from your ancestors?" Li Xuanye asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"No," Fang Hao shook his head. "My father's strength was not strong, and he just entered the Grandmaster realm when he died unexpectedly. I feel that my martial arts talent is not very good, so I chose to learn forging."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye became more and more satisfied. Fang Hao indeed had extraordinary Qimen talent, and he felt that his Qimen martial arts would soon appear in the world.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye then asked Fang Hao some more questions, and Fang Hao answered them one by one. In the end, Fang Hao even took Li Xuanye to the courtyard behind the shop.</p><p></p><p>This was the courtyard that Fang Hao had rented. The front was the shop, and the back was a courtyard where Fang Hao forged his tools.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, there was a forging platform, and various forging materials were placed around it. Next to the forging platform, there was an iron puppet about a person's height.</p><p></p><p>"This is the battle puppet I have carefully researched and developed. However, it is currently too limited and cannot fight independently. It needs my own martial arts power to control it, which makes it seem a bit like chicken ribs."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye was indeed a bit surprised. Fang Hao's talent was really impressive. He could even forge a battle puppet.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye injected a divine element into the battle puppet, and the puppet immediately raised its weapon and started swinging it around.</p><p></p><p>"I want the battle puppet to have a more autonomous fighting style, but it seems very difficult to achieve," Fang Hao said with an embarrassed look.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you've found a solution?" Li Xuanye asked with a smile as he retracted the divine element.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then explained his idea of trying to nurture the battle puppet in a special place, just like how the corpse-devouring beast was nurtured. However, he sighed, as this process would be extremely long and the results were uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"This battle puppet, I'll take it. I have something to commission you to forge. If you succeed, it will be a great opportunity for you," Li Xuanye said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's eyes lit up, and he quickly agreed. Li Xuanye then took out 500,000 spirit stones and a "Spring Night Mirror", telling Fang Hao to keep the mirror for himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanye then showed Fang Hao a simple formation diagram, telling him to forge it into a treasure. As long as Fang Hao could comprehend the profundity of this diagram, it would prove that they were fated, and Fang Hao would become Li Xuanye's fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at the diagram, feeling that it was extremely profound. He was confident that he could complete this task and open up a new world for himself.</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuanye left, Fang Hao looked at the diagram, feeling that he had obtained something extraordinary. If he could truly comprehend and forge the treasure Li Xuanye wanted, it would be an incredible opportunity.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 84: Xie Lingfeng: Was the Martial Art I Cultivated a Fake One?</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a deep breath to calm his furious heart.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you know that to truly enter the Sword Dao, one must have a clear and enlightened sword heart?" Xu Yan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"???" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was completely bewildered. Sword heart enlightenment? He had never even heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at Hu Shan who was watching the fight from afar. Hu Shan also had a dumbfounded expression and shook his head, indicating he had never heard of it either.</p><p></p><p>"Are you just making up some random term to deceive me? Do you really think I, Xie Lingfeng, would believe that?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a deep breath and glared angrily at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he kept telling himself: "Don't fall for it, this is fake, he's trying to deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of "I knew it" on his face and said, "Since you don't even know what sword heart enlightenment is, how can you claim to have already entered the Sword Dao?"</p><p></p><p>He became more and more convinced that the martial arts of the Inner Realm were fake, and what his master taught was the true Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Then tell me, what is this so-called sword heart enlightenment?" Xie Lingfeng sneered.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely refused to be fooled.</p><p></p><p>"Sword heart enlightenment means the sword heart is clear and transparent, able to instantly comprehend sword techniques and sword moves, and freely make use of them. </p><p></p><p>"Only those with sword heart enlightenment can truly enter the Sword Dao. </p><p></p><p>"This is the foundation of the Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt pity for Xie Lingfeng, who didn't even know about sword heart enlightenment, and mistakenly thought he had already become a Sword Dao cultivator when he had not even entered the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! How could there be anyone with sword heart enlightenment in this world?" Xie Lingfeng's mind was in chaos, but he was determined that Xu Yan was trying to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>If there were truly people with sword heart enlightenment, wouldn't sword techniques be easy to learn? Where would the difficulty be?</p><p></p><p>"I am one with sword heart enlightenment, so I can instantly comprehend your sword techniques and freely make use of them as I please!" Xu Yan said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"No! Impossible!" Xie Lingfeng gritted his teeth and said, "Don't try to deceive me, you must have learned the sword techniques of my Sword Saint Peak from somewhere!"</p><p></p><p>"I only study the Sword Dao, not sword techniques. I don't care for your Sword Saint Peak's sword techniques. If you don't believe me, let's continue the fight!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his sword, signaling Xie Lingfeng to attack.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gritted his teeth but did not make a move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized he no longer had the courage to draw his sword.</p><p></p><p>If he attacked, the next moment his own sword techniques would be taken and used against him. How could he fight like that?</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, who was watching from afar, hurriedly ran over and said anxiously, "Young Master, don't be misled and lose your confidence!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng clenched his teeth and said, "But his sword techniques..."</p><p></p><p>"He must have stolen them. Let me teach him a lesson!" Hu Shan said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Drawing his long sword, he looked at Xu Yan and said, "I'll give it a try, let's see how you can take and use my sword techniques for yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and said, "Go ahead and attack."</p><p></p><p>"Take my attack and see how you can take my sword techniques!" Hu Shan sneered, and his long sword swept out like a raging wind.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a few deep breaths, watching the battle intently. He thought to himself, "Hu Shan's Raging Wind Sword Technique, has he learned it too? When did the sword techniques of Sword Saint Peak get leaked out?</p><p></p><p>"No! Impossible, the supreme sword techniques can only be cultivated by the core disciples. Even among the core disciples, not everyone is qualified to cultivate the three supreme sword techniques."</p><p></p><p>A preposterous idea began to form in Xie Lingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>What if what Xu Yan said was true?</p><p></p><p>He had sword heart enlightenment and could instantly comprehend sword techniques to use as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this possibility made Xie Lingfeng feel a bit lost.</p><p></p><p>He had always claimed to be the number one sword talent in Sword Saint Peak in a thousand years, but he hadn't even entered the Sword Dao?</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sneered inwardly, thinking there was no way anyone could have sword heart enlightenment. Xu Yan must have used some method to steal the sword techniques of Sword Saint Peak.</p><p></p><p>As Hu Shan's Raging Wind Sword Technique unfolded, Xu Yan suddenly struck back, his sword moving like a raging wind, which was precisely Hu Shan's own technique.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's face remained coldly sneering, not at all surprised.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he changed his moves!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the raging sword qi, a sword light skimmed across the ground, followed by a second, a third... These ground-skimming sword lights erupted one after another under the cover of the raging sword qi. </p><p></p><p>This was his self-created lethal sword move!</p><p></p><p>It did not belong to Sword Saint Peak. Through many life-and-death battles over the years, he had created this ground-skimming sword light technique, which achieved the final victory by taking the enemy by surprise.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of the raging sword qi, it had a startling effect.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who had seen this ground-skimming sword light had already died!</p><p></p><p>No one knew he had this hidden killing move!</p><p></p><p>Watching from the sidelines, Xie Lingfeng's eyes lit up. Hu Shan had actually hidden such a lethal move, which was not a sword technique of Sword Saint Peak. Let's see how the other party could take and use it!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, but his figure flickered and dodged. Then he swung his sword, and amidst the raging sword qi, a series of ground-skimming sword lights shot out.</p><p></p><p>They were even stronger, faster, and more exquisite than Hu Shan's.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hu Shan had not yet realized that Xu Yan had unleashed his signature move.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's pupils shrank, and a tumultuous storm surged in his heart. Wasn't this Hu Shan's killing move?</p><p></p><p>Could sword heart enlightenment really exist?!</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Xie Lingfeng hurriedly drew his sword, and a dazzling sword light shot out, blocking Xu Yan's ground-skimming sword lights.</p><p></p><p>Even so, one sword light still grazed Hu Shan's face, leaving a shallow sword mark.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sheathed his sword, standing there with an arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's lips trembled, his face deathly pale, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This was his self-created move!</p><p></p><p>As soon as he unleashed it, it was taken and used by the other party, and even better and stronger than his own.</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster was this? A cultivator this monstrous, who in the world of sword dao could be his match?</p><p></p><p>Who could dare to draw their sword against him?</p><p></p><p>Unless they had a cultivation realm far surpassing his, with absolute strength to crush him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at the same realm, he would be invincible!</p><p></p><p>No, he could even fight beyond his realm!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hu Shan had no choice but to believe that what Xu Yan said was true - he had learned the sword techniques on the spot and could freely take and use them.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng felt a bit lost and dazed. This battle had dealt him such a heavy blow, he even began to doubt his own sword dao talent.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally calmed down a bit, sheathed his sword, and cupped his hands, saying, "Senior Xu, it is I who have lost."</p><p></p><p>Although he technically hadn't lost yet.</p><p></p><p>But Xie Lingfeng knew he could not defeat Xu Yan. His sword techniques had been thoroughly seen through, and the only thing keeping him from losing was his slightly higher cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't lost yet, since I haven't defeated you," Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was very strong, proficient in sword techniques, he just lacked the sword heart enlightenment. </p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan could see the weaknesses in Xie Lingfeng's sword techniques, the fleeting opportunities, with his current strength, he was not confident he could seize them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xie Lingfeng's ability to respond was extraordinary. Even if he grasped the weak points and attacked, it was not necessarily possible to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>However, if the battle continued, Xu Yan felt he could win.</p><p></p><p>But since the other party had been so severely struck, it was best to leave them some leeway.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng bitterly smiled, saying his swordsmanship had been thoroughly understood, and there was absolutely no way for him to win. The only path was to be defeated, it was just a matter of how long it would take.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was just comforting himself.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Xie Lingfeng spoke: "I have studied the sword since I was young, entered the path at the age of six, and have become the youngest Sword Venerable Master in the thousand-year history of the Sword Venerable Cliff.</p><p></p><p>"I am confident that among my peers, there is no one who can defeat me. But today, in fighting with you, Brother Xu, I realize that there are still higher realms beyond this world."</p><p></p><p>"I have many doubts, I wonder if Brother Xu can enlighten me on a few points."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought about it, Xie Lingfeng's attitude was still acceptable, he was not arrogant, and Xu Yan also wanted to learn more about the Inner Realm from Xie Lingfeng to prepare for his future journey there.</p><p></p><p>So he nodded and said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stared intently at Xu Yan and asked, "Brother Xu, are you from the Borderland?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "I know what you want to ask, I'm not afraid to tell you, I am indeed the Borderland person you mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"You must be wondering how I became a martial artist? </p><p></p><p>"The Borderland has no spiritual energy, so it is impossible to cultivate martial artists, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded and said, "Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly shocked that there were martial artists in the Borderland, and their strength was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>"True martial dao does not cling to the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth. Even if the heavens and earth have no spiritual energy, one can still use one's own body as a bridge to communicate with the heavens and earth, and become a martial artist..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"True martial dao?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng frowned. What is the true martial dao?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the martial arts he cultivated were false?</p><p></p><p>This absurd idea surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the true martial dao, and what you cultivate in the Inner Realm is actually a false martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible, nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan jumped up and shouted.</p><p></p><p>What bullshit! </p><p></p><p>The martial arts cultivated in the Inner Realm are false martial arts? And the Borderland's are the true martial arts?</p><p></p><p>This is a huge fallacy!</p><p></p><p>"I know, you can't accept this, but the fact is just like this!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not surprised by his reaction.</p><p></p><p>Whoever has cultivated for half a lifetime, if suddenly told that what they cultivated is false, who could accept it?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's face became solemn, and he said in a deep voice, "Brother Xu, why do you say this? How can my martial dao be a false martial dao? At most, there are differences between the two, it can't be called true or false, right?"</p><p></p><p>If his martial dao was a false one, then the heritage of the Sword Venerable Cliff would also be a false martial dao?</p><p></p><p>The entire martial dao of the Inner Realm would be false martial arts?</p><p></p><p>He could not accept such a result at all. Once this was spread out, how many martial artists would be enraged, how many heritage lineages would be filled with killing intent? This would shake the foundation of the martial dao in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Come, come, come, let's discuss this martial dao, and you'll understand why it's a false martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit was lifted, and he said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Discuss martial dao!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan's spirits were also lifted, discuss martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go first, or you?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was someone he could discuss martial dao with, and he wanted to tell Xie Lingfeng and the others what the true martial dao was.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Martial dao, starting from the Nine Grades... The First Grade is already a martial arts expert. Breaking through the First Grade barrier, drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, refining the inner qi of martial dao, this is the Refinement Master, the strong ones in the martial dao. Above the Refinement Master is the Grand Refinement Master...</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Refinement Master, the inner qi of martial dao flows like a river, like blood circulating throughout the body..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng started from the entry level of martial dao, the Nine Grades, and went all the way up to the Grand Refinement Master realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial dao of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened intently, Xie Lingfeng's exposition was clearer than blood, more detailed and more complete, allowing him to truly understand the martial dao of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao of the Inner Realm was not without merit.</p><p></p><p>However, it did not change Xu Yan's belief that the martial dao of the Inner Realm was a false martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it made him more determined.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, who had been quietly observing, sighed after hearing Xie Lingfeng's exposition: "The martial dao of the Inner Realm is also very strong, but it is still not as good as the martial dao I created. If my martial dao can be widely cultivated, once it spreads, the martial dao of the Inner Realm will likely face a great impact."</p><p></p><p>Any martial artist aspires to be stronger. They all want to cultivate more powerful techniques, and the martial dao he created was stronger than the martial dao of the Inner Realm. Once it spread, the martial dao of the Inner Realm would gradually be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>And those heritage lineages with long histories would certainly not be reconciled, and the martial dao of the Inner Realm had been passed down for a long time, with countless believers. It would inevitably trigger a fierce debate over the true and false nature of martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was premised on him spreading the martial dao, and it having a certain scale to attract attention.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's trip would not be dangerous, and Xie Lingfeng and the others did not act arrogantly just because they were from the Inner Realm. Li Xuan did not stay any longer.</p><p></p><p>As for the final result of discussing martial dao, he could predict it.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, it's your turn now!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng finished and looked solemnly at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and began, "To cultivate martial dao, one must first establish a solid foundation. The foundation of martial dao starts with refining the skin... Those who have refined their bones into golden bones are the ancient geniuses. Once the golden bones are refined, even if buried underground for thousands of years after death, they will still be golden and harder than steel..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng interrupted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his brain was buzzing a bit. The foundation of martial dao is refining the skin? Reaching the peak of skin refinement, ordinary knives and swords can hardly harm you?</p><p></p><p>Then refine the bones, and they are divided into iron bones, copper bones, and golden bones?</p><p></p><p>Refining golden bones, even if buried underground for thousands of years after death, the bones will still be golden and harder than steel?</p><p></p><p>Listening to it, it sounded mysterious and unreal.</p><p></p><p>He felt his brain was not only buzzing, but also a bit on fire, as if his brain was burning.</p><p></p><p>"You said, golden bones buried underground for thousands of years will still be golden?"</p><p></p><p>This is the foundation of martial dao?</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "With a solid foundation, it is the root of martial dao. Above the golden bones, there are also jade bones, jade bones without blemish, unchanging for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng scratched his head, he felt his brain was a bit on fire, his mind had received an extremely great shock.</p><p></p><p>Is martial dao really like this? </p><p></p><p>So mysterious?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that what I cultivated is really a false martial dao?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, are you alright?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Xie Lingfeng, whose hair was all messed up, his face alternating between blue and red, his whole state a bit off.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing that the martial dao he cultivated is a false one, the impact was too deep. Sigh, I shouldn't have been so blunt in telling him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

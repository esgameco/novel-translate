        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings from the Netherworld and the Witch-Demon Realm have been trying to enter the Cang Realm and fight against its strong ones for ages.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Cang Realm's advantage grew larger, and its powerful beings also increased in number. </p><p></p><p>After all, although there were some holes in the Cang Realm, it was still an intact world, and its laws of heaven and earth had not decayed. This was sufficient to support cultivators' practice, so strong ones would continue to emerge.</p><p></p><p>While Realm Lord level experts may not easily appear, there was no shortage of Supreme level experts.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Netherworld and Witch-Demon Realm had not produced any new Supreme level experts for a long time. The current Supreme level experts all belonged to the ancient generation.</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings of the Netherworld and Witch-Demon Realm had once joined forces to launch an attack on the Cang Realm, attempting to force its Realm Lords to make concessions. However, after a great battle, the Cang Realm repelled their joint attack by leveraging its numerical advantage in Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, large-scale conflicts between the three realms no longer occurred. The powerful beings from each side occasionally made contact with each other, but the Cang Realm never yielded or made room for them to settle down.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Netherworld had retracted the pathway of laws connecting to the holes in the Cang Realm that it had extended earlier. It seemed to have given up on the idea of letting Netherworld warriors enter the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A sudden tremor came from the Netherworld. The realm, which had already partially collapsed, suddenly crumbled further in one corner.</p><p></p><p>The tremors rippled outwards, spreading through the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>The Witch-Demon Realm, being closest to the Netherworld, was the first to sense it. One by one, powerful beings emerged and stood outside their realm.</p><p></p><p>Charming Witch, Earth Witch, Strength Witch, Flame Demon, Giant Demon, Tyrant Demon, Red Demon - the few remaining of the Seven Witches and Twelve Demons of the Witch-Demon Realm all appeared, looking towards the direction of the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Why did another part of the Netherworld collapse?" Giant Demon asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Charming Witch frowned. At this moment, she showed no trace of her usual allure. Her expression contained only solemnity and fear.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Unchanging Divine Palace make a move? Even in its ruined state, the Netherworld is not something we have the power to crumble. Only the Lord of a Realm would have such strength!" Charming Witch said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Netherworld finished then? And will our Witch-Demon Realm be next?" Earth Witch and the others' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all seven of them looked towards the Cang Realm. To resist the Unchanging Divine Palace, only the Cang Realm had any possibility!</p><p></p><p>"Have those few from the Netherworld already perished?" Flame Demon frowned as he looked towards the Netherworld's location.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!" Charming Witch shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Could they have surrendered to the Unchanging Divine Palace?" Strength Demon asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if they surrendered, it would only buy them a short reprieve. Besides, we all know the Unchanging Divine Palace's style of action and their methods. They won't accept us, but will definitely invade to absorb our strength and steal the essence of our realms from us." Charming Witch sighed.</p><p></p><p>If surrendering to the Unchanging Divine Palace was an option, why would they stubbornly defend their realms in the face of mortal danger? It was simply because the Unchanging Divine Palace aimed to devour realms to achieve some goal. In a sense, the lords of these small realms and the living beings within were merely nutrients in the eyes of the Unchanging Divine Palace!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, another corner of the Netherworld collapsed. Even across the vast distance, they could faintly sense a presence emerging.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord!" The expressions of Charming Witch and the other six grew heavy. A true Realm Lord had made a move.</p><p></p><p>After lying dormant for such a long time, the Unchanging Divine Palace had finally recovered from the great battle of the past and begun to take action. And their first move was to send out a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Should we support the Netherworld?" Strength Demon asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late." Charming Witch sighed, "Even if we join forces, we may not be able to match that Realm Lord. By relying on the power of the Witch-Demon Realm, we could resist for a while, but it would take considerable time to move our realm over there. We won't make it in time."</p><p></p><p>"Let's find Tai Kun and Tai He. At this point, if the Cang Realm wants to survive, their only option is to accept us and fight the Unchanging Divine Palace together!" Tyrant Demon said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. At this point, this is the only path left. The Witch-Demon Realm should also move closer to the Cang Realm!" Charming Witch and the other six made their decision and returned to the Witch-Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The laws of the Witch-Demon Realm extended towards the holes in the Cang Realm. The laws began to contract, and the vast Witch-Demon Realm slowly started to move, drawing closer to the Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Realm, Dao Domain, True Dragon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming had already returned and was recounting the details of the dragon subjugation incident, as well as the powerful being behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao?" Ao Lie's red whiskers trembled with rage as he furiously said, "Does he think it's still like the old days? Of the Seven Heroes of Cang, some are dead, some have disappeared, leaving only him and Yu Yao. He's all alone now, yet he still dares to act so presumptuously?"</p><p></p><p>"This is disregarding me, Ao Lie! Developing a method to subjugate dragons, what is he trying to do? This is bullying dragons too much! Does he really think I, Ao Lie, am easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie was furious, his dragon aura rippling out. Even his dragon horns flashed with a sharp light.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't want to bother with that flirtatious woman Charming Witch, but this bastard Xiao Yao can't be let off so easily. I must demand an explanation from him and see just how capable this so-called leader of the Seven Heroes of Cang really is!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie stood up abruptly, speaking with uncontrollable anger.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ao Lie, Tian Sha requests an audience!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie raised an eyebrow and gestured for Ao Ming to go welcome the guest. He sat on his throne, waiting for Tian Sha to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tian Sha, what important matter brings you here?" Ao Lie asked directly after Tian Sha entered.</p><p></p><p>"I've come about Xiao Yao!" Tian Sha's gaze was solemn. "Xiao Yao has gone too far. He didn't contribute in repelling the Netherworld and Witch-Demon Realm several times, and now he's plotting for the authority over realms in the Divine Realm, even targeting the True Dragon Realm. This matter cannot be left unresolved."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ao Lie immediately asked, "What's your opinion on this, Tian Sha?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to lend Brother Ao Lie a hand in suppressing Xiao Yao. For this operation, I've already contacted some Realm Lords, and they won't interfere."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure Brother Ao Lie knows that if we target Xiao Yao, Yu Yao, being one of the Seven Heroes, certainly won't stand idly by. I will block Yu Yao."</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha's eyes were cold.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a grudge against Xiao Yao?" Ao Lie was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that. What do you think, Brother Ao Lie?" Tian Sha neither confirmed nor denied.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie fell into deep thought. It was no secret among the Realm Lords of the Dao Domain that Tian Sha was plotting for the authority over realms.</p><p></p><p>However, the authority over realms was not so easily obtained. Where did Tian Sha get the confidence from? Many Realm Lords were watching and waiting, even preparing to get a piece of the pie, absolutely not allowing Tian Sha to become too powerful alone.</p><p></p><p>Among the ancient small realm lords, Tai He, Tai Kun, and Tai Miao had shown no movement, made no statement on this matter, as if tacitly approving Tian Sha's actions.</p><p></p><p>"This cooperation to target Xiao Yao is fine, but in the Cang Realm, our True Spirit lineage received the favor of the Cang ancestors and was given a place..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This ground, no matter what, must be defended, and will never submit to others..." Ao Lie slowly began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ao Lie, rest assured. I, Tian Sha, have come here not only to assist you in dealing with Xiao Yao, but also to demonstrate sincerity for cooperation between us.</p><p></p><p>"After the matter is settled, Brother Ao Lie will get 20%. How about that? With this 20%, it will be enough to ensure the stable position of the True Spirit lineage."</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"20%?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Lie laughed and said, "Good, then it's settled. Xiao Yao has bullied dragons too much, we must retaliate, otherwise he'll really think true dragons are easy to bully!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ao Lie, just wait for my signal. When the time comes, we'll descend upon the divine realm together, leaving Xiao Yao nowhere to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll await your good news then!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie nodded happily.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Tian Sha will go prepare. Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>"Take care. Ming'er, see your Uncle Tian Sha off!"</p><p></p><p>After seeing Tian Sha off, Ao Ming returned and asked puzzledly, "Father, do you really want to join forces with Tian Sha?"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao has bullied dragons too much. We must teach him a lesson. Besides, since Tian Sha dares to plot for the authority of heaven and earth, he must have his own confidence.</p><p></p><p>"If the cooperation goes smoothly and we get 20% of the authority, it will be enough for our true dragon clan to maintain our current position."</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie's gaze was deep as he said, "It's been too long since the battle of heaven and earth. The Immortal Palace is likely to take action. Tian Sha's ambitions - the fact that Tai He and Tai Kun aren't coming out to stop him clearly shows they also want to see if Tian Sha can really do it."</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming pondered and said, "But Father, after all, Lord Xiao Yao is the leader of the Seven Heroes of Tai Cang. If we kill him..."</p><p></p><p>"Who said anything about killing him?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie chuckled and said, "How could Xiao Yao be so easily killed? If he really encounters a crisis, how could Tai He, Tai Miao, and Tai Kun just stand by? After all, no matter what, that bastard Xiao Yao is, in a sense, the disciple of Senior Tai Cang!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming suddenly understood, then worriedly asked, "Father, what if Tian Sha wants to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie said meaningfully, "Xiao Yao is hailed as the number one of the second generation of Tai Cang's heaven and earth. Although Tian Sha hasn't been called the number one of the third generation, he's close. The contest between the second and third generations may concern the authority of heaven and earth. What does their battle have to do with us? I, Ao Lie, only need to vent my anger and gain some heavenly authority in passing, nothing more."</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming suddenly realized that the true dragon clan only needed to seek an explanation. As for the struggle between Lord Xiao Yao and Tian Sha, the outcome didn't matter to them.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Realm, Tian Sha walked silently, arriving at the Jade Yao Realm, silently gazing at it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Yao Realm shook slightly, rules fluctuated, and streams of rule power surged forth, transforming into a graceful figure.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Sha?!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Yao looked at Tian Sha with a solemn gaze. At this moment, she felt intense pressure from Tian Sha.</p><p></p><p>"A realm without a lord of heaven and earth cannot resist the Immortal Palace. Does Realm Lord Jade Yao understand?" </p><p></p><p>Tian Sha said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"You're far from becoming the lord of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Yao sneered.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha said nothing and turned to leave. Jade Yao frowned, the power of rules gradually receding, and the Jade Yao Realm sank back into silence.</p><p></p><p>"It's time!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha's eyes were cold. No one could stop him from becoming the lord of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Since you know that the sneak attack back then was related to me, there's no need to hide anything anymore. Let's see how you help Xiao Yao!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha strode towards the Shadow Realm. It was time to take action.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Tian Sha jerked his head up to look beyond heaven and earth, his form flickering and instantly disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile in the Dao Realm, realm lords appeared one after another, emerging beyond heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng looked towards where the Netherworld Realm was located, revealing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha uttered four words!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts sank. The Immortal Palace had actually started to move.</p><p></p><p>"What are the Witch-Demon Realm people trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Luo Realm Lord looked at the Dao rules extending from the Witch-Demon Realm, which were pulling the Witch-Demon Realm closer.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, Dun Wu, Ba Mo, are you trying to start a war?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng's aura surged as he said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiang Feng..."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's seductive voice came through. Some weaker realm lords hurriedly suppressed their thoughts and averted their gazes, afraid of being affected.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng snorted coldly, "Put away your charm, it doesn't work on me, Jiang Feng!"</p><p></p><p>"So fierce!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Immortal Palace has already made its move. If we don't join forces, how long can the Tai Cang Realm hold out? At this moment, if we continue to fight amongst ourselves, no one will have a good outcome!"</p><p></p><p>Ba Mo spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"You from the Tai Cang Realm cannot borrow the Dao rules of our realm. Even if you enter the Tai Cang Realm, your help would be limited. You should continue to use the Witch-Demon Realm as your base and cooperate with our Tai Cang Realm. There's no need to enter our Tai Cang!"</p><p></p><p>Another realm lord spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you from Tai Cang being so heartless? We are at least lords of small realms. We may not be able to deal with the lord of heaven and earth, but we can handle the small realm lords of the Immortal Palace. The Netherworld Realm probably can't be saved anymore. If we from the Witch-Demon Realm are defeated, how long can your Tai Cang hold out?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu put away her seductive demeanor and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, violent tremors came from the Netherworld Realm, and a blood-red light shone on the Immortal Land.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions changed drastically. This was the Dao rules of the Netherworld Realm being fully activated, almost to the point of self-destructing the realm to perish together with the enemy!</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light bloomed, as if a sun had appeared on the chaotic Immortal Land. Even from afar, the group of powerful beings could feel the terrifying power erupting from the Netherworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought the Netherworld Realm would completely explode in the next moment, the blood-red light actually began to contract, as if it was being absorbed and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring realms?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha's gaze focused, and everyone's hearts sank.</p><p></p><p>Could the one who made a move be that person from the Immortal Palace? Otherwise, how could they possess such terrifying power?</p><p></p><p>Only that person could possibly have the power to devour realms! Although the Tai Cang Realm was not in ruins, how long could it hold out?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, everyone's mood became heavy, and a strong sense of crisis enveloped their minds. Even Tian Sha began to reconsider and adjust his plans against Xiao Yao.</p><p></p><p>After all, the real crisis came from beyond heaven and earth. If they couldn't overcome it, everything would be for naught!</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's devouring realms, it takes time to digest. In the short term, it's impossible to devour a second realm. We shouldn't encounter him in the near future."</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie looked at Tian Sha and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha took a deep breath, his gaze deep as he said, "Everyone, now that the crisis has come, the realm cannot be without a master for a day. I, Tian Sha, am confident that I have some ability to control most of the authority of heaven and earth. I hope everyone can work together to face this crisis!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

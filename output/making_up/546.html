        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's the Hongze World!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The desolate world was dark and empty, with an aura of death permeating it. Looking from afar, it was just a vast expanse of darkness that even obscured the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, there may be some unexpected changes in the Hongze World," Jiang Buping said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, be careful, especially watch out for the powerful experts from the Immortal Palace," the Ancient Sea Turtle nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship slowed down and activated its concealment formation, silently approaching that patch of darkness.</p><p></p><p>As they got closer, they could gradually make out the outline of an enormous world.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the Great Wilderness which stood like a bright pearl amidst the primordial chaos, this world was gray and lifeless, even more devoid of vitality and desolate than the mountains formed from dead True Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes glowed as he silently observed the distant world, probing for any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping did the same.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship slowed down even more, occasionally hiding in small mountains along the way to temporarily avoid detection, then slowly approaching again. The closer they got to the Hongze World, the stronger the sense of desolation and bleakness became.</p><p></p><p>There were no Immortal True Spirits in this area.</p><p></p><p>It seemed even the Immortal True Spirits were unwilling to approach this lifeless world, unable to bear its desolation.</p><p></p><p>"This lifeless world seems to have an ominous aura amidst its bleakness," Xu Yan murmured.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's voice trembled slightly, "Should we still approach? After all, there's never been a lifeless world before. We don't know what changes might occur in a world after it dies. What if there really is something inauspicious?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, if you're scared, just wait for us here. The world is already dead, so what's there to fear even if it's inauspicious? The more unknown, the more worth exploring!" Meng Chong patted the Ancient Sea Turtle's head.</p><p></p><p>"A little fear is normal, just overcome it!" the Ancient Sea Turtle said with an awkward smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then stop shaking. If we're attacked, I doubt you'll be able to respond, let alone control the flying ship!" Fang Hao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm shaking from excitement, not fear!" the Ancient Sea Turtle insisted stubbornly.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, keep being excited then." Fang Hao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>As the flying ship got closer to the Hongze World, the sense of desolation and bleakness washed over them like a tide. It was as if a dark aura enveloped the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three fellow disciples silently gazed at the world before them, looking at the uneven ground devoid of any signs of life, without a single plant growing.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an ominous aura permeated the entire world.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Hongze World was a large mountain. This mountain did not seem to be formed from a dead True Spirit, but rather appeared to be a mountain from within the Hongze World that had broken off and now accompanied it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stop briefly on that mountain!" Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The lifeless world seemed to be shrouded in an ominous aura. Moreover, the people from the Immortal Palace were also searching for the Hongze World, so they couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already observed that mountain. It also appeared desolate, but there were no potential dangers or signs of Immortal Palace experts lying in ambush.</p><p></p><p>"O-okay!" The Ancient Sea Turtle's voice shook even more, his control of the flying ship's formation disk trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him. This turtle had clearly been traumatized in the past. Even after countless years, he still couldn't control his trembling when approaching the Hongze World.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why the Ancient Sea Turtle had given up on the potential opportunities in the Hongze World.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because the Ancient Sea Turtle was too afraid. The Hongze World had become a source of fear for him. Unable to control his fear, even the greatest opportunity would turn into disaster.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship slowly approached the mountain. As they got closer, Xu Yan and the others continued to focus their attention on the Hongze World ahead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous boom rang out. The Ancient Sea Turtle, who was controlling the flying ship, was so startled that he instantly retracted into his shell with a whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The Ancient Sea Turtle fell onto the flying ship. In an instant, he seemed to lose all signs of life, turning into an ordinary dead turtle - just an empty shell! The formation disk of the flying ship also fell.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others: ...</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao picked up the formation disk and looked at the Ancient Sea Turtle, who was using his turtle breath technique to play dead. He was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This turtle was really too cowardly!</p><p></p><p>"What was that sound just now?" Meng Chong scratched his head in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be a battle!" Xu Yan's expression was solemn. That thunderous sound had come from extremely far away, yet it still reached them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, just from the rumbling sound, they could tell it must be an extremely powerful battle. The combatants must be at the level of World Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be two True Spirits fighting?" Jiang Buping asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Battles breaking out between True Spirits wasn't uncommon.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another sound came, this time continuous, as if from some powerful offensive techniques clashing.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't sound like True Spirits fighting," Xu Yan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>True Spirit battles were always accompanied by roars, but apart from the rumbling of combat, there were no roars to be heard.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the sounds, it seemed more like a battle between powerful experts using mighty secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, stop playing dead and come out!" Xu Yan kicked the turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, a head finally emerged from the shell.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" The Ancient Sea Turtle's eyes darted around, looking ready to retract into his shell again at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"There are powerful beings fighting in the Immortal Realm!" Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>By now, the flying ship had landed on the large mountain, with its body embedded into the mountain to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful beings fighting?" The Ancient Sea Turtle was puzzled. After listening for a while to the gradually weakening sounds coming from extremely far away, he finally emerged completely from his shell, returning to his normal form.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, that was a survival technique. You all reacted too slowly. In the Immortal Realm, as soon as you sense any unusual changes, the first thing to do is hide yourself and conceal your aura. This is all experience!" The Ancient Sea Turtle said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't be bothered to argue. This turtle was not only cowardly, but refused to admit it, always finding excuses.</p><p></p><p>"Alright Old Turtle, we understand. But listen to those sounds - it's clearly powerful beings fighting, and they must be at the World Lord level. Besides the Immortal Palace and the former Seven World Lords, are there other World Lord level experts in the Immortal Realm?" Xu Yan patted the Ancient Sea Turtle's head as he asked.</p><p></p><p>Getting to the important matters, the Ancient Sea Turtle also became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from World Lord level Immortal True Spirits,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Among cultivators, there were only the original seven Lords of Heaven and Earth, and some powerful figures from the Immutable Temple. Besides them, no other Lord-level powerhouses had ever been heard of!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sounds of battle in the distance had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Did we mishear? Could it be true spirits at the Lord level fighting?" the Ancient Sea Turtle asked doubtfully. </p><p></p><p>After all, among known cultivators, besides the seven Heavens and Earths, only the Immutable Temple had Lords of Heaven and Earth left.</p><p></p><p>However, of the seven Lords, only Purgatory was known to remain, but he had already joined the Immutable Temple.</p><p></p><p>So only the Immutable Temple should have Lord-level powerhouses left.</p><p></p><p>"Battles between true spirits would be accompanied by roars. The true spirits of the Immutable Land may have great power, but they are unintelligent beasts. The sounds we just heard were from some kind of attack technique exploding. Definitely not true spirits!" Xu Yan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Just then, another violent sound rang out. The noise grew more and more intense, as if the battle had entered a white-hot stage, with increasingly powerful attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle swallowed and said in shock: "What's going on? It really is Lord-level powerhouses fighting. Could Purgatory have turned against the Immutable Temple's forces?"</p><p></p><p>The first one he thought of was Purgatory, since he was the only known survivor among the seven Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Purgatory already joined the Immutable Temple. For him to betray them again? Unlikely. Does he not fear that one from the Immutable Temple?" Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>There must have been a reason for Purgatory to join the Immutable Temple. And that one from the Immutable Temple was so powerful, Purgatory was no match. Since he chose to surrender rather than fight to the death back then, how could he betray the Immutable Temple now and seek his own doom?</p><p></p><p>Unless Purgatory was confident he could contend with that one.</p><p></p><p>But clearly, Purgatory couldn't possibly have that level of strength.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle said excitedly: "Could there be infighting within the Immutable Temple? If so, that would be great!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Hao couldn't help stroking his chin and saying: "Could it be the Blood Demon? Weren't Senior Sister and Tianzi plotting against the Blood Demon? Did Blood Extreme succeed in replacing him? But was exposed as a result, leading to this battle?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head and smiled: "Even if Blood Extreme could succeed, it wouldn't happen so quickly. And if he did succeed, according to plan, the chances of Blood Extreme being exposed would be low. He would continue to lurk in the Immutable Temple under the guise of the Blood Demon. Besides, if he really was exposed, how could Blood Extreme hold out in battle for so long?"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded. They could basically rule out the possibility of Blood Extreme.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the Blood Demon was replaced and exposed, that one from the Immutable Temple would personally take action. There's no way the battle could last this long.</p><p></p><p>The distant battle continued, with sounds intermittently transmitted. As time went on, the fighting grew increasingly fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that the seven Lords of Heaven and Earth didn't all die?" Xu Yan said pensively after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"You mean...?" The Ancient Sea Turtle was startled, but then shook his head. "Unless they joined the Immutable Temple, how could they survive? Even Taicang died!"</p><p></p><p>Even someone as strong as Taicang had died. Purgatory survived because he joined the Immutable Temple, and there must have been other reasons for the Immutable Temple to accept him.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, they likely never had that chance.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had joined the Immutable Temple, they wouldn't be able to betray it now and spark this battle.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps a force besides the Immutable Temple has appeared in the Immutable Land. This could be a battle between them and the Immutable Temple's powerhouses. The Taicang Heaven and Earth was able to exist for so long, likely because the Immutable Temple had an enemy appear and couldn't spare attention to target Taicang," Meng Chong speculated, rubbing his head.</p><p></p><p>"That's possible!" The Ancient Sea Turtle's eyes lit up when he heard this, and he nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>This would explain it. The Immutable Temple needed to deal with a great enemy, so they had no spare energy to invade the Taicang Heaven and Earth, allowing it to survive until now.</p><p></p><p>This possibility was high. After all, the Immutable Temple had appeared suddenly long after the seven Heavens and Earths were established.</p><p></p><p>The Immutable Land was boundless - surely the Immutable Temple wasn't the only power there! The seven Heavens and Earths could be seen as new powers in the Immutable Land, while the Immutable Temple was an ancient power. Because of the special nature of the seven Heavens and Earths, they targeted and invaded them.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. The Immutable Land is vast and boundless, with many unknowns. And does the Immutable Land even have borders? What lies beyond the Immutable Land?" Xu Yan's face showed a thirst for knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a powerful rumble transmitted. They could even faintly sense the violent spiritual energy of the Immutable Land sweeping over the mountains like a breeze in the wake of the rumble.</p><p></p><p>Ah! After the rumble came a scream of agony, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The victor had been decided. One side had fallen!</p><p></p><p>"Hide well. If they were fighting over the Hongze Heaven and Earth, the victor is likely rushing back now," Xu Yan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Ancient Sea Turtle immediately shrank into his shell, using his turtle breath technique to play dead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three also concealed their auras. The flying ship burrowed deep into the mountains, using them as cover to hide.</p><p></p><p>Far from the Hongze Heaven and Earth, the Witch Demon panted heavily, his eyes glowing with a cold, bloodthirsty crimson light.</p><p></p><p>His claws were buried in someone's body. The person was now lifeless, their flesh withering away.</p><p></p><p>All their essence was being devoured by the Witch Demon.</p><p></p><p>"You, a false Lord of Heaven and Earth, thought you could hunt me? If I, the Witch Demon, wasn't still injured, I could kill three of your kind!" The Witch Demon snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"But thanks to the essence of your flesh, I can recover faster. Let's see how many false Lords your Immutable Temple sends to hunt me!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Demon's gaze was cold and fierce.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many true Lord-level powerhouses in the Immutable Temple. Most so-called Lords were actually false Lords of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Though stronger than minor Lords, their personal laws were weaker than true Lords.</p><p></p><p>"To struggle so much just to kill one false Lord, how hateful!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Demon tossed aside the withered corpse and looked out at the vast, hazy land. His gaze gradually grew determined.</p><p></p><p>"The boundless, hazy land stretches endlessly. I want to see if your Immutable Temple can keep hunting me forever. As long as I don't die, I'll return one day to kill you all. I, the Witch Demon, have only lost to one person in my life. That old monster from the Immutable Temple doesn't qualify - he just relies on having cultivated for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Demon thought coldly to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I can't linger here. If a Lord from the Immutable Temple comes, I'm no match in my current injured state!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Demon took a step and instantly vanished, disappearing into the vast, hazy land. Only the aftershocks of battle continued to ripple through the area, taking a long time to subside.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan retreated further and further away, distancing themselves from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at the battlefield, their expressions were extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, can Xu Yan win?" Hu Shan asked with some concern.</p><p></p><p>The two Grand Masters were truly formidable, and their combined might could stir up a cataclysmic storm. </p><p></p><p>"Since Xu Yan is not retreating, he must be confident in his chances," Xie Lingfeng replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he was somewhat worried in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Just who are these black-robed individuals? To be able to deploy two Grand Masters, their strength must be extraordinary, with a peak Grand Master leading them," Hu Shan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"They are from one of the hidden powers. Among the hidden powers, there are not many with such strength," Xie Lingfeng's gaze was grave.</p><p></p><p>In the vast inner realm, besides the prominent factions, there existed certain hidden powers. These hidden powers operated discreetly, engaging in unsavory activities, and never revealed their faction names to the outside world. </p><p></p><p>While their existence was known, their names could not be ascertained, hence they were referred to as hidden powers. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the hidden powers varied in strength. Not all of them were completely unknown - even some major powers could not determine the names of the most formidable hidden powers.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed individuals belonged to one such hidden power.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, the towering waves grew more and more violent, and the dazzling sword lights struck out like a raging storm.</p><p></p><p>Viewed from afar, the battlefield resembled a cataclysmic scene!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan activated his innate true qi, unleashing it freely. A faint spiritual glow even began to emanate from him, revealing the powerful might of the Dragon Soaring Across the Rivers and Mountains Spiritual Bone.</p><p></p><p>The surging spiritual energy from heaven and earth continuously replenished his depleted true qi, and Xu Yan grew more and more valiant, his aura becoming increasingly formidable.</p><p></p><p>As he fought, he also gained insights into the terrifying might of the two black-robed individuals, whose powerful presence stirred the spiritual energies of heaven and earth, exerting a world-shattering pressure.</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed individuals grew increasingly alarmed, determined to kill this youth, for he posed a grave threat to them. Their crescent moon swords unleashed ever more vicious sword qi, until their auras finally merged, signifying the execution of a joint technique.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a massive crescent moon sword light appeared in the sky, continuously pouring down, as if it spanned half the heavens, sealing off all directions.</p><p></p><p>The sword light ravaged the area, evaporating the towering waves. It was as if the entire space had been enveloped in a sword light purgatory! Xu Yan's gaze sharpened - their merged auras had instantly boosted their power, and they had sealed off all directions to prevent his escape.</p><p></p><p>He scoffed inwardly. If he wished to flee, how could they possibly hope to contain him? Boom! In that instant, Xu Yan's aura surged violently, his sword intent vast and majestic, his ruthless killing intent rampaging across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers manifested, counter-sealing the surroundings to prevent the black-robed individuals from escaping.</p><p></p><p>With a slap of his left palm, a golden dragon roared, its dazzling eyes brimming with the mighty dragon will and an aura of fury, which even seemed to calm the towering waves of the Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The golden dragon charged towards one of the black-robed individuals, its powerful presence continuously shattering the sword lights.</p><p></p><p>However, the black-robed individuals were extremely formidable. As they wielded their crescent moon swords, the golden dragon was destroyed before it could even approach.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Xu Yan unleashed palm strike after palm strike with his Descending Dragon Palm, his unparalleled might gradually breaking through their layers of sword lights, pushing forward step by step.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was unleashing his full strength - his left hand wielding the Descending Dragon Palm, his right hand the Sword Dao of Mountains and Rivers, slashing out sword after sword.</p><p></p><p>Facing two opponents, he stubbornly maintained the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had turned the tables, sealing off all directions to block the black-robed individuals' escape routes.</p><p></p><p>One sword descended.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The dragon's cry resounded, the mountains and rivers enveloping the black-robed individual, as if trying to pull him into the depths of the mountains and rivers, burying him completely.</p><p></p><p>Another sword slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of the Myriad Phenomena of Mountains and Rivers! The sword light surged, the sword intent rippling as the dragon's cry of the mountains and rivers and the Myriad Phenomena of Mountains and Rivers instantly overlapped.</p><p></p><p>Sword after sword followed, completely suppressing the black-robed individuals.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of the mountains and rivers grew increasingly powerful, the killing intent permeating the heavens and earth, as if the entire world had been imbued with a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>At this stage of the battle, the black-robed individuals' expressions had drastically changed. They could acutely sense the grave danger they were in, their situation now extremely perilous.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan unleashed another palm strike, and the massive golden dragon charged towards the other black-robed individual. Just as the latter was about to strike the dragon, it suddenly split into eighteen golden dragons, which came crashing in from all directions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan's sword descended, the dragon's cry of the mountains and rivers merging with the Myriad Phenomena of Mountains and Rivers, pulling the black-robed individual into the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, the Sword Deity Xu Yan, have slain Grand Masters on the Cangjiang Island. Any who dare to covet the Cangjiang Island shall be killed without mercy!" Xu Yan's voice thundered across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The observing martial artists were all stunned, having witnessed the slaying of two Grand Masters. Just how powerful was the Sword Deity Xu Yan? Could he be a peak Grand Master?</p><p></p><p>"As for the hidden power behind the scenes, if you wish to seek revenge, feel free to come. I, the Sword Deity, will be waiting. But remember to bring enough spirit stones, for paupers are not worthy of dying by my hand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's cold voice rang out once more.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present drew a sharp breath. This was a direct declaration of war against a major power!</p><p></p><p>A power capable of deploying two Grand Masters must be a top-tier faction, with a peak Grand Master at its helm. Was Xu Yan truly capable of single-handedly suppressing such a formidable power?</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed individuals now felt a terrifying sense of life-and-death crisis. Suddenly, their auras underwent a drastic change. An ominous chill permeated the air, as if their crescent moon swords were coated in a layer of frost, and the surrounding temperature plummeted.</p><p></p><p>This ominous aura carried a deathly presence.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that they were prepared to fight to the bitter end, unleashing a powerful martial arts secret technique. The cost of this technique was evidently immense, but in the face of life and death, such a price no longer mattered.</p><p></p><p>"A martial arts secret technique? Hmph!" Xu Yan sneered contemptuously, and his sword descended. It was as if the myriad phenomena of the world had been extinguished, the mountains and rivers annihilated, the collapsing mountains and rivers enveloping the ominous aura, absorbing it into the power of the mountains and rivers' extinction.</p><p></p><p>As the mountains and rivers were extinguished, the ominous aura was transformed into the power of the mountains and rivers' annihilation.</p><p></p><p>"No! What is this...?" The black-robed individual's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this, so bizarre and powerful? His body began to crumble, disintegrating into ashes along with the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>One black-robed individual was slain by the sword, while the Descending Dragon Palm erupted with the most yang and unyielding might, as if the fury of the divine dragon, causing even the heavens and earth to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The ominous aura of the martial arts secret technique unleashed by the other black-robed individual...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had encountered his nemesis. Under the power of the Descending Dragon Palm, he was crushed like paper, unable to withstand even a single blow! "How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe exploded, and under the terrifying dragon might, he was reduced to ashes and dispersed! The heavens and earth returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The Cangjiang River was as it had always been, the storm that had threatened to destroy the heavens and earth had dissipated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only one person remained, holding a sword, standing proudly in midair. The spectators were all silent at this moment!</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a name was deeply etched: Sword Saint Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>The young man wielding the sword, outside of Canglang Island, had slain two great Grandmaster cultivators! "Among the geniuses of the world, there is none who can rival Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan alone has suppressed all the geniuses of the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>"It can be foreseen that in the near future, Xu Yan will be the number one cultivator of the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster cultivators watching the battle exclaimed with deep emotion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, though young in age, had already slain great Grandmaster cultivators. It would not be long before he could slay peak Grandmaster cultivators as well.</p><p></p><p>He was a true, peerless genius that no one could match!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were greatly shocked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength had completely exceeded their imagination. He was only at the Innate Realm, yet he had defeated two great Grandmaster cultivators single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>This was the true terror of the Dao of Martial Arts?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed inwardly. He was known as the Sword Sovereign Cliff, the strongest genius in a thousand years, but compared to Xu Yan, the gap was truly vast.</p><p></p><p>What comforted him was that among the geniuses of the inner domain, he was still the most outstanding, and he still had the qualifications and confidence to look down on the other geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng no longer dared to hope that he could catch up to Xu Yan's pace. He was self-aware, and his greatest wish in life was to attain sword enlightenment and truly enter the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, this battle has truly made your name resound throughout the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng approached and said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, he had already been shocked by Xu Yan's feat of shattering Yin Hong with a single palm.</p><p></p><p>Now, outside of Canglang Island, to have defeated two great Grandmaster cultivators single-handedly, the deterrence was far greater than shattering Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yin Hong was only a weak entry-level Grandmaster, while the great Grandmaster cultivators were much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful great Grandmaster cultivators, although they had heard of Xu Yan's feat of shattering Yin Hong, did not take it seriously, thinking that Xu Yan had used some kind of temporary enhancement technique to defeat Yin Hong, and that they could do the same if they exerted their full strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yin Hong was a weak Grandmaster, and his true strength was not widely known.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan defeating two great Grandmaster cultivators single-handedly had immediately raised his deterrence to a new level. Even peak Grandmaster cultivators would have to be cautious now.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a reputation, nothing worth mentioning," Xu Yan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>The three continued towards Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>"The great Grandmaster cultivators are indeed very powerful. They were able to fight me for such a long time, and their might was truly terrifying. The peak Grandmaster cultivators must be even stronger," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had previously underestimated the great Grandmaster cultivators, and even more so the peak Grandmaster cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The great Grandmaster cultivators were already able to manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, almost using it for their own purposes. As for the peak Grandmaster cultivators, had they already attained the initial ability to enhance their combat power by controlling some of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>They were not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reckoned that with his current strength, he would not be able to defeat a peak Grandmaster cultivator. However, a peak Grandmaster cultivator would also be unable to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"Once I break through the Innate Realm to its peak, I can even kill the peak Grandmaster cultivators," Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The three arrived on Canglang Island, and the buildings and other things were all intact.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hurried to Yin Hong's residence and found that the secret room had been opened, as expected.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while, he finally found a hidden room. </p><p></p><p>Opening the hidden room, he found a pile of spirit stones and several jade boxes, each containing seven-grade spirit herbs. </p><p></p><p>There were a total of eleven seven-grade spirit herbs, but not a single six-grade spirit herb, as six-grade spirit herbs were still relatively scarce in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan quickly counted them - less than 100,000 spirit stones, and only about 30 spirit herbs in total, including the eleven seven-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>What relieved Xu Yan was that there was a box containing spirit tickets worth several hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>However, there was not a single storage token deposited in the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This hidden room, though well-concealed and requiring Grandmaster-level strength to open, had been intentionally left behind. Those who had taken away the things from Canglang Island were afraid of angering Xu Yan by taking everything.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Hong is quite poor," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder who his patron is, whether they are wealthy or not. Will they come to seek revenge?" Xu Yan was somewhat looking forward to Yin Hong's patron coming to seek revenge. </p><p></p><p>If someone powerful enough to be Yin Hong's patron came, they would likely be very wealthy. If they came for revenge, perhaps Xu Yan could make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. Based on the current situation, it seemed Yin Hong's patron had no intention of seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Take everything except the spirit stones," Xu Yan placed the spirit herbs and spirit tickets into the box that Du Yuying had gifted him, to be taken back when he returned to the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"Xie, you and Hu Shan find a place to stay for now. I have some insights to ponder on Canglang Island for a few days," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, are you not afraid of the man in black robe, who is a peak Grandmaster cultivator?" Xie Lingfeng reminded.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, let him come if he dares. He cannot harm me," Xu Yan said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan and I will try our best not to disturb Brother Xu's contemplation," Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, Xu Yan went to a small mountain peak on Canglang Island, sitting cross-legged under an ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>He was going to ponder the Dao of Penetrating the Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>His battle with the two great Grandmaster cultivators had given him more insights, and he was now just a step away from fully comprehending the Dao of Penetrating the Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of Penetrating the Mysteries is about transforming true qi into true essence, and then harmonizing the true essence with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, to comprehend the profound mysteries of the heavens and earth, and begin to touch upon the mighty powers of the universe.</p><p></p><p>I have already grasped the subtleties of true qi, and how to refine it into true essence. As for harmonizing with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were closed as the insights his master had imparted about the Dao of Penetrating the Mysteries emerged clearly in his mind. </p><p></p><p>Gradually, the cultivation method of Penetrating the Mysteries connected with the Innate Realm, and how to break through to the Realm of Penetrating the Mysteries, as well as the specifics of its cultivation, all became crystal clear to him.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 111 Above the Great Grandmaster?</p><p></p><p>Shi Er swallowed a blood-refining pill and began to cultivate, feeling his qi and blood strengthening, and he became very excited.</p><p></p><p>Medicinal pills, truly are precious treasures that assist cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One pill is equivalent to his bitter cultivation for half a month.</p><p></p><p>"Although medicinal pills are easy to refine and have no impurities left, they cannot be taken in excess, or it will cause the realm to be unstable."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er thought about it and put away the remaining pills.</p><p></p><p>"I have already entered the door, I should also learn some saber techniques. The Master only teaches the Dao, and I cannot learn or comprehend it. I'll wait for Meng Chong to return and have him teach me.</p><p></p><p>"Or I can learn the inner domain techniques as well."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Shi Er looked at the time, it was time to cook. It's been a few days, he should make some chicken soup, the Master likes this.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he went out, he saw Meng Chong returning, bare-chested, with a wound on his chest and blood stains all over his body. He was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, what happened to you?"</p><p></p><p>This looked like he had experienced a brutal battle, especially the wound on his chest. If it was a little deeper, it would have been life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Meng Chong's physical body was extremely powerful. Even he, as a martial artist, could not break through his defense, let alone ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"Just a minor injury, no big deal."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong panted as he walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, how did you get injured?" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was shocked and hurriedly ran over.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, don't move, I'll treat your injury."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying brought over a chair for Meng Chong to sit on.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly walked over, and Meng Chong respectfully called out.</p><p></p><p>"Treat the wound first, then we'll talk."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and sat back down.</p><p></p><p>Watching Su Ling Xiu apply medicine to Meng Chong, he said, "Suturing the wound, it will heal quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was stunned and looked at her master. "Like sewing clothes?"</p><p></p><p>"More or less."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked at the wound on Meng Chong's chest, thinking. But what can be used to suture it? Needles and thread?</p><p></p><p>"Sister, do you think this is a spiritual herb?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong now lifted the silver-colored small grass wrapped in cloth that his treasured saber had picked.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Water Spirit Grass, it's a spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>She thought of the material to suture the wound. She took out a stalk of Water Spirit Grass, rubbed it between her fingers, and several fine grass fibers came out.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, let me help you suture the wound."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu took a needle and threaded it with the Water Spirit Grass fibers, wanting to suture Meng Chong's wound, but the needle couldn't even pierce through.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she tried to stab it down, the needle bent.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's muscles twitched a few times. "Sister, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu tried to stab the needle down again, and although it was difficult, like stabbing into leather, she was finally able to suture the wound together.</p><p></p><p>After carefully stitching the wound, Meng Chong also controlled his muscles to prevent the wound from bursting open.</p><p></p><p>Then, Su Ling Xiu applied medicine made from the Water Spirit Grass to the wound, and the blood stains on Meng Chong's body began to fade.</p><p></p><p>In a day or two, there wouldn't be a trace left.</p><p></p><p>"So Master suddenly left because he discovered that Second Senior Brother was in danger?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought to herself. This would make sense as to why the Master suddenly left.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, where did you get this Water Spirit Grass? There are no spiritual herbs in the Borderlands, did you go to the Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Only the Inner Realm had spiritual herbs. Meng Chong's injuries, could it be that he had a fierce battle in the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>"It was in the capital city of the Wu Kingdom. I encountered a person who was once a respected elder in the Wu Kingdom's jianghu, but for some reason, he has become incredibly powerful. I feel like he is no longer the same person..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>The situation with Elder Wu was very strange.</p><p></p><p>He also recalled the worm on Elder Wu's brow, perhaps it was related to this mysterious worm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze turned to him. "Tell us the details of what happened."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong recounted the entire course of events and the battle process in detail, without omitting anything.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem was why Elder Wu had become so powerful. Moreover, the opponent seemed to be a powerful practitioner of the demonic sect, with a cultivation method extremely similar to, but more refined and fierce than, the Blood Heartless.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained calm, but he was inwardly shocked.</p><p></p><p>All the signs indicated that Elder Wu had been possessed, but why would the possessor want to possess a centenarian elder?</p><p></p><p>And where was Elder Wu possessed?</p><p></p><p>Judging from the current situation in the Wu Kingdom's jianghu, it was highly likely that he was possessed while entering the boundless great mountains to seek out a powerful cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And that worm was probably the host of the possession!</p><p></p><p>"A Great Grandmaster does not possess the ability to possess others. The opponent's strength has surpassed the Great Grandmaster, and if the judgment is correct, the opponent's remaining soul should be residing in that worm.</p><p></p><p>"That worm is also extraordinary, as it is the foundation of the possession.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Great Grandmaster, there are indeed even stronger ones. But why is the Great Grandmaster the pinnacle in the Inner Realm? Could it be that there are some restrictions on the cultivators above the Great Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong described the perilous battle, especially at the end when he could have taken the opportunity to pursue and kill the opponent, but a powerful pressure suddenly appeared, making him feel as if he was trapped in mud, his movements sluggish, allowing the opponent to escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that pressure was a bit like a Great Grandmaster, yet different, similar to the Dao of the Saber and the Dao of the Sword, but also different in its own way.</p><p></p><p>"It was very unique and powerful. I feel that the opponent was in a weakened state, otherwise, I would not have been able to kill him."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said with relief.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and Zhou Ying were shocked, exchanging glances, their hearts extremely unsettled.</p><p></p><p>There are even stronger cultivators above the Great Grandmaster?</p><p></p><p>What realm is that?</p><p></p><p>Including Shi Er, the four of them looked at Li Xuan, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not know what realm was above the Great Grandmaster, but he suddenly had an inspiration about the realm beyond the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>His expression remained calm as he said, "It was just a possession, just a remaining soul. Extinguishing it is enough."</p><p></p><p>"Possession?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others murmured.</p><p></p><p>The Master was indifferent, clearly not taking the mysterious strong cultivator's strength seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what about that worm?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Just a body for the remaining soul to reside in."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally would not explain in detail, but he had guessed the purpose of the worm.</p><p></p><p>Standing up and walking in front of Meng Chong, he said, "Although this battle was perilous, you have also awakened your Saber Spirit and comprehended the Dao of the Saber, which is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, he said in a deep voice, "Above the Great Grandmaster, there are naturally even stronger ones. Just as I've always told you, the martial dao is boundless, and the limits of the martial dao that you have seen and heard are merely the ignorance of the weak."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You must be humble and modest, diligently cultivate, the path of martial arts is long and arduous, you all have just started."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu respectfully bowed and said, "Yes, Master, we will diligently cultivate, be humble and modest!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "You should heal your injuries well, the Dao of the Blade, all the blade techniques, are effortless for you. When you have time, teach them to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>"Deeply comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body, break through it soon."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's expression was solemn, there was an excited look in her eyes. Above the Grand Masters, there were likely even stronger experts targeting her hidden enemies.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even entered the path yet, even if I break through the Innate Realm, I won't be able to deal with those people, nor can I bury them. I must work hard to cultivate, I must comprehend the Dao of Alchemy.</p><p></p><p>"I must comprehend more alchemy formulas, refine more medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>"With medicinal pills in hand, countless martial artists will serve me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was very clear about the value that alchemy and martial arts brought.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, I want to use these Spirit Grass to refine medicinal pills, you're about to break through too, let me ponder and refine a batch of cultivation-enhancing medicinal pills for you?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Spirit Grass, Su Ling Xiu spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you can take them as you please, but I don't need the medicinal pills for my breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, these are spiritual herbs, the medicinal pills refined from them have excellent effects."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu narrowed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That's still an external force, occasionally supplementing is fine, but in the end one must rely on oneself. Realm that is hollow will hinder one's true strength. After I break through, I'll try the medicinal pills again, Shidi, you can take them as you need."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not reject medicinal pills, he just knew that if one relied solely on medicinal pills to improve, the realm would be hollow and the true strength would not match the realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Shi Er, Meng Chong knew that Shi Er's realm was hollow.</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you, Second Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was delighted as she took the Spirit Grass and left.</p><p></p><p>She returned to her room, recalling the Alchemy Classics, and began to compose alchemy formulas.</p><p></p><p>"Only the Spirit Grass is the monarch herb, the rest are minister herbs like Nine-Leaf Primordial Agaric, Mountain Ginseng... This is a new Tempering Bone Elixir, it shouldn't be called the Evergreen Elixir, this is the one I refined for Tempering the Evergreen Bone."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu quickly concocted an alchemy formula.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Elixir, to assist her in breaking through the Golden Bone Shackle and step into the Evergreen Bone, refining the Evergreen Bone.</p><p></p><p>"If there were Spirit Crystals to assist, the effect would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought.</p><p></p><p>"This formula shall be called the Nourishing Elixir, for Second Senior Brother's cultivation; this formula shall be called the Condensing Qi Elixir, for the First Senior Brother's Innate Realm cultivation, it can restore the consumed true qi."</p><p></p><p>New alchemy formulas emerged in Su Ling Xiu's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Healing and injury-treating medicinal pills also need to be prepared, in case of injury, one can take the medicinal pills..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu pondered, continuing to extract formulas from the Alchemy Classics, and then independently compose new formulas based on alchemy theories.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough formulas for now, I should spend time, using the Alchemy Classics as a foundation, continue to comprehend new formulas, new Alchemy Classics, and compose higher-level alchemy formulas."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's eyes were bright, she already had a direction for comprehending the Alchemy Classics.</p><p></p><p>"But there's no rush for now, the current Alchemy Classics are sufficient for use. When my martial arts have entered the path, I'll carefully organize the gains, integrate and master them, and must have some harvest."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu excitedly took the Spirit Grass and began to prepare for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, instruct Kou Ruozhi to purchase more medicinal materials."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll instruct him right away."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began to refine the medicinal pills, while Meng Chong had already left the courtyard and come to the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged, the precious sword resting on his knees, he carefully contemplated himself, while also comprehending the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with Blood Spirit Ancestor, he had gained much.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Sword Soul awakened, that tyrannical and domineering sword intent was now deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>That sword had the aura of tyrannically dominating the world.</p><p></p><p>"I have nurtured the sword for a long time, only when I draw the sword does it have such tyrannical power. But now when I strike with the sword, I no longer have such terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"So that sword intent's power is related to my sword nurturing."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Nurturing the sword requires consuming qi and blood, consuming mental focus, and cannot be accomplished in a short time. But once nurtured, the power of a single sword strike is not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong calculated in his heart, if he divided his mental focus to nurture the sword, would it slow down his own cultivation?</p><p></p><p>"Consuming time just to nurture a single sword strike, is it really worth it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong contemplated.</p><p></p><p>"First I'll comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body, after breaking through the Great Sun Golden Body, I'll consider it again, or I can ask the Master."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gathered his mind and continued to silently comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>He had already awakened his Sword Soul, whether he needed to nurture the sword, he did not know.</p><p></p><p>If he nurtured the sword again, and the first strike still possessed the power that exceeded his own realm's limits, it would also be an unknown.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had originally nurtured the sword in order to awaken the Sword Soul.</p><p></p><p>And the moment the sword was struck, it was also the moment the Sword Soul awakened, the terrifying power was related to the Sword Soul awakening.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, pondering. Meng Chong's recent encounter with danger made him realize that although he did not fear Grand Masters, the experts above Grand Masters could still pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Were there such experts in the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>The Magic Sect expert who had usurped Elder Wu's body, what was their true strength, and how did they appear in the Borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"Chased and escaped with only a wisp of soul? The spiritual mechanism of the Borderlands had already been destroyed, how did that half-dead person survive? Relying on that worm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt he should investigate the Borderlands, in case another half-dead person like that appeared and threatened his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Or even threatened him.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the alchemy-refining Su Ling Xiu, this girl might have some serious trouble behind her, if there were experts above Grand Masters, it would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"When can Xu Yan comprehend the Profound Realm cultivation method? As long as he comprehends the Profound Realm cultivation method, when I break through the Profound Realm, even experts above Grand Masters, I won't be inferior!"</p><p></p><p>With a hundred times the strength of peers in the same realm, and with his Sword Intent mastered, Dragon Soaring Across the River Spirit Body, Innate Spirit Bone... With these enhancements, breaking through realm barriers to slay enemies would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan should also go wander in the Inner Realm soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Inner Realm, broadening his horizons, would help Xu Yan deeply comprehend the Dao of Martial Arts!</p><p></p><p>"I should go wander in the Boundless Great Mountains."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought, and his figure directly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu turned back, the Master had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you going to take revenge for Second Senior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>She guessed.</p><p></p><p>In the Boundless Great Mountains, Li Xuan was walking in the air, overlooking the four directions, searching for any place that might be hiding martial artists.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern River Commandery, the Xu Family Mansion.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous bone-shaking sound came, followed by Panacea Elder's joyful voice.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've entered the realm! This is the Blood Realm, truly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Xu Yan had a somewhat disdainful expression on his face, Panacea Elder was too weak.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was greatly amazed, this medicinal pill was truly a treasure for martial artists to cultivate, the effect was so astonishing, with the medicinal pill's assistance, Panacea Elder had quickly completed the Refining of the Viscera and broken through to the Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

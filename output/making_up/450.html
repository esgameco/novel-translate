        <h1>Chapter 450</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of people gathered together, enthusiastically discussing the affairs of the Wanbao Alliance - how many immortal lords had pursued someone but failed to catch them, and not only that, but one of their branch locations had even been looted opportunistically, among other things.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was unaware of all this, as she had been in secluded cultivation and generally didn't pay much attention to matters in the divine realm. </p><p></p><p>She listened for a while and roughly understood what had happened. </p><p></p><p>Essentially, the person being pursued had initially been framed for killing the disciple of the Changxun Realm Alliance leader, which then triggered a series of conflicts. The Wanbao Alliance had lost face and naturally refused to let the matter rest. Moreover, the pursued person's faction had never come to negotiate with the Wanbao Alliance to resolve the misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>This led the Wanbao Alliance to conclude that the other party was likely an unaffiliated cultivator who had coincidentally obtained a powerful legacy, giving them such strength.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun found it boring and was about to leave when she heard someone exclaim admiringly: "Meng Chong the Divine God is truly a prodigy - the first person to remain unscathed under pursuit by the Wanbao Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong?! Zi Yun was suddenly overjoyed. The person pursued by the Wanbao Alliance was Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what does this Meng Chong you mentioned look like? Why is he so formidable?" Zi Yun suppressed her excitement and asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Although the person pursued by the Wanbao Alliance was undoubtedly the Meng Chong she knew - after all, there couldn't be a second person as incredibly talented named Meng Chong who was completely unafraid of the Wanbao Alliance - Zi Yun still couldn't help wanting to confirm again.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that this Meng Chong is bald with a muscular build. He's cultivated some unknown but extremely powerful technique that allows him to become like a giant, appearing divine, hence his title..."</p><p></p><p>The martial artist from Dongyang Martial Academy began describing enthusiastically, his eyes filled with admiration. </p><p></p><p>What martial artist doesn't aspire to become powerful?</p><p></p><p>"It really is Meng Chong!" Zi Yun was elated.</p><p></p><p>"My Meng Chong has only been in the divine realm for how long? Not even 30 years, and he's already famous throughout the realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun felt a surge of pride. </p><p></p><p>Her judgment had indeed been exceptional - the man she was in love with was incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The group continued discussing Meng Chong enthusiastically. After a while, another female martial artist spoke up with an adoring expression: "Meng Chong may be strong, but he's not unrivaled. There's another who is handsome and elegant, with swordsmanship that reigns supreme in the world..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun knew immediately who this senior sister was referring to.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Xu Yan! It could be no one else but Senior Brother Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the group began discussing Xu Yan - the one who had slain the immortal lord Tianshadiying, who had single-handedly cut through a celestial rift with just his sword, killing all the experts comparable to immortal lords within, including one who was on par with a top-tier immortal lord.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was no longer bored and joined in the discussion, mostly inquiring about information on Meng Chong. However, towards the end, she became puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What about Su Lingxiu? Why hadn't her fame spread? On second thought, Su Lingxiu preferred peace and quiet, wasn't showy, and always stayed by her senior's side. Given how vast the divine realm was, it wasn't surprising that her name hadn't spread.</p><p></p><p>But what about Fang Hao? Why was there no mention of his fame either?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Fang Hao also dislikes showing off?"</p><p></p><p>Though puzzled, she didn't dwell on it much. Zi Yun's thoughts were entirely focused on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>After the group dispersed, Zi Yun returned to her residence. She was itching to go find Meng Chong but realized her current strength was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong will come find me, right? It's been so many years."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun sat by the window, resting her chin on her hand and staring blankly at the distant horizon, no longer in the mood to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a major realm - the spiritual energy is more abundant, and the natural energy is relatively more active. The immortal lords of major realms are slightly stronger, and their legacies are more powerful."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed as he entered the Great Yan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where Zi Yun is."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head. The Great Yan Realm was so vast, finding one person would likely not be easy.</p><p></p><p>"It should be relatively easy to inquire about where the prodigies from the Spirit Realm have been settled. I'll ask the local governor of the Great Yan Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Now with great strength and confidence, Meng Chong decided to directly seek out the local governor to inquire. </p><p></p><p>Although the Great Yan Dynasty was very powerful, Meng Chong didn't take it too seriously. If it really came to blows, while he might have difficulty cutting through the entire Great Yan Dynasty alone, he would have little trouble slaying several dozen immortal lords.</p><p></p><p>The head of a prefecture in the Great Yan Dynasty would certainly be an immortal lord, and one ranked among the strong within that realm.</p><p></p><p>Biannanjun was a border prefecture of the Great Yan Dynasty, bordering the wilderness. Governor Du Yuan had presided over Biannanjun for over a thousand years. His strength was at the late stage of the immortal realm, not far from perfection.</p><p></p><p>As the head of a prefecture, besides having to prevent the celestial rifts in Biannan from going out of control and needing to suppress them, he also had to prevent any unrest from occurring in Biannan.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, with the situation in the divine realm in turmoil and Tianshadiying stirring up trouble everywhere, even the Great Yan Dynasty had seen the emergence of some rebels, with Tianshadiying's shadow behind them.</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Yan Dynasty was at its peak, with strong power and numerous experts. Therefore, there was only some minor chaos, which could not shake the Great Yan Dynasty in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Bordering the wilderness, Biannan naturally had to be vigilant and guard against powerful figures crossing over from the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>However, the wilderness was desolate. Even with people assigned to watch, it was impossible to have 100% control over those crossing the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>If a True King Celestial Lord entered, it wouldn't cause much impact. But if an immortal lord crossed the wilderness, unless they remained hidden and never took action, even the slightest movement would expose their traces.</p><p></p><p>Once exposed, if they hadn't entered the Great Yan Realm through the proper gates, they would have to explain their purpose for coming to the Great Yan Realm.</p><p></p><p>They would either be expelled or - die!</p><p></p><p>With the current turbulent situation, the Great Yan Dynasty showed no mercy in this regard, and they had the strength to back it up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Biannan governor's mansion, Du Yuan was looking at a new piece of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>This was information that had just been transmitted and had not yet spread widely.</p><p></p><p>"Sixteen immortal lords from the Wanbao Alliance pursued Meng Chong and have since vanished without a trace?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan was shocked upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen immortal lords - even for the powerful Wanbao Alliance, this was a devastating loss.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, among these sixteen immortal lords was a powerful late-stage immortal realm expert leading them.</p><p></p><p>"Were they killed by Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance's pursuit of Meng Chong had been causing an uproar throughout the divine realm for several years now.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had been constantly evading, and his methods of evasion were quite miraculous. He could conceal and suppress his own aura, making it difficult even for immortal lords to track him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a powerful figure behind Meng Chong took action?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan pondered, unwilling to believe this was Meng Chong's doing alone.</p><p></p><p>Even if Meng Chong had broken through to the immortal realm during the pursuit, how could he single-handedly slay sixteen immortal lords?</p><p></p><p>One of them was even at the late stage of the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the experts of the Wanbao Alliance's treasure protection team were all skilled in joint attack techniques. When they joined forces, even the most top-tier immortal lords could only flee.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without the power to kill sixteen Immortal Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"After investigating the final whereabouts of the sixteen powerful experts, the Treasure Alliance discovered traces of a great battle at the edge of the wilderness. Based on the remnants of the battle, it was done by Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>After reading to the end, Du Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>It was truly Meng Chong who single-handedly killed sixteen Immortal Celestial Venerables. What terrifying strength this was. Could he already be comparable to experts above the Immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>"Based on some intelligence, the martial arts Meng Chong practices are extremely special and powerful. This is likely related to his powerful martial arts techniques." Du Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"How will the Treasure Alliance respond? Will they back down and negotiate with Meng Chong, or will they be unable to swallow this anger and request the descent of supreme experts?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>"My Great Yan royal family also seems to be one of the behind-the-scenes founders of the Treasure Alliance. Will they also participate in the action?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>The forces behind the Treasure Alliance are quite complex, with several great realms involved. Otherwise, the Treasure Alliance would not be able to become the number one merchant alliance in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the degree of involvement of the great realms differs. Although the Great Yan royal family is also involved, they don't seem to be too deeply involved in the Treasure Alliance. In this pursuit and assassination of Meng Chong, there was no news of the royal family dispatching Immortal Celestial Venerables to participate.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it's best not to provoke this Meng Chong if possible. Otherwise, it will surely bring huge losses to Great Yan."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Great Yan is strong, all signs indicate that Meng Chong's ability to escape is extraordinary. The Treasure Alliance used so many methods but still couldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>And this last great battle was clearly after Meng Chong's breakthrough. He deliberately lured the Treasure Alliance's experts to come, in order to kill them all in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>Such a fierce person - whichever force provokes him will suffer huge losses, and may even face the danger of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan walked out of the study and stood in the garden of the prefectural governor's mansion. He looked up at the sky and said, "Is this world truly about to change?"</p><p></p><p>All signs indicate that some existences are not content with the current pattern of the world and want to make a change, or want to seek something from it.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Celestial Venerables seem high and mighty, as if they have lifespans equal to heaven and earth. But under the great trends of the world, they are also unable to control their own life and death."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, sixteen Immortal Celestial Venerables of the Treasure Alliance were killed like grasshoppers.</p><p></p><p>Never had there been a moment when Immortal Celestial Venerables seemed so weak!</p><p></p><p>"Are you the prefectural governor?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice sounded from behind!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan was shocked in his heart, his expression changed drastically. As his aura surged, he quickly turned around to look, holding a large seal in his palm.</p><p></p><p>This seal was glowing with light, illuminating the sky. This area of the prefectural governor's mansion instantly received reinforcement, and his strength was also enhanced at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This was the prefectural governor's seal, and also a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>It could enhance the seal holder's ability to control heaven and earth, and could also transmit messages to powerful experts in the prefecture. In times of crisis, it could even directly request aid. The seals of nearby prefectural governors would sense it and quickly come to assist.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the prefectural governor perished and the seal shattered, it would also imprint the appearance of the attacker. The central government of the Great Yan Dynasty would also sense it and quickly respond.</p><p></p><p>Each prefectural governor's seal was one of the cores of the Great Yan Dynasty's operation, and also one of the cores of the Great Yan Dynasty's control over the Great Yan realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Du Yuan immediately activated the prefectural governor's seal, but did not transmit any crisis message. After all, if the other party wanted to ambush him, they would have already made their move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was trembling.</p><p></p><p>As an Immortal Celestial Venerable, this was the first time someone had approached him without his knowledge!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? Could it be an expert above the Immortal realm?" Du Yuan thought in shock.</p><p></p><p>He turned around and immediately saw the person who spoke.</p><p></p><p>It was a muscular young man with a bald head that was reflecting light.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he saw this person, a name immediately appeared in Du Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Divine Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and looked at Du Yuan, who was on high alert with a face that had turned pale from fright. He smiled sheepishly and said apologetically, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was a bit abrupt and scared you!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan: ...</p><p></p><p>You really did scare me, but can you not say it so bluntly? I, Du, am after all the head of a prefecture and a dignified Immortal Celestial Venerable. I need to save face too!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong?" Du Yuan coughed dryly and asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan couldn't help but feel nervous inside. He thought back to whether he had ever offended Meng Chong. After confirming that he had never provoked the other party, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This person was truly fierce.</p><p></p><p>He put away the prefectural governor's seal, withdrew his aura, and revealed a smiling face. He said, "So it's Brother Meng. I've long admired your great name!"</p><p></p><p>"You're too kind, too kind!" Meng Chong cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Come, come, Brother Meng, please sit!" Du Yuan hurriedly entertained Meng Chong, sitting down in a pavilion in the garden.</p><p></p><p>He personally brewed a pot of spirit tea to serve.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, there's one thing I don't know if I should ask?" Du Yuan couldn't resist asking, feeling itchy inside.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to confirm whether the sixteen Immortal Celestial Venerables of the Treasure Alliance were indeed killed by Meng Chong alone.</p><p></p><p>"What is it? Feel free to ask." Meng Chong roughly guessed what the other party wanted to ask.</p><p></p><p>After killing more than a dozen Immortal Celestial Venerables of the Treasure Alliance, he had deliberately left some traces of the great battle. The purpose was naturally to tell the Treasure Alliance that he had killed them all himself, and they should consider carefully what to do next!</p><p></p><p>"It's like this. I happened to receive some news that sixteen Immortal Celestial Venerables of the Treasure Alliance were killed. I don't know if..." Du Yuan spoke somewhat cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"I killed them!" Meng Chong nodded, "This Treasure Alliance is relentless. It was clearly an incident caused by Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow, but they insisted on blaming me. They really think I have a good temper? Mere dozen or so Immortal Celestial Venerables dare to come and try to kill me? They must be tired of living!"</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuan swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his heart trembling. It was indeed this fierce Meng Chong who had killed them!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng's divine might is awe-inspiring, truly worthy of the name Divine!" Du Yuan said with a look of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It's all just empty fame, empty fame!" Meng Chong waved his hand, looking very modest.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, what instructions do you have for me in coming here?" Du Yuan's attitude was very humble.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a fierce person. He killed Immortal Celestial Venerables as if crushing chicks. He couldn't offend him.</p><p></p><p>What if, in a fit of anger, he casually crushed him to death? Wouldn't that be unfortunate?</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal. I came here to inquire about something..." Meng Chong came to find Du Yuan this time to inquire about where those martial artists who came from the Spirit Realm had gone. Once he had a direction, it would be much easier to investigate Zi Yun's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Directly inquiring about Zi Yun's whereabouts would easily attract the attention of the Treasure Alliance and implicate Zi Yun. Besides the Treasure Alliance, Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow would probably also secretly cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

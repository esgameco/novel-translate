            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 12: Fabricating Cultivation Techniques, Xu Yan Comprehends</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw his master beckoning him and was immediately filled with excitement, rushing over eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Master must have realized that I'm just one step away from the Golden Bone, and have encountered a bottleneck. He's going to point me towards breaking through the Golden Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Filled with excitement, he approached Li Xuan and respectfully greeted him, "Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you've maintained your enthusiasm and diligently cultivated, that's very good!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's excited expression, Li Xuan nodded, acknowledging his hard work in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he sighed, "People with not-so-sharp minds are just so stubborn. Even if they don't make much progress in cultivation, they still maintain their sincerity and diligence, which is truly rare!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, this disciple of mine is actually... quite good, it's just that I'm not that extraordinary of a master!"</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan was single-minded and not the brightest, his unwavering pursuit and persistence in cultivation were truly admirable.</p><p></p><p>"You've been cultivating for some time now, and have been practicing the Horse Stance for a while. Today, Master will pass down a more powerful technique to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke in a stern manner.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, convinced that his master had seen him reaching a bottleneck in the Golden Bone and was about to teach him a more powerful tempering technique.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said, stepping to the side and bending his knees, with one foot in front of the other in a slight squat. He raised one hand up and the other down, palm facing up and down respectively.</p><p></p><p>After assuming the stance, he looked at Xu Yan and said, "From now on, you'll practice this Horse Stance. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mimicked the stance, nodding, "Yes, Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned to a normal standing position, one hand behind his back, and said, "This is the basic stance. There are two cultivation phrases, ponder over them well. How much you comprehend depends on your karmic affinity."</p><p></p><p>Simply teaching a new stance would be too monotonous, so Li Xuan decided to fabricate some cultivation phrases as well.</p><p></p><p>He slowly spoke, "Remember these phrases well: 'Observe the heart, nurture the true essence, the qi and blood forge the golden body.' Ponder over them deeply. If you can comprehend the phrases, you'll be able to grasp their profound meanings."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Li Xuan leisurely turned and left, exuding the aura of a venerable master.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he was now completely immersed in the "cultivation phrases," murmuring them repeatedly, trying to derive some understanding from them.</p><p></p><p>"'Observe the heart, nurture the true essence, the qi and blood forge the golden body'... truly profound and extraordinary! I must delve deeply into these to comprehend them!"</p><p></p><p>"This must be the secret to tempering the Golden Bone and even the Jade Bone. If I can grasp the profound meaning within, I'll definitely be able to refine the Golden Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was completely lost in the cultivation phrases, repeating them over and over, hoping to gain some insight.</p><p></p><p>However, even as night fell, he still hadn't managed to comprehend anything.</p><p></p><p>"It's too profound! I already have a deep understanding and great insight into bone refinement, yet I still can't grasp the meaning of these phrases for now."</p><p></p><p>"As Master said, if I can comprehend the phrases, I'll be able to appreciate their profundity. Xu Yan, you can definitely do it! You can definitely comprehend the phrases and refine the Golden Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to encourage himself, his determination unwavering.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a day, and such profound phrases would naturally require three to five days of contemplation to gain any understanding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan was about to go to bed, he saw Xu Yan still standing there, muttering the fabricated cultivation phrases he had made up.</p><p></p><p>"This foolish disciple, has he gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope he doesn't end up with brain problems."</p><p></p><p>He then called out, "It's late, time to go back and sleep!"</p><p></p><p></div></p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came to his senses in a daze and hurriedly bowed in salute, saying, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Although his foolish disciple was a bit obsessed, he still listened to his master's words, so the problem was not too big.</p><p></p><p>If he really got stuck in a dead end, it would just take a bit of persuasion to guide him out.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan went back to his room to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and thought, "Enlightenment lies in timing and inspiration. Forcing it will only drive it further away. I almost got trapped in it and lost my mind."</p><p></p><p>"Luckily, the master pointed it out to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Rest, conserve my energy, and restore my mind. I'll continue tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"The formula is so profound, it's not something that can be grasped in a day or two. It should take about three to five days for me to comprehend it. My talent is not too bad!"</p><p></p><p>After realizing this, Xu Yan went to rest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's daily routine remained the same - cultivating, gardening, feeding chickens, raising rabbits, cooking, etc. There was no change in his schedule.</p><p></p><p>The only change was in his horse-riding stance.</p><p></p><p>And he was stuck at the stage of perfecting the copper bone, unable to progress further.</p><p></p><p>During his daily cultivation, he constantly contemplated the two "formulas", but still could not grasp their profound meaning.</p><p></p><p>Three days had passed, and he had gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't even comprehend these two formulas, how can I refine the golden bone? How can I enter the path?"</p><p></p><p>"This is just the formula for the foundational realm. The formulas after entering the path must be even more unfathomable. How can I continue my cultivation then?"</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, don't be hasty! The master always says not to be impatient, not to aim too high, but to be down-to-earth... I must have overlooked something."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmed his mind and let it settle.</p><p></p><p>"The master said, 'With no woman in the heart, cultivation is like having a deity.' This is a state of mind, the elimination of the biggest distraction in the heart..."</p><p></p><p>"As a young man, I'm easily attracted by women and distracted. The master used women as an analogy for the biggest distraction in cultivation. There must be a deep meaning in this, indicating that he is reminding me not to be entangled in distractions."</p><p></p><p>"What are my distractions?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to ponder deeply, extrapolating a series of profound meanings from the phrase "with no woman in the heart, cultivation is like having a deity."</p><p></p><p>If Li Xuan knew how Xu Yan could come up with such extensive interpretations, he would surely exclaim that this was not a case of a slow mind, but an extremely overactive imagination!</p><p></p><p>"My distraction... is cultivation itself. I'm obsessed with cultivation, but is this considered a distraction?"</p><p></p><p>"I've got it!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight suddenly appeared in Xu Yan's mind, and he had another realization.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is a quest, a belief, a will. But I've only been stuck in the attachment to it, turning it into a distraction!</p><p></p><p>"I should abandon the attachment to cultivation itself, and focus on the present, forgetting the external things and unnecessary perceptions... Becoming nothing, becoming no one, and immersing myself completely in the formulas to deeply comprehend them..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan felt like a window had opened in his mind, and a brilliant insight had emerged. The true meaning of the two formulas now seemed to be shrouded in a thin veil, and he only needed to gently poke through it to see the hidden truth.</p><p></p><p>"'Enlighten the heart, observe the self, and nurture the true intention.' Enlighten the heart is to clarify the mind, observe the self is to perceive the changes in one's qi and blood, and nurture the true intention is to nourish the qi and blood, refine the marrow, and elevate the essence..."</p><p></p><p>"I've comprehended it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes shone with excitement, his expression filled with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

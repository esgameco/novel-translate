        <h1>Chapter 300</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu waved her hand and said, "You don't owe me any favors. You have already paid the consultation fee, and treating you is what I should do since I accepted the fee."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li solemnly said, "Although the young lady has accepted the consultation fee, such a serious injury cannot be settled with just a small fee. I, Jiao Li, will remember this kindness in my heart. If you ever need anything, just let me know, and I will rush through fire and water without any hesitation!"</p><p></p><p>She had thought that she would become disabled, and even the divine powers of the heavens and earth would crumble, causing her to fall completely. But unexpectedly, she was now reborn.</p><p></p><p>"I am Jiao Li, one of the Grand Alliance's Protector Elders. May I ask the young lady's honorable name?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li solemnly clasped his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Elixir Immortal Lady Suling Xiu!" </p><p></p><p>The moon-like Yuer answered before Suling Xiu could speak.</p><p></p><p>"Elixir Immortal Lady, your reputation is well-deserved. I, Jiao Li, will remember it in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Turning to Cailingr, he excitedly said, "My injuries can all be healed, and your injuries will be no problem at all!"</p><p></p><p>Cailingr was also greatly excited, as her injuries could now be healed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I, Jiao Li, have recovered. Fan Kaishan is in Luozhou, I'll go find him for a battle."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was overjoyed, soaring into the sky and disappearing into the distance, impatient to show himself and shock the people of Leiyan Manor. In their eyes, the one they had considered a waste was now restored to his peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched Jiao Li leave excitedly, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple is really careless, there's still a small problem that hasn't been discovered."</p><p></p><p>It was truly just a small problem.</p><p></p><p>It was just that when Jiao Li glared with his eyes, his mouth would also open...</p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't glare with his eyes, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was now greatly excited, thinking that if his Shifu's such serious injuries could be healed, the other injured members of the Grand Alliance could also be cured.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Cailingr, could you consider my proposal?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was still not giving up.</p><p></p><p>"Well, healing the injuries is the priority right now."</p><p></p><p>Cailingr was trembling, this young lady was too frightening.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded, and healing Cailingr's injuries became much easier. After taking the medicinal pills she concocted, Cailingr's injuries would soon be completely healed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cailingr was shocked to discover that Suling Xiu's healing methods were truly extraordinary. The effects of the medicinal pills were so miraculous! Thinking of Suling Xiu's proposal, if she agreed, there would be various rewards.</p><p></p><p>"How about it, Sister Cailingr? As long as you agree, I can refine medicinal pills for you for free, of course you'll still need to provide some spiritual herbs. I can also formulate the medicinal pills you need for cultivation, like those that enhance the spirit. And if you get injured in the future, I can also treat you for free. These are all rewards, so you should seize the opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu offered generous rewards to attract Cailingr.</p><p></p><p>Yuer also helped persuade, "Sister Cailingr, the Sea Spirit Tribe doesn't just have you. If the conditions we offer spread to the Sea Spirit Tribe, there will definitely be powerful Sea Spirit cultivators who will compete to agree to it. </p><p></p><p>There's no loss at all, but great benefits instead."</p><p></p><p>Cailingr was tempted by their words. She could foresee that after Elixir Immortal Lady Suling Xiu's name spread, such generous rewards would surely have Sea Spirit cultivators rushing to agree.</p><p></p><p>Now, the opportunity was right in front of her. As long as she agreed, she could not only obtain rich rewards, but also establish a friendship with Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really going to be fine?" Cailingr still had some concerns.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there won't be any problems, and I won't let you suffer even the slightest bit of pain. Even if there's a small issue, my Shifu is here." Suling Xiu assured her while thumping her chest.</p><p></p><p>Cailingr looked at Li Xuan, a profoundly powerful expert, a terrifying existence. If his disciple was so formidable, he must be even more so.</p><p></p><p>"There won't be any scars, right?" Cailingr still had a hard time overcoming that mental barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!" Suling Xiu hurriedly promised, and then took out a medicinal pill, handing it to her: "This is a Reviving Pill. Even for a powerful cultivator like you, after sustaining heavy injuries, just taking one pill can restore you almost completely."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I agree!" Cailingr took the pill, gritting her teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!" Suling Xiu was overjoyed. She and Yuer supported Cailingr to lie on the bed, then quickly stuffed a medicinal pill into Cailingr's mouth, making her enter a dormant state, afraid she might change her mind.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng looked on enviously, thinking that Suling Xiu's conditions were too generous, so he couldn't help but speak up: "Miss Suling, how about me?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu glanced at him and shook her head, "Go away."</p><p></p><p>She and Yuer pushed the bed and excitedly entered the room, ready to study the body structure of the Sea Spirit Tribe and how it differs from the human race.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Cailingr to actually agree to let Suling Xiu dissect her. He had to keep an eye on this.</p><p></p><p>"I hope there won't be any problems, I'd better keep watch."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, then secretly observed the situation in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, are all Sea Spirit Tribe members this fair and flawless?"</p><p></p><p>"Completely unblemished, crystalline like jade, without a single hair... Is this just her, or are all Sea Spirit Tribe members like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu and Yuer were studying the differences in structure between the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race, afraid of any accidents. Li Xuan kept a watchful eye, ready to intervene immediately if any problems arose.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has gained a deep understanding of the differences between the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race, obtaining the True Understanding of the Sea Spirit Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Scriptures of the Golden Book provided this feedback.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, no one knows the Sea Spirit Tribe better than me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the True Understanding of the Sea Spirit Tribe, his knowledge of them even surpassed the Sea Spirit Tribe itself.</p><p></p><p>"This Cailingr is remarkable. Among the Sea Spirit Tribe, she belongs to the Flawless Sea Spirits, with immense potential, belonging to the Imperial Bloodline. But the current Sea Spirit Tribe seems unaware of this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled at this, that the concept of the Flawless Sea Spirits and the Imperial Bloodline still existed.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan now understood Cailingr's potential as a member of the Imperial Bloodline, he had no intention of teaching her the method to activate that bloodline. After all, she was not his disciple.</p><p></p><p>When Cailingr woke up, the first thing she did was check her body, and found nothing unusual, which made her breathe a sigh of relief. She even had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Cailingr, the Sea Spirit Tribe is truly special," Suling Xiu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really understand the body structure of my Sea Spirit Tribe? The differences from the human race, you know them all?" Cailingr asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This is not some secret, the differences between the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race have long been recorded in the scriptures of the Spiritual Realm," Cailingr shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Suling Xiu might think the classics were unreliable, so she decided to understand them herself.</p><p></p><p>"It's different."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu shook her head. The differences recorded in the classics of the Spirit Realm were not as deep as her understanding.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the room, Caili'er did not leave, but temporarily stayed in the manor. She was deeply curious about Suling Xiu's amazing medicinal skills.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li's injury had always been considered incurable, leaving him half-disabled and even on the verge of death, with no way to treat it.</p><p></p><p>Even the rarest spirit medicines could not restore him.</p><p></p><p>But with Suling Xiu, he recovered quickly and completely.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was also very satisfied. This research on the spirit and soul had given her some gains, and she had new ideas on how to refine pills that could enhance the spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>And the diagnosis fee was not low.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wanshi Alliance was an organization of scattered cultivators, Jiao Li was still an extremely powerful expert, so he was not poor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha, Fan Kaishan, come out and fight me!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li's injury had just healed, and although he had not yet reached his peak, he was eager to show off, letting the people of Leiyu Manor know that he had not become a waste. If his injury could be healed, the other injured members of the Wanshi Alliance could naturally recover as well.</p><p></p><p>So he immediately rushed to the Qingyu Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Li?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li, who had been judged as half-disabled after being severely injured by the Leiyu Manor's divine artifact, damaging his spirit and foundation, now appeared lively and energetic before him.</p><p></p><p>His aura had not yet fully recovered to its peak, but his injury had already healed.</p><p></p><p>It only took a few days of recuperation for him to completely recover to his peak.</p><p></p><p>"How is your injury possible to heal?" Fan Kaishan exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>In this great battle with the Wanshi Alliance, the Spiritual Sect also had powerful experts who were severely injured, even affecting their foundations. Even though they had deep reserves and many treasures, some of them were unable to recover.</p><p></p><p>If Jiao Li, who had suffered such heavy injuries, could heal, then the other injured members of the Wanshi Alliance must all be able to recover to their peak. Compared to this, the Spiritual Sect's losses seemed even greater.</p><p></p><p>This made Fan Kaishan feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha ha, didn't expect it, did you? I, Jiao Li, have recovered. Come, let's fight and see how much my strength has recovered."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was excited.</p><p></p><p>The two strands of heaven and earth spiritual energy had fused into one, and his strength should have increased. He wanted to test it.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiao Li struck immediately.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of you!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan swung his great hammer, and they began to fight fiercely.</p><p></p><p>After the fierce battle, Jiao Li became more and more excited, as his strength had indeed improved, with the ability to condense the power of heaven and earth faster and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan also realized this problem, and his expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"How did he recover?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan's gaze turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Is it related to the Chiming Sect ruins, the Changqing Pavilion? "</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fan Kaishan thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he had obtained the news that Jiao Li and that person from the Hailing Clan had come to Luozhou, and their destination seemed to be the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he judged that the Changqing Pavilion was established by the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Did you heal your injury at the Changqing Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"So what if I did?" Jiao Li sneered.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his recovery at the Changqing Pavilion could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, the Changqing Pavilion, huh? I'll definitely pay a visit."</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion is no place for you to act recklessly!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li sneered, glaring angrily, wanting to say something more, but suddenly felt a bit confused. Why did his mouth open when he glared his eyes?</p><p></p><p>I didn't mean to open my mouth!</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to say?" Fan Kaishan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li glared his eyes and opened his mouth wide, as if wanting to say something fierce, but he remained silent, feeling a bit puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's none of your business!" He punched a few times and turned to leave, not continuing the fight.</p><p></p><p>The moment he turned around, Jiao Li glared his eyes, but his mouth opened involuntarily, causing a slight collapse in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a sequela, a minor problem. As long as I rest for a while, it will naturally recover. There's no need to find Miss Su for treatment."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he couldn't glare his eyes, or else his mouth would open involuntarily, which would be a loss of dignity.</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan did not continue to attack, pondering for a moment, and then transmitted the news back to Leiyu Manor. If even Jiao Li's severe injury could be healed, the Changqing Pavilion could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Where did the Changqing Pavilion's miraculous healing method come from? Was it related to the Wanxing Martial Institute?</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan pondered for a while, and then had an idea, immediately summoning the Qingyu Emperor to make some arrangements.</p><p></p><p>In the Changqing Pavilion, Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu were all busy, preparing to treat and diagnose injured cultivators. Various medicinal pills were placed in the medicine cabinets according to their effects.</p><p></p><p>The diagnostic spirit tools were also ready. For ordinary injuries, a single medicinal pill would suffice. For more severe injuries or those with stronger cultivators, the diagnosis fee would be calculated differently.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few people in the Changqing Pavilion, so they also had to limit the number of patients they could see each day.</p><p></p><p>After all, the diagnosis was for the sake of cultivation, for the improvement of their medicinal and martial arts, and for gaining accumulation, not for neglecting their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, our Wanshi Alliance has some injured members, with quite severe injuries. Could you please help treat them?" Jiao Li returned and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, as long as there is a diagnosis fee." Suling Xiu nodded, adding, "Some injuries may require special-effect spirit medicines, and you'll need to prepare the spirit medicines yourselves. I can't guarantee that I have all the spirit medicines ready."</p><p></p><p>"When the patients arrive, I'll let you know if there are any shortages after I've examined them."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was delighted and nodded, "Of course, the diagnosis fee is not a problem, and we will provide the necessary spirit medicines for the treatment."</p><p></p><p>He then instructed Zhu Xingzheng to do a good job, waiting for Suling Xiu's instructions, and then rode the giant eagle and left.</p><p></p><p>As for Caili'er, she continued to stay in the manor, curious about everything, her eyes opened wide by all that she saw here.</p><p></p><p>"The medical expert of the Changqing Pavilion, can you treat my son's injury?" A burly man supported a sickly and weak young man, who seemed on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu glanced at them and frowned, "The attack was really brutal, completely ruining him."</p><p></p><p>The burly man's eyes were red with fury as he said, "The people of the Spiritual Sect are truly hateful!"</p><p></p><p>"Pay the diagnosis fee." Suling Xiu didn't want to say much, as the Spiritual Sect had injured him, and she was just letting them come to test her.</p><p></p><p>"Here it is!" The burly man took out a rare spirit medicine.</p><p></p><p>"Have him take this Reviving Pill."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu handed him a Reviving Pill.</p><p></p><p>The young man's strength was too weak, and even though he was ruined, a single Reviving Pill would be enough to completely restore him.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of Wushuang was also quite helpless. How could there be such a demonic prodigy? Even if she had acted at that time, the other party might have still escaped, with that mysterious body technique and lightning-fast speed, it would not have been easy for this Grand Master to catch up.</p><p></p><p>And once they became enemies, if the other party's strength broke through, it would be troublesome when they came seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were backed by the Sword Sovereign Cliff, with a powerful backer, and Xie Tianheng's strength could rank among the top five peak Grand Masters in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at his disciple and chuckled, "Good disciple, are you pining for your lover?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in white robes rolled her eyes and said, "No, the disciple is just thinking of the master and the Wushuang Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Lying through your teeth!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master of Wushuang chuckled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sovereign Cliff, known as the number one sword sect in the inner domain, the current Sword Lord Xie Tianheng, was extremely powerful, having once single-handedly slain three peak Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>A towering cliff rose into the clouds, and a long staircase led up the cliff face to the summit.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the cliff, buildings were densely packed, but the higher up the cliff, the sparser the buildings became.</p><p></p><p>This was the Sword Sovereign Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Near the top of the cliff, outside a certain residence, an ancient pine tree was planted. A young man sat cross-legged under the ancient pine, his aura surging, and sword light emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng exhaled, his face filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally refined my inner qi into true qi, increasing my strength by over 50%."</p><p></p><p>After returning from the remote wilderness, he had been cultivating the martial dao inner qi, refining it into true qi.</p><p></p><p>Now he had finally refined it into true qi, and with this refinement technique, he could be considered a pre-celestial realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Can I only be considered a pseudo-pre-celestial realm?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't be considered pseudo-pre-celestial either. After all, Brother Xu is too much of a prodigy, his true qi is far beyond what ordinary cultivators can compare to, so with my true qi, I can actually be considered a pre-celestial realm cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought about it and immediately cheered up.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased quite a bit. With my initial sect master realm, I can easily defeat advanced sect masters, and even peak sect masters would be no match for me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xie Lingfeng became excited.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the pre-celestial realm is roughly like this. I'll switch to cultivating the true martial dao, but what about the realms beyond the pre-celestial?"</p><p></p><p>"Just follow the normal progression and cultivate according to the techniques above the pre-celestial realm?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng suddenly became dejected.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any techniques!</p><p></p><p>The techniques of the Sword Sovereign Cliff were ultimately not true martial dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>"My sword dao hasn't even been mastered, I still haven't attained sword heart enlightenment, it's too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also thought about his sword dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of entering the sword dao required attaining sword heart enlightenment, but he had never reached that profound realm.</p><p></p><p>"My sword techniques have improved greatly, indicating that I've gotten closer to sword heart enlightenment, but I have no idea how to break through."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Lifting his head to look outside the Sword Sovereign Cliff, "I wonder if Brother Xu has come to the inner domain, I can ask him for guidance then."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Hu Shan came carrying two large boxes.</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the Du Mansion of the Great Yue Kingdom has sent people to deliver a generous gift, saying it's to thank you for your help."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan put down the boxes.</p><p></p><p>"Help?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was taken aback, when had he helped the Du Mansion?</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded, he was also puzzled, when had the young master helped the Du Mansion?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't remember.</p><p></p><p>"And the Du Mansion also said that whenever you're ready, you can come to propose, the Du family will always welcome you, and the Du Miss will surely not disappoint you!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan couldn't help but ask at the end, "Young Master, when did you become intimate with the Du Mansion's daughter? This is good news, although the Du Mansion's strength is not too strong, but I've heard that the Du Miss is one of the top geniuses at the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was completely dumbfounded, puzzled, "I don't know her, did she get the wrong person?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, how can that be? No one would mistake their beloved. "</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan handed the letter to Xie Lingfeng, "Young Master, this is the letter from the Du Mansion's daughter to you, take a look."</p><p></p><p>He had a look of eager curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took the letter blankly, opening it as he asked, "What's the name of the Du Mansion's daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"No, Young Master, how can you have forgotten her name? Don't tell me you've used her and abandoned her?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan stared wide-eyed, disbelievingly, "Young Master, you're that kind of person?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! I, Xie Lingfeng, am an upright and proper person, how could I do such things..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng glared angrily at Hu Shan, then looked down at the letter in his hand, becoming even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What "thanks for the escort, caring for me along the way"...</p><p></p><p>"Young Master's single palm strike defeated a sect master, repelled a half-step Grand Master, Young Master is unparalleled, among all the men in the world, none can compare to Young Master in the slightest..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng became more and more silent as he read, reaching up to touch his face, "Am I really so handsome and graceful? Unparalleled in the world?"</p><p></p><p>And what was this about defeating a sect master with a single palm strike, repelling a half-step Grand Master? When did that happen?</p><p></p><p>Was I dreaming? Something's not right! Hu Shan looked at the content of the letter with eager curiosity, "Young Master, I can see a young lady's deep affection for you!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also puzzled, "Young Master, when did you defeat a sect master? And with a single palm strike no less, do you have that kind of strength?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan almost simultaneously thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, is there a possibility that Brother Xu has come to the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>This kind of powerful strength to defeat a sect master with a single palm, he thought of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"But Xu Yan is Xu Yan, and you are you, they can't be mixed up, right?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"What if Brother Xu reported using my name?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, that's not right, although it was said that if anything happened in the inner domain, you could use my name, but it's impossible for him to say 'I am Xie Lingfeng'..."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly feeling that Xu Yan reporting as Xie Lingfeng was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's him or not, let's go to the Du Mansion. If it really is Brother Xu, that would be great."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded, going to the Du Mansion would make everything clear.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what about these generous gifts?"</p><p></p><p>Pointing to the two large boxes.</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep them for now, if it really is Brother Xu, we can hand them over to him then."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I'll go back and get ready, I'll follow you down the mountain right away."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, how much true qi have you refined?"</p><p></p><p>"Around 60-70%, my strength has increased quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan replied excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan left the Sword Sovereign Cliff and headed straight for the Du Mansion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The commotion at the Du Mansion had gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Five Great Warlord Princes of the Great Yue Kingdom, with the Marquis of Du being the strongest, the Marquis of Du is a peak Grand Master, holding a pivotal position in the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, the five great warlord princes' mansions all have conflicts with each other, and the root cause of these conflicts may be the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court secretly instigating them, to prevent the five great warlords from uniting.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the conflicts between the five great warlords are also related to their respective interests, and the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court is just seizing the opportunity to stir up trouble.</p><p></p><p>Among the three major countries in the inner domain, only the Great Yue Kingdom has the existence of warlord princes, and the reason for this is that when the Great Yue Kingdom was founded, the five great warlord princes were so powerful that unifying them would have resulted in significant damage.</p><p></p><p>And the five great warlords had initially joined forces, but they did not dare to openly break ties with the Great Yue Kingdom, so they reached an implicit understanding.</p><p></p><p>Nominally, the five great warlords were enfeoffed by the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court, and they accepted the rule of the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court, but in reality, the territories belonged to the five great warlords.</p><p></p><p>The five great warlords were originally five great families, firmly entrenched in their respective regions.</p><p></p><p>This incident involving the Marquis of Du's mansion is related to another warlord prince, the newly risen Grand Master of the Marquis of Zheng's mansion, who wanted to expand his influence and reached into the Marquis of Du's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the Du and Zheng factions had already reached an irreconcilable state, and when the Marquis of Zheng's mansion suddenly made a move, Madam Du, the mother of Du Yuying, had passed away with the wish to be buried in her hometown.</p><p></p><p>And Du Yuying, due to her unique physique, was also the prodigy of the Marquis of Du's mansion, the most beloved junior of the Marquis of Du, naturally becoming the target.</p><p></p><p>Although the Marquis of Du's mansion managed to contain the other side, this incident also involved the Demonic Sect, and it's unknown what benefits the Marquis of Zheng's mansion had promised them.</p><p></p><p>In the end, even Yin Hong, a Half-Step Grand Master, personally intervened, wanting to take Du Yuying away.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's purpose in intervening was different from that of the Marquis of Zheng's mansion and the Demonic Sect, but there was no doubt that he was also targeting the Marquis of Du's mansion.</p><p></p><p>It seems that several forces wanted to seize the opportunity to weaken the Marquis of Du's mansion.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the genius of Sword Saint Cliff, Xie Lingfeng, escorted Du Yuying back, killing several Grandmaster cultivators and even repelling the Half-Step Grand Master Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>The news spread, and the Marquis of Zheng's mansion withdrew, and the Demonic Sect also became silent. The powerful backer behind Yin Hong also retreated, not even revealing their identity.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Cliff is a top power in the inner domain, and not even the five great warlord princes' mansions or the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court would dare to provoke them rashly.</p><p></p><p>With the turmoil settled, the Marquis of Du's mansion also breathed a sigh of relief. This sudden attack by the Marquis of Zheng's mansion was well-prepared, and if the Marquis of Du's mansion had shown any weakness,</p><p></p><p>the other three warlord princes' mansions would have certainly taken the opportunity to undermine them and expand their own power.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court would also have secretly lent a hand to stir up the situation.</p><p></p><p>The powerful backer behind Yin Hong was most likely someone from the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court.</p><p></p><p>In the garden of the Marquis of Du's secondary mansion, Du Yuying was strolling leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the generous gift has been sent to Sword Saint Cliff and delivered to Young Master Xie. When do you think Young Master Xie will come to propose?" Cui'er asked with an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>"As the Miss's personal maid, if I marry Young Master Xie, I'll become a concubine, and Young Master Xie will also favor me..." Cui'er's face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>A gentle look flashed in Du Yuying's eyes as she softly replied, "He should not take too long."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, when can you break through to the Grandmaster realm? Then you and Young Master Xie can stand side by side as Grandmasters, which would be truly enviable," Cui'er asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, it could be as short as a year, or as long as five or six years..." Du Yuying shook her head. She was already at the Second Realm, but the distance to the Grandmaster realm was still far.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of Zheng is so vicious. It's a good thing Young Master Xie came to escort you, or it would have been dangerous, and those Demonic Sect fellows as well," Cui'er said indignantly, recalling the recent encounter on the way.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, do we have any news about which Demonic Patriarch's Grandmaster came to intervene?" Du Yuying asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"No news yet, it might have been one of the unknown Demonic Patriarchs," Cui'er shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a servant came to report, "Miss, Young Master Xie Lingfeng of Sword Saint Cliff has arrived at the gate."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Du Yuying's eyes lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, go welcome Young Master Xie in, I'll receive him at the Listening to the Rain Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying gently instructed, her eyes unable to conceal her delight.</p><p></p><p>However, she still maintained the proper decorum, letting Cui'er go to welcome him, as they were already quite familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss!" Cui'er exclaimed excitedly, her jade-like face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"Is Young Master Xie here to propose? If so, I'll become a concubine, and I can also..." Cui'er's mind wandered to the illusions she had experienced under the Thousand Illusion Demonic Master's influence, her face growing even redder.</p><p></p><p>As she hurried towards the gate, she asked, "Is Young Master Xie alone, or is he accompanied?"</p><p></p><p>"He is not alone, there is an older gentleman with him," the servant replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Young Master Xie must be here to propose then," Cui'er's heart raced, her face flushed with shyness as she approached the gate.</p><p></p><p>At the Marquis of Du's secondary mansion gate, the weary Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had arrived, wanting to find out if the person was indeed Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, if it is indeed Xu Yan, won't this involve Sword Saint Cliff in the affairs of the Marquis of Du's mansion?" Hu Shan asked, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"So what? Does Sword Saint Cliff fear the Great Yue Kingdom?" Xie Lingfeng said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, why did Xu Yan use your name? Shouldn't it be, 'I and Xie Lingfeng are sworn brothers, please give me a hand'?" Hu Shan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched as he sighed, "The thoughts of a genius are different from ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you said I could also use your name if I encountered any trouble in the inner domain. Could it be...?" Hu Shan suddenly became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Xu Yan won't use your name. He's still young, and you're already so old and weak, it wouldn't be appropriate," Xie Lingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan: ...</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, lamenting the misery of being weak.</p><p></p><p>A delicate-looking maid came running out, her gaze sweeping over Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, but ignoring them.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xie, where is he?" Cui'er asked anxiously, looking around.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady, I am Xie Lingfeng," Xie Lingfeng cupped his hands and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er turned to look at him, "You are Xie Lingfeng, the Young Master Xie from Sword Saint Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is I," Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er's entire demeanor changed, and she angrily shouted, "What imposter dares to impersonate Young Master Xie! Guards, come and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 265</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect is truly the number one sect in Jade State, with an astonishingly abundant collection of treasures.</p><p></p><p>Especially in that core treasure vault, there are several divine spirit herbs, including two specimens of the Earth Spirit Flower.</p><p></p><p>The number of spirit herbs below grade one are too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was completely stunned - formations, restrictions, talismans, and miraculous elixirs! </p><p></p><p>Are these the things of the Spirit Realm? Unheard of! He knew he had stumbled upon a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu is truly a true dragon, how wise was my initial decision!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sighed with deep emotion. If not for that wise decision back then, how could he have this chance today.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the elixirs, he believed he could soon break through to the Great Celestial Realm, and reaching the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm would no longer be out of reach! He had used up all the rewards he earned to exchange for elixirs, spirit tools forged by Fang Hao, as well as mist talismans and a small formation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu used the Earth Spirit Flower as the main material to refine a spirit intention elixir that could greatly enhance and assist cultivation. For those in the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm, the effects of this elixir were astounding. It could allow them to break through from the initial to the intermediate stage of Refining Spirit, greatly increasing their chances of breaking through to the advanced stage.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was overjoyed to obtain the elixirs. After taking one, he broke through to the Great Celestial Realm. The Red Cat was also excited, as it had also obtained the elixirs, which strengthened its demonic awareness and power. Its speed in painting formation patterns in its cave also improved. The next great demonic technique seemed to be close to completion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already seen the seventh page of the Taicangshu. The further in, the more profound and unfathomable the laws of heaven and earth became. He had already used this as a foundation to create stronger restrictions, heavenly and earthly formations, as well as some martial arts techniques. He had been passing these down to his disciples, letting them comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>After the disciples comprehended them, their understanding of the laws of heaven and earth deepened, making their own research easier. It also laid a foundation for them to apply the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the great perfection of the Spirit Intention Realm, and your own cultivation has reached the great perfection of the Spirit Origin Realm."</p><p></p><p>With the aid of the spirit intention elixir, Xu Yan broke through to the great perfection of the Spirit Intention Realm in just a few days. Li Xuan showed a look of delight. Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and Fang Hao had all made great breakthroughs, and were not far from their own.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Xu Yan or Meng Chong, the role of the elixirs was more to accumulate their own foundation, rather than to assist in cultivation and increase their power. Their thoughts were simple - the martial dao realm could not have the slightest bit of instability.</p><p></p><p>Even if they broke through with the aid of elixirs, they would still need to settle for a period of time to thoroughly consolidate their realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu, she did not have such concerns. However, since she cultivated the Elixir Martial Dao, the elixirs all transformed into a steady flow of vitality, so her realm's advancement was not significantly faster than Xu Yan and Meng Chong due to the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao mainly cultivated the Heavenly and Earthly Extraordinary Patterns. The elixirs only enhanced his physical body and spirit intention, and did not have a very obvious effect on the advancement of the Heavenly and Earthly Extraordinary Patterns.</p><p></p><p>As his comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth, especially the formations, restrictions, and extraordinary techniques created by Li Xuan, deepened, Fang Hao also made great progress in formations and the Heavenly and Earthly Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The four disciples all had huge breakthroughs due to their comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth. Xu Yan's sword dao became more and more complete, and his sword formations grew much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had great advancements in the Dao of the Sword and the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was extremely excited after obtaining the upgraded version of the Spring Night Mirror forged by Fang Hao. He would sneak around all day, afraid of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had obtained the elixirs and the Spring Night Mirror, Shen Haizhou planned to return to the Shen family. He had consulted Xu Yan, asking if he could take out some of the elixirs to give to his grandfather, claiming that he had encountered a powerful person who gifted him divine elixirs, without revealing the truth. Xu Yan had no objections, as the elixirs would eventually be known to the world, and even if it was known now, it would not pose any threat, as his master was invincible.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tai had been stuck in the peak of the Refining Spirit Realm for a long time, unable to break through the bottleneck. With the aid of the elixirs, his breakthrough was almost certain. The incident of the plundering of the Jade Divine Sect had caused an uproar in Jade State, with the major sects and families on high alert, conducting widespread searches for wandering cultivators. The Shen family only conducted a perfunctory investigation and then resumed normal operations, while Shen Tai had quietly entered seclusion to break through.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wan and Shen Haizhou were the only ones who knew about Shen Tai's breakthrough in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This Spring Night Mirror is truly a treasure!" Shen Wan exclaimed excitedly, his eyes shining with delight as he looked at the mirror in his hands.</p><p></p><p>As for the father and son of the Shen family indulging in the Spring Night Mirror, that is another matter.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, the atmosphere of cultivation had been restored. Su Lingxiu was refining elixirs every day, continuously enriching the Elixir Medical Classic with new elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Luo State, a young man with a cold and stern face, his brows like golden leaves, wielded a golden spear and fiercely struck down towards a Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although the young man with the spear was only at the peak of the Great Celestial Realm, he was not the least bit afraid of the Refining Spirit cultivator. A faint golden light flowed around him, neutralizing the spiritual pressure of the Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The powerful golden spear unleashed a formidable might, forcing the Refining Spirit cultivator to stagger back, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xintin!" the Refining Spirit cultivator roared, brandishing his great sword. A faint human-shaped ripple appeared on his forehead, indicating the pinnacle of his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xintin's gaze remained calm. The golden spear struck out, forming a golden storm that instantly engulfed the Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The battle intensified, the Refining Spirit cultivator clearly fighting for his life.</p><p></p><p>Amid the turbulent spiritual power, the sword light surged, and with a low roar, the cultivator's body was enveloped in a bloody glow as the sword light tore through the golden storm.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit cultivator transformed into a terrifying sword light that slashed through the air towards Lu Xintin. Boom! Lu Xintin's expression grew colder, and the golden light around him suddenly became dazzling, as if he was submerged in a sea of golden radiance. The spear thrust out, and with a crisp sound, the sword light shattered into fragments and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The spear pierced through the Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The chest of the cultivator was struck, and the large sword in the opponent's hand was shattered. His eyes were filled with anger and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xinting!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual cultivator's soul let out a roar, full of fury and resentment!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Lu Xinting snorted coldly, stirring the great spear, and the cultivator's physical body instantly shattered, with blood and flesh flying everywhere! The golden radiance on the great spear flashed and then surged towards the cultivator's soul!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The soul let out a miserable scream, but it did not disintegrate under the golden light. Instead, it tried to flee far away.</p><p></p><p>Having lost his physical body, with his current soul, although he could not last long, if he could inhabit another physical body, he could still linger for some time, and even pass down his martial dao, hoping for a chance to take revenge.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a scarlet beam of light swept down from the sky, instantly extinguishing his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, there has been progress!" </p><p></p><p>An elder appeared, with a satisfied expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, I feel I have not reached my limit yet, and I can continue to unleash the potential of my divine body."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then continue!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a spiritual swallow flew over and landed on the Second Elder's hand.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder took the envelope from the swallow's foot, opened it, and his brows furrowed slightly, revealing some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, is there any order from the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting asked.</p><p></p><p>"Jade State has produced a wandering cultivator genius, who calls himself the Sword Deity Xu Yan. He has slain a Refining Spirit Celestial and destroyed a second-rate aristocratic family, causing great losses to the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>"They have been unable to find him, so they have sought help from the sect, in the name of a clash of geniuses, to lure him out."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder flew the envelope in front of Lu Xinting.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting glanced at it and sneered, "A wandering cultivator genius? Hmph, he has only used some underhanded means to kill the Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Jade State has declined too much, the mighty Spiritual Sect and aristocratic families are actually bullied by a wandering cultivator without being able to do anything about it, which is really embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"But I also want to see, this self-proclaimed Sword Deity wandering cultivator, what kind of ability he has, whether he can withstand my spear!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder expressed his agreement, what kind of genius could a wandering cultivator have? This spiritual realm belongs to the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families. As long as there are outstanding talents, they are recruited into the sects at a young age, beyond the level of wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The chance of overlooking outstanding talents is very limited. Even if they were overlooked the first time, when the person displays enough talent, they will be recruited by the Spiritual Sects or aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>There is no genius who would refuse the recruitment of Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families, and those who dare to be arrogant have already died.</p><p></p><p>Even if there are still some overlooked, how many could there be?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, among the wandering cultivators, it cannot be said that there are no true geniuses, but they cannot be compared to the geniuses of the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation techniques, martial resources, and the tempering of geniuses, wandering cultivators are far inferior to the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Especially the top-tier Spiritual Sects, they already have a mature and efficient system for cultivating geniuses.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Demon Calamity, the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families have become even more ruthless in suppressing the wandering cultivators, and have further restricted the appearance of true geniuses among them, to avoid a repeat of the Blood Demon Calamity and the threat to the position of the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, kill the next wandering cultivator. After killing him, the potential of my divine body will be fully unleashed, and then I will set out to meet this Sword Deity Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I will let all the wandering cultivators in this world know, they will never dare to compete with the geniuses of the Spiritual Sects, they are not worthy!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting headed towards his next target with the great spear.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, a message spread throughout Luo State.</p><p></p><p>The true inheritor of the top-tier Spiritual Sect Crimson Darkness, with the peak Celestial realm cultivation, consecutively killed three Refining Spirit wandering cultivators, completely unleashing the potential of his divine Spiritual Body.</p><p></p><p>This laid a solid foundation for his breakthrough to the Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Luo State was shaken, and many wandering cultivators felt as if another huge mountain had been added on their heads! The true inheritor of Crimson Darkness, the divine Spiritual Body, renowned throughout Luo State!</p><p></p><p>And immediately, another message came, that the true inheritor of Crimson Darkness, Lu Xinting, would go to Jade State to initiate a clash of geniuses, challenging the renowned wandering cultivator genius of Jade State, the Sword Deity Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in Luo State, a group of people were furious.</p><p></p><p>Among the three Refining Spirit wandering cultivators killed by Lu Xinting, one was a Refining Spirit expert of the Luo State Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xinting, you are too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Although the words were like this, their gazes were extremely grave. The genius of the top-tier Spiritual Sect is truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"The divine Spiritual Body, one of the Ten Treasured Bodies, it is truly renowned. Its divine radiance can even resist the pressure of the spiritual soul, it is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>A Refining Spirit cultivator sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xinting is going to Jade State to challenge the wandering cultivator genius, when did Jade State produce such a genius? It's a pity that he encountered Lu Xinting, he is likely to die for sure."</p><p></p><p>The speaker turned to look at a young man and asked, "Wen Yong, you are from Jade State, do you know this Sword Deity Xu Yan? Speaking of which, you are also a genius in Jade State, how is your Celestial realm strength compared to Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong was shocked in his heart. Xu Yan had become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>The news had already spread throughout Luo State, that the Sword Deity Xu Yan in Jade State had destroyed a second-rate aristocratic family, the Dai Family, and slain a Refining Spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why Lu Xinting thinks he is worthy of fighting him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, ordinary wandering cultivator geniuses, he would not even bother with them!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, did you destroy the Dai Family for me? With the Dai Family gone, I can return to Jade State."</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong felt deeply moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I must return to Jade State, I must find Xu Yan and tell him about Lu Xinting's strength."</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"We wandering cultivators don't need to fight. Even if we win, the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families will not abide by the rules, they will surely intervene personally. Lu Xinting's protector, the Second Elder of Crimson Darkness, is at least a late-stage Celestial, or even at the peak of the Celestial realm!"</p><p></p><p>The others all nodded, agreeing with this view.</p><p></p><p>"Can the Millennium Alliance send an expert to protect Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Someone proposed.</p><p></p><p>"It's not appropriate. Our Millennium Alliance has not yet reached the time to emerge, we cannot expose ourselves easily. The experts of the Alliance all have important missions, they cannot leave easily."</p><p></p><p>A Refining Spirit cultivator shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Yong is right, we don't need to fight. We can hide, we wandering cultivators don't seek momentary valor, and the clash of geniuses has already lost its rules!"</p><p></p><p>An elder sneered and continued, "In the past, the Myriad Star Geniuses competed with the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families, and in the final battle, those shameless people directly intervened without any scruples, which was truly laughable!"</p><p></p><p>This was an elder Refining Spirit cultivator, rumored to have witnessed the past Blood Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Yong, go back to Jade State, find the one called Xu Yan, and stop him from fighting. When our Millennium Alliance emerges, let's see how the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families can still be so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The elder patted Wen Yong's shoulder and said.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to waste, I'll set out for Jade State right away!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong immediately set out on the journey back to Jade State.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 403</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers within the Divine Sword unfolded, vast and majestic, merging into the divine image. His form had already disappeared within the divine image, undetectable.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword intent surged forth, turning grass and trees into a torrent of sword energy, sweeping out mightily towards the two masked figures.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the Wisdom Sword realm was revealed in this moment. Each sword seemed to possess its own intelligence and swordsmanship. They coordinated with each other seamlessly, making the sword formation even more cohesive and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The two masked figures were ultimately peak True King Celestial Lord cultivators with formidable strength. As they attacked, waves of natural law energy rippled out, transforming into various strikes. They even directly employed secret techniques, attempting to break through the divine image's containment.</p><p></p><p>However, the two assassins felt their hearts sink as they found themselves unable to connect with the natural laws, blocked by some barrier. It was as if a more powerful and profound force that was more in tune with natural laws had seized control of the laws in this area.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial technique is this?!" The two were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat! Xu Yan is too strong, we're no match for him!"</p><p></p><p>The two assassins instantly made the decision to flee.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?" Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with his sword. A black sword light that seemed to extinguish heaven and earth slashed towards one of them. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, eighteen golden giant dragons roared as they converged from all directions to attack.</p><p></p><p>An even more violent sword intent like a fierce wind blew into their souls. The two assassins' expressions changed drastically as they hurriedly circulated techniques to protect their souls and resist the incoming gale.</p><p></p><p>"A soul-attacking technique!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Secret martial techniques that could attack the soul were extremely rare. Not all martial artists could master them, nor could all successfully cultivate them. Those who succeeded in cultivating soul-attacking techniques were without exception martial artists with exceptionally powerful souls, as such techniques ultimately relied on one's own soul power. And such martial artists were invariably top-tier existences at their level.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan used the mountains and rivers within his sword to trap one of them, directing all his attacks at the other. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to capture one alive to interrogate and find out their background and which force they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>Death squads, when faced with mortal danger, would typically self-destruct to avoid revealing their affiliated forces and mission objectives. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan needed to use the Heaven's Will Mind-Fixing technique to control the opponent before they could self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>But these two were peak True King Celestial Lord cultivators. Their souls had to be weakened or injured first before the Heaven's Will Mind-Fixing divine ability could restrain them.</p><p></p><p>"I can only capture one!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood he only had the chance to capture one alive. Once the situation turned unfavorable, the other would immediately self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Capturing even one would achieve his goal.</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord being pressured by Xu Yan's attacks suddenly changed expression, seeming to realize Xu Yan's intentions. With an angry roar, his aura suddenly surged as a phantom emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>This phantom emanated a cold aura.</p><p></p><p>As the cold phantom appeared, the True King Celestial Lord's aura weakened somewhat, clearly paying a significant price to use this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The cold phantom suddenly exploded, merging a chilling force with the earth. In an instant, the ground seemed to be overturned.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A heavy and cold force gushed out from underground, its powerful energy breaking through the containment of the divine image.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" The True King who had used the secret technique shouted, his form moving to flee.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know this was exactly the opportunity Xu Yan was waiting for!</p><p></p><p>Hum! An eye formed of swirling light appeared on Xu Yan's brow. As it opened, a majestic aura poured forth, shining upon the True King Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Minor Heavenly Dao Eye!</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord who was about to escape suddenly felt as if he was facing the august majesty of heaven, as if everything was being seen through. His form paused at this moment. Having used the secret technique and with his aura weakened, he was even less able to resist the gaze of this eye.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Xu Yan wants to capture me alive!"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord's heart sank as he realized Xu Yan's intention. At this point he was unable to successfully escape.</p><p></p><p>He was about to self-destruct, but under the gaze of that eye he became sluggish, unable to even self-destruct in time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A violent gale raged in his soul, churning it. The intense soul pain further prevented him from self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>He watched helplessly as Xu Yan's palm pressed down, seemingly containing the will of heaven and supreme intent within.</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord realized the danger but had no time to mount any defense!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was cold as he seized the opportunity to weaken the opponent's soul consciousness, then used Heaven's Will Mind-Fixing to restrain their soul and consciousness, completely controlling them.</p><p></p><p>The entire process took less than a breath to complete.</p><p></p><p>The other assassin had taken the chance to break out of the containment, but his eyes widened in shock. Not daring to linger for even a moment, he fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>He had to relay the latest information about Xu Yan back to Tiansha Diying to formulate a new plan to deal with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?" Xu Yan sneered, taking a step and vanishing from his spot. In the next moment, sword light surged forth and mountains and rivers descended, enveloping the fleeing assassin.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!" The assassin growled, his aura instantly vanishing as his soul was extinguished in that moment, all signs of life gone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan's gaze was cold. The assassins from this mysterious force were truly decisive. Once they realized escape was impossible, they didn't hesitate for even a moment before self-destructing!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had clearly cultivated some secret self-destruction technique that allowed them to extinguish their souls in an instant, leaving not even a trace of residual consciousness to prevent others from gleaning any information.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword light struck down, turning the corpse to ash.</p><p></p><p>Of the two assassins, one had been captured, achieving the goal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was increasingly grateful that his choice to cultivate the "Heaven's Will Mind-Fixing" divine ability had been an extremely wise decision.</p><p></p><p>"Take off your mask." Xu Yan looked at the assassin he had controlled.</p><p></p><p>Even with consciousness intact, the assassin could not resist this will that seemed like heaven's mandate.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The assassin removed his mask.</p><p></p><p>It revealed a middle-aged, pale face with eyes devoid of any emotion, as if feelings did not exist.</p><p></p><p>"Speak. Who sent you to assassinate me? What force is behind you?" Xu Yan began to interrogate.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family was one of the top forces in the Nine Mountains region and ruled over the Great Canopy Mountain area, yet they were unable to find even a trace of this mysterious force. This showed how deeply hidden this force was.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was such a deeply hidden force plotting? Were they infiltrators from outside enemies, or did they belong to a force within the Divine Realm? Now, there would be answers.</p><p></p><p>"It was Tiansha who ordered us to assassinate you. We belong to Tiansha Diying..."</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord began to speak.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under Xu Yan's questioning, he revealed everything he knew without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying?" Xu Yan was secretly shocked, finally learning the name of this behind-the-scenes force.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want to provoke conflict between me and the Wan family?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to interrogate.</p><p></p><p>"To create conflict between the Qinghua Realm and the Jiushan Realm, to complete the supreme mission of our Tianshadiying, and also to restore the glory of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, this True King Celestial Lord revealed a fanatical expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was shocked inwardly. The goal of Tianshadiying was actually to provoke conflict between the two realms, and the "glory of heaven and earth" seemed to be some kind of belief.</p><p></p><p>As for what exactly it meant to restore the glory of heaven and earth, this assassin couldn't explain clearly. He only knew that Tianshadiying's mission was to make heaven and earth stronger, to restore its former glory. </p><p></p><p>And to restore the glory of heaven and earth, they needed to break the current pattern, cause great turmoil in the divine realm, and trigger vast changes in heaven and earth. Only then would there be a chance to restore the glory.</p><p></p><p>The existence of Tianshadiying was for this mission.</p><p></p><p>As he learned more, Xu Yan was secretly astonished - most of the people in Tianshadiying were lunatics.</p><p></p><p>For the so-called glory of heaven and earth, they were willing to sacrifice everything! Fearless of death!</p><p></p><p>To avoid leaking Tianshadiying's secrets, they would directly eliminate themselves without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan also learned that because of his actions back then, the Tianshadiying organization at Dagaishan had some internal turmoil. A Diying member had assassinated the previous Tiansha, leading to suspicions of a traitor appearing. After all, how could there be traitors in the fanatical Tianshadiying organization, where members could die without hesitation for the mission?</p><p></p><p>As a result, the first traitor appeared, causing Tianshadiying to become more cautious when arranging missions.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they didn't assassinate anyone from the Wan family. It turns out they assassinated the Tiansha." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was amazed.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he ordered the assassination of the one giving orders, he thought it was someone from the Wan family. He never imagined the one giving orders was the Tiansha, and the other party was from Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>"This Diying is not simple. I'm afraid there's more than one person infiltrated in the Wan family."</p><p></p><p>These major forces in the Jiushan Realm must all have Diying members infiltrated, but it wouldn't be easy to root them out.</p><p></p><p>"Is your Tianshadiying pursuing Meng Chong?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked next.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's said that the Seven-Leaf Tiansha ordered to kill Meng Chong, to create conflict and contradictions, and to provoke a great war at all costs."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold. The Seven-Leaf Tiansha, according to this assassin, had the strength of an Immortal Celestial Lord! However, being only Seven-Leaf, his power would only be considered average among Immortal Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Celestial Lords of the Jiushan Realm are all in the Nine Mountains. Could there be an Immortal Celestial Lord hidden outside the Nine Mountains?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Celestial Lord who could appear at any time would be a huge threat to any force.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tianshadiying had failed several times in pursuing Meng Chong. What if this Seven-Leaf Tiansha took action personally?</p><p></p><p>Although with his master's jade talisman, there wouldn't be any danger.</p><p></p><p>But an Immortal Celestial Lord powerhouse lurking in the shadows was undoubtedly a huge hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy for an Immortal Celestial Lord to hide, unless they've cultivated an amazing concealment technique like the Tongchen Technique."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately dismissed the possibility that the other party possessed such a marvelous concealment technique.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Celestial Lords are one with heaven and earth. Because of this, Immortal Celestial Lords cannot hide from other Immortal Celestial Lords. It's almost impossible to conceal oneself.</p><p></p><p>There couldn't be a hidden Immortal Celestial Lord in the Jiushan Realm. The only possibility was that among these Immortal Celestial Lords, one was the Seven-Leaf Tiansha!</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan comes from the Seven Segment Mountain, which is different from the other eight mountains..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of the Seven Segment Mountain that Feng Yan belonged to. The power structure of this mountain was not a sect or family clan, but more like an alliance, called the Seven Segment Mountain Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial Lords of Seven Segment Mountain each had their own subordinates, yet they were allied together. If the Seven-Leaf Tiansha was most likely to appear anywhere, it would undoubtedly be Seven Segment Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"That Feng Yan, although he's in Seven Segment Mountain and belongs to the Seven Segment Mountain Alliance, is quite casual and hasn't formed his own subordinate force..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because Feng Yan was casual and the threat from Seven Segment Mountain's Heavenly Cave wasn't great that he went to support the Qinghua Realm and simply stayed without leaving.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan recalled Feng Yan's introduction of the Immortal Celestial Lords of Seven Segment Mountain, but couldn't find any who seemed particularly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"It might not necessarily be Seven Segment Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned slightly. This Seven-Leaf Tiansha had hidden his identity extremely deeply. Even within Tianshadiying, few knew his identity in the Jiushan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is a hidden danger for the Jiushan Realm. The Wan family will also be anxious and will investigate this matter seriously."</p><p></p><p>The Wan family was a clan, and they were being targeted by Tianshadiying. So the Wan family's Immortal Celestial Lords couldn't possibly be the Seven-Leaf Tiansha. On the contrary, because they were being targeted, they would pay more attention to this matter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to inquire, all about information on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"We only know that Meng Chong came to the Dagaishan region and then lost track of him. We're still investigating..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had come to Dagaishan, and it was also to find him. Since the Wan family was the ruling clan of Dagaishan, it was time to meet with Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence about Tianshadiying should also be told to Wan Tianlin, to mobilize the Wan family's forces to search.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the Diying members infiltrated in various major forces.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan took this Diying member to the Dagaishan Stone Peak and used a communication talisman to notify Wan Tianlin to come meet.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan would not reveal the divine ability of Tianyi to control people's minds, and the controlled person would not show any signs of being controlled.</p><p></p><p>This person still had great use!</p><p></p><p>He would continue to be a Diying member, becoming a true traitor to Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>Directly ordering him to kill back would be too low in value. Now that Xu Yan knew of Tianshadiying's existence, he naturally wouldn't engage in such inefficient retaliatory behavior.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take down Tianshadiying completely.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't completely take them down in one go, he could take down Tianshadiying's various strongholds one by one. Xu Yan wanted to utilize this Diying member's value to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>"You know Tianshadiying's strongholds, right? Tell me their locations."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know many strongholds. Besides the one I'm in, I only know three other contact points..."</p><p></p><p>After getting the locations of Tianshadiying's strongholds, Xu Yan calculated how to act. He couldn't take down a stronghold silently by himself.</p><p></p><p>So he still needed to cooperate with Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"You go back now. Say you encountered reinforcements from the Wan family and escaped using a secret technique..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"From today on, your identity is called Shadow One, infiltrating Tianshadiying. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Shadow One understands!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched Shadow One leave, a bright smile on his face. So Diying is good at infiltration?</p><p></p><p>Did they ever imagine they would be infiltrated in return?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

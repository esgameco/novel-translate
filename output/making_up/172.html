        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One person was able to contend with the great grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>And not just one, but several great grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>"Sss! Three great grandmasters, none of them are a match for Meng Chong. His cultivation has risen too quickly, how could he have cultivated this way, is it because of medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Then he became excited: "Spiritual herbs, I must collect more spiritual herbs to exchange for the medicinal pills needed for cultivation. With medicinal pills, I can also quickly break through to become a great grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were definitely two big shots. He must cling tightly to them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the sky above the valley, the clouds changed color, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was stirred up, as if a mighty force had descended! A peak great grandmaster! Meng Shu's heart trembled, although Xu Yan was very strong, this was a peak great grandmaster, a true apex existence in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, there is a saying about peak great grandmasters: "Upon reaching the peak, one can make heaven and earth change color!"</p><p></p><p>This shows the immense power of peak great grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that a peak great grandmaster, with a mere gesture, can stir up the spiritual energy of heaven and earth centered on themselves, transforming it into a terrifying might.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Xu, you must be undefeatable!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was slightly worried.</p><p></p><p>When the White Protector appeared, his aura was so strong that it seemed to be stirring up the spiritual energy around him, the terrifying power constantly gathering, layer upon layer of surging force, converging around him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart trembled, this was the peak great grandmaster of the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>He could already, to a certain extent, manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth around him, transforming it into formidable might.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a peak great grandmaster, not much to be afraid of!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the stone walls behind the White Protector, where there were spiritual herb-growing rooms, especially the one the White Protector had just come out of.</p><p></p><p>A small gray grass, possibly a fifth-grade spiritual herb! "Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The White Protector snorted coldly, raising his hand, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth gathering and forming into a huge hand, carrying a terrifying might, pressing down towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body was suddenly enveloped in golden light, his physique swelling, his loose clothes bursting open.</p><p></p><p>His overbearing aura stood tall, the majestic sword intent soaring, a terrifying sword light slashing towards the descending hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sword strike directly sliced open the giant hand.</p><p></p><p>The White Protector's gaze narrowed, this person's strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cultivation method he practiced seemed somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation realm was only at the grandmaster level, yet his aura was far beyond that of a grandmaster, and also very different from a grandmaster cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was cultivating a different martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"Trivial tricks!" The White Protector sneered, about to strike again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared, holding a long sword, the gentle breeze carrying a fierce killing intent, seemingly able to shatter even the White Protector's peak great grandmaster might.</p><p></p><p>The White Protector's expression changed drastically as he looked towards the suddenly appearing youth.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that there was no other peak great grandmaster in the valley and that no one had escaped, Xu Yan emerged.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept past the White Protector, looking towards the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly excited, the man in black robe was indeed wealthy, this time he would make another huge fortune.</p><p></p><p>As for the White Protector, this peak great grandmaster, although he could to a certain extent manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and transform it into formidable might, it was still too crude.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the profound mysteries of the Penetrating Mysteries realm, the true fusion of one's true essence with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the difference was vast, vast.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had only learned the most superficial aspects of the Penetrating Mysteries, only grasping the most rudimentary techniques, without truly comprehending the essence of the Penetrating Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"This false martial dao is indeed too weak, the higher the realm, the greater the gap."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When at the grandmaster realm compared to the Innate realm, although he was weaker, the gap was not so immense. Xu Yan reckoned that his talent and foundation were extraordinary, allowing him to possess such formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>The normal Innate realm martial cultivators, compared to the grandmaster realm cultivators of the inner realm, were at most just entering the Innate realm, able to contend with mid-level grandmasters, or at the peak of the Innate realm, able to contend with great grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was just a small realm difference.</p><p></p><p>However, the gap between martial dao geniuses was truly vast, like the gap between Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng, both top geniuses, yet the difference was so great that it could make Xie Lingfeng despair.</p><p></p><p>The gap further widened upon reaching the Penetrating Mysteries realm above the Innate realm, for upon entering the Penetrating Mysteries, one could manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, possessing the might of a peak great grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Of course, perhaps the difficulty in breaking through the Penetrating Mysteries realm was even greater than breaking through to the grandmaster realm, which was yet to be known.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked indifferently at the White Protector and said, "A peak great grandmaster, yet you hide and lurk, isn't that embarrassing? You don't even dare let people know the name of your faction, are you just a rat in the gutter?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Xu Yan's taunts, the White Protector did not respond.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was extremely grave, his aura constantly increasing, a curved blade appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Around him, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to transform into countless curved blades, circling and swirling, the heavens and earth changing color, the overwhelming pressure making the sky above the valley appear to be frozen.</p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>The White Protector sensed a strong sense of crisis from the youth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "Today, I will slay you, this peak great grandmaster, just like killing a gutter rat!"</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze transformed into sword intent, the mountains and rivers appearing, a golden dragon coiling within.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, leave those three to me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the other three black-robed men.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, don't worry, I'll go slay them right away!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned wickedly, completely ignoring the White Protector and rushing towards the other three.</p><p></p><p>After using a martial dao secret technique, that great grandmaster's aura had already become weaker, killing him would only take one or two strikes.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two, it would likewise only take one or two strikes.</p><p></p><p>The White Protector's expression changed slightly, but he dared not move an inch, staring intently at Xu Yan, not daring to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The sense of crisis was growing stronger and stronger, the aura of death seemed to be surging into his chest.</p><p></p><p>This was a feeling he had never experienced since becoming a peak great grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>The White Protector said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered coldly, the sword light flashing, slashing across the sky, cutting off the retreat path of the three.</p><p></p><p>"Three sword strikes! If my three sword strikes can't kill you, I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's body was surging with sword intent, a sword light flashing, the mountains and rivers appearing, as if the sky above the valley had transformed into a mountain and river landscape.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The White Protector snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Three sword strikes wanting to kill him?</p><p></p><p>Even Sword Saint Cliff Xie Tianheng couldn't do it!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although he was not weak, as a peak great grandmaster, how could he not be able to escape?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The White Protector struck, unleashing the full might of a peak great grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan, a sword strike was unleashed! Roar! The mountains and rivers cried out!</p><p></p><p>Then the second sword strike, the mountains and rivers transforming into myriad forms, a dragon leaping within, becoming a sword of apocalyptic might.</p><p></p><p>The third sword strike, the mountains, rivers, and all living beings, the sword descending!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's comprehension of the Sword Dao of Mountains and Rivers had already surpassed his previous level, from the Cry of the Mountains and Rivers, to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To the second move that extended from the mountain and river dragon's roar, the Dragon Might Destroys the World, and then to the Sword of the Myriad Existences of the Mountain and River.</p><p></p><p>Three swords were unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The majestic might that stirred the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had already been buried within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>The White Dharma Protector's eyes widened, his expression one of disbelief. His body crumbled piece by piece, dissipating into dust in the air.</p><p></p><p>A peak Grandmaster had fallen!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, three Grandmasters trying to flee had already been slain by Meng Chong, with the last Great Perfection Grandmaster, just before his death, horrified to see that the young man had slain the White Dharma Protector with just three swords!</p><p></p><p>To slay a peak Grandmaster with three swords, what a terrifying power! And even more frightening was his age - not even twenty years old! Poof! His body shattered under the sword light, turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>In his final moments, he felt that his death was not in vain, after all, the peak Grandmaster White Dharma Protector had been slain by just three swords. Let alone himself?</p><p></p><p>In this valley, there were no more Black-Robed Ones.</p><p></p><p>This was not the Black-Robed Ones' lair, but it was guarded by a peak Grandmaster, a Great Perfection Grandmaster, and two other Grandmasters, a total of four Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>This shows the importance of this place.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, is that a Grade 5 Spirit Herb?" Meng Chong asked excitedly, looking at one of the secret chambers in the cliff wall.</p><p></p><p>"Very likely," Xu Yan replied, equally excited.</p><p></p><p>The two did not rush in, but waited for Meng Shu to arrive, as he was more familiar with spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Meng Shu arrived, his entire being exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, your invincibility is unparalleled. A peak Grandmaster was slain just like that. Your strength is simply too outrageous."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look," Xu Yan said, leading the way into the White Dharma Protector's secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the secret chamber, the first thing they saw was a gray small grass growing in the crevice.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Grade 5 Spirit Herb!" Meng Shu exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Spirit Herb is this?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when approaching the gray small grass, there was a sense of spiritual tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu carefully approached and observed the gray small grass for a while, then shook his head, "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"You're the Spirit Herb expert in our clan, how can you not know?" Meng Chong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Grade 5 Spirit Herbs are virtually extinct in the Inner Realm. The records in our clan's classics are limited, so it's not strange that I don't know," Meng Shu explained.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, harvest it. Since it's a Grade 5 Spirit Herb, it must have extraordinary effects. And a peak Grandmaster was guarding it, so it must have remarkable potency," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Leave it to me." Meng Shu eagerly began to dig up the gray small grass.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong started to search the secret chamber, especially the White Dharma Protector's belongings.</p><p></p><p>The secret chamber was simple, with a stone bed carved near the Spirit Herb, on which were some envelopes and a bag.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the bag, which contained some medicinal pills, two Grade 7 Spirit Herbs, and a bag of Spirit Tickets.</p><p></p><p>"A bit poor, for a peak Grandmaster," Xu Yan couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Tickets were only worth a little over ten thousand Spirit Crystals, which seemed a lot, but not befitting a peak Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>And there was no storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had killed a peak Grandmaster, and there was no storage bag, which showed how rare they were.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, peak Grandmasters are at the pinnacle of existence. They have special privileges at the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, where they can get credit or even directly obtain what they need, so they usually don't carry too many Spirit Tickets on them," Meng Shu explained while digging up the Spirit Herb.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Xu Yan understood.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was looking through the envelopes, trying to find clues about the Black-Robed Ones' faction. However, he was disappointed to find that the letters did not mention the faction they belonged to, and some of the coded messages were not entirely clear.</p><p></p><p>One letter did mention the death of the Grandmaster and the pursuit of Su Ling Xiu, which had not yet yielded any results. This showed that the White Dharma Protector was a core high-level member of the Black-Robed Ones' faction, which was not surprising given that he was a peak Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've harvested the Spirit Herb," Meng Shu said, sealing the herbs in a medicinal pouch.</p><p></p><p>They then proceeded to the other secret chambers. In each one, there was a gray small grass, with two being Grade 7 and one being Grade 6. The Spirit Tickets and other items they found were more than what the peak Grandmaster had.</p><p></p><p>"They were cultivating Spirit Herbs!" Meng Shu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the secret chambers, Xu Yan raised his hand and slashed, cutting away a layer of the mountain wall, but there were no other secret chambers.</p><p></p><p>Looking around the valley, this was indeed a blessed place, with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth converging here, especially on the mountain walls, where the spiritual energy lingered and did not dissipate, which explained the growth of the Spirit Herbs.</p><p></p><p>Around the valley, there were many other Spirit Herbs, mostly Grade 9 and a few Grade 8, all of which had been harvested.</p><p></p><p>After clearing the place, Xu Yan contemplated, "Should we stay here for a few days and kill anyone who comes?"</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Shu said, "Senior Brother Xu, this place was guarded by a peak Grandmaster. The Black-Robed Ones' faction should not come here often, relying mostly on messenger birds. Now that the messenger birds are gone, cutting off their communication, by the time they discover the problem and send people, it could take days. There's no need to stay here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought about it and agreed. With the Demon Slayer Sovereign raging on Caolang Island, it was time to go deal with him.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, are we going to Caolang Island to kill the Demon Sovereign?" Meng Chong asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "Not yet. Since he's so eager for me to come, he should pay a price. I, Xu Yan, may be going to kill him, but the cost of my appearance cannot be low."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Have someone deliver a message to the Demon Slayer Sovereign. If he wants me to come fight him, he should prepare a hundred million Spirit Crystals as the appearance fee, as well as his entire wealth. After I kill him, I'll conveniently collect it all," Xu Yan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>When someone brings money to your doorstep, how can you refuse? The Demon Slayer Sovereign was a good person, sending money and his life. Such people were hard to come by, so he should be cherished.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu's mouth twitched slightly, silently mourning for the Demon Slayer Sovereign. Of all people, he had to provoke Xu Yan. If he wanted Xu Yan to fight him, he would have to pay a hundred million Spirit Crystals.</p><p></p><p>Would the Demon Slayer Sovereign agree to Xu Yan's conditions? Certainly! If Xu Yan avoided the fight, he would be completely helpless. Since he wanted to kill Xu Yan, how could he not be willing to pay the price?</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many Grandmasters are waiting for me on Caolang Island," Xu Yan said with a radiant smile, completely unaware that he was entering a dragon's den.</p>

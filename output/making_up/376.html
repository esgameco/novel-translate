        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The capital city of the Great Yue Kingdom was in a state of high alert. The True King Celestial Lords were patrolling the city, and all the martial artists had solemn expressions, ready to respond to any impending great battle.</p><p></p><p>Within the capital city, there was an aura that was in harmony with heaven and earth, as if it commanded the domain where the city was located. Any enemy trying to invade the capital would not escape the grasp of this powerful entity.</p><p></p><p>To invade the capital, one must first defeat the powerful cultivator who commanded this domain.</p><p></p><p>Although the aura of the powerful cultivator commanding the capital seemed somewhat weak, he was still an Immortal Celestial Lord, and no cultivator below his level could dare to offend him.</p><p></p><p>On the city towers, numerous soldiers in armor with murderous expressions were intently watching the four great mountains surrounding the capital from afar.</p><p></p><p>Originally, each of the four great mountains was guarded by an Immortal Celestial Lord. However, one of them had been severely injured while fighting the Blood Son from the Heavenly Cave and had retreated back to the capital. He was now the Immortal Celestial Lord commanding the capital.</p><p></p><p>The former commander of the capital's inner guards, Sui Hongwu, had gone to pursue and kill the Master of the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>This had left one of the four great mountains unguarded, allowing the Heavenly Cave to launch a massive invasion, forcing the Great Yue Emperor, the strongest cultivator in the Great Yue Kingdom, to personally guard the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The situation at the Heavenly Cave was still unclear.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the incident in the Qiyun Prefecture had cast a shadow over everyone's hearts. The Great Yue Kingdom was in great turmoil, on the verge of collapse. The capital appeared calm only because it was guarded by an Immortal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Heavenly Cave could not be defended, the capital would be the first to be affected.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave of the Great Yue Kingdom was one of the three great Underworld Caves in the Azure Flower Realm. The Great Yue capital was established here to guard this Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The four great mountains surrounded the Heavenly Cave entrance, which spanned thousands of miles and was bound by the laws of heaven and earth, like chains preventing it from expanding further.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy Heavenly Cave entrance, which had previously shown a faint blood-red glow, was now engulfed in a blood-red light, with a blood-thirsty aura permeating the area.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, clad in golden armor and wielding a long spear, seemed to be one with heaven and earth, commanding the Heavenly Cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>He was facing off against a pale-faced, androgynous young man with seven blood-red lines on his brow, who held a crimson spear that emanated a cold and bloodthirsty aura, clashing against the Great Yue Emperor's might.</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Cave entrance, three Immortal Celestial Lords in armor were engaged in a fierce battle with three blood-colored figures, with neither side able to gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of battle echoed endlessly at the Heavenly Cave entrance. Armored troops led by the True King Celestial Lords were fighting against the endless waves of blood servants and blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>The battle was extremely brutal, with countless casualties on both sides. The blood had stained the Heavenly Cave entrance, even forming a rain of blood that fell into the depths of the cave.</p><p></p><p>A squad led by a peak True King Celestial Lord, with all members at the Crystallized Fa Celestial Lord level, had already broken through the blood slave army and entered the Heavenly Cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>This battle had been raging for a long time, surpassing the scale and duration of previous invasions. Even the soldiers were exhausted from the constant rotation of defense.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was also deeply concerned about the situation within the Great Yue Kingdom, especially the incident in the Qiyun Prefecture, but he could not spare the time to address it.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was also facing attacks from the Heavenly Cave and could not provide more reinforcements. The Great Yue Emperor could only hope that Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu could hold back the Blood Son and the Master of the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be a grave situation. The Great Yue Emperor could only rely on the support of the Wanlei Sect and the Tianwu Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Jiu, do you intend to continue?" the Great Yue Emperor asked coldly, looking at his old adversary, Blood Son Jiu.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Jiu, the strongest cultivator of the Heavenly Cave, had a high position among the Blood Sons, as evidenced by the number of blood lines on his brow.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation of the Blood Dao techniques was also evidently stronger.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Jiu smiled lightly and said, "The Great Yue Kingdom is in turmoil, isn't it? The Great Yue Emperor's heart is in turmoil as well, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, if you surrender to my Underworld, I can spare your life. I, Blood Son Jiu, value you highly. To be honest with you, you cannot defend the Azure Flower Realm."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Jiu continued.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's expression darkened, and he coldly scoffed, "Just with you? Blood Son Jiu, you still lack something."</p><p></p><p>He thrust out his spear, as if the laws of heaven and earth had been transformed into a spear, with the power of the cosmos surging into it, causing ripples in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Jiu also thrust out his spear, with a crimson and chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>The two attacks collided, and neither was willing to back down.</p><p></p><p>Both the Great Yue Emperor and Blood Son Jiu understood each other's strengths, and neither could truly overcome the other.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, this operation was initiated by an ancient Blood Spirit. The Azure Flower Realm this time, you will not be able to defend it, and you cannot rely on reinforcements, whether from the Nine Mountains Realm or other realms, as they are all in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest with you, the Azure Flower Realm is an invasion point, the true gateway to your domain.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Flower Realm will ultimately fall, and your domain will be occupied. Why bother defending it to the death?</p><p></p><p>"If you surrender now, with your abilities and status, you will not be inferior to me."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Jiu spoke calmly, but his voice echoed throughout the Heavenly Cave, causing the faces of the defending cultivators to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor coldly laughed, "What does this Blood Spirit matter? Can he penetrate the heavenly and earthly barriers to come here? Since he cannot come, no matter how powerful he is, what can he do?</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Cave can only accommodate one cultivator of your strength, Blood Son Jiu. Not even a second Blood Son of similar power can enter, let alone the Blood Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators fighting felt relieved. The Great Yue Emperor's words made sense. Not only could the Blood Spirit not come, but even a second Blood Son of similar strength to Blood Son Jiu could not enter the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>There was a limit to the powerful cultivators the Heavenly Cave could accommodate. If two or three more Blood Sons of Blood Son Jiu's level were to come, the Great Yue Emperor would not be able to hold them off, let alone the Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Son Jiu laughed and said, "The Great Yue Emperor is a wise man, knowing that the Blood Spirit cannot penetrate the heavenly and earthly barriers to come here. But what if the Blood Spirit is not coming from the outside, but is born within the Azure Flower Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor scoffed, "Blood Son Jiu, do not try to confuse my troops. Your scheme is too obvious. Even if you can give birth to a Blood Spirit within the Azure Flower Realm, how long would that take? Decades, centuries, or even millennia? Do you think the Azure Flower Realm will give you that opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was not as calm as he appeared. He was thinking about Blood Son Xiu, and if Blood Son Jiu was saying this, there must be a possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu should be able to hold back Blood Son Xiu and the Master of the Blood Shadow Tower. But if the Blood Spirit is truly born within the Azure Flower Realm, it would be a grave situation indeed."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Subdue him?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Emperor of the Great Yue felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This time, the entire Qinghua Realm was in great turmoil. All the Heavenly Prisons had rebelled and launched a massive invasion, which had constrained him, as well as the Sect Masters of the Wanlei and Tianwu Sects.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the Immortal Supremes were embroiled in the Heavenly Prison battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This move was likely intended to create an opportunity for Blood Sacrifice to ascend to the Blood Spirit realm in the Qinghua Realm!" Although the Netherworld Blood Dao could rapidly enhance one's strength through blood refinement, ascending to the Blood Spirit realm was no easy feat, which Blood Sacrifice could not accomplish."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>The flaws of the Netherworld Blood Dao were also quite apparent. Most of the Blood Slaves and Blood Disciples appeared to have somewhat unstable realms, with their strengths within the same realm being weaker than the Immortal Domain cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The number of Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves who could match the Immortal Domain cultivators was not many.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves were essentially slaves in the Netherworld, or even consumable cultivation resources for the stronger ones!</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the cultivators of the Netherworld Blood Dao tended to be impulsive, bloodthirsty, and occasionally unable to suppress their emotions, even entering a state of frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators like Blood Sacrifice, who had completely mastered the power of the Blood Dao without being affected, were likely at the level of Netherworld prodigies.</p><p></p><p>And their cultivation time was probably not short, having settled their foundations, thus avoiding instability.</p><p></p><p>However, the Emperor of the Great Yue was still uneasy. An out-of-control, even mentally confused Blood Spirit, could be even more terrifying! But now, he could only hope that an external force would intervene and break the current situation.</p><p></p><p>A figure swiftly arrived and landed beside the Emperor of the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>It was a True King Supreme, known for his speed and primarily responsible for delivering messages.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were no match for Blood Sacrifice, and Yiun Prefecture is in danger of being destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was panting, his voice slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Prison in Yiun Prefecture has fallen, and millions of Blood Slave troops have invaded..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the newcomer's expression was filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue's heart sank, but his face remained calm. This matter could not be publicized, or the morale of the troops would collapse, and defeat would be inevitable! Some might even turn to the Netherworld in despair.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly evacuate all the people outside Yiun Prefecture. Inform the Wanlei and Tianwu Sects, and whoever has the ability should come and lend a hand... The Netherworld is trying to give birth to a Blood Spirit in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to go to the Realm Gate and seek aid from the other major realms outside the Nine Mountain Realm, informing them of the current crisis in the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue transmitted his orders.</p><p></p><p>Seeking aid from the major realms was the only strategy left.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue could only hope that the major realms would have powerful cultivators who could spare the time to provide support, and that they would arrive quickly, or the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>But the major realms were too far from the Qinghua Realm, with the Nine Mountain Realm in between, and whether they could arrive in time was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue's expression remained calm, but his heart was somewhat in disarray.</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger had not been gone for an hour when he rushed back, his face flushed, panting heavily, and his whole body trembling. For a moment, the Emperor of the Great Yue could not tell whether the messenger was excited or terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, tell me, have Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu perished?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue's heart was heavy. Was he frightened?</p><p></p><p>He could not even speak properly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had fallen? The fall of two Immortal Supremes was indeed enough to terrify someone.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, Your Majesty. I received a message from Commander Sui Hongwu, the crisis in Yiun Prefecture has been resolved. A powerful cultivator has intervened and annihilated Blood Sacrifice and the millions of Blood Slave troops with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>"The powerful cultivator, at Sui Hongwu's request and under the lead of Senior Feng Yan, is now on their way to our Great Yue Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, a powerful cultivator has come to our aid! Blood Sacrifice is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the True King messenger became incoherent in his excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A powerful cultivator?</p><p></p><p>For the Immortal Supremes to call someone a powerful cultivator, what kind of strength would that be? Even the Emperor of the Great Yue, one of the three Immortal Supremes of the Qinghua Realm, could not be considered a powerful cultivator in the eyes of the other Immortal Supremes! Even the Immortal Supremes from the major realms would not be considered powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could be called a powerful cultivator by the Immortal Supremes, throughout the entire Immortal Domain, might not even exist.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, the Emperor of the Great Yue even doubted whether the True King messenger had been subjected to some kind of stimulation, causing his mind to be somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>"You said that the powerful cultivator struck down Blood Sacrifice and the millions of Blood Slave troops with a single palm strike?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty, it was not I who said it, but Commander Sui Hongwu!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger replied excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Sui Hongwu said it was a powerful cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue was even more dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu, the Commander of the Internal Guards, was a steady and reliable person, someone the Emperor was quite familiar with.</p><p></p><p>He would not speak nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the Immortal Supremes, what kind of strength would be considered a powerful cultivator?</p><p></p><p>There was a saying in the Immortal Domain: "In the eyes of the Immortal, there is no powerful cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu should understand this principle.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty, a powerful cultivator has come to our Qinghua Realm. The powerful cultivator is now on their way to the Great Yue Heavenly Prison, and that bastard Blood Sacrifice is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger said excitedly and even spat in the direction of Blood Sacrifice, his gaze filled with disdain, as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sacrifice's face darkened. This insignificant insect beside the Emperor of the Great Yue actually showed such contempt for him? He thrust a spear towards him.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue frowned and struck out with a spear of his own to block Blood Sacrifice's attack.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the True King messenger, he took a deep breath and said, "I am very much looking forward to seeing this powerful cultivator that Commander Sui Hongwu spoke of, and just how powerful they are."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue found the situation utterly absurd. What kind of person could be worthy of being called a powerful cultivator in the eyes of the Immortal Supremes?</p><p></p><p>"Very powerful, very powerful, comparable to the height of heaven and earth, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger, still excited, nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he said, "When will this powerful cultivator arrive?"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether this was truly a powerful cultivator, at least it was a strong reinforcement that could break the current situation, which the Emperor of the Great Yue valued highly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, they will arrive in at most three days!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger replied.</p><p></p><p>"Since the crisis in Yiun Prefecture has been resolved, you should transmit a message to Sui Hongwu, instructing him to personally take action and suppress the unrest in all the Heavenly Prisons."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Now that a powerful Immortal Supreme had been freed up, it would be a good opportunity to have him patrol the Great Yue and subdue the unrest in the Heavenly Prisons. In this way, the various regions of the Great Yue could remain peaceful and stable for a long time, allowing them to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The True King messenger hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue's gaze was pensive, yet filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what kind of extraordinary being you are, to be called a powerful cultivator by the Immortal Supremes!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Yue thought to himself. The strength must not be weak, and it should not be weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The capital city of the Great Yue Kingdom was on high alert. Numerous True King Celestial Lords patrolled in all directions. In this vast capital, all martial artists had solemn expressions, ready to respond to the potential great battle at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Within the capital, there was an aura that merged with heaven and earth, as if commanding this part of the world where the capital was located. Any enemy wanting to invade the capital could not escape the owner of this aura.</p><p></p><p>To invade the capital, one would have to defeat the powerful expert controlling this domain.</p><p></p><p>Although the aura of the expert controlling the capital's domain seemed somewhat weak, he was still an Immortal Celestial Lord after all. No matter how weak, he was not someone that martial artists below the Immortal Celestial Lord realm could offend.</p><p></p><p>On the city walls of the capital, a group of grim-faced, armor-clad soldiers stared intently at the four great mountains surrounding the area a hundred miles outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Originally, each mountain had an Immortal Celestial Lord stationed there. However, one of them was severely injured while fighting a Blood Son from the Heavenly Abyss and ambushed by the Blood Shadow Tower Master. He had retreated back to the capital.</p><p></p><p>He was now the Immortal Celestial Lord controlling the capital's domain.</p><p></p><p>The original commander of the capital's internal guards, Sui Hongwu, had gone to pursue and kill the Blood Shadow Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>This left one of the four mountains without an Immortal Celestial Lord stationed there. The large-scale invasion from the Heavenly Abyss also forced the Great Yue Emperor, the strongest expert of Great Yue, to personally take action and guard the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The current situation at the Heavenly Abyss was still unclear.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the incident in Qiyun Prefecture cast a shadow over everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Kingdom was in chaos, almost on the verge of collapse. The capital seemed peaceful, but that was only because an Immortal Celestial Lord was stationed there.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Heavenly Abyss could not be defended, the capital would be the first to fall.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Heavenly Abyss was one of the three Netherworld Heavenly Abysses in the Qinghua Realm. The capital of the Great Yue Kingdom was built here to guard this Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Four great mountains surrounded the center, which was the Great Yue Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Looking down from the mountains, the entrance to the Heavenly Abyss spanned a thousand miles. The laws of heaven and earth could be seen manifesting like chains, encircling the entrance to prevent it from expanding further.</p><p></p><p>The hazy entrance to the Heavenly Abyss originally had a faint red glow visible inside, but now the entire entrance was blazing with blood-red light, permeated with a bloody, murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, wearing golden armor and holding a long spear, seemed to have merged with heaven and earth, controlling the domain of the Heavenly Abyss entrance.</p><p></p><p>He was facing off against an effeminate young man with seven blood-colored lines on his forehead and a pale face.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man held a crimson long spear in his hand. A cold, bloodthirsty aura soared to the sky, constantly clashing with the Great Yue Emperor's aura.</p><p></p><p>They were evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Heavenly Abyss, three armored Immortal Celestial Lords with surging auras were battling three blood-colored figures. They were also evenly matched, with neither side able to defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of killing never ceased at the entrance of the Heavenly Abyss. Squads of armored warriors formed battle formations, led by True King Celestial Lords, fighting against the constantly charging Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was extremely brutal. People were constantly falling, and Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves were constantly being killed.</p><p></p><p>Blood stained the entrance of the Heavenly Abyss, even turning into blood rain that fell into the Abyss below.</p><p></p><p>There was even a team led by a peak True King Celestial Lord, with all members at the Condensed Law Celestial Lord level, that had torn through the Blood Slave army and already entered the Heavenly Abyss entrance.</p><p></p><p>This great battle had been going on for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This invasion from the Heavenly Abyss exceeded the scale of previous ones, and its duration was also the longest. Even with soldiers rotating to defend, they all felt exhausted.</p><p></p><p>What worried the Great Yue Emperor even more was the current situation within the Great Yue Kingdom's borders, especially the incident in Qiyun Prefecture, but he couldn't spare any effort to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was also facing an attack from the Heavenly Abyss and temporarily couldn't send more powerful experts to help. They could only hope that Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu could contain Blood Son Tu and the Blood Shadow Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, things would be dire! Moreover, the Great Yue Emperor could only hope that the Wanlei Sect and Tianwu Gate would be able to spare some effort to support them.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Ji, do you still want to continue?" The Great Yue Emperor coldly looked at his old opponent, Blood Son Ji!</p><p></p><p>He was the strongest in the Great Yue Heavenly Abyss. From the number of blood marks on his forehead, one could judge that his status among the Blood Sons was not low.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the blood cultivation method that Blood Son Ji practiced was clearly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji looked at him calmly and said with a light laugh, "Great Yue is in chaos, isn't it? The Great Yue Emperor's heart is also in chaos, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, if you surrender to our Netherworld, you can save your life. I, Blood Son Ji, value you highly. To tell you the truth, you can't defend the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji continued.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's expression darkened. He sneered, "Just with you lot? Blood Son Ji, you're still a bit short."</p><p></p><p>Boom! He thrust out his spear, as if the laws of heaven and earth had transformed into a spear. The power of heaven and earth poured in, causing ripples in the space of this domain.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Blood Son Ji likewise thrust out his spear, with a chilling blood light and a crimson spear radiance.</p><p></p><p>After this exchange, neither of them held back anymore.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Great Yue Emperor or Blood Son Ji, they understood each other's strength. Neither could overcome the other.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, this operation was initiated by an ancient Blood Spirit. You can't defend the Qinghua Realm this time, and don't count on any strong reinforcements. Whether it's the Nine Mountains Realm or other realms, they're all in turmoil right now.</p><p></p><p>"To tell you the truth, the Qinghua Realm is an entry point, the real entry point for invading your world.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm will eventually fall, and your world will eventually be occupied. Why bother defending to the death?</p><p></p><p>"If you join us now, with your abilities as the Great Yue Emperor, your status won't be inferior to mine."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>But his voice spread throughout the entire Heavenly Abyss. The martial artists resisting the Netherworld invasion all had a slight change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor sneered, "What about a Blood Spirit? Can he pass through the world barrier to come here? Since he can't come in, no matter how strong he is, what can he do?</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Abyss can only accommodate one outsider with strength like you, Blood Son Ji. It's already at its limit. Even a second Blood Son with strength comparable to yours can't come through, let alone a Blood Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists who were in the midst of battle felt relieved. The Great Yue Emperor's words made sense. Forget about a Blood Spirit, even a second Blood Son with strength comparable to Blood Son Ji couldn't come through.</p><p></p><p>There was an upper limit to the strength of experts that the Heavenly Abyss could accommodate.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if two or three more Blood Sons with strength comparable to Blood Son Ji came, the Great Yue Emperor wouldn't be able to hold on. Why would a Blood Spirit need to take action?</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Son Ji started laughing, "The Great Yue Emperor is a sensible person. You know that a Blood Spirit can't pass through the world barrier to come here. But what if the Blood Spirit isn't coming from outside, but is born within the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor scoffed, "Blood Son Ji, stop trying to shake our morale. Your trick is too poor. Even if it's possible to give birth to a Blood Spirit in our Qinghua Realm, how long would that take? Decades? Centuries? Or over a thousand years? Do you think our Qinghua Realm would give you that opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Yue Emperor wasn't as relaxed as he sounded. He thought of Blood Son Tu. Since Blood Son Ji said this, it must be possible.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu should be able to contain</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Restrain him?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Emperor Dayue felt a bit uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This time, the entire Qinghua Realm was in chaos, with all the Heavenly Caves in rebellion, launching a massive invasion that tied up not only him, but also the leaders of the Wanlei Sect and Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the Immortal Heavenly Venerable were tied up on the Heavenly Cave battlefields.</p><p></p><p>This move was likely intended to create an opportunity for Blood Son Tu to advance to Blood Spirit in the Qinghua Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Although the Netherworld Blood Way can refine blood essence to rapidly increase strength, advancing to Blood Spirit is by no means easy. He won't be able to do it," Emperor Dayue comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>The drawbacks of the Netherworld Blood Way were also very obvious. Most blood slaves and blood disciples seemed to have somewhat unstable realms, with strength weaker than Divine Realm martial artists at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Blood disciples and slaves who could match Divine Realm martial artists were not many in number.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, blood disciples and slaves were akin to slaves in the Netherworld, even serving as cultivation resources for stronger beings!</p><p></p><p>Besides this, practitioners of the Netherworld Blood Way tended to be irritable and bloodthirsty, sometimes unable to suppress impulsive emotions, even entering a frenzied state.</p><p></p><p>Netherworld martial artists like Blood Son Ji, who could fully control blood power without being affected, were likely all at the level of Netherworld geniuses.</p><p></p><p>And the time they had spent cultivating was probably not short - they had tempered themselves to eliminate instability!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was still uneasy in his heart. An out-of-control Blood Spirit with confused consciousness could be even more terrifying! But now, he could not change anything, and could only hope for outside forces to intervene and break the current situation.</p><p></p><p>A figure swiftly arrived, landing beside Emperor Dayue.</p><p></p><p>It was a True King Heavenly Venerable, one who excelled in speed and mainly served as a messenger.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu are no match for Blood Son Tu. I'm afraid Qiyun Prefecture is about to fall..."</p><p></p><p>The messenger panted, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Cave in Qiyun Prefecture has fallen, and tens of thousands of blood slave troops have invaded..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the messenger's voice was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue's heart sank, but his face remained impassive. This matter could not be spread, otherwise morale would collapse and defeat would be certain!</p><p></p><p>Some might even despair and defect to the Netherworld!</p><p></p><p>"Evacuate everyone outside Qiyun Prefecture as quickly as possible. Inform the Wanlei and Tianwu Sects of this matter. Whoever is able should come out and take action as soon as possible... The Netherworld intends to scheme for the birth of a Blood Spirit in the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to go to the realm gate and request aid from the other great realms outside the Nine Mountains Realm. Report the current crisis in the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue transmitted these orders.</p><p></p><p>Apart from seeking aid from the great realms, there was no other strategy.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue only hoped that the great realms would have powerful experts who could spare the time to provide support, and that they would be fast enough. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>But the great realms were too far from the Qinghua Realm, separated by the Nine Mountains Realm and others. Whether timely aid could be obtained was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The messenger True King hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue's expression remained calm, but his heart was somewhat chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Less than an hour after the messenger True King left, he hurriedly returned, his face flushed red, panting heavily, his whole body trembling. For a moment, Emperor Dayue couldn't tell if he was excited or terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, speak. Have Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu perished?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue's heart felt heavy. Was he frightened out of his wits?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even speak properly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had perished? The fall of two Immortal Heavenly Venerables was indeed enough to terrify anyone.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, Your subject received a message from Commander Sui Hongwu. The crisis in Qiyun Prefecture has been resolved. A great expert intervened, killing Blood Son Tu and tens of thousands of blood slave troops with a single palm strike."</p><p></p><p>"At Commander Sui Hongwu's earnest request, the great expert is now coming to our Dayue Heavenly Cave, led by Elder Feng Yan."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, a great expert has come to our aid! Blood Son Ji is surely doomed!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the messenger True King became so excited that his words became incoherent.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A great expert?</p><p></p><p>What level of strength would it take for even an Immortal Heavenly Venerable to call someone a great expert? He, Emperor Dayue, one of the three Immortal Heavenly Venerables of the Qinghua Realm, was far from being considered a great expert in the eyes of other Immortal Heavenly Venerables! Even Immortal Heavenly Venerables from the great realms could not be called great experts.</p><p></p><p>Those who could be called great experts by Immortal Heavenly Venerables probably didn't exist in the entire Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Emperor Dayue even suspected that the messenger True King had suffered some kind of shock and his mind was not quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"You say, a great expert intervened and killed Blood Son Tu and tens of thousands of blood slave troops with a single palm strike?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's not what I said, it's what Commander Sui Hongwu said!" </p><p></p><p>The messenger True King said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Sui Hongwu said it was a great expert?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was the commander of the internal guards, a steady man whom he knew quite well.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely not talk nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable, what level of strength would be worthy of being called a great expert?</p><p></p><p>In the martial world of the Divine Realm, there was a saying: "In the eyes of the Immortal, there are no great experts!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu would surely understand this principle.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty, a great expert has come to our Qinghua Realm. Now the great expert is coming to the Dayue Heavenly Cave. That bastard Blood Son Ji is surely doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The messenger True King said excitedly and enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>He even spat in Blood Son Ji's direction, his eyes looking at him as if he were already dead.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji's face darkened. How dare this ant by Emperor Dayue's side show such contempt for him?</p><p></p><p>He thrust his spear over.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue frowned and countered with his own spear, blocking Blood Son Ji's attack.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the messenger True King, he took a deep breath and said, "I am very curious to see just how great this expert mentioned by Commander Sui Hongwu is, and in what way they are great!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue felt it was absurd and laughable. Who could be worthy of being called a great expert in the eyes of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Very great, very great, as great as the heavens and earth, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The messenger True King, too excited to notice Emperor Dayue's tone, nodded vigorously as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he asked, "When will this so-called great expert arrive?"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether they were truly a great expert, at least it was a powerful reinforcement that could break the current situation. Emperor Dayue still took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, they will arrive in three days at most!"</p><p></p><p>The messenger True King replied.</p><p></p><p>"Since the crisis in Qiyun Prefecture has been resolved, go and relay a message to Sui Hongwu, telling him to personally take action and suppress all the rebellious Heavenly Caves."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Now that an Immortal Heavenly Venerable expert had been freed up, it was the perfect opportunity to patrol Dayue and suppress the rebellious Heavenly Caves. This way, all areas of Dayue could remain peaceful and stable for a long time, allowing for recovery and growth.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The messenger True King hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue's gaze was deep and full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see just who you are, to be called a great expert in front of an Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was very curious about what methods this mysterious expert had used to make Sui Hongwu call them a great expert!</p><p></p><p>Their strength must not be weak, surely not weaker than his own?</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

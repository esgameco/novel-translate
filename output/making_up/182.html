        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dozens of peak grand masters did not appear to surround and attack. Instead, the first to appear were eight black-robed figures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression hardened as he looked at the leading elder, his gaze heavy, and he said in a deep voice, "The Headmaster of the Hidden Tower?!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's face also changed drastically, and her eyes reddened with hatred as she looked at those eight figures. It was these people who had killed her grandfather, forcing her to flee to the remote wilderness. But because of that, she had met her master and cultivated the Dantian Martial Dao!</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of you!" Su Ling Xiu said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Headmaster's gaze was indifferent, as if he lacked any spirit. He looked at Xu Yan and Meng Chong, directly ignoring the seated Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Hidden Tower Headmaster's eyes, Li Xuan, who did not display any aura or mysterious energy, was no different from Kou Ruozhi and Xu Junhe - mere ant-like existences.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me, or everyone here will die because of you," the Hidden Tower Headmaster said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"The Hidden Tower Headmaster is mysterious and powerful, known as the Undying. I'd like to experience just how mysterious and powerful he is!" Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the Hidden Tower Headmaster was extremely powerful, exuding a dangerous aura - a sensation he had never felt before.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Headmaster's indifferent gaze fell upon him, and in an instant, his originally murky eyes erupted with a piercing, sharp light.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a vast oppressive force descended.</p><p></p><p>This pressure was different from that of peak grand masters. It was like a "will" that suppressed one's consciousness and soul, making it impossible to break free. Even peak grand masters would tremble in the face of this overwhelming might, their full strength suppressed, unable to exert even a third of their power.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression changed, and with a hum, the mountains and rivers appeared, enveloping everyone to resist this pressure. His Sword Dao could withstand this oppressive force.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The mountains and rivers surged, as if under immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan exhaled, able to withstand this pressure. But he was filled with awe, asking in a deep voice, "Beyond the grand masters?"</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Headmaster's eyes shone with a terrifying light, and the pressure continued to increase, but it could not suppress Xu Yan's Sword Dao. He frowned slightly, greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cultivation method is this? It is similar to the Celestial Deity's Might, yet different. He is not a Celestial Deity, how can he possess such power to resist the Celestial Deity's Might?" The Hidden Tower Headmaster studied Xu Yan, his eyes flickering with insight, now understanding how Xu Yan could kill peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>It was related to this mysterious power!</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be a profound and subtle rhythm. How did he cultivate it? Not yet a Celestial Deity, but possessing nearly the power of the Celestial Deity's Might. If I could cultivate this mysterious rhythm, wouldn't I then have the true Celestial Deity's Might?" The Hidden Tower Headmaster became greatly excited at this thought.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you are not my match. Come with me, and I won't kill the others. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless," the Hidden Tower Headmaster said coldly, his aura surging, revealing his terrifying strength beyond that of peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. This person was definitely a powerhouse beyond the peak grand masters. Unless he broke through to the Profound Realm, he would be no match for this person. But he was not panicked, for his master was here.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, who had been sitting in the chair, had sensed the danger when the Hidden Tower Headmaster appeared. This person's strength was far beyond that of peak grand masters, especially that oppressive force that seemed to directly suppress the warriors' consciousness - a powerful spiritual or soul force.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary peak grand masters would likely be unable to resist, their consciousness suppressed and their strength unable to be fully unleashed. But this spiritual pressure could be resisted by powerful sword or blade intent. This was why Xu Yan was unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, "An existence beyond grand masters? Not quite right, though he has surpassed grand masters, he seems incomplete." He was almost certain that the Hidden Tower Headmaster was a powerhouse near the peak of grand masters, but had not yet fully broken through. And the realm beyond grand masters involved the cultivation of the warrior's spiritual force or soul.</p><p></p><p>"My created Martial Dao Fourth Realm is more powerful and profound than the realm beyond grand masters. My direction in creating the Martial Dao is correct, and I can basically determine the cultivation direction of the Martial Dao Fifth Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan used the Hidden Tower Headmaster as a reference to deduce the realm beyond grand masters, which belonged to the spiritual or soul level of cultivation. And his own created Martial Dao Fourth Realm was still more powerful and profound, even compared to this.</p><p></p><p>"Even if they cultivate the spiritual or soul realm, their strength is not that impressive. The Hidden Tower Headmaster gives me the impression of being rather unstable, though he has not fully broken through. This can be used to infer that the warriors beyond grand masters are not that strong."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was based on Li Xuan's own strength. The warriors beyond grand masters were powerful in their spiritual or soul force, but sword and blade intent could still resist it.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has entered the Profound Realm, reaching the peak or even small success. With his Sword Dao and Descending Dragon Palm Intent, he should be able to handle the warriors beyond grand masters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood this, and his gaze turned to the Hidden Tower Headmaster with a faint smile. Finally, he could demonstrate his strength as a master in front of his disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Divine Technique "Extinguish the Deity" and the "One-Hit Kill" would finally have a chance to be used.</p><p></p><p>And this was also an opportunity to guide Xu Yan and Meng Chong to comprehend similar Martial Dao divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Headmaster's pressure continued to grow, as if brewing a world-destroying might in the air. Xu Yan's sword intent still rippled, but he was starting to feel the strain.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, my strength is too weak. If only I could unleash my second layer of sword intent, I could surely break through this pressure!" Xu Yan thought angrily.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of sword intent, he had already comprehended, but was limited by his realm and unable to manifest it.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Meng Chong's body shone with golden light, and a tyrannical blade intent surged forth, joining with Xu Yan to resist the pressure. Since the master did not act, he must be using the Hidden Tower Headmaster's hand to temper them.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Headmaster's eyes gleamed with greed. This was a great opportunity right before him. He sneered coldly, "Young ones, don't waste your efforts. Although I have not yet entered the Celestial Deity Realm, I am only half a step away. You are no match for me. Surrender peacefully, or everyone here will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his hand moved...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cane radiated a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan stood up from the chair, moved his limbs, and twisted his waist, saying, "My disciple, today your master will use this person's life to pass on the divine martial arts to you. How much you can comprehend depends entirely on yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were immediately overjoyed, their master was going to teach them powerful martial arts again.</p><p></p><p>Divine martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, they knew it must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Pavilion Master's gaze sharpened as he looked at Li Xuan, his imposing aura gradually receding, the pressure converging around him, and the cane in his hand emitting a cold, brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely solemn. Had he misjudged? This person was actually the master of Xu Yan and Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>If the disciples were so powerful, how could the master be weak?</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, sir?" the Yin Pavilion Master asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned the jade ruyi scepter in his left hand, carrying it behind his back, and replied with a light smile, "I will not deceive you by using power one level below yours to kill you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, "Master is going to use power one level below to kill the Yin Pavilion Master, this half-step Celestial Being? Is he telling me that the divine martial arts are so powerful that he can easily fight beyond his realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" the Yin Pavilion Master's gaze turned icy, and invisible ripples spread out around him, the terrifying pressure suppressing Xu Yan and Meng Chong, causing their sword and saber intents to continuously contract, like a huge mountain pressing down on them, about to collapse at any moment! An even greater pressure was bearing down on Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>The ripples surged, silently stirring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, forming a pressure as mighty as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood calmly, raising his right hand like a sword, and chuckled, "Are you ready? I'm going to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, let's see how you plan to kill me!" The Yin Pavilion Master raised his cane, and terrifying light beams emerged from it, a powerful strike already prepared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not anxious, looking at Xu Yan and Meng Chong, he said, "Watch closely, this is the divine martial arts, extinguishing one's spirit and soul!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong stared with wide eyes, afraid of missing any detail, wanting to grasp the essence.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!" Li Xuan's eyes held a slight smile. There was no better way to teach his disciples than to personally demonstrate. Since he had obtained the divine martial arts, he finally had the opportunity to use them.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yin Pavilion Master was not a true Celestial Being cultivator, he had surpassed the peak Grand Masters and transcended a step.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Pavilion Master naturally would not be careless. The terrifying light had already erupted from his cane, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>However, as Li Xuan's palm descended, an invisible sword qi instantly slashed into the Yin Pavilion Master's consciousness, rendering his various defenses almost useless.</p><p></p><p>Boom! There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to evade.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Yin Pavilion Master was about to unleash his terrifying aura and a fierce strike, his body suddenly went limp, and he fell from the air, crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness had perished, leaving only an empty shell of a body.</p><p></p><p>But his physical body still contained vitality, only his consciousness and soul had vanished!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and the others were dumbfounded. This was the divine martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quite satisfied with his first display of the divine martial arts. The Extinguish Spirit Slash combined with the One-Hit-Kill was incredibly powerful, instantly slaying the Yin Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Yin Pavilion Master, but the seven peak Grand Masters behind him also succumbed to the lingering power of the Extinguish Spirit Slash, falling from the air after only briefly struggling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the eight bodies on the ground, Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both stunned. The others might not have noticed anything special, but the two of them, with their sword and saber intents permeating the area, naturally sensed the immense power and terror of their master's palm strike!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly explained, "This is the divine martial arts. The technique I used is called the Extinguish Spirit Slash, but whether it's a saber or a sword, there is no difference. </p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Extinguish Spirit Slash, there is also the One-Hit-Kill. No matter how profound the opponent's movement techniques are, they cannot evade this strike. If they cannot withstand it, they will die without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>Pointing at the eight bodies of the Yin Pavilion Master and the seven peak Grand Masters, he said, "Do you see the problem? I did not kill their physical bodies, but their consciousness, spirit, and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Crushing the bones, dispersing the ashes, and extinguishing the soul - this is the Extinguish Soul. I only killed their souls, not their physical bodies."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited in his heart. There was such a wondrous martial art in the world, killing the soul without harming the body. If he cultivated it, in the future when he killed enemies, he wouldn't have to worry about destroying their money pouches.</p><p></p><p>Extinguishing the soul, leaving the physical body intact, the possessions unharmed! He must comprehend this divine martial art!</p><p></p><p>"As Master said, crushing the bones, dispersing the ashes, and extinguishing the soul, I've always been completely destroying the enemy, not leaving them any chance to escape. But I was still lacking in the aspect of extinguishing the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Master has already taught me, if I don't extinguish the enemy's soul, they will still have a chance to escape. But I have never comprehended the art of extinguishing the soul!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt guilty for not understanding his master's teachings earlier.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still a bit slow."</p><p></p><p>However, he had firmly remembered the special power he had sensed in the moment his master struck, that was the power of the Extinguish Spirit Slash.</p><p></p><p>Given time, he believed he could surely comprehend the divine martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the changes in Xu Yan's expression, Li Xuan was secretly satisfied. He believed that after he had personally demonstrated it, Xu Yan would definitely be able to comprehend a martial art similar to the Extinguish Spirit Slash.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had the opportunity, although not as talented as Xu Yan, he was still a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu, her talents did not lie in this area, so Li Xuan would not demand too much from her, as long as she continued to comprehend the Pill Dao martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After killing the eight people of the Yin Pavilion, Li Xuan looked up towards the city of Tieshan, where above the Tianbaoge there were three existences no weaker than the Yin Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>Was this the backbone of the Tianbaoge? Half-step Celestial Beings! However, among the three, one had a dark aura, as if containing deadly poison, or the ability to wither all living things, cultivating demonic cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>A powerful cultivator of the Demonic Sect? The three were in a confrontational state, the Demonic Sect cultivator and the Tianbaoge's experts, obviously having come together with the Yin Pavilion Master. The Yin Pavilion Master came to capture someone, while he was tasked with holding back the Tianbaoge experts.</p><p></p><p>The two half-step Celestial Beings of the Tianbaoge, although they had come for the Qingqing Pavilion, ultimately did not take action, so they could not be considered enemies. Moreover, based on the information revealed by the Tianbaoge's management, their intention was that if the Qingqing Pavilion fell, the two would intervene to snatch away Su Lingxiu, Xu Junhe, and other core members, allowing the various factions to divide up the Qingqing Pavilion and the Blossoming Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>The half-step Celestial Beings of the Tianbaoge could be spared, but that Demonic Sect expert had come for Su Lingxiu. Since he had already made a move, he would kill one more person! Li Xuan's figure disappeared from the spot, reappearing outside the Tianbaoge in Tieshan City the next moment.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

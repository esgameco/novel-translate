        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Even though she knew Senior Brother had Master's jade talisman on him and wouldn't be in mortal danger, the sudden appearance of this true spirit and the unexpected turn of events still made Su Lingxiu cry out involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The others were even more shocked and pale.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators like Taihe and Taimiao cried out in alarm. They wanted to join forces to block that Heavenly Lord level true spirit, but it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>This true spirit was not only at the Heavenly Lord level, but had also been hiding among the other attacking true spirits. It waited until it got close to Xu Yan's sword formation before suddenly launching its attack.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xu Yan appeared, Meiwu's attention had been almost entirely focused on him. Her feelings were extremely complicated, after all she had suffered losses at Xu Yan's hands several times, and even had her precious treasure stolen by him.</p><p></p><p>However, she was powerless against Xu Yan! She didn't even know why, but she subconsciously moved closer to him, even bringing along the two unrefined true spirits she was restraining.</p><p></p><p>Was she getting closer to Xu Yan to seek revenge? </p><p></p><p>Meiwu asked herself and knew she didn't have that intention. But if it wasn't for revenge, why was she subconsciously moving closer to Xu Yan? She couldn't figure it out for the moment, but she did it instinctively.</p><p></p><p>When a Heavenly Lord level true spirit suddenly attacked Xu Yan, Meiwu's expression changed. Almost instinctively, pink light instantly enveloped one of the true spirits she had already subdued and rendered powerless. With a wave of her hand, she hurled this true spirit at the one that had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she waved her other hand, sending her pink ribbon-like divine artifact flying towards Xu Yan, wanting to wrap around him and pull him out of danger.</p><p></p><p>Although Meiwu had reacted instinctively, she was ultimately facing a Heavenly Lord level true spirit. There simply wasn't enough time. The true spirit she threw hadn't reached the attacking one yet, and her divine artifact hadn't wrapped around Xu Yan, when the terrifying attack of that true spirit descended! Just as everyone turned pale with fright, and some cultivators even instinctively closed their eyes, unable to bear witnessing this scene, a hand reached out from within the world.</p><p></p><p>This hand appeared silently, looking ordinary and unremarkable. One couldn't even sense any powerful aura or strength contained within it.</p><p></p><p>However, this hand grabbed hold of that Heavenly Lord level true spirit.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a light squeeze, poof! The Heavenly Lord level true spirit instantly turned to ash and dissipated!</p><p></p><p>It was as casual and effortless as crushing an ant!</p><p></p><p>But this scene shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao, Taihe, Taikun, Taimiao, Meiwu and the others all had a moment of daze. In some past era, a powerful unrefined true spirit, also comparable to a Heavenly Lord level true spirit, had come to the outside of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>That true spirit wanted to enter the world, wanting to invade it.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, a hand had reached out from within the world and killed that true spirit with one palm strike!</p><p></p><p>That was the first time they personally witnessed Taicang take action, destroying a true spirit comparable to a Heavenly Lord level with one strike. From that moment on, Taicang became invincible and unfathomable in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They finally understood why Taicang alone could subdue Wumo, Minyu, Ao Hong and the other four, and why the other six, as arrogant as Minyu and Wumo, dared not defy Taicang!</p><p></p><p>And today, similarly a hand reached out from within the world.</p><p></p><p>But it was even more shocking and inscrutable than when Taicang acted back then!</p><p></p><p>Taicang's strike had been tyrannically powerful! But this hand just reached out gently, then lightly crushed a Heavenly Lord level true spirit, as if reaching out to squash an ant, casual and effortless.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Ancestor!" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>From this one action, one could see that the gap between Taicang and the Dao Ancestor was really quite large.</p><p></p><p>This hand reached out and crushed a Heavenly Lord level true spirit. The remaining true spirits instantly trembled in fear, some even dying from fright.</p><p></p><p>Those Realm Lord level true spirits growled and shook, actually prostrating themselves on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"It's Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu subconsciously retracted her ribbon-like divine artifact, looking somewhat embarrassed. She instinctively glanced around, and seeing that no one had noticed her previous actions, she finally relaxed and pretended nothing had happened, even putting on a shocked expression like the others.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao was now chilled to the bone, extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Taicang?"</p><p></p><p>Was that Taicang? No! Impossible, Taicang was already dead! But if not Taicang, who else would have such terrifying power, to crush his true spirit with one hand? That was a Heavenly Lord level true spirit not much weaker than himself!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this is the contingency Taicang left behind? Has a new Heavenly Lord appeared in the Taicang world?"</p><p></p><p>Even so, it shouldn't be possible to possess such terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>If the one who acted was a Heavenly Lord, then what was Tianzi? No matter how you looked at it, Tianzi seemed to be the master of this world! He controlled the world's principles, how could there possibly be a second Heavenly Lord besides him? Mu Yao knew that the Taicang world had slipped out of control and become unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>The one who acted just now definitely had power no weaker than Taicang's, perhaps even stronger!</p><p></p><p>But how was this possible? Taicang's strength was already beyond expectation, how could there be someone who could match or even surpass him? The more Mu Yao thought about it, the more frightened he became. This mission was doomed to fail, he had to return to the Unrefined Spirit Palace immediately and report all this.</p><p></p><p>The plan had changed, they needed to adjust their actions.</p><p></p><p>It might even require that person to act personally to achieve their goal!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Mu Yao's whip suddenly shattered, turning into a terrifying force that blasted open Tianzi's blockade. His figure moved, instantly fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, why rush to leave? With such an irritable temperament, why not come sweep the floor for this Dao Ancestor and wear away some of that irritability?"</p><p></p><p>A calm voice transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao's expression changed drastically. Before he could react, he suddenly felt his body tighten, firmly grasped by a hand! Like a grasshopper caught in someone's grip, it felt like his bones could snap at any moment. In an instant, he couldn't use even a bit of his power.</p><p></p><p>His life and death were no longer in his own hands! Mu Yao was terrified in his heart. What terrifying power this was - he didn't even have a chance to escape, let alone put up any resistance.</p><p></p><p>His life and death depended on a single thought of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao had no doubt that if the hand squeezed just a little harder, he would turn to ash and dissipate just like his true spirit! Grasped and enveloped by a hand, he had even lost his senses.</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, everyone only saw a hand reach out and crush a Heavenly Lord level true spirit.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw Mu Yao break through Tianzi's blockade and flee far away.</p><p></p><p>A calm voice transmitted from within the world, that hand reached forward and grasped the fleeing Mu Yao, then returned to within the world.</p><p></p><p>The crisis of Mu Yao driving true spirits to attack the world was thus resolved! The many cultivators, including</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those realm lords all felt a sense of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Although previously, when that person had crushed a realm lord with one hand, it had given them an extremely powerful shock, they had only thought it was a Heavenly Lord at most. </p><p></p><p>They even believed he hadn't reached the Heavenly Lord realm yet, just infinitely close to it.</p><p></p><p>It was unexpected that such a powerful expert existed within the world, but it was still within the realm of understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, the scene just now made them realize that person was not simply a Heavenly Lord. In that person's eyes, even Heavenly Lords were like ants!</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Ancestor!" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao now felt even more deeply how fortunate he had been to receive guidance from the Dao Ancestor back then.</p><p></p><p>Tai Miao was also in a daze. Her Dreamy Dao and Supreme Dao had begun to gradually merge, also due to this person's guidance. </p><p></p><p>She never imagined this person's strength would be so far beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"It seems even Tai Cang is not his match!" Tai Miao sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Tai He, Tai Kun and the other ancient minor world lords were completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had thought the changes in the Tai Cang world were jointly pushed by Tian Zi and that person. Given Tian Zi's status, it wasn't surprising that person would be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't think he could withstand the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>After all, only those who had participated in the fierce battle back then knew how powerful the Immutable Divine Palace was. It's worth noting that at their peak, Tai He and Tai Kun's strength was very close to the Heavenly Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Heavenly Lords varied. Tai Cang was in a league of his own, followed by Wu Mo, Ming Yu, and Ao Hong, then Fen Yun, Hong Ze and Qing Ling.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of Heavenly Lords who had opened up worlds was different from those who hadn't.</p><p></p><p>For example, Mu Xie, although he was a Heavenly Lord level expert, his strength was relatively weak, not even matching Qing Ling.</p><p></p><p>Wu Mo and the other six major Heavenly Lords were much stronger than the Heavenly Lords of the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>At his peak, Wu Mo alone could fight three Heavenly Lords from the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Tai He and Tai Kun together could restrain one Heavenly Lord from the Immutable Divine Palace, which shows how strong they were at their peak.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were among the earliest followers of Tai Cang, and had once seized the Purple Light of Creation.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they also had the chance to advance to Heavenly Lord level strength, but the Immutable Divine Palace attacked too quickly, not giving them time to improve.</p><p></p><p>Tai He, Tai Kun and the others often thought, if the Immutable Divine Palace had come a few thousand or even ten thousand years later, Tai Cang would likely have broken through to a new level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when the Immutable Divine Palace attacked, Tai Cang would definitely have been victorious!</p><p></p><p>The scene just now, that hand reaching out from within the world, easily crushing a Heavenly Lord level true spirit, easily capturing Mu Xie back - it made Tai He and Tai Kun realize that person's strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They even fantasized - could it be Brother Tai Cang? </p><p></p><p>He's not dead?!</p><p></p><p>But then their expressions darkened - Tai Cang was already dead!</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>Tai He and Tai Kun looked at each other, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Besides Tai Cang, only that person from the Immutable Divine Palace had such terrifying strength. But clearly that person from the Immutable Divine Palace wouldn't be in the Tai Cang world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would Mu Xie drive true spirits to attack the world?</p><p></p><p>"Master has captured Mu Xie back, I'm going to dissect him and study him!" Su Lingxiu said excitedly, hurrying back into the world.</p><p></p><p>When the other warriors heard this, they broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Dissect Mu Xie?</p><p></p><p>That's a Heavenly Lord level expert!</p><p></p><p>"This girl is not to be trifled with, we must never offend her!" the realm lords thought silently to themselves.</p><p></p><p>The girl looked gentle, but her heart was actually somewhat vicious. Even wanting to dissect and study a Heavenly Lord - terrifying!</p><p></p><p>With the battle outside the world over, naturally some realm lords would be responsible for cleaning up the battlefield. Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping also quickly returned inside the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also turned to leave, but before he left, he glanced sideways at Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's face unconsciously flushed red, her gaze wandering and evasive. "Did that brat Xu Yan discover I took action?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how could he have paid attention to anything else when facing such a crisis? He definitely didn't notice me taking action."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Mei Wu felt relieved, but then another thought struck her and she began to panic again. "Not good, that bastard Xu Yan, he's not thinking of extorting more treasures from me, is he? I don't have many treasures left! If he really asks, should I give them to him or not?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Mei Wu's expression changed rapidly, her heart in turmoil, feeling anxious. Her eyes secretly glanced at Xu Yan, her demeanor exuding charm, as if trying to seduce someone.</p><p></p><p>"Is that woman Mei Wu still thinking about her jade bamboo?" Xu Yan turned and left. There was no way he would return the jade bamboo to Mei Wu - he had already planted it in his own world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan leave, Mei Wu finally relaxed completely.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, you haven't fallen for that kid Xu Yan, have you?" Li Wu asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Mei Wu's furtive glances at Xu Yan really looked like a young girl stealing glances at her crush, even seeming to bat her eyelashes coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Mei Wu glared at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>That bastard Li Wu really dared to imagine such things! As if she would like Xu Yan!!</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, I think it's quite good. If you really hooked up with Xu Yan, that would be amazing. You'd have a powerful backer, an incredibly powerful backer," Li Wu said in an enticing tone.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!" Mei Wu raged. "This old lady has her dignity! How old am I, and how old is Xu Yan? I'm not like that little girl Yu Yao, actually able to stomach grass tens or even over a hundred thousand years younger than herself!"</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu!" Yu Yao exploded in anger, glaring furiously.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu glanced at her sideways. "What, did I say something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Go to hell!" Yu Yao attacked in rage, striking out directly.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu didn't back down at all. "You think I'm afraid of you? You dare to do it but won't let people talk about it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Wu broke out in a cold sweat, looking to Yan Mo, Dun Wu and the others with a pleading gaze.</p><p></p><p>However, Dun Wu, Yan Mo and the others all backed away, not wanting to get involved in this mess.</p><p></p><p>Swish! Finally, someone intervened, separating Yu Yao and Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Age is not a barrier. What's there to be ashamed of?" Tai Miao said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Mei Wu gave a little laugh and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao snorted coldly, glaring angrily at Mei Wu, but didn't continue attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Miao, who was that person?" Tai He, Tai Kun and the others approached with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"That was the Dao Ancestor!" Tai Miao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The injuries on your bodies, the lingering aura - you can seek the Dao Ancestor's help. Only the Dao Ancestor can save you," Tai Miao said solemnly, looking at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's not easy to see the Dao Ancestor. But you can find that girl Su Lingxiu. I feel she would be very interested in the strange injuries and symptoms on your bodies," Tai Miao advised.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

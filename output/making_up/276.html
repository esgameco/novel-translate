        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was sorting out his insights while deeply contemplating the methods of the martial Dao of divine abilities. As he continued to ponder, the martial Dao of divine abilities became increasingly clear to him.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand now. Master's depiction of the patterns of the laws of heaven and earth, and having me ponder them, was actually to let me know that the heavens and earth have laws, and martial artists also have laws, and divine abilities are the laws of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I was too dull-witted, and only now have I grasped the profound meaning of my master's teachings."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, thinking that if he had understood the depth of his master's teachings earlier, wouldn't he have already comprehended the martial Dao of divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>"Master imparted these teachings, hoping that I would forge my own martial path, rather than simply retracing his footsteps. That's why at the critical junctures of the martial Dao, my master never spoke plainly, but wanted me to comprehend it myself.</p><p></p><p>"I should have realized earlier that my master must have had profound intentions."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more ashamed he felt.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was studying the laws of heaven and earth in the Taicangshu, when he suddenly had a feeling and looked towards where Xu Yan was, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Has Xu Yan attained some kind of enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>Gradually entering a state of oneness with all things, with a mind free of distractions, and with his spirit fully focused within - this was the state of enlightenment that Xu Yan had reached.</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities are not far now!" Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Once one enters the realm of divine abilities, divine abilities will naturally arise. If I were to enter the realm of divine abilities, what kind of divine abilities would I give birth to? Xu Yan's attainment of divine abilities will also provide feedback, so the divine abilities I possess must be quite numerous.</p><p></p><p>"The four martial Daos, and the peculiar Qimen martial Dao - will it also possess divine abilities? Even if it doesn't give birth to divine abilities, it will definitely produce methods no weaker than divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities of the physical martial Dao, the alchemical martial Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan grew increasingly excited as he pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The self-generated divine abilities are akin to innate divine abilities, and will continuously improve as one's realm and strength increase, without any upper limit.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, one can also create posterior divine abilities, which is the method of the martial Dao divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan couldn't help but get excited.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to compile a compendium of martial Dao divine abilities. After all, for the later martial artists, even if they break through to the divine abilities realm, the divine abilities they give birth to may not necessarily be very powerful, and they may only have one divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, they will need to cultivate other martial Dao divine abilities. Since they have already reached the divine abilities realm, how could they not have the methods of divine abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan began to ponder how to compile the martial Dao divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities have levels of strength, with a distinction between minor and major divine abilities. The self-generated divine abilities may not necessarily be stronger than the created divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"For example, martial artists like Shi Er and Zhou Ying, the divine abilities they give birth to might only be minor divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Since their personal divine abilities are not strong, they can cultivate stronger divine abilities to make up for it. The greatness of the Great Desolation martial Dao lies in this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's thoughts were in flux, and the gate of the martial Dao divine abilities emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Create martial Dao divine abilities! Further perfecting it, in addition to the self-generated divine abilities, one can cultivate the posterior created divine abilities, and the created divine abilities will definitely be very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"As this martial ancestor, I've racked my brains for the sake of the martial Dao. I'll spend some time compiling a compendium of martial Dao divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The compendium of martial Dao divine abilities would encompass major and minor divine abilities, as well as various methods of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"There's more work to be done." Li Xuan sighed, realizing he would have to put in more thought and effort to compile the divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was no rush for now, as he didn't know the specifics of the divine abilities yet. He would have to wait until he broke through to the divine abilities realm and fully comprehended the wonders of divine abilities, before he could use that as a foundation to compile various divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the divine abilities he compiled could be cultivated, Li Xuan was not worried. Even if his four disciples did not cultivate or comprehend them, as long as he disseminated them, there would surely be others who could comprehend and cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>In this world, prodigies like Xu Yan might be hard to find, but there would be no shortage of geniuses. Someone would eventually comprehend the divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had the Daodejing as an aid, so the divine abilities he compiled would be relatively complete, and the difficulty of comprehension could be reduced. Even if the major divine abilities were hard to comprehend, the minor divine abilities could still be comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had grasped the essence of divine abilities, he still needed a bit of time to thoroughly comprehend the martial Dao of the divine abilities realm.</p><p></p><p>But it would only take a few more days.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to delve into the eighth page of the Taicangshu, the laws of heaven and earth, while waiting for Xu Yan to completely comprehend the martial Dao of the divine abilities realm.</p><p></p><p>On the third day of Xu Yan's comprehension of the martial Dao of the divine abilities realm, a message arrived - the Wanshi Alliance's Luozhou Alliance had been exposed and was engaged in a great battle with the Lingxong Families.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had rallied the scattered cultivators to unite and resist the Lingxong Families, and was even gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingxong of Luozhou and the Families are so weak?" Fang Hao was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao and the others were all excited and eager to act. Once the Luozhou Alliance succeeded and gained a foothold in Luozhou, the Yuzhou Alliance should also emerge.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened and shook his head, saying, "The Luozhou Alliance won't succeed."</p><p></p><p>"Master, why?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The foundations of the Lingxong and the Families are not so easily shaken. Moreover, since the Wanshi Alliance was passively exposed, it means the Lingxong have already largely grasped their situation.</p><p></p><p>"The only uncertain factor is that the strength of these scattered cultivators may have exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>"But that's all there is to it. Once they recover, the Luozhou Alliance will surely suffer a heavy blow, and the even stronger Lingxong have not even acted yet."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Xuan was quite pessimistic about the Luozhou Alliance, and continued, "Aside from the scattered cultivators who have deep enmity with the Lingxong Families, the rest will just watch. They may even attack the Wanshi Alliance, trying to curry favor with the Lingxong.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the slogan of the Wanshi Alliance is too ordinary."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Li Xuan felt the need to guide his disciple Fang Hao, who was the lord of the Yuzhou Alliance of the Wanshi Alliance. He couldn't make the same mistakes, nor should he have the idea of fighting for a place for the scattered cultivators, as those scattered cultivators would then rally behind him.</p><p></p><p>After voicing his thoughts, Li Xuan proceeded to instruct his disciple again, and finally said, "Instead of shouting about the unity of the scattered cultivators, it would be better to shout 'The princes and nobles are no more than common men.' Those with hot blood will naturally respond.</p><p></p><p>"The scattered cultivators of the Lingyu have been tamed by the Lingxong for too long, their minds filled with the desire to join the ranks of the Lingxong Families, thinking that by doing so they can be elevated and become the superior ones.</p><p></p><p>"These scattered cultivators, once they enter the Lingxong, will be the most ruthless towards other scattered cultivators. You must remember not to be too naive.</p><p></p><p>"For the Wanshi Alliance to succeed, aside from having the strength to resist the Lingxong Families, it must also let the world's scattered cultivators see the benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Tell the world's scattered cultivators that by overthrowing the Lingxong, the resources of the Lingxong can be evenly distributed..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing his master's guidance, Fang Hao suddenly gained a clear understanding. He now realized that the Wanshi Alliance needed to have the strength to contend with the supreme Lingxong if it wanted to succeed, otherwise it would all be empty talk.</p><p></p><p>As for the strength of the Wanshi Alliance, Fang Hao was not very clear, and even Yu Gao didn't know much, but he did say that there were no shortage of powerful figures within the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Fang Hao, Li Xuan continued to delve into the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Daodejing on the spiritual platform opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>He became greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally comprehended the martial Dao of the divine abilities realm!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities and martial arts techniques I created have allowed you to break through to the Divine Abilities Realm. </p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt his divine essence and divine will fuse together, and his entire being was undergoing a process of sublimation. The light in the Nirvana Palace shone brightly, and his Spiritual Throne became even larger, purer, and more rhythmic.</p><p></p><p>As the divine will was being refined, a human form coalesced on the Spiritual Throne. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sensed the changes within himself, the wondrous nature of his divine soul. He had completely mastered the martial arts techniques of the Divine Abilities Realm, and he couldn't help but sigh in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, you truly are the pioneer of my martial dao! Divine abilities, the principles of the martial artist! The martial dao that martial artists cultivate!</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Throne, Li Xuan opened his eyes, and at this moment, his divine soul was almost indistinguishable from his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, the Great Dao Scripture fell into his palm, and he could feel the grandeur of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Great Dao Scripture in one hand, the golden light enveloped his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul of Li Xuan on the Spiritual Throne revealed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the divine martial soul!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan truly felt the immense power of the Divine Abilities Realm martial dao that he had created.</p><p></p><p>The principles of heaven and earth recorded in the Taicangshu, the first page of the laws of heaven and earth, he had already comprehended them, and he had a genuine understanding of the profundity of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm and condensed the martial dao divine soul. You have obtained the divine ability 'Emulate Heaven and Earth'!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Xuan's divine ability was born.</p><p></p><p>"Emulate Heaven and Earth, I never expected that I would give birth to such a divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Emulate Heaven and Earth, this divine ability was absolutely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm and condensed the martial dao divine soul. You have obtained the divine ability 'The Cosmos Within the Sword'!"</p><p></p><p>The second divine ability was born.</p><p></p><p>As expected, a sword dao divine ability would be born.</p><p></p><p>The Cosmos Within the Sword, with a single sword strike, the cosmos is within, and in the cosmos, life and death are decided in a single thought! "Very good, very powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>His divine soul had condensed, and two divine abilities had been born, these were innate divine abilities, the principles of the martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm and condensed the martial dao divine soul. You have obtained the divine ability 'Tranquil Sword that Slays the Divine'!"</p><p></p><p>The third divine sword ability was born.</p><p></p><p>"This sword dao divine ability is formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Tranquil Sword that Slays the Divine, as long as he obtains a wisp of the enemy's vital energy, no matter where the enemy is, no matter how far away, he can strike their divine soul with a sword.</p><p></p><p>"As one's realm and strength increase, this divine ability will be on par with karmic divine abilities, without needing the enemy's vital energy, he can still strike them from afar with a sword!"</p><p></p><p>This sword dao divine ability was undoubtedly extremely powerful. No matter where the enemy fled, he could strike them down with a sword.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even though he could strike the enemy's divine soul with just a wisp of their vital energy from a distance, if the enemy could withstand this attack, he would still be unable to slay them.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, this divine ability was extremely powerful and difficult to defend against. Even if the opponent's strength was similar, facing this sudden attack, they would likely be unable to defend against it.</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm and condensed the martial dao divine soul. You have obtained the divine ability 'Descent of the Divine Dragon'!"</p><p></p><p>Another martial dao divine ability was born.</p><p></p><p>This one, however, belonged to the Dragon Palm divine ability, and when unleashed, it was as if a true divine dragon descended.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the power of the Descent of the Divine Dragon was related to one's own realm.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, the might of this divine ability was extremely powerful, possessing the true power of a divine dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Palm has now reached the divine ability realm, so it truly is using a dragon to subdue a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a little embarrassed, as the casual remark he had made to Xu Yan about using a dragon to subdue a dragon had actually come true in the end.</p><p></p><p>"Four divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly elated in his heart, having entered the Divine Abilities Realm, his divine soul had condensed, and he had given birth to four divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"You have broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm and condensed the martial dao divine soul. You have obtained the divine ability 'Traversing Heaven and Earth in an Instant'!"</p><p></p><p>The fifth divine ability was born! Traversing Heaven and Earth in an Instant!</p><p></p><p>"This is a speed-type divine ability, crossing the heavens and earth in an instant, even faster than the Divine Lightning Traverse."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Lightning Traverse was extremely powerful, and once it could be fully unleashed, it could traverse the void like divine lightning.</p><p></p><p>But Traversing Heaven and Earth in an Instant, the speed of this divine ability was also extremely swift, able to cross the north and south of the heavens and earth in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the heavens and earth in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even though the divine abilities were powerful, they still required sufficient strength to support them.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, even though Li Xuan had broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm, he would still be unable to truly traverse the heavens and earth in an instant, crossing the north and south in a single moment.</p><p></p><p>"Only five divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>After the Traversing Heaven and Earth in an Instant divine ability was born, no more divine abilities were born, and Li Xuan felt a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"But it's enough. Emulate Heaven and Earth, The Cosmos Within the Sword, Tranquil Sword that Slays the Divine, Descent of the Divine Dragon, Traversing Heaven and Earth in an Instant... the divine abilities are all different, and they are all extremely powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that he should be satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The Emulate Heaven and Earth divine ability, once unleashed, would be far more powerful than the Six Zhang Golden Body, and if combined, it would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Cosmos Within the Sword, both offense and defense, unparalleled in the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>The Descent of the Divine Dragon, belonging to the tyrannical and unmatched divine abilities, with the descent of the divine dragon, who could stand against it?</p><p></p><p>"These are the divine abilities I gave birth to upon breaking through to the Divine Abilities Realm. When Xu Yan breaks through to the Divine Abilities Realm, he will also receive feedback, and I will then give birth to more divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"When Meng Chong breaks through, he will also give birth to divine abilities of the physical body, and the Six Zhang Golden Body will also undergo a transformation, becoming a powerful divine ability, similar to Emulate Heaven and Earth?</p><p>When Su Ling Xiu breaks through, she will also receive divine ability feedback, and the divine abilities of the Pill Dao martial artist..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Divine Abilities Realm, the martial dao would advance further, and he now had a deep understanding of divine abilities. It was time to put this into action and compile a divine abilities martial classic.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities must have a distinction between great and small. Although the divine abilities I have given birth to are all great divine abilities, for cultivators like Shi Er, if they break through to the Divine Abilities Realm, the divine abilities they give birth to may not be as powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I'll use this as a standard to distinguish between great and small divine abilities, based on the perfection and strength of the martial dao principles."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm going to compile a divine abilities classic, I also need to clearly organize the classification of divine abilities, such as offensive divine abilities, defensive divine abilities, speed divine abilities, and so on."</p><p></p><p>Compiling a martial dao divine abilities classic was not something that could be accomplished in a day or two, it would undoubtedly be a laborious task. But for the sake of the flourishing of his own martial dao, for it to become more perfect and powerful, Li Xuan could only persevere.</p><p></p><p>"Once the divine abilities martial classic is compiled, I'll first have my disciples study it, one person one copy, and they can comprehend as much as they can."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities martial classic had been compiled, how could he let it gather dust? Of course, he had to give it to his disciples and let them comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"I have already entered the Divine Abilities Realm, in this spiritual domain, who else can be my opponent? The supreme experts of the Transcendent Spirit Sect, can they block a single palm strike from me? Even if dozens of supreme experts surround and attack me, can they withstand a full-powered strike from me?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was filled with self-confidence. The Divine Abilities Realm was not just about the powerful divine abilities, even his casual martial arts techniques were almost divine abilities. The difference between now and the past was like night and day!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

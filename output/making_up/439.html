        <h1>Chapter 439</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Armored Beast was a type of celestial spirit from beyond the heavens known for its extremely strong defense. Every time hunters wanted to kill an Armored Beast, it required multiple people working together to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, when the gathered martial artists saw Jiang Buping so easily kill the Armored Beast, they were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, you come from the greater realm and have seen much. Do you know what secret technique this person used to so effortlessly hunt and kill the Armored Beast?" </p><p></p><p>In another area where over a dozen martial artists had gathered, someone asked the man in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Soul secret technique!" The man who was asked replied in a deep voice after taking a deep breath, his expression uncertain and surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss! It's actually a soul secret technique. This directly destroyed the Armored Beast's consciousness!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful soul secret technique - this person must not be provoked."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a martial artist from the Taikun Realm, Brother Liang was able to see through it at a glance."</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan had no reaction to the flattery from those around him. Instead, he stared at Jiang Buping in the distance, his heart extremely unsettled!</p><p></p><p>Even for a soul secret technique, being able to destroy an Armored Beast's consciousness in one strike was an extremely terrifying technique. Moreover, the person using it must have extremely strong soul power. Even those in the Taikun Realm may not necessarily have such a powerful soul secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping? It's actually him!" Liang Quan's heart was unsettled as he recognized the young man who killed the Armored Beast as Jiang Buping, the abandoned son of the Jiang clan of Taikun. Some rumors about Jiang Buping were no longer a secret in the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Especially for him - Liang Quan was originally a member of a force affiliated with the Jiang clan, so he knew more about this matter. He had also heard some of the hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't his soul tainted by the immutable energy, causing him to lose his intelligence and become muddleheaded? Didn't he disappear long ago? According to calculations, he should have perished under the contamination of the immutable energy. Why has he appeared here? Moreover, he doesn't look muddleheaded at all, and his strength is even greater than before."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liang Quan was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Could one actually recover after being contaminated by the immutable energy?</p><p></p><p>"This matter must be reported back to the Jiang clan. With Jiang Buping's talent, he will likely be able to break through to the Immortal realm. Once he breaks through to the Immortal realm, it will be a huge threat to the Third Young Master."</p><p></p><p>"The elders of the Jiang clan will certainly welcome him back into the clan. In order to bring him back, they will surely be willing to offer generous treatment and various conditions."</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>For great clans, talent and strength were the most important. The more monstrous the talent, the more it could strengthen the clan and bring huge benefits to the clan.</p><p></p><p>This was also why, although Jiang Buping was born of a concubine and not favored by the Jiang clan leader, he was still accepted into the Jiang family and given the treatment of a genius, precisely because of his talent.</p><p></p><p>When Jiang Buping was crippled, he became worthless and useless, and would only bring shame to the Jiang family, so he was mercilessly driven out.</p><p></p><p>If Jiang Buping broke through to the Immortal realm, with his talent, he would surely become a top Immortal in the future. Those clan elders would welcome him back again.</p><p></p><p>Face and reputation were no longer so important to those old undying clan elders. They only cared about the interests of the family!</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan did not stay in the Celestial Pit any longer. He made excuses to bid farewell to everyone and hurriedly returned to the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping did not know that his identity had already been recognized. After putting away the Armored Beast's corpse, he looked towards the depths of the Celestial Pit.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Celestial Pit, there were two celestial spirits comparable to those in the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records I saw in ancient texts, these celestial spirits live in the lands beyond the heavens. They are contaminated by the immutable energy from birth, so they cannot develop intelligence, but their strength is extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Celestial spirits with Immortal realm strength are either in their youth or of the lowest class. The Armored Beast I just hunted belonged to the youth category."</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I wonder if I can kill an Immortal realm celestial spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping pondered, deciding to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Celestial spirits had no intelligence. Even if he couldn't kill it, he would have a way to retreat, such as using pills to attract its attention and then taking the opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>Like beasts, the instincts of celestial spirits made them easily distracted and attracted by food.</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that spirit beasts are descendants of celestial spirits that entered the world from beyond. Because there is no immutable energy in the world, the offspring born were nourished by the world's spiritual energy and spiritual qi generation after generation, finally developing intelligence, resulting in today's spirit beasts."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping recalled some ancient texts he had seen in the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>The strength of spirit beasts depended on their bloodline. Each advancement was a transformation of the bloodline. The higher the level and stronger the power of their celestial spirit ancestor, the higher the upper limit of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Once an atavistic bloodline was born with intelligence, such a spirit beast would be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>So far, no such powerful spirit beast existed in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping headed straight for the depths of the Celestial Pit. Before he got close, he heard thunderous snoring. A huge celestial spirit was lying on the ground sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"Good opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was secretly delighted. He concealed his aura and approached this celestial spirit.</p><p></p><p>If ordinary martial artists approached, they would be detected immediately. However, Jiang Buping practiced the Extreme Soul Martial Way. He had no ordinary martial artist's aura, nor the aura of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his concealment technique was extremely mysterious, so this celestial spirit did not detect anyone approaching at all.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Jiang Buping suddenly attacked, thrusting out his spear and piercing the celestial spirit's head.</p><p></p><p>Roar! That celestial spirit let out a terrifying roar. Its eyes widened and its aura erupted, but it did not attack immediately. Instead, it began rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"So strong, actually unable to annihilate its soul!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's heart tightened. Taking advantage of the celestial spirit rolling in agony before it could recover to attack, he thrust his spear out again.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: God Slayer!</p><p></p><p>Puff! There was another even more terrifying roar. The entire Celestial Pit shook. Weaker celestial spirits were frightened and trembling, running wildly in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful celestial spirit was also scared. It watched the rolling celestial spirit from afar, not daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The commotion here quickly alarmed the martial artists in the Celestial Pit. Even the Immortal Venerable guarding this place was alerted and came over.</p><p></p><p>That celestial spirit raised its head, its blood-red eyes staring fixedly at Jiang Buping. Its ferocious nature erupted, and a terrifying aura rolled all over its body.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's heart skipped a beat. Although this celestial spirit had no intelligence, its soul may have become particularly powerful due to living in the immutable energy, even more tenacious than the soul of an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"One more strike will surely destroy its soul!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping took out a pill. Just as the celestial spirit was about to attack, he suddenly threw the pill a short distance away.</p><p></p><p>The celestial spirit that was about to attack suddenly looked at that small pill. With its keen senses, it discovered that this pill could alleviate its pain.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Unable to attack anymore, it turned around, lowered its head, and stuck out its tongue to lick that pill.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping seized this opportunity and thrust his spear downward once again, piercing the head of this otherworldly spirit.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Divine Spear seemed to shatter something.</p><p></p><p>Poof! That pill also dissolved instantly as Jiang Buping struck.</p><p></p><p>Roar! An even more terrifying howl rang out. That otherworldly spirit frantically unleashed attacks, rolling, leaping, and charging wildly.</p><p></p><p>Some smaller otherworldly spirits that couldn't dodge in time were instantly smashed to bloody pieces.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping retreated far away, waiting for this otherworldly spirit to die.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists in the celestial cave frantically retreated, except for that Immortal Venerable, who had a solemn and shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>His gaze toward Jiang Buping had changed.</p><p></p><p>Not yet an Immortal Venerable, yet able to hunt and kill an Immortal-level otherworldly spirit?</p><p></p><p>That was a technique to attack the soul? With such an ability, he would have few rivals at the same level. Once the opponent broke through to the Immortal realm, he doubted he could withstand it himself.</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy from the Great Realm?" he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Only the Great Realm possessed soul secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Thud! That otherworldly spirit fell down. Though not yet completely dead, its consciousness was on the verge of scattering.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping approached again and decisively finished it off, collecting the huge otherworldly spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Senior Brother's storage ring is truly useful. Ordinary storage bags couldn't hold such a huge otherworldly spirit."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I should also extract some Immutable Qi."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring that Immortal Venerable, Jiang Buping continued exploring the celestial cave, looking for a place to extract Immutable Qi.</p><p></p><p>The Taikun Realm was one of the three Great Realms among the 36 Divine Realms, second only to the First Great Realm of Taihe.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang family, known as the Jiang Clan, was the dominant force in the Taikun Realm, wielding immense influence. Though they didn't rule the entire Taikun Realm, they controlled half of it.</p><p></p><p>The entire Taikun Realm's major forces were divided into one clan, three sects, and two family clans.</p><p></p><p>The one clan was the Jiang family's Jiang Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan occupied half of the Taikun Realm alone, while the other half was ruled by the three sects and two family clans. Among the three sects and two family clans, one family clan was a subsidiary of the Jiang Clan, with its current patriarch being the grandson of a Jiang Clan elder.</p><p></p><p>For the Taikun Realm, the Jiang Clan was supreme. Even if the other three sects and one family clan joined forces, they wouldn't dare to oppose the Jiang Clan. They formed a delicate balance with each other.</p><p></p><p>They maintained their existing territories while avoiding conflict with the Jiang Clan, outwardly maintaining cordial relations.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew that the Jiang Clan's ambition was to rule the entire Taikun Realm and become the number one clan in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, although the other three sects and one family clan were not as powerful as the Jiang Clan, they were not without the ability to resist. Moreover, some major forces in the entire Divine Realm did not want an overly powerful family.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this balance had been maintained until now, with everyone forming a tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>In matters concerning the safety of the Taikun Realm and suppressing the celestial cave, the Jiang Clan took the lead, yet everyone firmly held their own territories. The Jiang Clan also dared not use force to coerce, lest it cause turmoil in the Taikun Realm and give other realm's major forces an excuse to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Even so, they were always scheming behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>For example, arranging a marriage alliance with the Yunshang Sect, one of the three sects, to form a nominal rule over the entire Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yunshang Sect Master's daughter, Yun Yan'er, was initially betrothed to the Jiang Clan prodigy Jiang Buping. According to their secret agreement, Jiang Buping was ultimately supposed to marry into the Yunshang Sect, though this point was not announced publicly.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Buping was unexpectedly crippled, and the engagement was called off. As a result, Yun Yan'er and the Jiang Clan patriarch's third son, Jiang Tianming, seemed to be flirting with each other, apparently in love.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan proposed that Yun Yan'er marry Jiang Tianming.</p><p></p><p>But the Yunshang Sect Master had not yet agreed and was still considering it.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that although Jiang Buping was an illegitimate son, he was indeed a prodigious talent. If he married into their sect, the Yunshang Sect wouldn't lose out, and they would form a kind of alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, if Yun Yan'er married Jiang Tianming, the Yunshang Sect could easily become a subsidiary force of the Jiang Clan if they weren't careful. Therefore, both sides were still in discussions, with no conclusion yet.</p><p></p><p>But to outsiders, it seemed that Yun Yan'er would most likely marry Jiang Tianming, as they were well-matched and like a divine couple. The landscape of the Taikun Realm was about to undergo some subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>In a certain courtyard of the Jiang Clan.</p><p></p><p>As the third son of the current Jiang Clan patriarch and a renowned prodigy of the Jiang Clan, Jiang Tianming resided in this courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, Jiang Tianming had broken through to the Immortal realm and had just recently come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tianming, you're the third youngest Immortal Venerable in the history of our Taikun Realm," Yun Yan'er said admiringly as she leaned against Jiang Tianming.</p><p></p><p>"Third, huh." Jiang Tianming looked at the beauty in his arms. This woman had a unique quality about her, as elusive as clouds and mist. Even he was moved by her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, indeed." Yun Yan'er nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's because one person was crippled. Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it into the top three," Jiang Tianming said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Yun Yan'er's expression froze for a moment as she thought of a certain person. She smiled and said, "That's not necessarily true. The Immortal realm is difficult to cross after all. Although he was the youngest True King Venerable, it's unknown whether he could have broken through to the Immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Though she said this, she knew that Jiang Buping breaking through to the Immortal realm would have been no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"The person is already crippled, and probably dead by now. Let's not mention him anymore," Jiang Tianming said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" Yun Yan'er nodded obediently.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, someone named Liang Quan is requesting an audience. He says he has confidential matters to report," a maidservant approached and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Quan?" Jiang Tianming frowned. "Who is he? What confidential matters?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, he's a subordinate of the family. As for the confidential matters, he says he can only report them in person and it's not convenient to relay them," the maidservant said softly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming raised an eyebrow and said, "Tell him that using confidential matters to seek an audience with me for merit will only have one outcome if it's not something I consider important. Let him think it over carefully. If he still wants to see me, then bring him in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master!" The maidservant bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the maidservant brought Liang Quan in.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Quan pays respects to the Young Master!" Liang Quan fell to his knees with a thud, respectfully saying.</p><p></p><p>"Speak. What confidential matters?" Jiang Tianming asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan raised his head and looked at the maidservant beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Jiang Tianming snorted coldly. "If the so-called confidential matters are not important enough for me to take notice, you'll be fed to the dogs."</p><p></p><p>With that, he waved his hand, and the maidservant retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, rest assured. This matter is of great importance. As soon as I learned of it, I rushed back immediately to report to you!" Liang Quan said respectfully and flatteringly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Yun Yan'er in Jiang Tianming's arms, hesitating whether to speak.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

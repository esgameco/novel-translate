        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This girl, could it be that she wants to dissect the divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through Li Xuan's mind, and he couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>This girl Su Lingxiu, on the path of alchemy and martial arts, has indeed been progressing further and further, and she has even started preparing to dissect the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that she will dissect the person's divine soul, but won't be able to put it back together?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the scene in the room appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was setting up a restriction, a restriction she had specially researched for the alchemy and martial arts, similar to the restriction for sealing spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>A soul-sealing restriction.</p><p></p><p>She then dripped a drop of elixir on Jiao Li's head.</p><p></p><p>"All ready!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was a bit nervous, but also excited, and asked, "Is there really no problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there won't be any problems. For an alchemy martial artist to treat the divine soul, to understand the divine soul, is a basic skill."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu affirmed.</p><p></p><p>"If I can thoroughly understand the secrets of the divine soul's origin, find the root of the divine soul, then the cultivation and enhancement of the divine soul will be greatly improved, and I can also quickly improve myself."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's face was full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu manipulated the golden needles inserted into Jiao Li's head with her Verdant True Essence, causing a faint ripple to gradually emerge from Jiao Li's head.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the ripple took on a human form, solidifying into what appeared to be a somewhat illusory, wave-like person.</p><p></p><p>This was Jiao Li's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine soul was somewhat damaged, looking a bit tattered.</p><p></p><p>At the core of the divine soul, there were two faint spiritual rhythms that seemed about to dissipate, and those were the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms that Jiao Li had refined.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the divine soul of a powerful expert, it's so solidified."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er exclaimed in awe.</p><p></p><p>A ripple in the shape of a person appeared on her head, which was her divine soul, and compared to Jiao Li's divine soul, it was much more illusory and not as solidified.</p><p></p><p>"These are his refined Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms, I must seal them up so they don't dissipate."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu carefully input her Verdant True Essence into the divine soul to seal the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms, preventing them from dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Inputting the Verdant True Essence into the divine soul would not cause any damage, but rather enhance the vitality, which was the special ability of an alchemy martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Lingxiu began to delve into the divine soul, exploring the secrets of the divine soul, and Yue'er, both nervous and excited, stared intently, wanting to see and comprehend the secrets of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li's divine soul was quite damaged, and the treatment Su Lingxiu was using was not to restore it with elixirs, but to externally repair the damage to the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The true essence transformed into threads and a small knife, carefully repairing Jiao Li's divine soul, and gently separating out some to explore the secrets of the divine soul, then fusing them back in.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er watched intently, silently observing the changes in Jiao Li's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Lingxiu had also researched Yue'er's divine soul, but due to Yue'er's divine soul being newly formed and too fragile, she was unable to delve deeply into it. Now, this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"The divine soul is related to consciousness, to everything. Losing the divine soul means losing consciousness, memory, and so on. My true essence won't damage the divine soul, but can even repair it. But if I were to refine spiritual treasures with nourishing effects on the divine soul, would they also not damage the divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked curiously as she solemnly explored Jiao Li's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Refining such spiritual treasures would be very difficult, the materials are not easy to find," Yue'er thought for a moment and replied.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's exploration of Jiao Li's divine soul became deeper and deeper, even triggering a flash of memory, a scene from Jiao Li's battle at the Lightning Cloud Manor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Lingxiu had a realization, and a secret technique emerged in her mind - the technique to explore a person's memories.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched silently, sighing inwardly that Su Lingxiu's curiosity was strong, and she had the heart to explore, from dissecting corpses to now researching the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"A truly qualified alchemy martial artist, she's about to take another step forward on this path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently anticipated.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu, in exploring the secrets of the divine soul, has gained a rudimentary understanding of the technique to search memories. You have obtained the Soul Search Technique!"</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Book of the Dao emanated golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Search Technique! Indeed, I've gained something. Now I can simply soul search to interrogate enemies and obtain secrets, how simple and straightforward!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>He continued to silently observe Su Lingxiu's exploration of the divine soul. Although she had gained an understanding of how to search the memories within the divine soul, Su Lingxiu avoided doing so, as this was the privacy of the patient Jiao Li, not an enemy.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's principles were still firmly in place.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu, in deeply researching the secrets of the divine soul and exploring the origin of the divine soul, has obtained the True Understanding of the Divine!"</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Dao came again.</p><p></p><p>The True Understanding of the Divine pertains to the secrets and roots of the "divine" of all living beings in the heavens and earth, including the divine soul, the primordial spirit, and so on.</p><p></p><p>With the True Understanding of the Divine, Li Xuan instantly comprehended the origins of the divine soul, the primordial spirit, and all the profound mysteries. He had completely fathomed the consciousness of all living beings in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I have now comprehended all of this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>With the True Understanding of the Divine, he could easily create secret techniques and divine abilities related to the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>He could even use special methods to enhance the intelligence of lowly beasts, making their "divine" complete and their intelligence sound.</p><p></p><p>This had already allowed Li Xuan to touch upon an extremely profound realm.</p><p></p><p>"I've gained some understanding, on how to strengthen the divine soul, how to weaken the divine soul, how to make the divine soul more robust."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Although she was still far from grasping the secrets of the divine soul's origin, she had still gained some harvests.</p><p></p><p>"I've also gained some insights!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was also very excited.</p><p></p><p>She finally understood what the divine soul of a powerful expert was like.</p><p></p><p>"Why are these Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms scattered?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had repaired Jiao Li's divine soul, and looking at the two strands of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms at the core of the divine soul, she asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather Yue Changming's Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms, bestowed by an elder, were much thicker and stronger than these two strands combined, after he had refined them into his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Although Jiao Li had two strands of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms, seemingly one more than Yue Changming, in terms of strength and the utilization of the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms, he was far inferior to Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because he was injured, so the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms split into two strands."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu didn't understand the specific state of the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms refined by Spiritual Domain martial artists. In her martial arts knowledge, the refined Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms would continuously condense and grow stronger, not split into one strand after another.</p><p></p><p>So she instinctively thought that Jiao Li's two strands of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Mechanisms were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because of the trauma, it has split into this state.</p><p></p><p>"Help him a bit, and also integrate the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, consider it as a reward for researching the divine soul." Suling Xiu thought this way, her true essence entered the divine soul, using restrictive methods and the power of elixirs, she slowly merged the two strands of spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As the two strands of spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth merged, Jiao Li's divine soul slightly rippled, in an instant, the spiritual charm of the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms surged greatly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw this scene and couldn't help but sigh, Jiao Li had paid his divine soul for Suling Xiu to research, but he also gained a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>He understood why the cultivators in the Spiritual Realm refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth in separate strands, rather than refining them into a complete whole.</p><p></p><p>This was limited by the refining methods of the cultivators in the Spiritual Realm, as well as the lack of the method to fuse the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth within the divine soul, and the self-control of the divine soul was also a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Since they couldn't refine and fuse them into one, in order to continue to grow stronger, they could only make up for it with quantity.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the refined quantity was not limitless, and it was related to the strength of the divine soul. Refining nine strands of spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>The scattered spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth naturally were not as strong as the refined complete spiritual mechanism, so Jiao Li's breakthrough this time was considered a success.</p><p></p><p>"This girl, she still lacks experience, a small problem occurred, but she didn't even notice it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, but he didn't remind Suling Xiu, this was a small problem, and Jiao Li would naturally know about it when he woke up.</p><p></p><p>At that time, let Suling Xiu solve it herself, which can enhance her cognition and understanding of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu merged Jiao Li's spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, took out a nourishing elixir for the divine soul, and directly dissolved and infused it into Jiao Li's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>This treatment ended here, it was very perfect.</p><p></p><p>Then, Suling Xiu let Jiao Li's divine soul return to his body and lifted the restriction.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Zhu Xingzheng was anxiously waiting for the treatment result, while Cai Lingér seemed a bit restless, occasionally glancing at Li Xuan sitting on the chair.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to leave, but didn't dare to speak up.</p><p></p><p>They could only wait for Jiao Li's treatment result to see what the situation was.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Yue'er pushed the hospital bed out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had a joyful expression and said, "Okay, the treatment is over, I'll wake him up now."</p><p></p><p>"It's already over?" Zhu Xingzheng was a bit surprised and asked, "Miss Su, are you saying that the divine soul injury has been healed?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng and Cai Lingér had an unbelievable look on their faces, the divine soul injury, healed in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu held a golden needle between her fingers and inserted it into Jiao Li's head, the golden needle trembled a few times, waking the sleeping Jiao Li.</p><p></p><p>"Get up and take a look, your injury is almost completely healed, you just need to rest for a few days and you can fully recover!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li opened his eyes, initially a bit dazed, then was shocked!</p><p></p><p>"My divine soul has recovered!"</p><p></p><p>The originally damaged divine soul was now completely restored, although it seemed a bit weak, but after resting for a few days, it could fully recover and return to its peak.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that the two strands of spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth he had refined were now merged into one, but it was not weaker than the two strands, but even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"The two strands of spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have fused together?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The divine soul has recovered?" Cai Lingér was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was also stunned, then became excited, he had made a great contribution, and he had also gained the support of such a great doctor, as long as he didn't die, he wouldn't have to worry about the depth of his injuries, they could all be healed!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it has recovered!" Jiao Li was excited and excited, he was about to get up from the hospital bed to express his gratitude to Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, his arms stretched up.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? What am I trying to do with my hands?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to sit up from the hospital bed, but his legs flipped over to the back of his head.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li: ???  Suling Xiu and Yue'er looked at Jiao Li's strange actions with a blank expression.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng and Cai Lingér were the same, why was he flipping his legs over his head?  Jiao Li suddenly felt a bit panicked, he wanted to put his legs down, but when he arched his waist, his upper body straightened up, and his head came out from between his legs.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li: ???  Suling Xiu, Yue'er: ...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng, Cai Lingér: ...</p><p></p><p>"Shifu, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to test how your body has recovered?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>He felt that something was not quite right with his shifu!</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li was completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to turn his head to look at Cai Lingér, but his head turned in the opposite direction, and then he realized a serious problem.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness and his body were not coordinated! For example, he clearly wanted to lift his leg, but his hand was raised instead! After some pondering and contemplation, Jiao Li finally returned to his original lying position on the hospital bed, his consciousness lifted his left leg, but his left hand was raised.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness raised his left hand, but his left leg was raised...</p><p></p><p>He immediately had a look of collapse on his face, although his divine soul had recovered, but it seemed an even bigger problem had occurred.</p><p></p><p>"Shifu, did something happen to you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng looked at Jiao Li, who was alternately raising his hands and feet, and wiped the cold sweat, carefully asking.</p><p></p><p>"A big problem has occurred."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li had a look of collapse on his face and said, "I clearly wanted to raise my hand, but it was my foot that was raised instead, I wanted to raise my foot, but it was my hand that was raised..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng and Cai Lingér: ???  The two of them didn't understand what Jiao Li meant at first, how could the foot and hand be the same?</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu, however, was stunned, suddenly realizing the problem, and had a sheepish look on her face, taking out an elixir and stuffing it into Jiao Li's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"A small problem, I'll help you treat it again."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er quickly pushed the hospital bed back into the room, leaving Zhu Xingzheng and Cai Lingér dumbfounded, their foreheads sweating, was there just a medical accident?</p><p></p><p>After about an hour, Yue'er pushed the hospital bed back out.</p><p></p><p>"This time there are no problems at all."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said confidently.</p><p></p><p>She woke up the sleeping Jiao Li and said, "Sit up, I've completely healed you this time."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Jiao Li was excited, sitting up from the hospital bed.</p><p></p><p>He moved his hands and feet, twisted his waist and so on, relieved in his heart, he was completely recovered.</p><p></p><p>No longer was it the problem of his consciousness raising his hand but his foot being raised.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss, for your healing grace, I, Jiao Li, owe you a favor, if you need anything, just ask!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li solemnly bowed in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

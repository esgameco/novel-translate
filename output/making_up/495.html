        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, his entire being was undergoing transformation and sublimation.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Dao Body shimmered with radiance as heaven and earth were born within. Divine abilities transformed into the laws of heaven and earth, and infinite celestial power surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The spirit platform became like the dome of heaven, with the primordial spirit residing above heaven and earth, yet also seeming to merge with it.</p><p></p><p>I am heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are me.</p><p></p><p>The body becomes heaven and earth, divine abilities become natural laws!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan comprehended the changes of his breakthrough, marveling at the mysteries of heaven and earth and the essence of its laws. Many realizations flooded his mind, and he felt as if he was truly embarking on the path of martial arts for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"I've taken another step closer to transcending heaven and earth, another step closer to standing shoulder to shoulder with him," Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>That towering figure he had seen in the wilderness, so immensely powerful that he could only look up to it in awe - now the distance to that figure's height was growing ever shorter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also learned the identity of that majestic figure.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cang!</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Tai Cang realm, and the creator of this world. But he had already perished.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang was only stronger than me, but not strong enough, which is why he fell. But I, Xu Yan, will surpass him and become invincible, second only to my master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood surged with excitement as he set this martial arts goal for himself, one he would strive for all his life.</p><p></p><p>As for his master, Xu Yan had already given up the extravagant hope of surpassing him. That was an insurmountable peak. If he could reach even 50% of his master's strength at the same level, he would be proud enough.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not surpass his master, he would become second only to his master! Xu Yan immersed himself in the insights of breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm, while also consolidating his new level.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough to Heaven and Earth realm, the Wisdom Sword realm was also perfected at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Sword realm was now in sight.</p><p></p><p>Various divine abilities were also improving and breaking through. The Yin-Yang Immortal Sword had now transformed into the Yin-Yang Embrace, endlessly generating within heaven and earth. Both its defensive and offensive capabilities had undergone tremendous enhancement and transformation.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I could easily subdue Ao Yuxue with a wave of my hand. Even if I encountered an adult true dragon, I could subdue it without much effort."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan assessed his current abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm was a technique for subduing dragons, and adult true dragons were at least at the Divine Venerable realm in strength. But with Xu Yan's current power, subduing a Divine Venerable realm true dragon would not pose much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"True dragons at the Supreme realm surpass me in strength, but with the Dragon Subduing Palm, I could still contend for a while. Though I couldn't fully subdue them, I wouldn't be helpless either."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a rough estimate of his dragon-subduing power.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary martial artist practiced the Dragon Subduing Palm, they naturally couldn't subdue dragons so easily or overcome stronger opponents to subdue a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was no ordinary martial artist. When he used the Dragon Subduing Palm, he possessed the power to overcome stronger foes and subdue true dragons.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that he had broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm and his divine abilities had been enhanced, he should have no problem manifesting eighteen divine true dragons to entangle a Supreme realm true dragon.</p><p></p><p>He might not be able to fully subdue it, but he could ward off the dragon's threat.</p><p></p><p>As for endurance, after breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm, Xu Yan feared prolonged battles least of all.</p><p></p><p>"However, even among Supreme realm true dragons, there are differences in strength. With my current abilities, facing a Supreme realm true dragon would still be quite challenging."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood that martial artists of the same realm could vary greatly in strength, sometimes with vast differences between them. True dragons were no exception - even at the same level, their powers were not necessarily equal.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Xu Yan was confident that even if he couldn't win, he could easily escape.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm, his Traceless Thought divine ability had become even more powerful. If he wanted to leave, mere Supreme realm beings couldn't stop him. They wouldn't even be able to track his whereabouts, let alone chase and kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how many true dragons come."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>If Ao Yuxue's grandfather came in person, he would certainly be no match. But with his master present, there was nothing to worry about. In fact, he might even have a chance to witness firsthand how his master subdues dragons.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan broke through, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao also arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has cultivated the martial path you created and broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm. You have reached small accomplishment in the Dao Establishment realm, with a hundredfold increase in heaven and earth amplification!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. The feeling of increasing in strength was the greatest joy in the world.</p><p></p><p>He had reached small accomplishment in the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a minor realm breakthrough, the power increase it brought was enormous.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has perfected the Wisdom Sword realm. You have reached small accomplishment in the Holy Sword realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao continued to provide feedback.</p><p></p><p>"How is your comprehension of the Heavenly Dao coming along?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a good mood and felt inclined to give Old Xiao some guidance.</p><p></p><p>"I've made some progress!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao became excited as soon as he heard this.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao is truly the path forward for us!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any questions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was elated to hear this and hurriedly replied respectfully, "I have a few doubts. Please enlighten me, Ancestor of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao eagerly explained his various doubts about comprehending the Heavenly Dao, seeking guidance.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan offered some pointers, and Old Xiao suddenly felt enlightened. After respectfully thanking him, he hurried back to seclude himself and contemplate the Qi of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I should prepare the martial arts methods for the next realm as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan exhaled.</p><p></p><p>He had already devised the realms above the Dao Establishment realm, but Li Xuan was not satisfied with this. He continued to ponder and refine them as much as possible, striving to maintain their power while perfecting them further.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Xu Yan broke through to the Heaven and Earth realm, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping all began preparing for their own breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the four of them still needed some time before breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao continued to arrange and strengthen the great formation of the Qinghua Sect, constantly refining his own heaven and earth wondrous patterns, transforming them into the laws of the wondrous gates, and constructing a wondrous gate heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This was a long process. Fang Hao used the Qinghua realm as practice, constantly arranging and strengthening formations. As he walked, he laid down wondrous gate grand formations, using this to reflect upon himself and construct his wondrous gate heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's alchemy and medical martial path, upon breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm, constructed an alchemy and medical heaven and earth that was both full of vitality and blazing with flames. She used the Heavenly Furnace as practice to strengthen her heaven and earth methods.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong practiced the physical body martial path, so his physical body heaven and earth naturally differed, particularly showcasing the strength and dominance of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was somewhat special. The Extreme Soul martial path was the path of the ultimate soul, and his soul did not have the concept of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, the Extreme Soul martial path at the Heaven and Earth realm also had its unique aspects. It underwent further transformation, with the soul becoming as solid as heaven and earth, no longer showing any trace of being a soul body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up towards the Nine Mountains realm. At this moment, an intense battle was erupting there, far surpassing the power of Immortal Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiaolong always fails to recognize his place!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head. No matter what, Red Cat was still the number one beast in the great beast martial path, and the pet of himself, the Ancestor of the Dao. How could anyone else shake his position as the Great Beast King?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was purely asking for trouble!</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains realm, a giant striped tiger emanated powerful beastly might, with a halo of beast energy shimmering above its head.</p><p></p><p>Opposite the striped tiger was a...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blue-backed, white-bellied true dragon also exuded rolling demonic energy, and unleashed a dragon's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Are you itching for trouble? You think just because you've become a true dragon, you can challenge my position as Great Demon King?" Red Cat sneered.</p><p></p><p>Back on Canglan Island, he had been able to suppress Jade Little Dragon, and now he could suppress him even more!</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon suddenly felt some regret. He realized that Red Cat's Great Demon aura was somewhat terrifying, and there seemed to be an energy that could suppress his own demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>"I acted rashly!" </p><p></p><p>But having already stated his position, he could only grit his teeth and continue the fight to determine a winner.</p><p></p><p>"The position of Great Demon King was originally determined by strength between us. Now I feel my strength surpasses yours, so why can't I be the Great Demon King?" Jade Little Dragon said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I, Red Cat, did indeed say that the Great Demon King position is determined by strength. Back then I was stronger than you and Little Toad, so naturally I was the boss.</p><p></p><p>"However, since you feel that becoming a long dragon means you can overpower me and compete for the top position, that's not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"But you'll have to bear the consequences of failure!" Red Cat sneered.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Jade Little Dragon let out a dragon's cry. The other demon generals and commanders watching all trembled, feeling a suppression in their bloodlines and souls.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!" </p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger was shocked. When he first met Jade Little Dragon, his strength was far inferior to his own. But in such a short time, he had already left him far behind.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger couldn't help but look at Red Cat with some concern that he wouldn't be able to withstand it, and the Great Demon King position would change hands. </p><p></p><p>No matter what, Red Cat was of the same species as him and they had a better relationship, so he naturally hoped Red Cat would win.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Red Cat let out a tiger's roar. At this moment, the tiger's might surged forth. But this tiger's might was different from ordinary tiger might - it contained a vast and boundless Great Demon aura.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the fierce intent of a peerless great demon had been revealed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll use you to test my new divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat chuckled, his tiger body shaking. As light burst forth, three identical Red Cat figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>Each Red Cat figure was rolling with demonic energy and surging with Great Demon might. Moreover, each Red Cat figure used a different Great Demon divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle erupted instantly. In just a short time, Jade Little Dragon was smashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"How did you get stronger again? Why aren't you suppressed by the dragon's might?" Jade Little Dragon had a dejected look.</p><p></p><p>"Mere dragon might, how could it suppress me!" Red Cat sneered and said, "Don't forget, I'm the great cat raised by the Ancestor of the Dao, and I'm the Great Demon King. I'm not an ordinary spirit beast or true spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon's heart sank, feeling even more regret. How could he have forgotten this - Red Cat was raised by his master's teacher!</p><p></p><p>That was the Ancestor of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, with Jade Little Dragon being smashed to the ground again and again.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender, I surrender! I won't compete for the Great Demon King position anymore!" Jade Little Dragon hurriedly conceded.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender? I won't stop until I've beaten you to my heart's content today!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat grinned viciously, pinning Jade Little Dragon down and beating him violently.</p><p></p><p>When it was all over, Jade Little Dragon lay sprawled on the ground. He felt like every bone in his body was about to shatter, and he looked like he was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>"The Great King is mighty!" Wind Spirit Tiger roared excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The other demon generals and commanders also erupted in earth-shaking roars: "The Great King is mighty!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat sat on the golden throne with a satisfied expression. This was the demon race he had established!</p><p></p><p>"As of today, our demon race has twelve demon generals. I hope you will all improve your strength quickly and gain a firm foothold in this great change in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat looked down at the demon generals below.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Great King!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat raised his head to look at the Qinghua Realm, muttering to himself: "I should go back for a visit. It's been too long since I went back - what if the master has forgotten about me?"</p><p></p><p>Now that the situation in the Divine Realm was turbulent, with great changes in the world and the Dao Realm merging with the Divine Realm, the demon race would inevitably face impacts.</p><p></p><p>He had to go back and curry favor with the master. Only with a powerful backer could the demon race continue to grow strong.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to assign tasks to the demon generals and commanders to guard their territory while he returned to the Qinghua Realm for a visit, Red Cat suddenly looked up to the left.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha also immediately looked up in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon, sprawled on the ground, also raised his head.</p><p></p><p>"Demon race? These spirit beasts have all gathered here, and they seem to be somewhat different. They could be useful."</p><p></p><p>Two figures floated over.</p><p></p><p>When Wind Spirit Tiger and the others saw them, their gazes immediately sharpened, and they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Tianhe Realm cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"Wanbao Alliance?" Wind Spirit Tiger said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger? One of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings? Submit, I happen to need a mount to ride. It'll be you, or else, death!" </p><p></p><p>One of the Tianhe Realm cultivators was surprised for a moment, then said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No, look, is that a true dragon on the ground? When did another true dragon come to the Divine Realm?" </p><p></p><p>The other Wanbao Alliance expert said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a true dragon, and its strength doesn't seem too great? Capture him!"</p><p></p><p>The two Tianhe Realm cultivators from the Wanbao Alliance revealed excited looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You two have trespassed into my demon race's territory and ignored this king. You should give this king an explanation, or else don't think about leaving!" </p><p></p><p>Red Cat stood up from his throne and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>These two Wanbao Alliance cultivators had completely ignored him, which the Great Demon King Red Cat could not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>"Wanbao Alliance cultivators, and Tianhe Realm at that. Could they be planning to find Meng Chong?" Red Cat mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance's great enemy was undoubtedly Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had broken through the Immortal Realm's limit, they probably felt confident again and were preparing to seek revenge on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"You're the Great Demon King? Xu Yan subdued dragons, today I shall subdue the Demon King and make a name for myself in the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Tianhe Realm cultivators laughed and said.</p><p></p><p>With increased strength came increased confidence, boldness, and arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the Divine Realm so far, only those at the Taihe Realm could break through the Immortal Realm's limit. Those at the Jiushan Realm still could not break through the Immortal Realm's limit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in his view, no matter how strong this Great Demon King was, he was at most a prodigy within the Immortal Realm, and could not possibly be at the Tianhe Realm level of strength.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was furious.</p><p></p><p>His tiger claw grabbed, drawing his great sword, and he slashed out with a violent strike.</p><p></p><p>"I've cultivated the sword dao until now, and today I finally have a chance to show its power!"</p><p></p><p>As Red Cat made his move, the two Wanbao Alliance experts immediately changed expression, hurriedly joining forces to defend.</p><p></p><p>"How are you..."</p><p></p><p>The two were shocked and angry. How could the Great Demon King's strength be so powerful? It was no longer at the level an Immortal Realm being should have.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, wasn't he a spirit beast? How could he cultivate sword techniques? And these sword techniques were extremely domineering and powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Frogs in a well, how could you know the extent of this king's power? Today I shall slay Tianhe Realm cultivators to demonstrate this Demon King's might!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat sneered.</p><p></p><p>His great sword chopped down, rolling with demonic energy, wild and matchless. In just a few exchanges, a head went flying.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

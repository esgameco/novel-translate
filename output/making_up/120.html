        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 120 The Technique of Sound Killing, the Frustrated Thousand Illusion Magician</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was listening intently to the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, comprehending the power within it. The crisp flute sound seemed to directly invade one's mind and body.</p><p></p><p>The heartbeat and the flute sound seemed to be merging together, as if the cessation of the flute sound would also stop the heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>Those who heard the flute sound had their mind and spirit thrown into disorder, with hallucinations appearing before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the latent thoughts in one's heart were all magnified, forming illusions.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of sound-killing technique is rather special and difficult to resist. The weak will be trapped in it without any way to extricate themselves once they hear it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he had gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Illusion Magic Sound is quite mysterious, but it's too weak. I don't know if it's because the cultivation method itself is weak or because the other party's strength is not strong enough?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled. He had grasped the sound-killing technique, which should be extremely powerful, able to instantly kill the enemy. It should be a formidable killing art.</p><p></p><p>Yet this Thousand Illusion Magic Sound was not as powerful as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to deliberately defend against it. The Thousand Illusion Magic Sound was like an ordinary melody in his ears, unable to cause any interference to him at all.</p><p></p><p>The voice of Du Yuying beside him suddenly reached his ears, and Xu Yan was delighted, as another three seventh-grade spirit herbs had been obtained.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Du Yuying, her fair face had already flushed red, her gaze becoming hazy, almost falling into an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Yet she was still stubbornly holding on.</p><p></p><p>"She's quite remarkable, a third-grade cultivator, able to endure this far."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The guards were all swaying and even gesticulating, seemingly about to fight each other.</p><p></p><p>The maid Cui'er in the carriage was whimpering, trapped in some kind of illusion.</p><p></p><p>The carriage driver, a first-grade martial artist, had his aura constantly surging, his eyes turning red, panting heavily, and growling from his throat.</p><p></p><p>He had already been bewitched by the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound.</p><p></p><p>As for Yan Kuan in the carriage, he was currently cultivating to resist the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, only his condition was a bit better than Du Yuying's.</p><p></p><p>This showed that Du Yuying was indeed quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, deal!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan agreed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his palm, a vast and majestic aura emerged, enveloping Du Yuying. The Thousand Illusion Magic Sound was completely neutralized, unable to penetrate this powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Might of the Subduing Dragon Palm!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying regained her senses, exhaling a deep breath, and put her veil back on, her heart deeply shaken. Just how powerful was this young man's strength?</p><p></p><p>She had felt a mighty aura enveloping her, and the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound entering her ears was like an ordinary melody.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the guards, including Yan Kuan in the carriage, their conditions were not good.</p><p></p><p>She sighed helplessly and spoke again, "Young master, one seventh-grade spirit herb to dispel the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound!"</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan shook his head and said, "No, I haven't had enough yet!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was dumbfounded. Was he really treating the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound as just a melody to listen to?</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, she said again, "Then please, young master, help them escape this predicament."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Might palm aura expanded, covering everyone. Instantly, the guards all regained their senses, but they were panting heavily, looking utterly exhausted, as if they had just experienced a great battle.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's heart was filled with awe. Even a Patriarch like him had to exert his full strength to resist the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, yet Xu Yan had easily suppressed it. </p><p></p><p>"Could he be a Great Patriarch?" </p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan thought, but then shook his head to deny it. "No, it's impossible. He must be a Peak Patriarch or a Pinnacle Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Even so, he was already greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still so young, yet he had already reached the level of a Patriarch, even a Pinnacle Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Yan Kuan felt like a complete waste.</p><p></p><p>The gap between people was truly so vast.</p><p></p><p>After helping the others escape the predicament, Xu Yan immersed himself in listening to the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, feeling that if he could comprehend the sound-killing technique, his strength might increase further.</p><p></p><p>"My master was right, I should take the essence and make it my own. This Thousand Illusion Magic Sound has something worth learning."</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the horse, Xu Yan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the flute sound became more urgent, like clashing blades, like a galloping horde of horses, an aura of killing intent emerging from the sound.</p><p></p><p>The sound waves were violent and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed. This time, the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound was completely directed at him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sound waves were like blades, like surging waves, constantly sweeping towards him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slightly raised his palm, and the Dragon Might palm aura surged, colliding with the sound waves.</p><p></p><p>He continued to comprehend the sound-killing technique.</p><p></p><p>As he listened, the sound-killing technique became clearer and clearer to him.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"My Subduing Dragon Palm has mastered the Dragon Might, but it lacks the Dragon's Roar. How can I display the vast Dragon Might, how can I display the Dragon's Wrath?</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon's Roar shakes the heavens and earth, this is the true essence of the Dragon's Wrath."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan gained enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>On his palm, a golden giant dragon appeared, its eyes shining brilliantly. The Dragon Might surged, and at a certain moment, the golden dragon opened its mouth and let out a dragon's roar.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With the dragon's roar, a majestic aura appeared in the heavens and earth, making all beasts kneel in submission.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's still not enough. This is not truly the Dragon's Roar, it lacks the power to slay enemies, it's just a loud sound."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately realized that this dragon's roar was only loud in sound, but lacked the power to slay enemies.</p><p></p><p>However, this golden dragon floating in the air, looking down from above, caused the flute sound to suddenly stop.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Magician, whose gender was unknown, had a grave expression, their body emanating faint ripples, their aura surging as they gripped the flute in their hand, a cold light flashing from it.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, to interfere in this matter? Have you slain all the Patriarchs of my Demon Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Magician's voice was soft, sounding like a man's and a woman's.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had no interest in figuring out their gender. He only wanted to continue comprehending the sound-killing technique, to truly grasp the essence of the Dragon's Roar.</p><p></p><p>Even more, he wanted to integrate the sound-killing technique into the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers are boundless, how could they be silent?</p><p></p><p>A silent Mountains and Rivers would lack vitality, lacking a certain artistic conception.</p><p></p><p>The moment he heard the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, Xu Yan had these realizations. If the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers was not a lifeless silence, but had a vibrant energy, then his comprehension of the second realm of the Heart Sword would be taken a step further.</p><p></p><p>So when the Thousand Illusion Magician stopped playing the flute, he became dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you stop playing the flute? You were playing it quite well, don't stop, keep going. I'm in a good mood, so I won't kill you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Magician's facial muscles were twitching in anger. This arrogant young man actually treated him, the Thousand Illusion Magician, like a street performer?</p><p></p><p>Keep going?</p><p></p><p>Did he really think that the true power of the Thousand Illusion Magician lay only in the Thousand Illusion Magic Sound?</p><p></p><p>That was because no one had ever survived under his Thousand Illusion Magic Sound, so no one had ever forced him to reveal his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you dare to insult me, you must die!"</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered and transformed into layers of illusory images, and cold glints flew out from the flute, like a rain of stars falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was shocked, the Thousand Illusion Demon Sound was not his strongest technique?</p><p></p><p>This was a lethal art!</p><p></p><p>The cold glints scattered like raindrops, impossible to dodge or resist.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks converged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Yan Kuan's expression was horrified. Even at his peak, he would not be able to withstand this strike from the Thousand Illusion Demon Master!</p><p></p><p>However, remembering Xu Yan's strength in slapping a Sect Master to death, he felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon roared out from Xu Yan, sweeping and circling. The countless cold glints fell upon the golden dragon, creating small craters on its body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the golden dragon was covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's heart tightened at the sight.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's expression changed, revealing a worried look.</p><p></p><p>The invincible golden dragon was now wounded and seemed unable to last much longer.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is not weak, you are the strongest Sect Master I've encountered."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan acknowledged the Thousand Illusion Demon Master's power.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, this was the peak Sect Master of the Inner Realm, his strength was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also a Sect Master, but he was too young, having just entered the Sect Master realm, still far from the peak.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master sneered, his voice seeming to come from all directions.</p><p></p><p>His figure became more substantial, and cold glints continued to emerge.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the flute emitted an icy glow, growing longer, like a shimmering sword, with increasingly sharp aura.</p><p></p><p>It surrounded the tea house, enveloping Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed ready to strike and completely annihilate the enemy at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"This person is quite strong, although a Sect Master of the Demon Cult, he cultivates techniques not meant for killing. He must be one of the more eccentric warriors of the Demon Cult.</p><p></p><p>"If I use my full strength, I might kill him, and then I won't be able to hear the Thousand Illusion Demon Sound anymore. Injuring him is also not good, as the Demon Sound he plays when injured will be inferior."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, feeling somewhat troubled.</p><p></p><p>Using too much force might kill the Thousand Illusion Demon Master, but using too little would not force him to play the Thousand Illusion Demon Sound for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a conflicted expression, the golden dragon continuously resisting the Thousand Illusion Demon Master's attacks while Xu Yan evaluated the Demon Master's strength, trying to determine how much power he should use to subdue him without seriously injuring him and still force him to play the Demon Sound.</p><p></p><p>In the process, the golden dragon's wounds kept increasing, and it would not last much longer.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master's gaze was icy cold. "Kid, I'm going to tear you to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked by the golden dragon's might, like a true dragon had descended. However, it was still just a dragon form, far from the true Dragon Manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan had a grave expression. "The Thousand Illusion Demon Master is too strong, it seems Xu Yan can't withstand him. What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying also frowned, inwardly anxious.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan gritted his teeth, his aura surging, as he stepped forward. "Little brother, I'll try to hold off the Thousand Illusion Demon Master while you take the Miss and escape. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him strangely. "You're still injured, are you sure you can withstand him? Won't you just get killed instantly?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." </p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan coughed up a mouthful of old blood, suddenly feeling his injuries had worsened.</p><p></p><p>The words, though unpleasant, seemed to be true. In his current state, he might indeed get killed instantly.</p><p></p><p>He felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Am I still a Sect Master? Why is the gap so large?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan felt weary, a sense of futility overwhelming him.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating martial arts for decades, was this all he amounted to?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, prepare to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master laughed coldly, the flute erupting with cold glints shooting towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll risk my life to block this strike!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's gaze was resolute, even if he died, he would try to block the Thousand Illusion Demon Master's attack. His aura surged as he roared and charged forward.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw something else.</p><p></p><p>An even larger golden dragon emerged, blocking all the attacks!</p><p></p><p>Pu!</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan coughed up blood!</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he had surged with a desperate determination to block the attack, regardless of his injuries, Xu Yan had already summoned an even larger golden dragon to defend against it.</p><p></p><p>You still had this much power left?</p><p></p><p>Why did you look so conflicted, as if considering whether to abandon the Miss and flee?</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's eyes were moist, his injuries had just started to recover, but now they had worsened again!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him strangely, wondering why this Sect Master was so fragile.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Kuan, are you alright? The attack just now shouldn't have affected you, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, I just got a bit excited and my injuries flared up again."</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan wiped the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with a lifeless despair as he returned to the carriage to tend to his injuries.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master's expression kept changing. How was there another golden dragon? And it seemed even stronger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth, his eyes gleaming with cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Shatter!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unleashed his full power, the flute erupting with dazzling cold light that crashed down upon the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>Pu!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you..."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master sneered as he charged towards Xu Yan, but then he saw another golden dragon appear, even stronger than the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>It circled around him, its majestic presence constantly surging.</p><p></p><p>Blocking his retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master's expression changed repeatedly, his figure moving to try and flee into the air.</p><p></p><p>He was no match!</p><p></p><p>But then, another golden dragon appeared above him!</p><p></p><p>Now there was no escape route left.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Illusion Demon Master, let's make a deal."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, finally having blocked the Demon Master's escape.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of deal?"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master's face was gloomy, realizing he had fallen into a trap.</p><p></p><p>"Keep playing the Thousand Illusion Demon Sound for me, and I'll let you go once I'm satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to humiliate me? I, the Thousand Illusion Demon Master, am not a street performer!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Master erupted in rage.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you want to die?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master felt utterly humiliated. What kind of freak was this?</p><p></p><p>"If you want to live, then play for me. If you don't want to live, I'll turn you to dust!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I want to live!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Demon Master gritted his teeth and spoke.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

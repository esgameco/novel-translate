            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 86: Xu Yan's Enlightenment, the Sword Intent of Heaven and Earth</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A bolt of lightning struck down from the sky, the thunderous roar deafening.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, "The might of heaven and earth is truly extraordinary. Even with my current strength, intercepting such a powerful lightning strike would be quite difficult."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly grew curious - did this world's martial dao have the concept of tribulation crossing?</p><p></p><p>"I didn't include tribulation crossing in the martial dao I created. It would be foolish to arbitrarily give myself a heavenly tribulation test."</p><p></p><p>As for whether his strength would be insufficient without undergoing a heavenly tribulation, that was not an issue.</p><p></p><p>Who said only those who crossed the heavenly tribulation were truly powerful?</p><p></p><p>What if one could directly control the might of heaven and earth, the power of the heavenly tribulation, without needing to cross it?</p><p></p><p>"As long as the cultivation method is well-designed, and the disciple is talented enough, anything is possible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has successfully cultivated the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist. Your Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the golden finger had arrived - Meng Chong had comprehended and cultivated the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, excellent. Since Meng Chong has comprehended the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist, it's time to pass on the next cultivation method to him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. He already had the cultivation method for the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist in his mind, and he couldn't help but marvel at its power.</p><p></p><p>With a slight punch, a powerful thunderous force was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"Against a demonic cultivator like Xue Wuxin, the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist would be a devastating counter."</p><p></p><p>If Xue Wuxin were still alive, the outcome against the current Meng Chong would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The rain was pouring down, but the fierce wind had stopped. The lightning and thunder had also ceased.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong returned from the rain.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have comprehended the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good! You have not disappointed me. Now, settle down and I will pass on the Eight Trigrams and the Dao of the Sword to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to pass on the Eight Trigrams to each of his disciples, and see what they could comprehend from it. Each disciple's insights would be different.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Trigrams contained profound mysteries, including body techniques. As the disciples' cultivation levels increased, they might gain new realizations.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xu Yan had comprehended the Feather-light Body Technique, and during his battle with Xue Wuxin, he had also gained insight into the Transposition Technique.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what kind of body technique Meng Chong would be able to comprehend from the Eight Trigrams.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would also comprehend the Transposition Technique by chance?</p><p></p><p>Three days later, in the familiar mountain forest outside Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>The inner part of the forest had become a flat, barren land, without a single blade of grass.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and a trigram diagram appeared on the ground, rippling with true qi.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Eight Trigrams, containing the profound principles of heaven and earth. Body techniques can also be comprehended from it. I shall now pass on the Dao of the Eight Trigrams to you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the knowledge of the Eight Trigrams, as well as his own ponderings on the mysterious and powerful principles within.</p><p></p><p>"Have you remembered it all?"</p><p></p><p>He asked Meng Chong solemnly in the end.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I have remembered it all," Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Eight Trigrams diagram, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the Eight Trigrams is truly profound and mysterious. It sounds so powerful, containing the wondrous principles of heaven and earth. One can continue to gain insights from it."</p><p></p><p>He decided to focus on comprehending the Eight Trigrams in the coming time.</p><p></p><p>"I have already comprehended the Thundercloud Golden Ape Fist. Next, I will try to comprehend a body technique or movement technique from the Eight Trigrams.</p><p></p><p>"My elder brother's body technique is extremely mysterious, and he also comprehended it from the Eight Trigrams. I won't learn my brother's technique; I want to comprehend my own unique body technique.</p><p></p><p>"What I comprehend myself will be the most suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong started walking on the Eight Trigrams diagram, deep in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded him, "While comprehending the Eight Trigrams, do not forget to continue cultivating, to fully refine your qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Meng Chong responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, continue your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then left.</p><p></p><p>Now it was up to Meng Chong to see when he could comprehend his own unique body technique from the Eight Trigrams.</p><p></p><p>As for the incantation for the body technique, Li Xuan had not written one. Meng Chong's talent lay not in memorizing incantations, so giving him one might even be counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Qi Kingdom, the commotion caused by the appearance of the powerful cultivator had gradually subsided. The officials all knew that even if they found a powerful cultivator, they could not shake the position of the Guo family.</p><p></p><p>The fervor for seeking out the powerful cultivator had also waned. The officials all wanted to obtain martial arts techniques from the cultivator, or have their descendants become the cultivator's disciples.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, none of them had even seen the cultivator's face.</p><p></p><p>In the rear garden of the Qi King's palace, in Xu Yan's residence.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was holding a wooden stick, sparring with Xu Yan. Neither of them was using any internal qi or blood energy, relying solely on their sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time they had done this.</p><p></p><p>"Xu brother, are you sure this kind of sparring will help you comprehend the sword intent?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>After numerous discussions on the martial dao, especially on the Dao of the Sword, Xie Lingfeng had come to realize the truth - the martial arts he had cultivated were false!</p><p></p><p>He had not even grasped the basics of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Since he had recognized his mistake, he naturally wanted to correct it. He asked Xu Yan what true martial dao was and how to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Rebuilding his martial arts foundation was no longer an option.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's answer was to transform his Grandmaster-level cultivation into Xiantian (Primordial) realm cultivation, and the first step was to refine Xiantian true qi.</p><p></p><p>This true qi was similar to the internal qi of martial artists, but it was more pure, more mysterious, and had greater potential and power.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Yan, the internal qi of inner realm martial artists was actually true qi, but since they cultivated false martial arts, their qi was also false.</p><p></p><p>That was why it lacked the purity and power of true Xiantian qi.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng found this reasonable and believed it wholeheartedly. However, he did not know how to refine his internal martial qi into Xiantian true qi.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could not provide a method either, but he told Xie Lingfeng that once he broke through to the Xiantian realm and understood its mysteries, he might be able to find a way to refine and elevate his qi.</p><p></p><p>For now, Xu Yan wanted to comprehend the sword intent before breaking through to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>The earlier he could comprehend the sword intent, the stronger his foundation in the Dao of the Sword would be. If he could not comprehend the sword intent within a month, Xu Yan would choose to break through instead.</p><p></p><p>That was why Xie Lingfeng was sparring with Xu Yan, to help Xu Yan comprehend the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Xu Yan nodded. "The comprehension of sword intent lies in calming the mind, appreciating the wonders of heaven and earth, and also in the sword techniques. I have a feeling that continuously sparring with you will be helpful in comprehending the sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thrust out a sword strike, and asked curiously, "Xu brother, what is the sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>It all sounded so profound and mysterious to him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that time, they all had a dazed expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain of the sword dao, there was only the legend of the supreme sword techniques, the powerful and invincible sword qi, the cold and sharp sword beams. Although there was occasionally the mention of sword intent, it was a different concept from the sword intent that Xu Yan spoke of.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent is the intent within the sword, which is my intent, as well as the intent of heaven and earth, and the intent of the sword dao - a kind of enlightenment, a realm that accords with heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said slowly after pondering.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng slightly opened his mouth, looking a bit dazed. He understood each word, but when put together, he was dazed - it was too profound, far beyond his reach.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he sighed inwardly: "I am known as the Sword Saint Cliff, the number one sword dao prodigy in a thousand years, but compared to Brother Xu, I'm like a joke!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xie Lingfeng was startled.</p><p></p><p>He stared wide-eyed, looking at Xu Yan in shock.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he felt the tree branch in his hand had become heavier, as if it no longer obeyed his control.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that an inexplicable, unfathomable yet powerful and profound force was emanating from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Faint, elusive, indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Yet there was a sense of sharpness, as well as an endless, eternal charm.</p><p></p><p>The sword technique was no longer under control.</p><p></p><p>His hand was trembling, and the tree branch in his hand gradually crumbled into powder, causing him to hastily let go and retreat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were slightly narrowed as he entered a state of oneness with the world, and an aura kept emerging in circles.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent is the intent within the sword, and since the sword is in my hand, then it is my intent... What should the intent of the sword dao be? The sword must have the sharpness and keenness, which cannot be lacking, while I have a flawless jade-like body, enduring and eternal.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao has no limits, and the sword dao also has no limits, it should be eternal and indestructible..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan contemplated his own cultivation, and the images of his master's words and actions emerged in his mind - sitting elegantly and comfortably, moving freely and unrestrained, every gesture and movement was just the ordinary lifestyle of a common person.</p><p></p><p>Yet, his master was such a high-level figure.</p><p></p><p>What kind of realm was that?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind recalled the scene of his arduous cultivation in the small mountain village, feeding chickens and cooking every day, while his master lived a comfortable life. The more he thought about it, the more he felt his master's realm was too high.</p><p></p><p>"This is what my master said - the Dao follows nature!"</p><p></p><p>The scene of his master teaching the Eight Trigrams also emerged - Qian, Kun, Zhen, Dui...</p><p></p><p>The more he recalled, the more Xu Yan gained enlightenment: "It turns out that from the very beginning, my master was guiding me to comprehend the sword dao, to comprehend the sword intent, laying the foundation for me.</p><p></p><p>"I've just been ignoring it all this time.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it now, my master's every word and action accord with the great Dao, while I was just approaching the great Dao from a close distance.</p><p></p><p>"My master's realm is truly unfathomable, almost reaching the level of the great Dao."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan attained enlightenment, his sword heart became clear and his sword intent became lucid.</p><p></p><p>A sword intent surged out from him.</p><p></p><p>The sword heart has reached a small completion.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the sword intent!</p><p></p><p>"The mountains and rivers are indestructible, withstanding the wind and rain, the mountains and rivers are also indifferent, burying countless lives... My first sword intent shall be called the Mountain and River Sword Intent."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes, and the Mountain and River Sword Intent emerged, heavy, enduring, yet also sharp and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the shocked Xie Lingfeng, he smiled and said, "Brother Xie, how about you try my sword intent? Don't worry, I'll go easy on you."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to test the power of this Mountain and River Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Xie Lingfeng accompanying him in sword practice, he wouldn't have comprehended the sword intent so quickly. Finally, before breaking through to the Innate Realm, he had comprehended the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was completely shocked. So this is the sword intent?</p><p></p><p>It was too profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he solemnly said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to experience this so-called sword intent and see if it was truly as powerful as described.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword from the sheath, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held the tree branch and said, "Brother Xie, you can strike first!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he struck first, Xie Lingfeng wouldn't have a chance to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng didn't hesitate, and struck out with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword light turned into a flying rainbow, crossing the distance between them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth seemed to resonate with a momentary hum, and Xie Lingfeng vaguely felt as if he saw the mountains and rivers appearing, endless and eternal, yet also sharp and indifferent, seemingly able to bury all living beings.</p><p></p><p>The flying rainbow sword light disappeared into the mountain and river, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>And the reflection of the mountains and rivers seemed to be on the verge of crumbling, the rivers roaring, as if about to bury all living beings, and he - was among the living beings about to be buried!</p><p></p><p>His heart was terrified!</p><p></p><p>So this is the sword intent?</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng hurriedly struck out with his sword, one strike after another, the flying rainbow sword lights flashing, stirring up layers of cold light, constantly pouring down on the Mountain and River Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had struck out a hundred sword strikes!</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Mountain and River Sword Intent dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The tree branch in Xu Yan's hand turned to powder.</p><p></p><p>He felt his mind was a bit dizzy, as if his spiritual energy had been consumed too much, and his qi and blood had also been depleted by about a tenth.</p><p></p><p>His jade-like body was shining brilliantly, and his qi and blood were quickly recovering.</p><p></p><p>The emptiness in his spirit was also slowly recovering.</p><p></p><p>"The sword intent is too powerful, with my current strength, the consumption is too great when I manifest it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the realm of sword intent was extremely high, and he was only at the Qi and Blood Realm, the first realm of the martial dao. Manifesting the sword intent consumed too much, beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"It's because I have a jade-like foundation that I can endure it. If it were a golden bone foundation, the Qi and Blood Realm could probably only manifest the sword intent once or twice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was silently contemplating.</p><p></p><p>Although his consumption was great, he could still continue to manifest the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>He could sustain it for five or six times.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was marveling at the great consumption of the sword intent, but Xie Lingfeng had already been shocked.</p><p></p><p>Just a single sword intent?</p><p></p><p>He had exerted his full strength, unleashing a hundred sword strikes, yet he could only dispel this one sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could clearly feel that the sword intent could erode the power of his sword techniques. The flying rainbow sword light sank into the sword intent, as if trapped in a quagmire, its power reduced to only about a third.</p><p></p><p>He realized a problem - sword dao cultivators who have comprehended the sword intent possess the ability to overwhelm those who have not.</p><p></p><p>Once one has grasped the sword intent, they can rise above the higher realms!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it sounded so profound!</p><p></p><p>After this experience, Xie Lingfeng became more and more convinced that the martial dao he had cultivated was a false one!</p><p></p><p>The long-standing martial dao of the Sword Saint Cliff was all false!</p><p></p><p>And he himself was not a sword dao prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Just an ordinary sword dao cultivator who had learned a bit of sword technique!</p><p></p><p>"I cannot sink into this state, I must comprehend the sword dao, I must enter the door of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"I must become a true sword dao cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was determined. Perhaps this trip to the border wilderness was an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"I must ask Brother Xu how to attain sword heart clarity!"</p><p></p><p>Only with a clear sword heart can one enter the door of the sword dao, this is the foundation.</p><p></p><p>And only with a clear sword heart can one comprehend the sword intent!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Xu, for comprehending the sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng cupped his hands and congratulated him with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie is too kind, if it weren't for you accompanying me in sword practice, I wouldn't have been able to comprehend the sword intent so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu is being too modest, I have no contribution at all. Even without me, Xu Yan would have comprehended it only a day or two later."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with a wry smile.</p>

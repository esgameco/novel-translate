        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shifted his thoughts from the Taicangshu to editing the divine martial arts manual. By now, he had already compiled a few minor divine arts.</p><p></p><p>As for the major divine arts, he had not compiled a single one yet.</p><p></p><p>However, the two major divine arts, similar to "Rebirth of a Single Thought" and "Skeleton Transformation", already had an initial theoretical framework, and it was only a matter of time before they were compiled.</p><p></p><p>"These major divine arts must be perfected as much as possible, with the difficulty of comprehension and cultivation reduced as much as possible, to ensure that they can be comprehended and cultivated," Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he also knew that the more powerful the martial dao, the higher the difficulty of comprehension, and it was very difficult to reduce it.</p><p></p><p>If the difficulty was reduced too much, it would make the martial dao appear not powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was beginning to prepare for her breakthrough to the Divine Element Realm, and barring any accidents, she would also transform into a divine body.</p><p></p><p>"The three martial arts have all reached the Divine Art Realm, while the Odd Martial Arts are a bit lacking, but it's not a big problem."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Odd Martial Arts was inherently different, and it involved formations, prohibitions, and celestial anomalies. As the strength increased, the power of these Odd Martial Arts methods would also increase.</p><p></p><p>The formations set up by Li Xuan at the Divine Art Realm could rival those at the Divine Art Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion had martial artists seeking treatment every day, including wandering cultivators and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Although the number of treatment slots was limited each day, for those who were severely injured, plagued by old wounds, or even had their foundations damaged, this was an opportunity to change their fate, and they naturally would not give it up.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan noticed that Meng Shu was secretly chatting with some of the martial artists who came to seek treatment, casually mentioning a certain name, as if inquiring about someone.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists Meng Shu was talking to were all from aristocratic families or sects, as the information and secrets they possessed were far beyond what wandering cultivators could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that there is a martial artist named Mu Qiuliu whose strength is not bad and is quite handsome. I don't know if it's true? Have you heard of this person?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Qiuliu?" </p><p></p><p>The martial artist from the aristocratic sect was startled and looked at Meng Shu with surprise. Why was this person bringing up Mu Qiuliu? But since he was from the Long Qing Pavilion, responsible for distributing medicinal pills, he couldn't afford to offend him. If he could please the other party, perhaps he would get an extra medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>"The Mu Qiuliu you're talking about should be the 'Casanova' of the Mu Family, right? He is indeed powerful and talented, quite handsome as well."</p><p></p><p>The Casanova of the Mu Family was indeed famous, especially in Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>"Casanova?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was puzzled and asked, "Why do they call him the Casanova?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist had a strange expression on his face. Since Meng Shu knew Mu Qiuliu's name, how come he didn't know the origin of the Casanova title? In the Spiritual Realm, or even in Luozhou, there were probably fewer people who knew the name Mu Qiuliu, but if you mentioned the Casanova of the Mu Family, almost everyone would know.</p><p></p><p>"He's a womanizer, didn't you know?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was a bit stunned, his image of this person collapsing. He took a deep breath and asked, "Tell me, how is he a womanizer?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a long story..." </p><p></p><p>The martial artist coughed dryly, his face somewhat pale, obviously his old wounds had not healed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu handed him a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>After asking several martial artists from aristocratic families, only this one person knew about Mu Qiuliu, while the others could only speculate that he might be from the Mu Family.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist was overjoyed to receive the medicinal pill and began to recount the romantic escapades of the Casanova of the Mu Family, the many love debts he had accumulated, and the troubles he had caused.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also couldn't help but sigh that the talent of the Casanova of the Mu Family was extraordinary, already at the peak of Refining the Spirit, and he might even be an Invincible Expert now.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The image of a certain person had collapsed in his heart, and he felt somewhat distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Mu, so he's actually this kind of person!"</p><p></p><p>Scenes from the past flashed through his mind - the graceful and refined Mu Qiuliu, who had captivated countless beauties, was actually a womanizing scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>Whenever he thought of that gentle and beautiful figure leaning affectionately against Mu Qiuliu, he felt angry, thinking they were a divine couple, only to find out he had been deceived. Mu Qiuliu was just one of many beauties he had charmed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu felt a bit lost and was about to leave, but suddenly turned back and asked, "Where is Mu Qiuliu now?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist, though a bit puzzled by Meng Shu's reaction, shook his head and said, "I don't know. The Casanova of the Mu Family has disappeared for a while. There are rumors that he's hiding from his love debts, or that he's seeking a breakthrough to become an Invincible Expert, or that he's looking for new beauties to charm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu felt distressed, the image of that figure had completely collapsed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Long Qing Pavilion, Meng Shu sat in the corner, feeling listless and lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched a bit. He now understood that Meng Shu had met Su Lingxiu's father and knew he was from the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now he wanted to find someone.</p><p></p><p>"The Casanova of the Mu Family? Tsk tsk, he must be quite a talent. Could he be the son of that Mu Feiming whom Xu Yan defeated? Su Lingxiu's half-brother?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't dwell on this matter. He didn't care about Su Lingxiu's origins, and these grudges were something she had to resolve herself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as her teacher, he couldn't let her be bullied. Even if he didn't step in, her senior martial brothers like Xu Yan and Meng Chong, as well as her junior martial brother Fang Hao, would step up to protect her.</p><p></p><p>The day's consultation time at the Long Qing Pavilion ended, the doors were closed, and Shi Er continued his arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Ying found the listless Meng Shu sitting in the corner.</p><p></p><p>These days, Meng Shu had been wandering among the queue of those seeking treatment, and she had noticed some things.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shu, do you know your brother-in-law's identity?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying asked through a transmission.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu looked up at her with a complex expression and sighed, "Let's not talk about him anymore."</p><p></p><p>"So you do know!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what have you found out?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was silent for a moment before asking, "Sister Su, did she tell you something?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying stared at Meng Shu for a long time, pondering.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at me like that for? I've called her Sister Su since I was little. Although my father beat me and told me to call her Aunt, I like calling her Sister, and she's accepted it. Don't give me any nonsense about improper address."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying thought for a moment and took out a jade token, saying, "The young miss instructed me that if there is news from outside the Inner Realm, or if there are martial artists from outside the Inner Realm, I can use this jade token to leave the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>This jade token, she already knew what it was - a noble clan's jade token!</p><p></p><p>"Is your brother-in-law from the Mu Family of Luozhou?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying asked while looking at the jade token.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Mu Family of Luozhou was a top-tier aristocratic family, extremely powerful, and rumored to possess the secret of cultivating spiritual herbs, wielding considerable influence in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What have you found out?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying asked solemnly, "Brother Mu, he... is quite a womanizer!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sighed and told Zhou Ying everything he had found out.</p><p></p><p>"The Mu family's womanizer, widely renowned..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's expression turned grim. Doesn't this mean that the young lady was deceived?</p><p></p><p>"Was the hidden manipulator behind the Yin Tower the Mu family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying suddenly thought of this question.</p><p></p><p>Given the Lingyu Sect's view of the inner domain, perhaps upon learning that the young lady had given birth to the Mu family bloodline, they wanted to erase the Mu family womanizer's affairs and the remaining bloodline in the inner domain, in order to preserve the Mu family's reputation.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!" Meng Shushu shook his head. "But I can be sure it has nothing to do with Brother Mu."</p><p></p><p>"How can you be sure?" Zhou Ying was indignant.</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal herbs, Brother Mu left behind the medicinal herbs for Sister Su to nourish her body..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying fell silent, then after a long while, asked, "Should we tell the young lady that her father is the Mu family's womanizer?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head, "I don't know, let it be as fate decides! Perhaps not knowing is also a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying thought about it and nodded. Suling Xiu is now living happily, if she knew her origins, having such a scoundrel for a father, she would probably be distressed again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu and Zhou Ying decided to act as if nothing had happened, and not inquire further about the Mu family womanizer.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had broken through to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has broken through to the Divine Element Realm, your Longevity Divine Element has increased a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>With Suling Xiu's breakthrough, Fang Hao's airship forging had truly entered the final stage.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A purple lightning-wrapped airship, less than ten meters long, with pavilions and carved dragons, floated before them. Fang Hao was conducting the final forging.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan woke up from his comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth, and curiously watched on the side, greatly shocked by this extraordinary technique.</p><p></p><p>Caili'er was the same.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost successful!" Suling Xiu was excited.</p><p></p><p>She had also devoted her heart to this airship, such as providing many design suggestions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Water Star Palace, although only a second-rate sect, had once been glorious. But now it had declined to a second-rate sect, yet it was still extraordinary in Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Water Star Palace's Sect Master would soon break through to the Refine God Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Water Star Palace Master's daughter, Tang Jinyan, was the legitimate wife of the Mu family womanizer. Although she had returned to the Water Star Palace in anger, she still managed some of the Mu family's affairs, especially handling the womanizer's remaining romantic debts.</p><p></p><p>With the backing of the Mu family, a top-tier sect, no force in Luozhou dared to provoke the Water Star Palace, especially since the Mu family womanizer was rumored to be an Extreme Powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Whether Mu Qianliu had feelings for Tang Jinyan, his legitimate wife, or not, he was still her husband by title. Who would dare to disrespect the wife of a potential Extreme Powerhouse?</p><p></p><p>The Water Star Palace also just guarded its own territory, without any desire to expand outwards. It seemed they only wanted to ensure the sect's continuation. As a result, no one dared to attack the Water Star Palace.</p><p></p><p>But Tang Jinyan, the Mu family's wife, was in a very bad mood.</p><p></p><p>From Jiao Ming, Ping'er to Jing Popo, they had gone to the inner domain to capture the bastard, but there had been no news until now, and the gate to the Lingyu Sect had even been closed.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the three had either died, or were completely stranded in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of them being dead was as high as ninety percent.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan even felt a sense of panic, fearing that Mu Qianliu had left some methods to protect that mother and daughter, and had killed Jiao Ming, Ping'er and Jing Popo.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jing Popo was at the Great Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>She had been restless for a while, afraid that this matter would provoke Mu Qianliu, and he would divorce her.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu was too much of a womanizer, he had no deep feelings for her. He had only married her, the legitimate wife, at the clan's arrangement, to be a flower vase and shut the elders' mouths.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about the family, and had left soon after the marriage, never to return.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu had no feelings for her, but Tang Jinyan was infatuated with him. The more she thought about that vile woman tainting her husband's bloodline, the more she couldn't help herself, wanting to eliminate those who polluted her husband.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with a few women who had a one-night stand with her husband, and finding that the Mu clan elders didn't care, and her husband was also missing, her courage gradually grew, and her actions became more and more ruthless.</p><p></p><p>In the end, a vile woman brought a son to the Mu family's door, and she was even ready to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>What was hateful was that the son born to that vile woman was a spirit body! This made the Mu clan elders excited, and they even warned her. Tang Jinyan was so angry that she returned to the Water Star Palace.</p><p></p><p>She still hadn't gone back to the Mu family, and with the unexpected incident in the inner domain, her mood could be imagined, gloomy every day.</p><p></p><p>"Miss!" </p><p></p><p>The maid cautiously walked in.</p><p></p><p>Even Tang Jinyan's personal maid had been punished several times due to Tang Jinyan's bad mood since the inner domain incident.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Tang Jinyan asked lazily.</p><p></p><p>"About the inner domain matter..." the maid hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Just say it, what about the inner domain matter?" Tang Jinyan angrily demanded.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, that person seems to have already come to the Lingyu Sect."</p><p></p><p>The maid spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Tang Jinyan abruptly stood up, her face full of anger. "Could it be that she used the jade token to go to the Mu family and claim her ancestry? Have those old fogeys accepted her as well?"</p><p></p><p>When the gate to the Lingyu Sect opened, some people from the inner domain entered. Could it be that the vile woman was among them?</p><p></p><p>Using the jade token left by her husband in the inner domain, did she go to the Mu family to claim her ancestry? If that was the case, and she was recognized by those old fogeys, her talent must not be low!</p><p></p><p>"She didn't go to the Mu family, but... but to the Longevity Pavilion." </p><p></p><p>The maid spoke cautiously and softly, "The Longevity Pavilion's Pill Dao Immortal Lady, Suling Xiu, may be her!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying, that's impossible!" Tang Jinyan's expression changed drastically, and she exclaimed in a shrill voice.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the previous information, the name was Suling Xiu. All the clues point to the fact that the Longevity Pavilion's Pill Dao Immortal Lady is very likely her, and the Longevity Pavilion's appearance timing..."</p><p></p><p>The maid explained the latest information she had obtained.</p><p></p><p>This series of information linked together, and the Longevity Pavilion's Pill Dao Immortal Lady was the person Tang Jinyan wanted to capture, from the inner domain!</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan was a bit restless, her face paling. If the news was true, the matter she had sent people to the inner domain to assassinate, if it was exposed, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"The Longevity Pavilion, the inner domain, Xu Yan..."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Tang Jinyan had a terrible guess. The renowned Xu Yan was probably also from the inner domain. The opening of the gate to the Lingyu Sect and Xu Yan's rise... </p><p></p><p>The timing was too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

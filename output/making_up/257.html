        <h1>Chapter 257</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hearing the ideals and aspirations of the Wanshi Alliance, Fang Hao had a conflicted expression on his face and had not yet made a decision, and he also needed his master's approval.</p><p></p><p>"You should rest first and focus on recovering from your injuries. Don't worry, Zhu Liang won't be able to find this place. Even if he discovers the manor, he'll be courting death if he dares to come in."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao let the Alliance Leader rest and recover, then continued to research his communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Leader felt as if he was in a dream. He had almost died, his injuries were severe, but by chance he encountered Fang Hao and Xu Yan, who rescued him.</p><p></p><p>After taking a pill, his injuries were recovering rapidly. The damage to his foundation had also been healed by the young lady.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, he would be able to recover to his peak.</p><p></p><p>"If only they were members of the Wanshi Alliance, that would be wonderful!" the Alliance Leader sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and surveyed the manor, when suddenly his body trembled! In the courtyard, a young man was sitting in a chair, reading a book calmly and casually. At a glance, he seemed mysterious and majestic.</p><p></p><p>"An extraordinary supreme expert! A true supreme expert!" the Alliance Leader was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He was in the late Refining Deity stage, yet he felt this way. Just how powerful was this young man's cultivation? "Peak of the Refining Deity stage?" The Alliance Leader immediately denied this, "Impossible, even the peak of the Refining Deity stage is far from being so mysterious and majestic. Could it be beyond the Refining Deity stage?"</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Yuzhou branch of the Wanshi Alliance, his position was not bad, although his strength was not as good as the other branch leaders and vice-leaders. However, he had met Refining Deity experts more than once before.</p><p></p><p>None of them had such a mysterious and majestic aura. None of them gave him such a strong desire to prostrate and worship.</p><p></p><p>None of them had the bearing of such an extraordinary supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the Alliance Leader was greatly shocked. Could this senior already be an existence beyond the Refining Deity stage?</p><p></p><p>"Junior Yu pays respects to the senior!" The Alliance Leader hurriedly stepped forward and respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan exuded the aura of a supreme expert, his mysterious presence making him seem even more majestic. This made the Alliance Leader want to prostrate and worship him.</p><p></p><p>"Rest and recover your injuries." Li Xuan's eyes did not leave the ancient book he was reading, his tone calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" The Alliance Leader was extremely excited inwardly, carefully backing away to find a spot to sit and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Refining Deity stage? What kind of realm could that be? Could there truly be such an existence in this world?" The Alliance Leader was in a state of excitement.</p><p></p><p>He had unexpectedly encountered what seemed to be an existence beyond the Refining Deity stage by chance.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Xu Yan and Meng Chong's strength is so unbelievable!" The Alliance Leader sighed inwardly, realizing that this was the disciple of a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang had been chasing the Alliance Leader all the way to the capital of Zheng, but lost his trail there. He couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Leader had burned his essence blood and was severely injured, his cultivation foundation even damaged. There was no way he could have escaped Zhu Liang's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Although Zheng did not participate in the conflicts, as long as there was no disturbance in the capital, they would not stop the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic families from searching and pursuing the fugitive.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and Shu Zheng searched for the Alliance Leader's traces in the capital of Zheng, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>So they turned back and headed in the direction the Alliance Leader had fled.</p><p></p><p>"He was obviously too heavily injured to control himself, and must have fallen here." Zhu Liang and Shu Zheng came to the place where the Alliance Leader had fallen, and began searching the surroundings, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"His injuries were too severe. Even if he was rescued, he would either die or be crippled. The remaining remnants of the rogue cultivators must be exterminated!" Zhu Liang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He had already determined that Xu Yan and Meng Chong must have come from this rogue cultivator organization. He even suspected that Dai Sheng was not killed by Xu Yan, but by a Refining Deity expert from this organization.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Alliance Leader, there were two Refining Qi mid-stage cultivators, a strength not to be underestimated. So the Yuyu Sect and the Shu family began a large-scale search for Wanshi Alliance members.</p><p></p><p>The other Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families also joined in, as their stance towards the rogue cultivator force was unified - they absolutely would not allow it to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>After learning that this rogue cultivator force had a Refining Deity late-stage cultivator, the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families of Yuzhou did not dare to be careless, and thoroughly searched for all Wanshi Alliance members in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>In the secret hideout of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This secret place was only known to the Refining Deity cultivators of the Wanshi Alliance. At this moment, all the Refining Deity cultivators of the Wanshi Alliance had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector was severely injured and was currently in seclusion to heal.</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance Leader is in grave danger!" The Right Protector said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful members of the Wanshi Alliance all had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Liang, Shu Zheng, this grudge must be avenged!" One person gritted his teeth in hatred.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families are extensively searching for the Wanshi Alliance. I have already issued orders for all the strongholds to disband and disperse, not revealing their identities.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for the Alliance Leader to return, or for orders from the main headquarters." The Right Protector took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance members were all rogue cultivators, carefully selected, either having suffered persecution from the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families and having resolute stances, or having grand ambitions and fiery passions, with an extremely low chance of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>By abandoning the strongholds and dispersing, they could avoid the pursuit of the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families. Even if the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families were powerful, they could not engage in large-scale slaughter of rogue cultivators, or else the backlash would also be significant.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, no one is allowed to leave this place. Wait for the Alliance Leader to return, or for instructions from the headquarters!" The Right Protector looked at everyone solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Right Protector, don't worry. At this time, going out would be dangerous. We will stay together, and even if we are attacked, we can fight our way out." </p><p></p><p>"The main target of the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families is us Refining Deity experts. Once exposed, we will definitely be surrounded and attacked. We know our limits."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Alliance Leader can return safely."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the members were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Leader's situation this time was likely dire.</p><p></p><p>The Right Protector was also troubled. He was a native of Yuzhou, and when the Wanshi Alliance was established, he was only a small Celestial Warrior. </p><p></p><p>The previous Yuzhou Alliance Leader was also a local rogue cultivator, mature and steady, acting only after careful planning. He was a Refining Qi mid-stage cultivator, and with the guidance of the main headquarters' experts and the assistance of treasures, he broke through to the Refining Deity late-stage.</p><p></p><p>But on his way to the main headquarters, he encountered an accident and perished.</p><p></p><p>The current Alliance Leader was sent by the main headquarters to Yuzhou. His character and strength were both good, and he was decisive in his actions, able to unite the members well. Just like the last time, he had helped Wen Yong escape from Yuzhou and preserved Wen Yong, the genius of the Yuzhou branch.</p><p></p><p>But he had only been in office for a short time when this incident occurred. Most likely, he had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzhou branch was really in a difficult situation! The Right Protector sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Wanshi Alliance had truly encountered an unexpected disaster, an extremely unlucky turn of events.</p><p></p><p>In Yuzhou, the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families had once again launched a large-scale search.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many scattered cultivators were filled with trepidation, fearing that sudden calamity would befall them. </p><p></p><p>Some of the scattered cultivators even complained about the members of the Wanshi Alliance, saying that if it weren't for these reckless fellows of the Wanshi Alliance, they wouldn't have been implicated as innocent bystanders.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the manor, the injuries of the Alliance Master had almost fully recovered. He was also somewhat puzzled - Zhu Liang and Su Zheng should have searched the surroundings, so why hadn't they come to the manor?</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao let out a breath, having just finished refining an improved communication talisman. This talisman could connect and communicate with multiple people simultaneously, allowing mutual communication between the talismans.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, how far can this new communication talisman transmit?" Xu Yan asked curiously as he picked up one of the talismans.</p><p></p><p>"The exact range is uncertain, but it should have no problem communicating over a distance of ten thousand li," Fang Hao replied after some thought.</p><p></p><p>The communication talisman still had room for great improvement, but Fang Hao's current cultivation level limited his ability to refine more advanced versions. Refining higher-level communication talismans would require divine inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"The current talisman can establish communication with up to nine people. There are nine small formations here, each representing one communicator. The talismans can establish mutual communication," Fang Hao explained, pointing to the fine formations on the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan contemplated for a moment, then said, "Shidi, this set of communication talismans is fixed. Can we explore the possibility of adding new communicators? For example, giving the other party a talisman and imprinting its mark onto our own talisman, so we can communicate without being limited to this set."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pondered for a bit, then scratched his head, "Theoretically, it's possible, but my current strength is insufficient. Refining higher-level communication talismans requires divine inspiration, which I cannot achieve through just my true qi."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can refine it, Shidi. With your cultivation speed, you should be breaking through soon, right?" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Soon!" Fang Hao nodded, the heavenly and earthly markings on him were about to be complete, and he was not far from refining the next one.</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu was stunned, looking at the talisman-like communication token. This could transmit over ten thousand li? The Spirit Realm had never seen such a communication treasure before. With the communication talisman, the connections between all the strongholds would be more secretive and timely, no longer needing to worry about interception.</p><p></p><p>"Can it really transmit over ten thousand li?" Alliance Master Yu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand li is a conservative estimate. The true communication talisman should be able to transmit instantly, no matter where in the Spirit Realm. Unfortunately, my cultivation is too low, and my refining skills are insufficient to achieve that," Fang Hao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu's eyes reddened as he grabbed Fang Hao's hands, "Little brother Fang, the Wanshi Alliance is exactly what's missing a genius like you. Come join the Wanshi Alliance, we have abundant spirit herbs and refining materials. Whatever you need, the Wanshi Alliance will spare no effort to obtain it for you."</p><p></p><p>With Fang Hao, a prodigy, in the Wanshi Alliance, how could they not carve out a place for themselves?</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack spirit herbs or materials," Fang Hao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"How can you not lack them? Your refining consumes a lot. Although your master is an extraordinary expert, you can't always rely on your master as a disciple, right? Fang Hao, you must have ambition. Come join the Wanshi Alliance, and we'll cover all your expenses," Alliance Master Yu persuaded urgently.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't lack them," Fang Hao pointed to a small jar next to him, "This is a storage jar I refined. It contains the treasures from the Dai family's vaults."</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu's face turned green as he remembered that Xu Yan and Meng Chong had emptied the Dai family's treasures.</p><p></p><p>The treasures of a prominent family, even if it was just a second-rate family, were far beyond the current Wanshi Alliance's capabilities.</p><p></p><p>But for Fang Hao, this genius, Alliance Master Yu was willing to go all out.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and said, "Come, let's plan together. We'll take down the Yushen Sect, and all their treasures will be yours. As long as you join the Wanshi Alliance, whatever sect or family's treasures you want, we'll do our utmost to seize them for you!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned. They were willing to wage war against sects and families just for him?</p><p></p><p>"But... I'm used to being free and unrestrained. I don't like being bound by rules and dealing with all those trivial matters..." Fang Hao was tempted but also hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"You'll be the Alliance Master, yes, the Alliance Master of the Yuzhou Division. You won't be bound by rules, and my Yuzhou Division will wholeheartedly serve you!" Alliance Master Yu made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?!" Fang Hao was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"But my strength is still not enough..." Fang Hao said.</p><p></p><p>Alliance Master Yu took out a bronze token and placed it in Fang Hao's hands, "With me here, that's enough. I'm the Alliance Master, what I say goes. I'm the second strongest in Yuzhou, second only to Zhu Liang. Who dares to oppose me!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao held the bronze token, "This is?"</p><p></p><p>"The token of the Yuzhou Division Alliance Master!" Alliance Master Yu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Master Yu, this isn't right. My strength is too weak, although I know formations, formations, and can refine communication talismans, and my shijie can refine medicinal pills, and my two shixiong can refine spirit weapons, but the position of Alliance Master is of great importance. I'm afraid I won't be able to do a good job," Fang Hao said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me Alliance Master Yu anymore. From today on, I'm no longer the Alliance Master, you are the Alliance Master, Master Fang!" Alliance Master Yu's resolve was firm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's shijie can refine miraculous medicinal pills, and Xu Yan and Meng Chong are powerful and prodigious. If Fang Hao becomes the Alliance Master, when he encounters difficulties, his shixiong and shijie will surely help.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzhou Division must rise, and Fang Hao as the Alliance Master will make those bastards look down on me, Yu Gao, no more!</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao solemnly bowed and said, "Yu Gao pays respects to Alliance Master Fang!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this won't do, I'm unworthy, I'm truly unworthy!" Fang Hao had a guilty expression on his face as he put the token away in his storage ring, his eyes filled with laughter.</p><p></p><p>He had become the Alliance Master of the Wanshi Alliance's Yuzhou Division!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Gao had a vague realization that he might have fallen into a trap in his eagerness to find a powerful patron. But then he thought, perhaps this was a good thing!</p><p></p><p>"Old Brother Yu, come, let's discuss how to take down the Yushen Sect!" Fang Hao smiled and pulled Yu Gao over to discuss with Xu Yan and Meng Chong how to deal with the Yushen Sect and the Su family!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

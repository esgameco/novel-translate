        <h1>Chapter 372</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping coughed, fresh blood flowing from the corner of his mouth, dripping incessantly. His physical body was covered in wounds, seeming as if it could collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at Xiashan City, where people were kneeling on the ground. Some martial artists wanted to come out to treat him, but Jiang Buping waved his hand, took a few steps, and disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold on anymore. This time I'm really going to die.</p><p></p><p>"Do I feel resentful? Perhaps. But this is how the world is. What good would resentment do? A discarded son of Taikun? Haha, how ridiculous. Why would I, Jiang Buping, care about the so-called glory of the Jiang clan of Taikun? If there's no place for an illegitimate son like me, I'll just leave!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping muttered to himself, shaking his head constantly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he tore off a piece of flesh from his chest. The intense pain that followed helped him focus his consciousness and revived his spirit somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He stuffed the torn flesh back into the wound, and a force of soul energy spread out, fusing the flesh back onto the wound.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go wherever fate takes me. My physical body is collapsing, and my soul is just drifting. How long can I maintain my consciousness, my lucidity?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping laughed self-mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Born with a soul different from ordinary people - not just different, only Jiang Buping himself knew that he was born with a soul!</p><p></p><p>Walking aimlessly, Jiang Buping even passed by a desolate city. He sighed inwardly, wondering when the calamity in the Qinghua Realm would end.</p><p></p><p>Who could turn the tide and end this great disaster? Blood Son Chu, comparable to an Immortal Venerable, and even among Immortal Venerables, he was an extremely powerful existence. The Qinghua Realm didn't have any spare Immortal Venerables to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Unless help came from outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Great Yue Kingdom, two powerful figures were engaged in a fierce battle. One was clad in armor, wielding a great halberd, seeming to be one with heaven and earth, as if holding a part of the world in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The other was surrounded by a soaring blood light, powerful blood force intertwining with heaven and earth. Though his aura was slightly weaker, it was enough to withstand the attacks of the armored man.</p><p></p><p>"Traitor, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's great halberd swept across the sky as he roared, continuously bombarding the Blood Shadow Tower Master, forcing him to retreat step by step. However, the latter still managed to hold his ground.</p><p></p><p>"You could have been a good person, but instead you chose to be a dog for the Netherworld. You traitor!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's eyes were red with anger. News of the great disaster in Qiyun Prefecture had reached his ears, and what shocked him even more was that a Blood Son had been born in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in history that a Netherworld martial artist had ascended to become a Blood Son through blood sacrifice in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>If no one went to contain him, Qiyun Prefecture would likely become a land of death!</p><p></p><p>"If you want to go to Qiyun Prefecture, forget it. If you dare to leave, I'll perform a blood sacrifice here. You only have one choice: either confront me or go to Qiyun Prefecture. But if you go, I'll also perform a blood sacrifice on a major city," the Blood Shadow Tower Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let me tell you the truth. Lord Blood Son Chu not only aimed to become a Blood Son but also to ascend to a Blood Spirit. He's already halfway there.</p><p></p><p>"How about that? Are you eager to go stop Lord Blood Son Chu?</p><p></p><p>"You can certainly abandon me to go contain Lord Blood Son Chu, but I can also complete the blood sacrifice for Lord Blood Son Chu, helping him ascend to a Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"You can only rage impotently here!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master was extremely arrogant. Although he was at a disadvantage, it wasn't difficult for him to contain Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was indeed stronger than him, but he wasn't a top-tier Immortal Venerable and couldn't defeat him in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued. Sui Hongwu kept unleashing powerful attacks, causing heaven and earth to shake and the laws of nature to rumble. However, he still couldn't defeat the Blood Shadow Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>A sense of helplessness welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a powerful aura appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sui, let me lend you a hand!"</p><p></p><p>With this shout, a huge fist imprint came crashing through the sky, smashing into the Blood Shadow Tower Master's blood light.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The blood light intertwined with heaven and earth was instantly shattered. Sui Hongwu seized the opportunity and thrust his halberd forward. With a puff, the Blood Shadow Tower Master hurriedly defended, but his shoulder was still wounded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression changed drastically, and he retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fengyan, you've come at the right time. Let's join forces to kill this traitor!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was overjoyed. Finally, reinforcements had arrived.</p><p></p><p>A man with silver hair and a white beard, but with a middle-aged face and a burly build, wearing a pair of fist gauntlets, didn't say a word. He threw his fists forward, attacking the Blood Shadow Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>"In my life, I hate traitors the most. You deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master's face changed dramatically. Fighting against two opponents, he was in danger.</p><p></p><p>He swung his blade once, and before he could be surrounded, he fled.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Fengyan and Sui Hongwu gave chase.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master fled straight towards Qiyun Prefecture. Blood Son Chu had already completed his ascension, and his strength among Immortal Venerables was greater than his own. Therefore, only by joining forces could they deal with Fengyan and Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fengyan, thank you for coming to our aid this time!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. The situation in my Nine Mountains Realm has stabilized for now. When I received the request for aid, I came immediately. Unfortunately, I was a step too late, and those Netherworld bastards performed a blood sacrifice on Qiyun Prefecture City," Fengyan said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>Three figures, one in front and two behind, rushed towards Qiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In Qiyun Prefecture City, Blood Son Chu was still standing on a tall building, waiting for blood disciples and blood slaves to bring him the essence blood from the sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful it would be if the Qinghua Realm could become my, Blood Son Chu's, hunting ground."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Chu knew that unless he ascended to a Blood Spirit, he had no chance of achieving this.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, trying to occupy the Qinghua Realm would be nothing but a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up as a blood shadow arrived in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Son Chu, reinforcements have come from the Great Yue Kingdom. I couldn't contain them alone..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master hurriedly said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well enough."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Chu nodded and beckoned, "Come, let's join forces to defeat the incoming enemies!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master felt relieved and came to the top of the tall building, respectfully bowing to Blood Son Chu.</p><p></p><p>"Your blood force isn't pure enough. I'll teach you a secret technique that can enhance your strength."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Chu extended a hand and said solemnly, "Watch carefully. This secret technique is a great art of the Netherworld, incredibly powerful..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master was overjoyed and said gratefully, "Thank you, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Hum! Blood light coiled around Blood Son Chu's finger, transforming into a blood blade. As the blood blade wavered, more and more blood blades appeared. These blades were cold, bloodthirsty, seeming as if even the slightest wound from them would continuously devour one's essence blood and power.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Blood-Devouring Yin Blade. It can instantly devour essence blood, sacrifice martial artists, and turn them into nourishment for oneself... It's a great art of the Netherworld, and not all Blood Sons can cultivate it. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Chu brought the blood blade in front of the Blood Shadow Tower Master and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This slave understands!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Chu had revealed that his status in the Netherworld was extraordinary, not comparable to ordinary Blood Sons. By teaching him this secret technique, he intended for him to become a Blood Son as well.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cha's trusted subordinate. Once Blood Son Cha ascends to become a Blood Spirit, he will be a Blood Son under his command, and with this secret technique, his status and position will be higher than ordinary Blood Sons!</p><p></p><p>"Take it and comprehend it well!" Blood Son Cha said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, sir!" The Blood Shadow Tower Master arranged these blood blades around himself and began to concentrate on comprehending them.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Cha, prepare to die!" At this moment, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had caught up in pursuit. Seeing the deathly silent Qiyun County city, their eyes bulged with rage as they roared and jointly attacked that figure.</p><p></p><p>"Mere early stage Immortals," Blood Son Cha smiled faintly. He took a step forward, blood light dyeing half the sky red. With a flick of his finger, beams of blood-colored light shot out as he single-handedly fought two Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Blood Shadow Tower Master was shocked. Lord Blood Son Cha was too powerful - he had just ascended but could already fight two opponents without being at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Son Cha's voice transmission reached his ears: "Quickly comprehend and increase your strength. Then we'll join forces to kill these two. The blood essence of Immortal Heavenly Venerables is greatly nourishing and will help me advance further towards becoming a Blood Spirit."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Tower Master hurriedly focused his mind and began comprehending the secret technique.</p><p></p><p>A blood blade entered his body along with his comprehension, permeating it with a certain aura, as if wondrous insights were surging into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha, while battling Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu, revealed a smile at the corner of his mouth. The blood-colored markings on his brow suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>A strange power suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" A scream rang out as the Blood Shadow Tower Master suddenly showed a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha's cold laughter came: "I've nurtured you for so long, and you even broke through to the Immortal realm. It's time to reap the harvest. You're quite good nourishment..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Before Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's shocked eyes, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Blood Shadow Tower Master suddenly turned into a mass of blood energy that seemed to contain immortal essence.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In an instant, the blood energy entered Blood Son Cha's body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Son Cha's previously pale face turned ruddy, and his aura was strengthening.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were alarmed.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the Blood Shadow Tower Master, Blood Son Cha had become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, Blood Son Cha's strength rose another level. With a flick of his finger, blood blades appeared densely surrounding the entire battlefield in midair.</p><p></p><p>Completely sealing off all escape routes, he revealed a cold smile as he looked at Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu as if they were prey.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's your turn. The blood essence of Immortal Heavenly Venerables is greatly nourishing. Blood refining the two of you may not be enough to reach Blood Spirit, but it will bring me one step closer."</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant! See how you can blood refine me, Feng Yan!" Feng Yan roared angrily, not daring to be careless. A layer of gray light surged forth, instantly covering his body in what seemed like stone armor.</p><p></p><p>His entire being was like a man made of stone.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's expression was solemn as his great halberd radiated light. Joining forces with Feng Yan, the two of them controlled a domain of heaven and earth, merging with it.</p><p></p><p>To kill the two of them would require shattering this space and breaking open the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Son Cha just smiled coldly. Blood blades surrounded him as the battlefield was engulfed in a blood-colored storm, constantly sweeping and slicing. Though unable to break through Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's domain, as the battle continued, their faces turned pale.</p><p></p><p>The two discovered that their blood energy seemed somewhat out of control, merging into the surrounding space. Normally for Immortal Heavenly Venerables, this wouldn't be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Blood energy merging with the surroundings would strengthen their control over this domain.</p><p></p><p>However, the blood energy continuously merging with the surroundings was actually dissipating, being drawn away and slowly devoured by Blood Son Cha. If this continued, the two would inevitably die! But faced with this situation, they had no way to counter it.</p><p></p><p>"Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome!" Feng Yan gritted his teeth and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha's Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome was no ordinary item, but an even more powerful Netherworld divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Your fate is already sealed. Begging for mercy or surrendering is useless. Resisting allows you to last a bit longer. Not resisting means you'll be devoured quickly. If you want to die more comfortably, you can choose not to resist," Blood Son Cha said with an effeminate smile.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's hearts sank. At this point they could only continue resisting and hope for a change in the situation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Great Yue Emperor, or the Myriad Thunder Sect Master, or the Heavenly Martial Sect Master would be able to break away and come to Qiyun County to suppress Blood Son Cha. Then they would be saved.</p><p></p><p>Qiyun County city was filled with blood energy. This area of heaven and earth seemed to have become a blood-colored realm, as if dyed red with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued.</p><p></p><p>It could no longer even be called a battle, but rather Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu gritting their teeth in resistance.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha's aura was slowly increasing. As one side waxed and the other waned, the two didn't know how long they could hold out!</p><p></p><p>At one point, Blood Son Cha tossed out two Netherworld blood pearls and said with a smile, "Replenish your blood energy. You can resist longer."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu glared angrily at Blood Son Cha, but ultimately had no choice but to refine the Netherworld blood pearls to replenish their depleted blood energy.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha naturally had no good intentions. He was simply treating them as cultivation nourishment. The more blood energy they could provide, the more beneficial it was for Blood Son Cha.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld blood pearls could undoubtedly restore their depleted blood essence, and even make their blood essence purer and more potent.</p><p></p><p>Though aware of Blood Son Cha's intentions, the two had no choice but to accept the Netherworld blood pearls to restore what they had lost. Only by doing so could they hold out longer and have hope of an opportunity arriving.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Cha's effeminate smile revealed a satisfied look. Every so often, he would give out two Netherworld blood pearls. The ones he carried were all high-grade blood pearls that even Immortal Heavenly Venerables could use.</p><p></p><p>When the two could no longer increase their blood energy by using the Netherworld blood pearls, that would be the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think anyone will come save you. Those with the ability to do so can't make it here," Blood Son Cha said with a playful smile.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship turned into a streak of light as it entered Qiyun County, heading straight for Qiyun County city. Along the way, they encountered a True King preparing to blood sacrifice a small city.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flicked his finger and instantly killed the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm has become a living hell!" All those who came from the Spirit Realm felt heavy-hearted at what they saw along the way.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clenched his fists, indignant. These Netherworld enemies must be eliminated! He was not from the Divine Realm or the Qinghua Realm, but he was from this world. In a sense, the enemies from the Netherworld were also his enemies.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, such acts that offended both gods and men would arouse indignation in anyone who had not lost their humanity.</p><p></p><p>"That person looks so pitiful. Let's save him and bring him aboard," Su Lingxiu suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

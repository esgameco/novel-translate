        <h1>Chapter 372</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough...*</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping coughed, with fresh blood flowing out from the corners of his mouth, dripping incessantly. His physical body was covered in wounds, seeming on the verge of collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at Xia Mountain City, where a group of people were kneeling on the ground. Some cultivators even wanted to come out to treat him, but Jiang Buping waved his hand and disappeared into the distance in a few steps.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold on anymore, this time I'm really going to die.</p><p></p><p>"Unwilling? Perhaps, but that's just how the world is. What can unwillingness do? 'Abandon the Taoist clan'? Haha, how laughable. How would I, Jiang Buping, care about the so-called glory of the Jiang clan of the Tai Kun? Since they can't accommodate this bastard son, then I'll just leave!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping muttered to himself, shaking his head constantly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he tore off a piece of flesh and blood from his chest, the excruciating pain causing his consciousness to focus and his spirit to be invigorated.</p><p></p><p>He stuffed the torn flesh and blood back into the wound, and a spiritual force permeated, sealing the wound.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just go wherever I end up. If my physical body collapses, my spiritual soul will only be like a drifting weed. And how long can I maintain my clear consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual soul was extraordinary from birth, not just extraordinary, but Jiang Buping alone knew that he was born with a spiritual soul!</p><p></p><p>Wandering aimlessly, Jiang Buping even passed by a desolate city. He sighed, "When will the calamity of the Qinghua Realm end?"</p><p></p><p>Who could stem the tide and end this great disaster? Blood Offspring Xu, comparable to the Immortal Venerable, and his strength was also among the strongest of the Immortal Venerables. The Qinghua Realm did not have any surplus Immortal Venerables to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Unless, reinforcements came from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Great Yue Kingdom, two powerful figures were engaged in a fierce battle. One was clad in armor, wielding a great spear, seemingly merging with heaven and earth, as if grasping a realm in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The other was enveloped in a blood light, with powerful blood energy intertwined with heaven and earth, his aura slightly weaker, but still able to withstand the attacks of the armored man.</p><p></p><p>"Rebel, you must die!" </p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's great spear swept across the sky, roaring as he relentlessly struck, forcing the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master to retreat step by step, yet he still stubbornly resisted.</p><p></p><p>"A good person doesn't do this, going to serve the Underworld as a dog, you rebel!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's eyes turned red with fury, the calamity in Giyun Prefecture had already reached his ears, and what shocked him even more was that a Blood Offspring had been born in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in history that a Underworld cultivator had been bloodied and ascended to become a Blood Offspring in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>If no one went to intervene, Giyun Prefecture might become a land of death! "You can forget about going to Giyun Prefecture. If you dare to go, I will bloodily sacrifice a region. You only have one choice, either to confront me, or go to Giyun Prefecture, but I will also bloodily sacrifice a major city."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let me tell you the truth, Blood Offspring Xu not only wanted to become a Blood Offspring, but also to ascend to a Blood Spirit. Now he has already succeeded halfway.</p><p></p><p>"How's that, are you eager to go stop Blood Offspring Xu?</p><p></p><p>"You can just sacrifice me to restrain Blood Offspring Xu, but I can also complete the blood sacrifice to help Blood Offspring Xu ascend to a Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"You can only be powerlessly enraged here!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master was extremely arrogant, although he was at a disadvantage, restraining Sui Hongwu was not difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's strength was indeed stronger than him, but he was not a top-tier Immortal Venerable, unable to defeat him in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, Sui Hongwu constantly unleashing powerful attacks, shaking heaven and earth, the laws of heaven and earth roaring, but still unable to break through the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>A sense of powerlessness surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Young Sui, I'll lend you a hand!"</p><p></p><p>With this loud shout, a thunderous sound, a huge fist print traversed the sky and struck the blood light of the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The blood light intertwined with heaven and earth was instantly shattered, Sui Hongwu seized the opportunity, thrusting out his spear, with a whoosh, the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master hastily blocked, but his shoulder was still injured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression changed drastically, his figure flickered, retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Feng, you've come at the right time, let's join forces to kill this rebel!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was overjoyed, finally reinforcements had arrived.</p><p></p><p>A silver-haired, white-bearded man with a middle-aged appearance and a burly build, wearing a pair of fist gauntlets, without saying a word, unleashed a barrage of punches towards the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>"I've always hated traitors the most, you shall die!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master's face changed drastically, facing two opponents, he was in danger.</p><p></p><p>He slashed out with a sword, taking advantage of not being surrounded yet, his figure flickered and he fled towards Giyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu gave chase.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master rushed towards Giyun Prefecture, Blood Offspring Xu had already completed his ascension, his strength among the Immortal Venerables was stronger than him, so he could only join forces to deal with Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Feng, I'm grateful for your aid this time!"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, I'm from the Nine Mountains Realm, the situation has stabilized there now, so I came when I received the call for help, unfortunately I was a step too late, allowing that bastard from the Underworld to bloodily sacrifice Giyun Prefecture City."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>Three figures, one in front and two behind, rushed towards Giyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In Giyun Prefecture City, Blood Offspring Xu still stood on the high tower, waiting for his blood disciples and blood slaves to bring him the sacrificed essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"If the Qinghua Realm could become my hunting ground as a Blood Offspring, that would be wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Blood Offspring Xu knew that unless he ascended to a Blood Spirit, he would have no chance of occupying the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up, a blood shadow flashed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Offspring Xu, the Great Yue Kingdom has sent reinforcements, I alone cannot restrain them..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master hurriedly said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well."</p><p></p><p>Blood Offspring Xu nodded, waving his hand, "Come, let's join forces to crush the invaders!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master heaved a sigh of relief, coming up to the high tower and respectfully saluting Blood Offspring Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Your blood energy is not pure enough, I will teach you a secret technique to enhance your strength."</p><p></p><p>Blood Offspring Xu extended a hand, speaking solemnly, "Watch carefully, this secret technique is a great art of the Underworld, extremely powerful..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master was overjoyed, thanking him, "Thank you, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Hum! Blood light swirled from Blood Offspring Xu's fingertips, forming a blood blade. The blood blades flickered, one after another appearing, these blood blades were icy cold, bloodthirsty, as if just being scratched by them would continuously devour essence blood and power.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Devouring Blood Yin Blade, it can instantly devour essence blood, bloodily sacrifice cultivators, and turn them into nourishment for oneself... It is a great art of the Underworld, not all Blood Offsprings can cultivate it, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Offspring Xu handed the blood blades to the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master, speaking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Your servant understands!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Blood Offspring Xu revealed that his identity in the Underworld was not ordinary, and by passing on this secret technique to him, he wanted him to become a true Blood Offspring.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Ditu's trusted subordinate. Once Blood Ancestor Xu is promoted to the Blood Spirit realm, he will become the blood subordinate under his command, and with this secret technique, his status and position will be higher than ordinary blood subordinates!</p><p></p><p>"Next, contemplate well!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master surrounded himself with these blood blades, focusing intently on his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Ancestor Xu, surrender your life!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had already arrived and were chasing after him. Seeing the deathly silent Qiyun Prefecture, they were immediately enraged, letting out a furious roar as they joined forces to attack that figure.</p><p></p><p>"Just a mere Immortal Initial stage, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu smiled indifferently, taking a step forward as the blood light reddened half the sky. With a snap of his fingers, blood-colored light beams shot out, as he fought alone against the two Immortal Venerable experts.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master was shocked, Blood Ancestor Xu's strength was too powerful. Even though he had just been promoted, he was able to hold his own against two Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he heard Blood Ancestor Xu's voice transmitting to him.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly comprehend and enhance your strength. After that, we'll join forces to kill these two. The essence blood of Immortal Venerables is a great supplement, allowing me to further advance to the Blood Spirit realm."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow Pavilion Master hurriedly calmed his mind and began to comprehend the secret technique.</p><p></p><p>A blood blade followed his comprehension, entering his spiritual sense and spreading a certain aura, as if profound realizations were surging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu, the corners of Blood Ancestor Xu's mouth curled up in a smile, and the blood-colored patterns on his brow suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>A strange power abruptly manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>A miserable scream rang out, and the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master suddenly revealed a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu's cold laughter came: "I've raised you for so long, and you've even broken through to the Immortal Venerable realm. It's time to reap the rewards, your nourishment is quite good..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the stunned gazes of Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu, the Immortal Venerable Blood Shadow Pavilion Master suddenly transformed into a mass of blood qi, this blood qi seemingly containing an immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The blood qi instantly merged into Blood Ancestor Xu's body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the originally pale-faced Blood Ancestor Xu's face turned a deep red, and his aura was continuously strengthening.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were shocked.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master, Blood Ancestor Xu's strength had increased even further.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Blood Ancestor Xu's strength had risen to a new level. He snapped his fingers, and blood blades appeared, densely surrounding the entire battlefield, completely sealing off all escape routes. He revealed a cold smile, looking at Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu as if they were his prey.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it's your turn. The essence blood of Immortal Venerables is a great supplement. By refining you two, although I'm still far from the Blood Spirit realm, I'll be one step closer."</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant! Let's see how you refine me, Feng Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan roared furiously, not daring to be careless. A layer of gray light surged, and in an instant, it was as if he was covered in an armor of stone, his entire body transforming into a stone-like figure.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu's expression was grave, his great halberd radiating light. With Feng Yan's cooperation, the two of them commanded the power of the heavens and earth, uniting with the laws of the world.</p><p></p><p>To kill them, one would have to shatter this heaven and earth space, breaking through the laws of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Ancestor Xu smiled coldly, the blood blades surrounding the battlefield whirling and slashing, creating a blood-colored storm. Although they couldn't break through Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's control of the heavens and earth, as the battle continued, the two of them began to turn pale.</p><p></p><p>They realized that their blood qi seemed to be somewhat out of control, merging into the heavens and earth. For Immortal Venerables, this was not normally a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi merging into the heavens and earth would only strengthen their control over this realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the blood qi continuously merging into the heavens and earth was actually being drawn away and devoured by Blood Ancestor Xu. Gradually, they would be drained, and eventually, they would inevitably die.</p><p></p><p>But faced with this situation, the two of them had no solution.</p><p></p><p>"Slaughter Life Blood Refining Barrier!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan gritted his teeth and coldly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu's Slaughter Life Blood Refining Barrier was no ordinary item, but a powerful Underworld Divine Artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Your fate has already been decided. Even if you beg for mercy or surrender, it won't be of any use. You can resist for a little longer, but if you don't resist, you'll be devoured quickly.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to die more comfortably, you can choose not to resist."</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu smiled softly.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's hearts sank. At this moment, they could only continue to resist, waiting for a chance.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Great Yue Emperor, or the Wanlei Sect Master, or the Tianwu Sect Master, if any of them stepped out and suppressed Blood Ancestor Xu in Qiyun Prefecture, they might be saved.</p><p></p><p>The Qiyun Prefecture city was filled with blood qi, as if this realm had been dyed red with blood.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, or rather, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were gritting their teeth and resisting.</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu's aura was slowly growing, and with this ebb and flow, the two of them didn't know how long they could hold out.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Blood Ancestor Xu tossed out two Underworld Blood Pearls, smiling as he said, "Replenish your blood qi, so you can resist for a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu glared angrily at Blood Ancestor Xu, but ultimately had no choice but to refine the Underworld Blood Pearls to restore their depleted blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu, of course, had no good intentions. He was simply using them as cultivation resources, and the more pure blood qi they could provide, the more beneficial it would be for his advancement to the Blood Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Knowing Blood Ancestor Xu's intentions, the two of them had no choice but to accept the Underworld Blood Pearls to restore their losses, as only in this way could they persist longer and hope for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu's soft smile revealed a satisfied expression. After a period of time, he would give them two more Underworld Blood Pearls. The Underworld Blood Pearls he carried were all of high-grade, even Immortal Venerables could make use of them.</p><p></p><p>When they could no longer use the Underworld Blood Pearls to enhance their blood qi, that would be the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that someone will come to save you. Those with such strength can't even get here."</p><p></p><p>Blood Ancestor Xu smiled meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship entered Qiyun Prefecture, rushing towards the Qiyun Prefecture city. Along the way, they encountered a True King preparing to perform a blood sacrifice on a small city.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan snapped his fingers, instantly annihilating the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Flower Realm, a living hell!"</p><p></p><p>What they saw along the way made all the people from the Spirit Realm feel heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clenched his fists, his heart filled with indignation. This Underworld enemy must be destroyed! He was not a person from the Divine Realm or the Azure Flower Realm, but a person of this world. As an enemy from the Underworld, in a certain sense, he was also Xu Yan's enemy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, such an act that was abhorred by both gods and men, as long as one was not a person who had lost all humanity, they would feel outraged and unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"That person looks so miserable, let's bring him up."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 283</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but think of an explanation - the Invincible Path! Xu Yan's actions were so similar to the Invincible Path.</p><p></p><p>Invincible all the way, gathering the momentum of the Invincible to break through, consolidating the will of the Invincible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan was using this to accumulate his foundation and elevate himself, with some differences, and it wouldn't affect the gathering of the Invincible momentum even if he was defeated.</p><p></p><p>"This is Xu Yan's Invincible Path!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His disciple has finally broken out of the framework he had given him, which is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Being able to break out of the framework means the disciple will become stronger, and the stronger the disciple, the deeper his martial arts insights, the stronger he will be as well.</p><p></p><p>Since the disciple has taken the Invincible Path, it's as if he has taken the Invincible Path as well.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, it's good that you have this idea!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, expressing his approval.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was invigorated. "Master, I want to travel the Spirit Realm, challenge the top geniuses of the world, defeat them, and use this to accumulate and ascend to the peak of the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>To challenge the Spirit Realm's top geniuses, dominate the current generation, and reach the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>But this will certainly offend the major Spirit Sect families, as their geniuses being defeated, how could they accept it easily?</p><p></p><p>The rules of the past genius confrontations were just a facade.</p><p></p><p>The once powerful Wanxing Martial Arts Academy was also defeated in the genius confrontations, and it disintegrated, with heavy casualties among the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the specific process of the Wanxing Battle is only known to the participants.</p><p></p><p>And here, there is one of the former participants, one of the Thirty-Six Elites of Wanxing - Yue Changming!</p><p></p><p>As the master, he naturally needs to support and protect his disciple who wants to challenge the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>As for those who want to personally take the field when their geniuses are defeated, that is a path to death! "I know Master cannot conveniently take action, but I have confidence that I can retreat safely, Master need not worry!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The master cannot act casually, after all, he is too strong. If the suppression of power is not enough, or if he unleashes his true aura or reveals a glimpse of his true strength, it would cause a calamity.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan does not plan to let the master protect him. He is confident he can retreat safely, and the challenge is not reckless either, he is a martial artist, not a reckless person.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was happy in his heart, now he has an excuse. In the future, when he encounters enemies and cannot just slap them to death, it will not damage his image as a peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>After all, he cannot cause a calamity! The eldest disciple is so considerate, he has even helped the master prepare the excuse in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, strong people have never grown in a greenhouse, never grown under protection. Disciple, your will and confidence make me very pleased!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, his idea had been affirmed by the master, which meant he had not taken the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also came over.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I also want to learn from the elder brother, I want to temper my blade, become a master of the blades in the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The second disciple also wants to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu came over excitedly, her jade-like face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the third disciple, does this girl also want to take the Invincible Path?</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to learn from the elder brother and second brother, I'm preparing to open a Pill Medicinal Martial Arts Hall, to heal and treat wounded martial artists, to accumulate my pill medicinal arts, can't just learn without using it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought, of course, the third disciple does not have the fighting spirit to take the Invincible Path.</p><p></p><p>But she's right, if she learns the pill medicinal arts, she should use them.</p><p></p><p>Now with the turmoil in the Spirit Realm, the war between the Wanshi Alliance and the Spirit Sects, there are countless injured, even martial artists with severe injuries to their foundation, this is a good opportunity for her to accumulate pill medicinal experience.</p><p></p><p>"Lingxiu also has her own ideas, very good, I'm very pleased!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Master, I've always had my own ideas, you know."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said while massaging the master's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to lead the Wanshi Alliance to participate in the great battle in the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao spoke up.</p><p></p><p>As the Alliance Master of the Yuzhou Alliance, and a cultivator from the Spirit Realm, he naturally has a deeper connection and wants to display his might and make a name for himself in the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The four disciples all have their own goals now.</p><p></p><p>This is very good.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan is confident he can retreat safely, Li Xuan would never let him encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>He must provide the necessary protection.</p><p></p><p>This is related to his great martial arts undertaking.</p><p></p><p>No need to personally protect him, but the proper protection cannot be lacking.</p><p></p><p>The four disciples all have their own cultivation goals and directions, Li Xuan as the master is very pleased, especially Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who want to take a similar Invincible Path.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating and refining themselves through battles, to break through the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu have also been stimulated and started to cultivate diligently, but they still lack a lot to break through the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat also seems to have ideas and has started to cultivate diligently, Li Xuan can sense it is constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan is preparing to travel the Spirit Realm and challenge the top geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong is the same, this path is not easy, but if he succeeds, the harvest will be huge.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu is refining pills, preparing various pills for the two elder brothers.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao continues to refine the Mysterious Treasure Chests.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er is breaking through in the Refine Spirit, and Yue Changming's spiritual body has already recovered. He has also refined the Spiritual Mechanism of Heaven and Earth into his divine soul, and his strength is now stronger than Huang Liang's.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Mechanism fragment that Li Xuan absorbed is much stronger than the one Huang Liang refined into his divine soul, which is why Yue Changming's strength was able to quickly surpass Huang Liang.</p><p></p><p>While refining the Spiritual Mechanism, Yue Changming is also comprehending the pattern of the laws.</p><p></p><p>These are the few law patterns extracted by Li Xuan from the first page of the Taicangshu and printed on paper.</p><p></p><p>For Spirit Realm martial artists, these few patterns are enough for them to comprehend, to comprehend the entire laws of Heaven and Earth is obviously impossible.</p><p></p><p>They can only comprehend one or two of the laws.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan has temporarily put aside compiling the Martial Arts Classics, and is instead compiling the martial arts realms above the Divine Techniques, to pass on to Xu Yan before he goes out to brave the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Invincible Path is destined to be his path to the peak of the Spirit Realm. In this journey of battles, his martial arts comprehension will also continue to improve.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he can comprehend all the martial arts realms above the Divine Techniques during this period.</p><p></p><p>"The realms above the Divine Techniques involve the laws of Heaven and Earth, I have already compiled them, the cultivation methods are well-perfected, and the realm connections are high.</p><p></p><p>"The path that Taicangshu martial artists walk must be to integrate the laws of Heaven and Earth into their bodies. Even if they master the power of the laws of Heaven and Earth, they are still constrained by the laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"To transcend Heaven and Earth is much more difficult, and they lack the laws of their own martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts naturally cannot be bound, controlling the laws of Heaven and Earth, rather than being constrained by the laws of Heaven and Earth. So above the Divine Techniques, controlling the laws of Heaven and Earth for my own use.</p><p></p><p>"Using the laws of Heaven and Earth as the divine image of my martial arts, it can not only enhance my own divine techniques, but also be controlled by myself, so let's call it the Divine Image Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan has determined the realm above the Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Image Realm! Transforming the laws of Heaven and Earth into the divine image of martial arts, controlling the laws of Heaven and Earth for one's own use, in a sense, also surpassing the laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Existing within Heaven and Earth, yet in a sense, transcending them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Controlling the laws of heaven and earth is almost impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>The supreme Cangwu cultivators refine their spirits to a level beyond that of heavenly beings, which must be related to the laws of heaven and earth. Li Xuan could also roughly deduce that it involves refining the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, one can borrow the power of the laws of heaven and earth. Just like the supreme expert Huang Liang, by refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, he gained the ability to sense the laws of heaven and earth and condense a strand of the power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It may seem like using the laws of heaven and earth, but ultimately, the supreme Cangwu cultivators are still under the control of the laws of heaven and earth. When they manifest the power of the laws of heaven and earth, they are not "controlling or manipulating" them, but rather borrowing them.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps a higher realm is required to be on par with the laws of heaven and earth, and then truly control the laws of heaven and earth for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>What Li Xuan needs to do is to reach a realm beyond spiritual powers, where he can directly control the laws of heaven and earth for his own use. In a sense, he already has the foundation to transcend the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The reason he can control the laws of heaven and earth is not only due to his own martial dao laws at the spiritual power realm, but also an extremely important factor.</p><p></p><p>That is the laws of heaven and earth recorded in the Tao Cang Book, which has allowed Li Xuan to reach an extremely high understanding of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He can even directly reference the laws of heaven and earth in the Tao Cang Book, and incorporate them into his martial dao spiritual image, gaining the method to control the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the laws of heaven and earth, transforming them into the martial dao spiritual image! "The spiritual image realm is thus determined, using the laws of heaven and earth as the martial dao spiritual image, or even using heaven and earth as the spiritual image... To transcend heaven and earth, one must cultivate step by step, without being constrained by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual image is the starting point of transcending heaven and earth. Although it is still far from truly transcending heaven and earth, it is no longer limited by the laws of heaven and earth, but rather controls them.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's monstrous talent, there shouldn't be any problem in comprehending this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual image realm, in theory, is similar to the realm above the Refining Spirit Heavenly Beings, but it has actually surpassed the realm above the Refining Spirit Heavenly Beings.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to break through the spiritual image realm and manifest the martial dao spiritual image, combined with spiritual powers that can control the heavens and the earth... Incredible, the entire heaven and earth would feel like it is under my control.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly too powerful!</p><p></p><p>"If I were to manifest the Divine Dragon Descending into the World spiritual power, and the martial dao spiritual image transforms into a divine dragon, this would be using the laws of heaven and earth as the dragon."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan thought about it, the more excited and thrilled he became.</p><p></p><p>He opened the Great Dao Golden Book to check the martial dao techniques of the spiritual image realm.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Techniques of the Spiritual Image Realm:</p><p>Technique Perfection Level: Medium-High</p><p>Realm Connection Level: High</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: High</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: Medium-High</p><p></p><p>After seeing the information provided by the Great Dao Golden Book, Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The technique perfection level is only medium-high, but it's not too low. With Xu Yan's monstrous talent, he can definitely comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>The realm connection level, however, has received a high rating.</p><p></p><p>This indicates that the theoretical progression from the Spiritual Powers realm to the Spiritual Image realm is completely correct.</p><p></p><p>The high comprehension difficulty is within expectations, as the martial dao techniques of the Spiritual Image realm have incorporated the laws of heaven and earth from the Tao Cang Book, allowing for direct comprehension of how to start controlling the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation difficulty is only medium-high, which means that as long as he can comprehend it, the actual cultivation will not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao techniques of the Spiritual Image realm will do."</p><p></p><p>Trying to improve the technique perfection level and reduce the comprehension difficulty is too difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the comprehension difficulty is reduced and the technique perfection level is improved, in a sense, the power of this realm will also be diminished.</p><p></p><p>The closer one gets to the Spiritual Powers realm, the higher the technique perfection level will be. The further one departs from the Spiritual Powers realm, the greater the power gap between realms, and the more difficult it is to improve the technique perfection level.</p><p></p><p>Being able to raise the technique perfection level to medium-high, while not lowering the realm's power compared to expectations, Li Xuan felt he had done his best.</p><p></p><p>The more profound and abstruse the martial dao techniques, the higher the comprehension difficulty, and there is no way around this.</p><p></p><p>In order to become stronger, he can only make such a choice.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Image realm is set. What realm will be above the Spiritual Image realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Image realm has already transformed the laws of heaven and earth into the martial dao spiritual image, controlling the laws of heaven and earth for one's own use. What cultivation path should he take to go beyond that?</p><p></p><p>How can one truly transcend heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>To truly transcend heaven and earth, it cannot be achieved in a single step. It requires crossing one realm after another, ultimately transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>So, what cultivation path should be taken above the Spiritual Image realm to further improve the martial dao and lay the foundation for transcending heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a headache coming on. "This martial dao is too difficult to compile, the gap between realms is too large, and there is no connection between them. It's like taking too big a step, easy to stumble..."</p><p></p><p>"So, it can only be one step at a time, one realm after another..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Xu Yan's monstrous talent, if the realms are completely disconnected and the gap is too large, it would still be impossible to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could somehow comprehend it, he wouldn't know how long it would take, and he would be stuck in one realm for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Image realm is about controlling the laws of heaven and earth, and above that, it must be about breaking free from the constraints of the laws of heaven and earth, not being bound by them..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, Li Xuan was compiling martial dao techniques, while Xu Yan was preparing to venture out and challenge the geniuses of the Spiritual Domains.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the situation in the outside world had undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>In the Leiyu State, the battle between the supreme experts had been rekindled.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This time, a bolt of lightning shot up from the mountain peak where the Leiyu Mountain Manor was located, instantly spanning the vast sky and striking towards a supreme expert of the Myriad World Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The expert's face changed drastically, and despite exerting his full power to resist, he was still blasted away, with half his body charred and severely injured!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Another bolt of lightning came sweeping across, targeting the supreme expert from the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Artifact!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan expert's face changed drastically. Waves of water surged around him, forming a tumultuous barrier, but it still could not withstand the lightning strike. Another supreme expert from the Myriad World Alliance hastily lent a hand to assist.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Although they managed to block the lightning strike, the expert who had lent assistance was heavily injured by the Leiyu Mountain Manor's expert.</p><p></p><p>A figure enveloped in lightning, wielding a divine artifact, emerged from the Leiyu Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared from the Myriad World Alliance, his expression grave as he commanded.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad World Alliance's experts hastily retreated.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The lightning strike came sweeping across again.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yan, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The Myriad World Alliance's experts cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Elder Yan coldly snorted, gripping a short baton in his hand and striking out.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The two powerful attacks collided, with neither side gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>The baton in Elder Yan's hand was also a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the Leiyu Mountain Manor erupted with a surge of crimson lightning clouds, rolling towards them.</p><p></p><p>The Leiyu Mountain Manor had activated their second divine artifact!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat from the Leiyu State!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice echoed from the Leiyu Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, retreat if you must, but the Leiyu State will belong to the Leiyu Mountain Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Yan let out a hearty laugh as he led the Myriad World Alliance's experts in their retreat.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

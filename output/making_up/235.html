        <h1>Chapter 235</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has entered the Spirit Realm for some time now. How is he doing?" </p><p></p><p>Someone spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's entry into the Inner Realm must be different from us."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Inner Realm? Some old fellows have already joined the Great Desolation Cabinet, becoming the devotees of Great Desolation."</p><p></p><p>"This is the second path besides entering the Spirit Realm. Who would want to be a servant?"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the powerful figures of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, unlike other forces in the Inner Realm, has the backing of the Spirit Realm forces behind the purple-crowned pavilion master, in order to monitor the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now, whether the forces of the Spirit Realm have abandoned the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is unknown.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion cannot join the Great Desolation, or it will invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. The Inner Realm has become the Great Desolation. You are all Great Desolation people, so it is only natural for you to become devotees of the Great Desolation Cabinet."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this does not violate the rules of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, so you can join the Great Desolation Cabinet Devotion Hall in your own name."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>His identity is ultimately different, and he cannot join the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, unless the Great Desolation is strong enough to withstand the impact of the Spirit Realm forces.</p><p></p><p>"Then so be it!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's half-step Celestial Beings nodded one after another.</p><p></p><p>They are the lofty existences of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. How could they be willing to be servants, unless they have no choice? Now that they have a choice, they naturally choose another path.</p><p></p><p>With the secret entry of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's half-step Celestial Beings into the Great Desolation Cabinet Devotion Hall, the situation in the Inner Realm has changed again, and in the Great Desolation Cabinet, a group of powerful figures sat together and began to discuss the future of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>They are the figures at the peak of the martial dao in the Inner Realm. The changes in the Inner Realm are all in their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Since we are both devotees of the Great Desolation, then let the Inner Realm become the past."</p><p></p><p>One of the devotees spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let the Inner Realm become the past, and the martial dao of the Great Desolation is the right path."</p><p></p><p>And so, not long after, a major event that shook the Inner Realm occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Yan Kingdom announced its incorporation into the Great Desolation, and the Yan Emperor became the third emperor of the Great Desolation, with the right to participate in the competition for the next Great Desolation Emperor as a descendant of the Yan royal family.</p><p></p><p>And the Yan Kingdom, starting from now, will be governed by the Great Desolation Cabinet.</p><p></p><p>In this way, of the three major countries in the Inner Realm, only the Purple Cloud Kingdom remained.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all eyes in the world were focused on the royal family of the Purple Cloud Kingdom. Even the martial artists of the Purple Cloud Kingdom were paying attention to whether the Purple Cloud Kingdom would also join the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Purple Cloud Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor was furious. "The young son of the Yan Emperor, has he gone mad? The Great Desolation is weak, how can it compare to the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he asked in a deep voice, "Has my rebellious daughter been found?"</p><p></p><p>The grand eunuch bowed and said, "Your Majesty, there are clues now, and Lord Shu is going to find Princess Ziyun."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, it's good that my nephew Shu has gone. Let that girl see what the bloodline of the Spirit Realm is, and that marrying my nephew Shu is her blessing."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor said happily.</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spirit Realm will soon open, and with my nephew Shu, who has the bloodline of the Spirit Realm, we can also enter the Spirit Realm without becoming servants.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Inner Realm or the Great Desolation, they are just barbaric lands. Only the Spirit Realm is the land of martial dao supremacy!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's expression was full of longing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed in in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, a great disaster has happened!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's gaze narrowed, and he asked in a deep voice, "Has the Great Desolation attacked?"</p><p></p><p>The first thing he thought of was the Great Desolation attacking the Purple Cloud Kingdom. His expression was grave, but not panicked.</p><p></p><p>With his nephew Shu, who has the bloodline of the Spirit Realm, he is enough to intimidate the powerful figures of the Great Desolation.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, it's... it's Lord Shu, he's dead!"</p><p></p><p>The person's face was deathly pale, his voice trembling.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed him, who could kill him?"</p><p></p><p>That was the person he relied on to enter the Spirit Realm, yet he was dead?</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's Princess Ziyun!"</p><p></p><p>The person said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's expression was horrified, his face immediately turning pale, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. "This rebellious daughter, how dare she! Where is the old Shu?"</p><p></p><p>"Chasing after Princess Ziyun."</p><p></p><p>"Transmit my order, go capture the rebellious daughter and bring her back. Decree to the world that Ziyun is no longer my princess of the Purple Cloud Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's voice was trembling.</p><p></p><p>His expression was furious to the extreme, and he was almost in a state of frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>A message suddenly spread throughout the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor had ordered the world to sever the father-daughter relationship with Ziyun, revoke her princess status, and issue a bounty with a high reward.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all the major forces in the Inner Realm were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun, who had once been one of the three youngest grand masters in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a genius, yet she was abandoned by the Purple Cloud Kingdom, and a bounty was issued to hunt her down? Has the Purple Cloud Emperor gone mad?</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Li Xuan let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The First Tome of the Formation Dao Grand Ceremony has finally been organized.</p><p></p><p>"There are a total of thirty-six formations, including nine grand formations. This will do for now."</p><p></p><p>After organizing the formation diagrams and integrating the Heavenly-Earthly Peculiar Array, a total of thirty-six formation diagrams were compiled, including nine grand formations.</p><p></p><p>The Teleportation Formation is one of the nine grand formations.</p><p></p><p>"Small formations are easy to comprehend, but the grand formations are more difficult. They truly involve the principles of heaven and earth, and require extremely high talent to achieve."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Gate Martial Dao requires extremely high talent, otherwise one cannot cultivate arrays, formations, and prohibitions all together, and the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao emphasizes "peculiarity" and "unorthodox".</p><p></p><p>It requires talent that is more inclined towards this aspect.</p><p></p><p>"I hope my fourth disciple can find the right one."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The formation diagrams have been transmitted out.</p><p></p><p>But so far, no one has been able to comprehend anything from them.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that finding the right disciple really requires good fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Since there is none in the Inner Realm, let's go to the Spirit Realm and take a look. The vast Spirit Realm, the prosperous martial dao, surely there must be such talented individuals there?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Formation Dao Grand Ceremony has been organized, and if someone can comprehend the grand formations, Li Xuan is willing to take them as a named disciple and let them delve into the study of formations.</p><p></p><p>Alas, so far, no one has been able to comprehend anything from the formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Red Cat, who has been learning to write and practicing calligraphy, and has not slacked off, constantly studying the formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>But so far, there has been no progress.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Red Cat is a great demon with awakened intelligence, how could it possibly comprehend the formation diagrams?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and Meng Chong might have the potential, but the two of them are currently busy cultivating to break through to the Divine Meaning Realm, so Li Xuan has not asked them to comprehend the formation diagrams, so as not to distract them from their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Above the Cangjiang River, a graceful figure rose from the water, splashing up a layer of water droplets, and swiftly headed towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Vile woman, you should die!" </p><p></p><p>A figure in the sky quickly pursued, an old man, his eyes bloodshot, seemingly in a state of frenzy, the aura of a half-step Celestial Being rippling in all directions.</p><p></p><p>A half-step Celestial Being! Ziyun's face was pale, frantically fleeing towards Canglan Island, her speed lightning-fast, afraid that the aura of the half-step Celestial Being would suppress her.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun, who had already reached the great grand master realm, was extremely fast, but she was still no match for the half-step Celestial Being. </p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Canglan Island was already in sight.</p><p></p><p>Before the other party's half-step Heavenly Deity's suppressive might could arrive, Ziyun rushed up to Canglan Island in a disheveled state. "You wretch, daring to kill the young master, I will tear you to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>The old man was extremely frenzied, directly rushing towards Canglan Island, his half-step Heavenly Deity's might not restrained at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up briefly, then continued to study the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>Clang! A flash of sword light came slashing down from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Intruder on Canglan Island, die!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The half-step Heavenly Deity's might was shattered by the sword light before it could even reach Canglan Island, and the old man's body also disintegrated into flying ash under the sword light.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun fell to the ground in a disheveled state, but she revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure appeared beside Ziyun, his brow slightly furrowed. At this moment, Ziyun was severely injured and very disheveled.</p><p></p><p>"I came to seek refuge!" </p><p></p><p>Ziyun laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of person did you provoke?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out a medicinal pill and had her take it.</p><p></p><p>"Some self-important, high and mighty bastard who dared to covet me. I killed him."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised an eyebrow, curious. "What kind of person?"</p><p></p><p>"He claimed to have the bloodline of the Spirit Realm and an ancestral jade token, and must enter the Spirit Realm. So he was high and mighty, and he also had a half-step Heavenly Deity guardian."</p><p></p><p>"It was my father the emperor, who wanted to find the person I was betrothed to, that bastard. He was arrogant, saying he could marry me, that it was my three-life blessing. </p><p></p><p>"He even wanted me to serve him. In a fit of anger, I killed him.</p><p></p><p>"While his guardian hadn't noticed yet, I escaped and finally made it here."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun sneered.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was surprised. "The bloodline of the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be that some people from the Spirit Realm entered the mortal realm in the past, and their descendants remained here."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun stood up in front of Meng Chong, saying coquettishly, "I've been banished by my father and cut off from the family. I have no home now, so I've come to seek refuge with you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned. "You also have a jade token, and your father..."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun sneered. "He's just a bastard. If he knew I had the jade token, the first thing he would do is lock me up and seize the token for himself, or even kill me.</p><p></p><p>"He's already sent people to hunt me down, what else is there to say?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then you can stay on Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>As for Ziyun's troubles, he didn't mind at all. The Purple Cloud Kingdom would not last long anyway.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the Great Wasteland was unstoppable, and Meng Chong knew the goals of those powerful figures. The insignificant Purple Cloud Kingdom could not obstruct the great tide!</p><p></p><p>"The time for those with jade tokens to enter the Spirit Realm is not far off. Will you come with me?" Ziyun asked.</p><p></p><p>"You pursue your own opportunities. I will go to the Spirit Realm, and we will meet again someday!" Meng Chong replied after thinking it over.</p><p></p><p>After rescuing Ziyun, Meng Chong continued his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" Ziyun respectfully paid her respects to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded, allowing Ziyun to stay as she pleased.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun's talent was not bad, and she was Meng Chong's follower. Whether she could become his disciple's wife would depend on their own fate. As her master, Li Xuan would not interfere.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island did not stir up any waves due to Ziyun's arrival, and the powerful figures of the Purple Cloud Kingdom did not dare to set foot on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Purple Cloud Kingdom was also in a difficult situation.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the Great Wasteland was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>As many powerful figures and forces pushed forward the matter of the Spirit Realm, news of it gradually spread in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Inner Realm were viewed as servants and dogs by the Spirit Realm. Driven by the powerful figures and major forces, the Inner Realm cultivators felt a sense of indignation - the Spirit Realm had bullied them too much, and they had the idea to fight for the honor of the Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm was not a vassal of the Spirit Realm, not a place for them to choose servants!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Inner Realm was no longer the Inner Realm, but the Great Wasteland, the true orthodox land! The term "Inner Realm" was gradually abandoned, replaced by the concept of the Great Wasteland taking root in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>With the joint efforts of many powerful figures and top forces, the momentum of the Great Wasteland had become unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Kingdom was already on the verge of collapse, and some ministers had even directly betrayed and joined the Great Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has completed his Great Sun Golden Body. Your Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Great Sun Golden Body was complete.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would accumulate his foundation and prepare for the breakthrough to the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Meng Chong's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the Shenyi Realm of the Dao of Martial Arts. Your Pill Dao Martial Arts has broken through to the Shenyi Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Pill Dao Martial Arts had advanced to the Shenyi Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Tong Xuan Realm Perfection. Your Pill Dao Martial Arts has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had reached Tong Xuan Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan should be about to break through as well, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already killed several minor Heavenly Deities, but Li Xuan didn't know the reason.</p><p></p><p>Could it be for the sake of competing for treasures?</p><p></p><p>"Where is my fourth disciple?" Li Xuan thought about the Qimen Martial Arts, still without a suitable person to comprehend it, which made him quite troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I should let her try?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of Ziyun. This one was one of the three youngest grand masters in the Inner Realm, and her talent seemed even stronger than Xie Lingfeng's.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a pre-drawn array diagram and called Ziyun over.</p><p></p><p>"This diagram, you can try to comprehend it. If you gain any insights, you may obtain an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" Ziyun was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>She picked up the array diagram, but found it very profound and puzzling, unable to grasp the essence.</p><p></p><p>"It's too profound, I need to ponder it carefully."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun began to comprehend the array diagram.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Li Xuan became somewhat disappointed as Ziyun was unable to comprehend anything.</p><p></p><p>It seems she did not possess the talent for array techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was finally preparing to break through to the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan went to the Spirit Realm, she had been cultivating more diligently, sometimes practicing for two and a half hours a day, at least two hours.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were still times when she slacked off, but overall, her diligence had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was finally ready to break through to the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, on Canglan Island, the weakest ones were the Qi and Blood Realm Perfection disciples, the pill refinement disciples.</p><p></p><p>Pan the Alchemist had already reached Minor Xiantian, and had learned the most basic pill refinement techniques, able to independently refine low-grade pills like Qi Blood Pills and Nurture Qi Pills.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and Zhou Ying had both reached Xiantian Perfection, but the two had encountered bottlenecks and could not break through to the Tong Xuan Realm in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother breaking through to Xiantian was a natural progression, and her strength was not expected to be too great.</p><p></p><p>She lacked any martial arts cultivation, only enjoying a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Junhe and Xu Yan's father's thoughts, Xu's mother just needed to enjoy herself, not participate in any fighting or killing.</p><p></p><p>That day, Li Xuan felt he had memorized the second page of the Taicangshu well enough, and could now inscribe it into the Great Dao Golden Book, pondering the creation of an even higher-level formation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Dao Golden Book on the Spirit Platform opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

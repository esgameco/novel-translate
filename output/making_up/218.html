        <h1>Chapter 218</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was contemplating the Dao of the sword, but the enlightenment of the sword heart was still somewhat mysterious to him. He had learned about it from Xie Lingfeng, but even Xie Lingfeng himself did not fully comprehend the key points of the enlightenment of the sword heart, so he could not explain it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although Xie Tianheng knew about the enlightenment of the sword heart, and Xie Lingfeng had told him everything he knew, it was still not easy for Xie Tianheng to comprehend it. He could not find the clue!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a little troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go ask that senior for advice?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>That senior was highly respected, wise and broad-minded. If Xie Tianheng went to ask him for advice, he would surely be willing to point him in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>However, when Xie Tianheng thought back to how he had once stood up to that strong cultivator with an arrogant and overbearing attitude, he blushed and felt too embarrassed to face him.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng felt that his skin was still too thin, so he could only sigh inwardly and continue to ponder and comprehend on his own.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice sounded beside him.</p><p></p><p>"To attain the enlightenment of the sword heart, you must first purify your mind, not be disturbed by external things, and have only the sword in your thoughts... Your talent in the Dao of the sword is not bad, and you have mastered many sword techniques, and can even comprehend the sword intent. You already have some experience.</p><p></p><p>"With the state of mind you have when comprehending the sword intent, immerse yourself in it and understand the meaning within, and the enlightenment of the sword heart will not be far away."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's heart trembled, someone had approached him without him even noticing! Immediately, he was greatly excited, for this voice was none other than that senior's!</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked up and sure enough, saw the senior standing in the distance, gazing at the rolling sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for guiding me out of the confusion!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng hurriedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and continued to instruct Xie Tianheng.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was excited, as he had vaguely gained some understanding. He was confident that if he closed himself off for some time, he would surely be able to attain the enlightenment of the sword heart!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, have you come here with any instructions for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng asked respectfully after his excitement had subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Just wandering around, no particular instructions."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If the senior has any instructions, Xie Tianheng will go through fire and water to complete them!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good intention."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Xie Tianheng, Li Xuan did not linger too long on the Sword Saint Cliff, and left the mountain. His next destination was to go to the Seven Star Academy, now called the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy. Along the way, he leisurely enjoyed the scenery and observed the local customs and people.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he passed by some small villages and unexpectedly found a few young cultivators practicing at the skin-refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Feeling interested, he gave them some guidance.</p><p></p><p>That day, before he arrived at the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, the Golden Book of the Dao on his Spiritual Platform suddenly opened, and a golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the cultivation method of the Heart Sword Realm, and you have advanced to the Heart Sword Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Xuan felt that his Dao of the Sword had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Sword Realm! All things can become the sword!</p><p></p><p>With a single step, the weeds floated and transformed into fierce, slashing swords, like a torrential flood of swords sweeping out, instantly piercing through a small hillside in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"The Heart Sword Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally comprehended the cultivation path of the second realm of the Dao of the Sword, the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that once Xu Yan broke through to the Divine Will Realm, his realm in the Dao of the Sword would also surpass the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true power of the Dao of the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied with the Dao of the Sword he had created.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to find an opportunity to pass on the third realm to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has perfectly attained the enlightenment of the sword heart, and your Heart Sword Realm has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had perfectly attained the enlightenment of the sword heart.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Sword had advanced further.</p><p></p><p>"His strength is growing stronger every day!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with amazement, Xu Yan's strength was constantly increasing and growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Continuing on to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, just as he arrived in the Seven Star City, the Golden Book of the Dao opened again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong's Dao of the Blade has reached mastery, and your Blade Soul has advanced to the Hidden Blade Realm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Dao of the Blade had also finally broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has perfected the Tyrannical Blade Intent, and your Blade Intent has advanced to the second level."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Blade Intent had also broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong should be about to comprehend the first level of the Unbreakable Golden Body soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, he remained very low-key, not attracting any attention, not even White Cloud and the others knew of his presence.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the former Seven Star Academy, dedicated to the transmission of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded as he watched the instructors teaching the students the Great Wilderness Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>After teaching the students, these instructors would also immerse themselves in the comprehension and cultivation of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>However, the Grand Masters had turned to cultivate the Profound Dao, but had not yet broken through, and the strength of the Profound Realm was superior to the Grand Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>This made it impossible for the Grand Masters to switch to the Profound Dao, they could only switch to the Primal Dao first, and then break through to the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the peak Grand Masters, they did possess the conditions to switch, but the cultivation method of the Profound Dao was not yet perfected.</p><p></p><p>Neither Xu Yan, nor Su Lingxiu, had much attention focused on this aspect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Profound Dao had not yet been transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stayed at the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, either guiding the instructors in their cultivation, or guiding the students.</p><p></p><p>He finally felt the sense of being a Martial Ancestor, transmitting the Dao and teaching disciples.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Profound Realm Perfection, and your Divine Will Realm strength has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the Profound Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Profound Realm Mastery, and your Great Day Golden Body has doubled in strength."</p><p></p><p>Just a few days after Xu Yan, Meng Chong had also broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Profound Realm Minor Success, and your Pill Dao and Martial Dao in the Profound Realm are now perfected, gaining further enhancement."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had also broken through to the Profound Realm Minor Success.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to guide the instructors and students in the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, and anyone who received his guidance saw their strength rapidly soar.</p><p></p><p>He also noticed Du Yuying and her maid Cui'er, occasionally hearing the cute maid muttering about Young Master Xu...</p><p></p><p>"This girl has good talent and bloodline, and also possesses a special physique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently nodded, Du Yuying had already reached the Grand Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Celestial Tomb and making up for the deficiencies in her body, her talent had further improved, and her strength had broken through rapidly.</p><p></p><p>At the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, Li Xuan was a little regretful that he had not found a suitable disciple.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached Profound Realm Perfection, and if he did not accumulate a foundation, his body would undergo another transformation when he broke through to the Divine Will Realm. He was about ready to break through to the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan would certainly not choose to break through at this time.</p><p></p><p>He would continue to accumulate his own foundation, so that when he broke through to the Divine Will Realm, he could undergo another transformation and advancement.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Xu Yan has reached the Spirit Body, if he undergoes another transformation and advancement, will he surpass the Spirit Body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the more time it takes to accumulate one's own foundation. To accumulate the foundation faster, the consumption of spirit medicines is indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu should already be refining pills.</p><p></p><p>However, the spirit medicines in the Inner Realm are ultimately of a lower grade.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan left the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao Academy, continuing to wander the mountains and waters, while returning to Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the second layer of the Dao of the Sword, and your second layer of the Dao of the Sword has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Dao of the Sword had broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Go take a look at the Cangbei region, the gate to the Spirit Realm is there."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recalled the gate to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had slapped that lecherous Dao Celestial to death last time, he had not heard of any Dao Celestials appearing in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>It seems that, apart from that one, no other Dao Celestials have come to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"After all, in their eyes, the inner domain is a lowly place, a place for pigs and dogs, they are used to being high and mighty, so naturally they would not have any strong experts come to the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood this to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the one Xu Yan killed, or the one he himself had slapped to death, they had come to the inner domain on a mission, right?</p><p></p><p>As for what the mission was, it no longer mattered.</p><p></p><p>They were dead!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then headed towards the Cangbei region.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual qi of the Spirit Realm is probably far beyond what the inner domain can compare to, and that is precisely why they would view the inner domain as a lowly place."</p><p></p><p>In the remote border regions, although there is heavenly and earthly spiritual qi, the heavenly and earthly mechanisms have dissipated, and the Taiyang Dao cannot be cultivated in the border regions.</p><p></p><p>While the inner domain does have spiritual qi, and the heavenly and earthly mechanisms exist, compared to the Spirit Realm, it is probably vastly inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation in the Spirit Realm is easier and simpler, Xu Yan wanted to quickly accumulate a foundation to prepare for his breakthrough to the Divine Intent Realm, he probably had to go to the Spirit Realm to do so."</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, although it does not hinder cultivation, the speed of accumulating a foundation is far slower than in the Spirit Realm, this is inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Cangbei region, vast and snowy.</p><p></p><p>A gigantic gate, rippling like water, stands between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The gate is closed.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of the Treasure Pavilion Mountain, the purple-crowned men, the high-ranking members of the Treasure Pavilion, are now looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Something seems to be amiss! The previous Dao Celestial who entered simply disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>As for the next Dao Celestial, that seductive woman, there were still some news at first, causing some carnage.</p><p></p><p>That one seems to be more promiscuous, the last news was that she was looking for a handsome and powerful man.</p><p></p><p>Then, there was complete silence, as if she had vanished into thin air! That was a Dao Celestial, in the inner domain, who could possibly be their match?</p><p></p><p>And when fighting a Dao Celestial, the commotion would certainly not be small, even if they were killed, they would not disappear so quietly.</p><p></p><p>Unless, they were killed in just a few moves!</p><p></p><p>"Canglang Island!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned men, this name suddenly flashed in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the mysterious existence on Canglang Island, no one else has such strength.</p><p></p><p>But the two Dao Celestials did not go to Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>The directions they went were unrelated to Canglang Island, and the female Celestial's last disappearance was too far from Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, all the signs indicate that the senior on Canglang Island seems to have never left the island.</p><p></p><p>"That senior has high virtue and unfathomable strength, he does not oppress others with his realm, and the Dao Celestials have not offended Canglang Island, so he naturally would not intervene."</p><p></p><p>Someone spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The others all nodded in agreement. That senior, when he acts, never oppresses with his realm, a truly great virtuous sage, his realm can only be looked up to in awe.</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man also acknowledged this view.</p><p></p><p>"You all wonder, why did those two Celestials disappear? Could there be another treasure land in the inner domain worth exploring? And even if they were exploring a treasure land, they should have emerged by now, there should not be no movement at all."</p><p></p><p>It's as if they just vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>There is only one possibility, they were killed! Could it be that the inner domain is hiding a second powerful expert besides Canglang Island? "Is it possible that it's the Demon Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man shook his head and said, "Impossible, the Demon Lord should be dead."</p><p></p><p>That person who entered the inner domain to kill the Demon Lord, the Demon Lord was not at his peak at the time, how could he be a match for that person? He must have died for sure!</p><p></p><p>"Then there is only one possibility!"</p><p></p><p>Someone took a deep breath and uttered two words: "Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, everyone fell silent, their hearts shaken, it's only been a short while, Xu Yan has already killed Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Xu Yan, there is no other existence in the entire inner domain that could possibly kill Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, although extremely strong, is still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>That seductive woman disappeared before she could find a handsome and powerful man.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan, majestic and handsome, with great strength... It's likely that he unfortunately encountered Xu Yan, and was then killed by him! "Xu Yan should enter the Spirit Realm, I want to see if those fellows in the Spirit Realm are still so arrogant! "</p><p></p><p>Someone had an expectant look on their face.</p><p></p><p>The experts in the Spirit Realm have bullied too much, it's time someone put them in their place.</p><p></p><p>If they also treat Xu Yan that way, what awaits them is being annihilated without a trace!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked in the Cangbei region, and saw the gigantic gate rippling like water from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Are those experts from the Treasure Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the people on the Treasure Pavilion Mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>He enveloped the area with his divine sense, making it so that no one could see his figure.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of the gate to the Spirit Realm, Li Xuan stared at the gigantic gate rippling like water. "Was this gate formed by the laws of heaven and earth, or was it artificially created?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was no stranger to the laws of heaven and earth, especially the Taiyang laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After probing the gate to the Spirit Realm with his divine sense, he found that this gigantic gate was formed by the convergence of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If it was artificially created by the experts separating the Spirit Realm and the inner domain, they must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Even Shenxing Celestials cannot do this, let alone Liangshen Celestials."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, what exactly happened to the Taiyang heavens and earth, using a gate to connect the Spirit Realm and the inner domain, as if dividing the heavens and earth into several regions.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his divine sense, he did not push the gate open, although he had reached the Divine Intent Realm and could slap small Celestials to death with a palm strike, his strength was still lacking.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm has Liangshen Celestials, these formidable existences.</p><p></p><p>There may even be experts surpassing Liangshen Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Now is not the time to enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there seems to be something special over there."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly noticed something peculiar in the valley between two mountains in the distance.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered and he arrived at the entrance of the valley.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Demon Hunting Battlefield that Meng Chong mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Hunting Battlefield, the place where a group of Spirit Realm experts surrounded and killed the Demon Lord who had fled into the inner domain in the past.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stepped into the valley.</p><p></p><p>"This place seems to have a natural formation? Or rather, it is a peculiar place formed by the momentum of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan walked through the valley, he became more and more amazed.</p><p></p><p>"The formation and layout of the Qimen Martial Dao, I can use the terrain and geography of this place as a reference, incorporating it into a formation or array as a reference for the comprehension of Qimen Martial Dao formations."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought as such, his divine sense spreading out to record and depict the terrain and geography of the Demon Hunting Battlefield into a pattern, integrating it into the Qimen Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>(Explanation: The Three Celestial Realms are the three great realms, namely Gathering Spirit, Uniting Spirit, and Refining Spirit, collectively known as the Three Celestial Realms; also called Small Celestial, Great Celestial, and Liangshen Celestial; Gathering Spirit early, middle, and late stages, and perfection, these are the smaller realms; Divine Intent, Divine Element, Divine Ability, these can also be called the Three Divine Realms.)</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

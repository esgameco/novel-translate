        <h1>Chapter 462</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the absorbed immutable qi, Jiang Buping continued killing in the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Time to strengthen myself a bit."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sat down in a certain spot in the Heavenly Cave. He took out a formation disk, set up an array, and then brought out the soul treasure obtained from the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"This can be refined into the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping paid no mind to the powerful experts arranged outside the Heavenly Cave. After this enhancement, he would break out of the cave, slaughter the encircling experts, and kill until the enemy was terrified.</p><p></p><p>"After finishing this round of killing, it will be time to go to the Taikun Realm."</p><p></p><p>Some debts were due to be settled.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Jiang Buping wielded the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon and strode towards the entrance of the Heavenly Cave. A great battle erupted.</p><p></p><p>One man with one spear, killing until the many experts were terrified!...</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Realm, the first and most powerful realm of the Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Divine Sect was the number one sect in the Divine Domain, with an ancient heritage. It had existed since the emergence of the Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>It ruled over the Taihe Realm, and when the Divine Domain faced great crises, it would step forward to coordinate all sides, jointly resist external enemies, and safeguard the Divine Domain's security.</p><p></p><p>The path to break through the Immortal Realm's upper limit was also in the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Realm contained the Divine Domain's number one Heavenly Cave, which was the strongest and most dangerous cave in the Divine Domain. Within it gathered external enemies such as the Netherworld, demon sorcerers, and extraterrestrial true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Taihe Divine Palace, many powerful experts of the Taihe Sect had gathered.</p><p></p><p>At the front of the palace, in the main seat, sat a figure shrouded in faint light. Its appearance could not be clearly seen, nor could its strength be discerned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sect Master of the Taihe Divine Sect was standing respectfully in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary, the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is causing chaos in the Divine Domain, and they are colluding with external enemies. Should we gather the various forces of the Divine Domain to jointly eliminate Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow?" </p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>A calm voice came from the figure in the main seat: "The world has reached a time when change is necessary. If Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow wants to act, then let them act. However, they cannot be allowed to truly throw the Divine Domain into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"The world can be unified, but it will still be the world of our Cang Heaven and Earth, not the world of outsiders. This is a matter of principle.</p><p></p><p>"When necessary, open the Heavenly Ladder, and naturally someone will come to deal with these matters."</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master asked respectfully: "Emissary, should we just watch Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow's actions for now?"</p><p></p><p>"The world must change eventually. If Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow wants to push for it, then let them. However, whether they can profit from it depends on whether Heaven's Bane has that capability.</p><p></p><p>"You only need to open the Heavenly Ladder when necessary."</p><p></p><p>The Emissary said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master nodded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Then he spoke again: "A powerful expert has appeared in the Divine Domain, killing Immortal Realm martial artists like chickens. Could there be other powerful figures plotting?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Killing Immortals like chickens? Besides Heaven's Bane's people, with Heavenly Unity Realm or Divine Venerate Realm martial artists descending, are there others scheming?"</p><p></p><p>The Emissary was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Emissary, from the information we have, they don't seem to be martial artists above the Immortal Realm, but they also don't seem to be of the Immortal Realm. It's as if the martial dao they practice is rather special and powerful."</p><p></p><p>A Taihe Sect elder spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is too weak to break through their concealment techniques, which is why you mistakenly believe they are not above the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Emissary said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"There are some secret techniques that can conceal oneself, even disguise one's martial dao aura, causing people to misunderstand. And the most skilled at such secret techniques are none other than..."</p><p></p><p>The Emissary suddenly stopped, not continuing further.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Taihe Sect Master and others suddenly realized. So that was it.</p><p></p><p>Since it was said by the Emissary, it naturally couldn't be wrong.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Emissary gave some more instructions and learned about the current situation in the Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary, since Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is lurking, and Heavenly Unity Realm or even Divine Venerate Realm experts are in the Divine Domain, will this pose a threat to us? If they were to attack our sect, wouldn't we be unable to resist?" </p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>There shouldn't be martial artists above the Immortal Realm in the Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, martial artists above the Immortal Realm shouldn't stay in the Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Heaven's Bane wouldn't dare. Besides, if they really do attack, just open the Heavenly Ladder. Someone will naturally come to eliminate them!"</p><p></p><p>The Emissary said calmly, completely dismissing Heaven's Bane.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary, can the world truly be unified?"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it can be unified is yet unknown, but the world's structure will ultimately change."</p><p></p><p>After the Emissary finished speaking, the faint light began to fade.</p><p></p><p>"If there are unexpected changes beyond expectations, open the Heavenly Ladder."</p><p></p><p>As the Emissary's figure faded, these were the last words left behind.</p><p></p><p>"We obey!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master and others said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>This time, by inviting a strand of the Emissary's divided soul to descend, they had finally resolved some confusion and also learned what the Taihe Sect should do next.</p><p></p><p>"Our Taihe Sect should not have Earth's Shadow lurking within, but to ensure against the worst, everyone should take action. Keep a close eye on the movements in the Divine Domain. Once there are unexpected changes, open the Heavenly Ladder!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect Master looked at the group of elders and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect began to prepare for the changes in the Divine Domain and the transformations of the world.</p><p></p><p>In the Taikun Realm, within the Jiang Clan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jiang Clan's ancestral shrine, the current clan leader and several great clan elders stood respectfully in the main hall of the shrine.</p><p></p><p>A faint light appeared on the statue of the ancestor enshrined in the ancestral shrine. At this moment, the statue's eyes opened, and the entire statue seemed to come to life.</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully welcome the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan leader and the great clan elders all knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A majestic voice came from the statue: "The world is about to undergo some changes. When the Heavenly Ladder appears, someone will descend to the Divine Domain. You should make preparations."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan leader and others said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"How is the current situation in the Divine Domain? Tell me everything."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan leader and the great clan elders began to describe the changes in the Divine Domain, including the turmoil and Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow's behind-the-scenes manipulations.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Jiang Clan leader said: "Reporting to the Ancestor, our Jiang family has a rebellious descendant named Jiang Buping. His soul was once tainted by immutable qi, but for unknown reasons, he did not lose his mind and has already recovered. His strength far surpasses others at the same level, and he kills Immortal Realm martial artists as if it were effortless..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?"</p><p></p><p>The voice from the statue sounded slightly surprised, then continued: "If that's the case, it's likely that a Supreme Being is hiding in the Divine Domain and resolved his immutable qi issue for him. But why target our Jiang family's descendant?" Based on what you say, this Jiang Buping has extraordinary talent, so it's understandable that he caught someone's eye. You can handle this matter yourselves. As for the Supreme Being behind him..."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, the statue's voice came again: "A Supreme Being cannot be offended lightly. When the Heavenly Ladder opens, someone will naturally come to have a talk with them. Before that, you should weigh your options carefully."</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan leader and others were slightly shocked. Even the Ancestor was unwilling to rashly offend the so-called Supreme Being?</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that offending them was not entirely impossible, rather it depended on the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan leader and others respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Great Ancestor, what is meant by 'Supreme'?"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan elder couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme realm of martial arts," the voice from the statue said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Then it added: "Above the Immortal realm is the Heaven Union realm. Above Heaven Union is the Divine Lord realm, the Divine Lord realm of martial arts. And above the Divine Lord realm is the Supreme realm."</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan leader and others were shocked. They only knew that above the Immortal realm was the Heaven Union realm, but were unaware of the realms beyond that.</p><p></p><p>In the past, these ancestors never spoke of this, only telling them to focus on cultivation. When the time came, they would ascend the heavenly ladder and leave the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Today, the ancestor had actually answered this question. It must be because great changes were coming to the world, so they were being told the answer.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Union is easy to achieve, Divine Lord is difficult to ascend to, and Supreme is one in ten thousand. As for what's above Supreme, you don't need to know - in the entire world, they can be counted on one's fingers."</p><p></p><p>After the voice from the statue finished speaking, it said: "That's all. Act with caution, don't be reckless!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Great Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The light from the statue faded, its open eyes closed, and that trace of descended consciousness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan leader and others looked at each other, their expressions heavy. They would need to be more careful in how to deal with Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"What's the result of the ambush on Jiang Buping?" the Jiang clan leader asked sternly, regaining the authority of a clan leader.</p><p></p><p>"No news has come back yet!" The grand elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the clan leader, he said gravely: "Jiang Buping will certainly come to Taikun Realm to demand an explanation. He will definitely kill Jiang Tianming. Clan Leader, do you want to mobilize the entire clan's strength to protect Jiang Tianming?"</p><p></p><p>The other clan elders also silently looked at the clan leader.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming was the clan leader's third son, very favored, and with extremely prodigious talent.</p><p></p><p>However, the talent Jiang Buping had now displayed was even more prodigious. Jiang Buping was actually also this clan leader's son, but born of a concubine, originally not well-regarded.</p><p></p><p>Only because of his outstanding talent did the clan elders decide to bring him back to the family and give him the treatment of a genius. Who knew that Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er would secretly plot against Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the grand elder personally investigated and found that Jiang Buping had been crippled, so he said nothing more and allowed Jiang Buping to be expelled.</p><p></p><p>Now it was good - the abandoned son of Taikun had risen in a counterattack, severely slapping the Jiang clan's face. Countless factions and powerful figures in the divine realm were waiting to watch the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>The news that Jiang Buping had been contaminated with indestructible energy but was unharmed was spread by Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er. Without this clan leader's tacit approval, or even pushing things along, it absolutely could not have reached this point.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, several clan elders and powerful figures from the Cloud Above Sect had participated in this ambush on Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Jiang Tianming was afraid and wanted to borrow external forces to kill Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>And this clan leader was obviously protecting Jiang Tianming, thus adopting a tacit attitude.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan leader looked at the grand elder and others. Mobilize the entire clan's strength to protect Jiang Tianming? "Let's wait for the results of this battle before deciding," the Jiang clan leader said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"With turmoil in the divine realm and great changes in the world, I hope the clan leader can think thrice about how our Jiang clan will be passed down!" The grand elder said, then strode away.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Flame Realm, within the royal palace of the Great Flame Dynasty, the Great Flame Emperor and several royal powerhouses were also awaiting instructions.</p><p></p><p>In the Taomiao Realm, within the Taomiao Divine Sect, an internal struggle had concluded, with several Immortal Heavenly Venerable elders perishing in succession.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a small garden in the core area behind Taomiao Divine Sect's mountain, the current sect master and others entered this small garden.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was among this group.</p><p></p><p>With her strength, she originally had no qualifications to enter here, but only because the cultivation method she practiced was so special, her status was unusual, and an exception was made for her to come here.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" Seeing the small courtyard with its myriad flowers and enchanting scenery, Xin Mengrou was shocked.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, she couldn't tell if this was real or illusory.</p><p></p><p>After entering the small courtyard, under the sect master's lead, they came to an elegant pavilion in the yard.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Upper Sect Emissary!" The Taomiao sect master respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>The originally closed door of the elegant pavilion opened.</p><p></p><p>Entering the pavilion, Xin Mengrou glanced around and saw that there was only a seated statue inside.</p><p></p><p>The statue of a jade-white, flawlessly beautiful woman seemed both real and illusory, giving a strange feeling of being ethereal and intangible, yet truly existing.</p><p></p><p>The Taomiao sect master was the first to prostrate himself before the statue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xin Mengrou hurriedly followed suit and bowed down.</p><p></p><p>The statue's eyes seemed to come alive, its gaze looking over. For some reason, Xin Mengrou felt that the statue's gaze seemed to be looking at her.</p><p></p><p>"The Taomiao struggle has ended. Whether the Dream Path or the Supreme Path, they are ultimately the Taomiao Path. From today, there shall be no more attacks on each other. As people of the same sect, you should unite and work together to resist external enemies."</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from the statue.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The Taomiao sect master and others hurriedly responded with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Taomiao sect master reported on matters in the divine realm, as well as the issue of infiltration by the Heavenly Fiend and Earthly Shadow, and finally introduced the current state of the Taomiao Dream Path.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Fiend's hand has reached too far. Clean it up."</p><p></p><p>The statue's voice was cold, with no discernible emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Then, the statue's gaze fell on Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>"It has been a long time since the Taomiao Sect of the divine realm has had such a talented practitioner of the Dream Path. You are very good. From today, you will take charge of the Taomiao Dream Path."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was stunned and hurriedly said respectfully: "This disciple's strength is low, not enough to..."</p><p></p><p>"You will stay here in seclusion with me for some time. I will give you some guidance, and you will soon be able to break through to the Immortal realm. The Dream Path is ultimately somewhat different from ordinary martial arts cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, Emissary!" Xin Mengrou said respectfully, secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>The Taomiao sect master and others couldn't help but be greatly surprised, especially the current head of the Taomiao Dream Path, who was even more astonished.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xin Mengrou's talent was even more outstanding than anticipated, and that was why she had caught the Emissary's eye and been directly named as the head of the Dream Path? In any case, Xin Mengrou taking over the Dream Path, especially being appointed by the Emissary who was even prepared to personally guide her, was undoubtedly a great thing for the declining Dream Path.</p><p></p><p>After the Taomiao sect master and others had withdrawn, leaving only Xin Mengrou in the pavilion, a woman's ethereal figure walked out from the statue.</p><p></p><p>She was like a dream, extremely unreal, yet irresistibly fascinating.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou dared not look too much and stood respectfully with her head bowed.</p><p></p><p>"The Dream Path you cultivate is slightly different. Have you had other insights?" the woman asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple once received guidance from a senior, thus gaining some insights," Xin Mengrou said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? What is the name of this senior you speak of?"</p><p></p><p>"This junior does not know!"</p><p></p><p>"Given the chance, I would like to meet this senior of yours, to see who exactly could give guidance on my Dream Path."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou kept her head lowered, but her heart was greatly shaken. Could this woman be the founder of the Taomiao Dream Path, the Ancestor of Taomiao?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

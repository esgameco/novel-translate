            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 35: Roasting Chicken with Bare Hands, Committing a Grave Sin</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Xu Yan kept practicing according to his newfound insights. One crater after another was blasted out of the ground, until late at night when he had expended a significant amount of his vital energy and felt fatigued, finally returning to the village reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Xu Yan was full of vigor and came back to the hillside to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A palm strike sent the soil flying three zhang away, creating a crater.</p><p></p><p>"The power has increased again. My insights were correct. I'm still only at the superficial stage, but the palm force can be further enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the crater on the ground, his heart filled with excitement. </p><p></p><p>This palm strike was already twice as powerful as before he had cultivated the Dragon-Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>He had finally broken free from relying solely on brute force in battle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Let me go see how my foolish disciple is doing with his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan strolled over leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hurriedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the various sized craters on the ground, all blasted out by Xu Yan during his practice.</p><p></p><p>He was delighted inwardly: "He has gained some insights? Judging from the power of these craters, they were not created by mere brute force alone. Although he has not yet mastered the Dragon-Subduing Palm, given time, he will surely succeed."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have gained some enlightenment," Xu Yan said, then raised his hand and struck out a palm, booming as it created a hole in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained calm, but he was inwardly amazed: "This disciple is truly talented. He has grasped how to release his vital energy in a certain way to greatly increase the power."</p><p></p><p>"He must have comprehended the first line of the incantation, right?"</p><p></p><p>He then spoke: "The fact that you have gained some insights shows you have the aptitude for cultivating the Dragon-Subduing Palm. However, you must always remember that enemies will not give you time to build up power. You must achieve the state where the palm moves as the mind wills.</p><p></p><p>"Only when you cultivate the dragon-shaped palm force will you be considered to have roughly grasped the initial stage of this technique.</p><p></p><p>"Calm your mind, contemplate more, and practice more."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled: "That's right, before each strike, I go through a process of building up power, however brief it may be. But for experts, life and death can be decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"My insights were not wrong, but they are still not deep enough. I need to continue working hard."</p><p></p><p>He respectfully bowed: "Thank you, Master, for your guidance!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and turned to leave with a leisurely gait. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't stay too long, nor could he give too much guidance, lest he be stumped by his disciple's questions, which would be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan took a look at Xu Yan's cultivation progress and then departed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Xu Yan would cultivate the Dragon-Subduing Palm in the mornings, contemplate and practice body techniques in the Eight Trigrams Diagram in the afternoons, and cultivate the vital energy incantation in the evenings to strengthen his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>Before long, half a month had passed. </p><p></p><p>The hillside was covered with large and small craters from Xu Yan's Dragon-Subduing Palm practice, showing his tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>He could now unleash the palm force as soon as the thought arose, swift and at will.</p><p></p><p>When he struck out a palm now, the vital energy-infused palm force was like a raging torrent as thick as a calf, hitting the ground with tremendous speed and ferocity.</p><p></p><p>The power had increased by more than three times compared to before.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not yet cultivated the dragon-shaped palm force, only managing to unleash ordinary vital energy surges, even though the power had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet truly mastered the Dragon-Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was contemplating the incantation of the Dragon-Subduing Palm and summarizing the insights he had gained over the past half month.</p><p></p><p>"How do I condense the dragon-shaped palm force? Why is it necessary to refine it into a dragon-shaped palm force?"</p><p></p><p>"How should I proceed?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How can I start cultivating the Dragon Palm technique?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of a true dragon appeared.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood circulated, and a surge of qi and blood flowed out from his palm, gradually transforming into a dragon-like shape under his control.</p><p></p><p>However, it ultimately became a force resembling a python, far from the true dragon form.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, refining the dragon form requires mastery over one's own qi and blood. Only by enhancing the control of my qi and blood can I refine the true dragon form.</p><p></p><p>"If I can achieve this, the dragon-shaped palm force I create will be no different from a true dragon. Perhaps this is the pinnacle of the Dragon Palm technique.</p><p></p><p>"At this stage, what I need to do is to refine the dragon form, with horns, whiskers, and claws..."</p><p></p><p>With a clear direction, Xu Yan began to cultivate the Dragon Palm technique by mobilizing his qi and blood, trying to refine the dragon form.</p><p></p><p>Yet, each time he managed to form a horn, he failed to form the claws, and his qi and blood would collapse uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized that to refine the dragon-shaped palm force, he must first strengthen his control over his qi and blood, which is also the prerequisite for mastering the Dragon Palm technique.</p><p></p><p>"With the Dragon Palm technique, my palm force will increase dramatically, and its strength will be at my command, not like the near-uncontrollable state I'm in now."</p><p></p><p>After understanding the key to cultivating the Dragon Palm technique, Xu Yan began to explore how to enhance his control over his qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, although he had made some progress in controlling his qi and blood, he was still far from being able to refine the dragon-shaped palm force.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how can I improve my control over my qi and blood?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but ask during a meal.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan paused slightly. How should he improve the control over qi and blood? He didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as a master, he couldn't just give such a response.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the chicken leg in the bowl, and suddenly had an idea. He said, "Disciple, your understanding of the importance of qi and blood control shows that you have reached a bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>"Qi and blood lie within oneself. How to improve the control? Use every bit of qi and blood effectively, and control them at will?</p><p></p><p>"You can try roasting meat with your qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tore off a piece of chicken meat and continued eating while speaking, "Hand-roasting meat is a supreme skill. Using qi and blood to roast the meat, this requires a very high level of qi and blood control.</p><p></p><p>"Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, roasted to perfection. This is not easy.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see this chicken leg?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tore off the remaining chicken leg and placed it in his own bowl, continuing, "When you can use your hands to roast the chicken leg until it's fully cooked, while the meat outside the leg is still raw, your control over qi and blood will have passed the test."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened thoughtfully, inwardly admiring, "So cultivation is actually in the details of daily life. I'm still far behind. Master's realm is too high."</p><p></p><p>He no longer ate, and said, "Master, I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, that's good!" Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly ran to the chicken coop, grabbed a chicken, skillfully plucked its feathers and slaughtered it, then held it in his palm.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, and the scorching qi and blood instantly enveloped the chicken.</p><p></p><p>A sizzling sound rang out, and as soon as he smelled the aroma of the meat, the chicken in his hand had turned completely black when the qi and blood receded.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer edible.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head, summarizing the experience, and grabbed another chicken, plucked its feathers, slaughtered it, and placed it in his palm to roast with qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Again, he ended up burning the chicken to a crisp.</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan finished his meal and strolled leisurely through the village, he saw more than a dozen blackened chickens scattered at Xu Yan's feet, and Xu Yan was currently roasting another freshly slaughtered chicken in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Goodness gracious!" Li Xuan's mouth twitched. In such a short time, Xu Yan had already ruined over a dozen chickens. If he didn't stop him, the entire chicken coop would be destroyed tomorrow!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

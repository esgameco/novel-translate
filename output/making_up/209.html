        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was extremely excited, as he was truly the pioneer of his great martial dao undertaking. In such a short time, he had already comprehended the profound Shen Yi Boundary martial dao technique.</p><p></p><p>"The power and mystery of the Shen Yi Boundary is even more formidable than I had anticipated. When the divine will is present, the Heavenly Mandate cannot be defied. Within the scope of my Shen Yi, I am akin to the Heavenly Mandate!"</p><p></p><p>Even if thousands or hundreds of peak grand masters were to attack him now, Li Xuan could simply sit there motionless, and with a single thought, make them all kneel before him. This level of martial dao Heavenly Human suppressive pressure was something ordinary martial artists could never achieve.</p><p></p><p>"What is my 'golden finger'?"</p><p></p><p>According to his previous speculation, after the opening of the Nidan Palace, the cultivation of the Spiritual Platform, and the refining of the martial Shen Yi, he should be able to see the "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited as he withdrew the Shen Yi that had covered the Canglang Island, and his consciousness entered the Nidan Palace, arriving at the Spiritual Platform.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he excitedly saw the embodiment of the golden light.</p><p></p><p>Above the Shen Yi form on the Spiritual Platform in the Nidan Palace, there was a golden book shrouded in golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Yi form suddenly stirred, as if it had opened its eyes and was gazing at the golden book! In that instant, a realization dawned upon Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book!</p><p></p><p>This was his "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>The Shen Yi surged into the Dao Golden Book, and the golden light erupted as the Dao Golden Book turned a page.</p><p></p><p>Although with his current Shen Yi, turning the pages of the Dao Golden Book was somewhat strenuous, he was still able to do so.</p><p></p><p>As the Dao Golden Book turned, the information about it also surfaced.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, I can finally use the golden finger to assist in the creation of martial dao techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book could assist him in creating martial dao techniques. After inputting the created techniques, he could see the degree of perfection, the connection between different realms, the difficulty of comprehension, and so on.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the Dao Golden Book, after inputting the created techniques, he could see the necessary information and gradually refine and perfect them, allowing the techniques to be cultivated smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book had already recorded the martial dao he had created.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan checked the information on the hastily created techniques that had not yet been comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Blood Qi Boundary Martial Dao Technique: Degree of Perfection: Extremely Low. Cultivation Difficulty: Extremely High. Comprehension Difficulty: Extremely High. Martial Dao Comprehender: Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evaluation of the Blood Qi Boundary martial dao technique recorded in the Dao Golden Book, the corner of Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book had given an "Extremely Low" evaluation for the degree of perfection of the technique. Li Xuan acknowledged this, as he had truly just blindly created it, without even a complete theoretical framework.</p><p></p><p>With such a low degree of perfection, the cultivation difficulty would naturally be high, and the comprehension difficulty would also be extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book had given "Extremely High" evaluations for both the cultivation and comprehension difficulties, yet Xu Yan had still managed to comprehend and cultivate this technique.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple is truly a prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Any ordinary person would never be able to comprehend such a technique.</p><p></p><p>After the technique was comprehended, it had already been perfected, and the cultivation requirements would naturally be greatly reduced, allowing it to be widely disseminated.</p><p></p><p>Primal Boundary Martial Dao Technique: Degree of Perfection: Mid-High. Realm Connection: Mid-High. Cultivation Difficulty: High. Comprehension Difficulty: High.</p><p></p><p>For the Primal Boundary technique, he had put in more thought and effort, and also spent a lot of time and effort to ensure it could connect seamlessly with the Blood Qi Boundary.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Dao Golden Book had given a "Mid-High" evaluation for the degree of perfection and realm connection.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the cultivation difficulty was still rated as "High".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then looked at the subsequent techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Penetrating Profound Boundary martial dao technique had similar degrees of perfection, realm connection, cultivation, and comprehension difficulty as the Primal Boundary technique.</p><p></p><p>As for the latest Shen Yi Boundary technique, it was a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yi Boundary Martial Dao Technique: Degree of Perfection: High. Realm Connection: High. Cultivation Difficulty: High. Comprehension Difficulty: Mid-High.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the "Mid-High" evaluation for the comprehension difficulty of the Shen Yi Boundary technique, Li Xuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Shen Yi Boundary technique is this easy to comprehend? Is that why Xu Yan was able to comprehend it so quickly?" Could it be that the Dao Golden Book's evaluation was based on Xu Yan's standard?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but suspect that since Xu Yan had comprehended the Shen Yi Boundary technique so quickly, the Dao Golden Book had given a "Mid-High" comprehension difficulty evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, as long as the comprehension difficulty of the techniques I create is Mid-High, Xu Yan will most likely be able to comprehend them quickly."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered this thoughtfully. With the Dao Golden Book, he now had a reference for how his created techniques would fare in terms of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Creating subsequent martial dao realms would be much easier now, as he could just go through a few trial-and-error iterations, gradually correcting them until he achieved the desired martial dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then checked the information on the physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Golden Bell Covering Technique: Degree of Perfection: Low. Cultivation Difficulty: High. Comprehension Difficulty: High. Comprehender: Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The starting physical martial dao technique, the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering Technique, had a "Low" degree of perfection evaluation from the Dao Golden Book, though not "Extremely Low".</p><p></p><p>The cultivation and comprehension difficulties were both rated as "High".</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is also a prodigy, to be able to comprehend this as well, it's no easy feat."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, feeling that his disciples were truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Golden Body Technique:</p><p>Degree of Perfection: Mid-High.</p><p>Realm Connection: Mid-High.</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High.</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: High.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body Technique had only a "Mid-High" degree of perfection evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the degree of perfection is Mid-High, I can ensure it can be comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He then checked the evaluations for the Alchemical Martial Dao, which were similar to the Physical Martial Dao, except the comprehension difficulty for alchemy was rated "High-Superior" rather than just "High".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a general understanding of how the Dao Golden Book evaluated martial dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>The evaluations ranged from "Extremely Low" to "Extremely High".</p><p></p><p>Looking at the evaluations for the Sword Dao, Blade Dao, and Bagua, Li Xuan couldn't help but exclaim, "My disciple is truly a prodigy! He is worthy of being the pioneer of my martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the Dao Golden Book on the Spiritual Platform, Li Xuan began to ponder the next stage of cultivation techniques for the Physical Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already reached the Penetrating Profound Boundary.</p><p></p><p>The advancement technique for the Great Sun Golden Body should also be created now.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong could also comprehend that, his Physical Martial Dao would rise to the Shen Yi Boundary, and his strength would increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Great Demon Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly remembered that he had created the Great Demon Technique, and the Crimson Cat was currently in the midst of its transformation.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Dao Golden Book opened again, and Li Xuan saw the table of contents.</p><p></p><p>The contents included Pure Martial Dao, Physical Martial Dao, Alchemical Martial Dao, Sword Dao, Blade Dao, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"There's no Great Demon Martial Dao? Could it be that the Great Demon Martial Dao, being of the beast and demonic class, cannot be evaluated by the Dao Golden Book?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan furrowed his brow, as the Dao Golden Book's table of contents did not include the Great Demon Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"No, the table of contents only records the martial dao that have already been comprehended. Although the Crimson Cat is in the midst of its transformation, it has not yet completed the final stage."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Li Xuan turned a page in the Dao Golden Book and wrote the Great Demon Technique into the blank space.</p><p></p><p>As he wrote the Great Demon Technique into the book, the Dao Golden Book provided an evaluation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Martial Dao:</p><p></p><p>Perfection of the cultivation method: High.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: Medium-high.</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: Medium-high.</p><p></p><p>To Li Xuan's surprise, the Demonic Martial Dao's cultivation method was actually highly perfected. "Could it be because of the acupoints? I've already pointed out the acupoints for the Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>By pointing out the acupoints, and also having the intention to imitate the Golden Body of the Great Sun, that's why the Demonic Martial Dao's cultivation method received a high evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation difficulty is medium-high, and the comprehension difficulty is medium-high. The fact that the Red Cat can cultivate it is also not simple. No wonder I felt its spiritual intelligence was relatively high at first glance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book, this divine tool, is really useful, a powerful tool for creating martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The next martial art should also be considered."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had some ideas in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He would write the martial art ideas into the Dao Golden Book, and then gradually correct them based on the feedback from the Dao Golden Book, until he finally obtained a satisfactory martial art cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The martial art cultivation methods I create, even if I can comprehend them myself, still require arduous cultivation, it's too tiring. It's better to have my disciples cultivate them, and directly get feedback on their cultivation realms, that's the right way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his own painstaking cultivation might not be as efficient as his disciples'.</p><p></p><p>So he would only be responsible for creating the martial art cultivation methods, and leave the arduous work of comprehension and cultivation to his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to write some martial art ideas into the Dao Golden Book to try its feedback, Li Xuan suddenly felt his consciousness sink, and a sense of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>The consumption of divine will was very large.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly stopped observing the Dao Golden Book, withdrew his divine will, and slightly narrowed his eyes, activating the divine will realm cultivation method to recover the consumed divine will.</p><p></p><p>"Browsing the Dao Golden Book requires the consumption of divine will. With my current strength, the duration of each use won't be too long."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book, this divine tool, in addition to providing feedback on martial art cultivation methods, might have some other miraculous uses. But his realm was too low to discover or use them.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he couldn't even browse the Dao Golden Book for a long time, let alone explore its other miraculous uses.</p><p></p><p>The consumption of divine will was a bit large, and a trace of fatigue appeared in his rare gaze.</p><p></p><p>After drinking a cup of Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea, Li Xuan lay down on the chair to rest.</p><p></p><p>"I've already reached the divine will realm, I should also think about refining some pills to recover divine will and primordial spirit power."</p><p></p><p>He thought about the Stone Secluded Grass, which had such effects, but so far he only had one stalk of it.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm is ultimately a bit barren, fifth-grade spirit herbs are too scarce."</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He thought about the Spirit Realm, but he didn't know what level of expert he would be considered there with his current strength.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is too weak, going to the Spirit Realm is not secure enough, I'd better wait until my strength is a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted from the large divine will consumption, Li Xuan fell asleep on the chair.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a martial artist, he hadn't slept like this in a long time.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, Li Xuan felt refreshed, his divine will had recovered to its peak, and he could use the Dao Golden Book again.</p><p></p><p>"Can't consume too much, must keep some reserve power."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the divine will was consumed too much, and an enemy appeared, wouldn't that be a precarious situation?</p><p></p><p>"What new martial art should I create? For the cultivation method, how should I start?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered.</p><p></p><p>"For now, let's not create a new martial art, first let's edit the cultivation method that Meng Chong will cultivate next."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to open the Dao Golden Book to start editing the next stage of the Golden Body of the Great Sun cultivation method, the Dao Golden Book suddenly opened, emanating golden light, and at the same time, information appeared on the Dao Golden Book, transmitting over.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Gathering Spirit Realm Martial Dao Celestial, your Gentle Wind Sword Intent has been enhanced, and your experience in the Annihilating Divine Soul Sutra has increased."</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit dazed, he had thought Meng Chong would encounter a Martial Dao Celestial, but it turned out to be Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>And he even killed the Martial Dao Celestial!</p><p></p><p>"Was it in the Celestial Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"A Gathering Spirit Realm Martial Dao Celestial? That's the realm above Grand Master? A complete Martial Dao Celestial shouldn't appear in the Celestial Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Celestials also have different levels of strength, there should be a hierarchy of realms.</p><p></p><p>The Gathering Spirit Realm should be the realm above Grand Master, the weaker Martial Dao Celestials.</p><p></p><p>"He's already killed a Celestial."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, his own disciple had taken the lead and slain a Martial Dao Celestial under his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, who has just reached the Penetrating Mystery Realm, has already slain a Martial Dao Celestial, this Martial Dao Celestial must have been quite weak."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood that after Xu Yan grasped the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, killing a Martial Dao Celestial was an inevitable result.</p><p></p><p>As someone in the divine will realm, as long as he unleashed the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, extinguishing the spiritual consciousness of a Gathering Spirit Realm Martial Dao Celestial would be easy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was for a Gathering Spirit Realm Martial Dao Celestial, if it was a stronger Martial Dao Celestial, his divine will realm strength might not be able to easily annihilate the opponent.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of Martial Dao Celestials was still too little.</p><p></p><p>"I'll know the details when Xu Yan returns."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't continue to ponder further, and was about to write some martial art ideas into the Dao Golden Book to get feedback and edit new martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He quickly took out an ancient leather book.</p><p></p><p>This "Tai Cang" book, he had been studying it almost every day, and had been constantly studying the first page.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he had already gained some insights, and from those patterns, he seemed to see a kind of "momentum", or a mysterious geographical environment.</p><p></p><p>"The Tai Cang book is not simple, although I don't know why it appeared in the Imperial Palace Treasury of the Wu Kingdom, perhaps it was hidden as a supreme treasure?</p><p></p><p>"No matter the reason, this book is not simple. If I write these patterns into the Dao Golden Book, will I be able to obtain the information I want?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>His divine will moved, and the Dao Golden Book opened on the spiritual platform.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, he had long since memorized the first page patterns of the ancient Tai Cang leather book, but when it came to drawing the first pattern, he was stumped.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit confused, even though he had already memorized the patterns, when he tried to draw them, he felt like he had no idea where to start.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he tried to start from one pattern, he felt that it wasn't the starting pattern, and another pattern was the true starting point.</p><p></p><p>And when he tried to change to another pattern as the starting point, he felt that yet another pattern was the true starting point, as if it was constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>The more it was like this, the more it showed that the patterns on the Tai Cang leather book were extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan opened the ancient leather book, staring at the patterns on it, he firmly chose one pattern and wrote it into the Dao Golden Book with his divine will.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sucked in a breath, just writing the pattern had consumed his divine will extremely quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be hasty, write it slowly, time doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slowly and gradually wrote the pattern into the Dao Golden Book, the speed was extremely slow, and he was also activating the divine will realm cultivation method to recover the consumed divine will.</p><p></p><p>After writing in about a third of the patterns, Li Xuan, even though he had slowed down the speed, now felt fatigued and couldn't endure it anymore.</p><p></p><p>So he had to stop writing the patterns.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Dao Golden Book emitted a faint glow, and the page actually provided information about the patterns.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

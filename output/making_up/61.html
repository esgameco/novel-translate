        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 61: Does Cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Robe Require Sunbathing?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been closely observing Meng Chong. At this moment, his expression changed as he noticed Meng Chong's physique had become stronger, and his inner qi and blood had increased.</p><p></p><p>"Has he succeeded in comprehending the cultivation method and begun cultivating it?" Li Xuan was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He silently observed, using the keen senses of a cultivator at the Qi and Blood Realm, to sense the changes in Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the initial form of the Great Sun Golden Bell Robe, with the flesh and body becoming like a great bell?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physical body had become stronger, and the strengthening was overall, with a sense of inner and outer unity, like being enveloped by a great bell.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sun, Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Great Sun Golden Bell Robe requires sunlight shining on the body to more effectively sense the qi and blood, in order to cultivate it successfully? If so, what about the scorching summer heat - wouldn't that lead to heatstroke?</p><p></p><p>"How exactly did Meng Chong comprehend it? Why did he cultivate under the sun and succeed in cultivating the technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat puzzled. He upheld the principle of only transmitting the cultivation method and not interfering with his disciple's comprehension. Even if his disciple exhibited peculiar behavior, he decided not to intervene.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong had succeeded in cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Robe by cultivating under the sun. If there was no sun, would he be unable to cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>"How exactly did he comprehend it? If there is no sun, how would he cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to wait until Meng Chong completed his cultivation, and then explore how he had comprehended the technique. If there was no sun, how would he cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>After all, Meng Chong had been practicing martial arts since childhood, and his physique was robust. His talent might indeed be focused on the physical aspect.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Robe, he had been diligently cultivating, standing in a horse stance without feeling tired, and had even missed the time for cooking.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan did not disturb his disciple's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shi Er came carrying a chicken.</p><p></p><p>Bringing a chicken every day had become his task, and he was more than happy to do it.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Meng Chong in the midst of cultivation, he couldn't help but feel envious.</p><p></p><p>Disciple Xu Yan of the senior had single-handedly swept through the Divine Might Army, demonstrating terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong might also soon become such a powerful martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved to him.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully jogged over. "Senior."</p><p></p><p>"Can you cook?" Li Xuan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes I can!" Shi Er was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had diligently learned how to cook, especially how to stew chicken soup!</p><p></p><p>The senior seemed to have a particular fondness for chicken soup.</p><p></p><p>"Go cook, and remember to add nine-leaf ginseng or mountain ginseng to the chicken soup."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" Shi Er was delighted, as this was an opportunity to showcase his skills.</p><p></p><p>He took the chicken to slaughter it and went to cook.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was immersed in his cultivation, completing one cycle after another. After the second cycle, he felt his physical body had become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of being impervious to blades and spears!</p><p></p><p>"This is the Dao of martial arts, so profound and wondrous!" Meng Chong was overjoyed, his heart surging with excitement, and he continued to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he had completely forgotten about other matters, focusing solely on his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"He's about reached his limit." Li Xuan sensed Meng Chong's physical condition. Three cycles of tempering were already the limit.</p><p></p><p>After all, for a first-time cultivation, being able to complete three cycles of tempering already demonstrated Meng Chong's exceptional talent in the physical aspect.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after the third cycle of tempering, Meng Chong felt he could no longer continue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he opened his eyes and immediately felt a sense of hunger.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no! I forgot to cook!" Meng Chong looked at the time and was startled.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the hunger in his stomach, he looked up at his teacher, somewhat embarrassed. "Teacher, I'll go cook now."</p><p></p><p>"No need, you have entered the cultivation, and your qi and blood have been constantly tempered and consumed. It's time to replenish the consumption." Li Xuan stood up and walked...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leisurely steps.</p><p></p><p>"Let's eat!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Following the master into the dining hall, Shi Er had already served the dishes.</p><p></p><p>A large bowl of chicken soup, fragrant and steaming, Meng Chong smelled the aroma and immediately felt a sense of longing.</p><p></p><p>"Eat up!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said as he sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was excited and began to eat heartily.</p><p></p><p>After a bowl of chicken soup, his qi and blood became replenished, and the feeling of hunger subsided.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully retreated to the side, waiting for the master and disciple to finish their meal.</p><p></p><p>After clearing the bowls and chopsticks, Shi Er bowed and said, "If the esteemed one has no further instructions, I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully took his leave.</p><p></p><p>When it was just the master and disciple, Li Xuan spoke, "Disciple, tell me about your experience in cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's spirit was immediately lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple suddenly realized that to cultivate the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, one must do so under the sun, to feel the scorching heat of the sun, in order to better sense the qi and blood, and to refine from the outside to the inside..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong detailed the process of his realization and how he cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained calm, but he was somewhat puzzled in his heart. Could it be that the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering truly requires one to bask under the sun in order to cultivate it more successfully?</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps this is just Meng Chong's own realization, where he merely used the sun's scorching heat to warm himself, and thus sensed the qi and blood, which allowed him to enter the cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was clear, and his thoughts became more active.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's realized cultivation method was correct. As long as he could sense the qi and blood, he could cultivate it without needing to bask under the sun. However, Meng Chong used the sun's warmth as a means, and thus had a flash of insight, sensing the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"But what if there is no sun? What if it's raining or cloudy? How would one cultivate then? And in places with long, cold winters with little sunlight, how would one cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked, "Disciple, if there is no sun, such as on rainy or cloudy days, how would you cultivate then?"</p><p></p><p>If the cultivation requires basking under the sun, then what if there is no sun?</p><p></p><p>Not cultivate at all?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had just successfully cultivated and realized the method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, and was feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>He had never considered this question before.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Meng Chong was at a loss, not knowing how to answer.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "At night, there is no sun. Does that mean you cannot cultivate then, disciple? You still need to delve deeper in your understanding."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Xuan turned and leisurely walked away, leaving his disciple to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The master had posed the question to the disciple, letting him figure it out himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that Meng Chong could gain insight from this, and once he broke through this barrier, perhaps he would truly realize the essence of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering.</p><p></p><p>"When there is no sun, how do I cultivate?</p><p> </p><p>"Not cultivate at night?</p><p></p><p>"Not cultivate on rainy days?</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a cultivation method? My realization was too shallow."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked up and saw that it was now dusk, with only the last rays of the setting sun remaining.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

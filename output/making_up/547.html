        <h1>Chapter 547</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three fellow disciples, along with the sea turtle hiding in its shell pretending to be dead, concealed themselves in the mountains for two days.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't a battle to fight over Hong Ze's realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked towards Hong Ze's realm but didn't see any traces of powerful beings. He looked around at the hazy surroundings, which were also empty and devoid of people.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, to Hong Ze's realm!"</p><p></p><p>Confirming there were no powerful beings nearby, and that the unknown battle had not erupted over Hong Ze's realm, Xu Yan no longer hid.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping also emerged from the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Old turtle, you stay here for now. If you discover anyone approaching, immediately send us a message!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, kicking the turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle poked its head out and nodded, "No problem, I'll keep watch on the surroundings. If anyone approaches, I'll send a message right away!"</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle looked relieved. </p><p></p><p>For him, Hong Ze's realm was the source of terror. Just seeing it made him unable to control his fear. If he were to enter Hong Ze's realm, he would probably collapse on the spot and only be able to slowly crawl, just like when he initially fled Hong Ze's realm, which took him a very long time.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been so terrified, if it hadn't taken so long to escape, his injuries wouldn't have been so severe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three fellow disciples slowly approached Hong Ze's realm. Although they hadn't discovered any danger, they didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ze's realm is already dead. The realm seems to be shrouded in an ominous aura, or perhaps the intent of death. Be careful of any unknown dangers that may exist," </p><p>Xu Yan transmitted to Meng Chong and the others.</p><p></p><p>"In this area of Hong Ze's realm, there isn't even a single true spirit. Either the desolation of Hong Ze's realm has frightened away all the true spirits so they don't dare approach this area, or there's a powerful true spirit hiding within Hong Ze's realm," </p><p>Jiang Buping said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"We can't rule out that possibility. With my minor Heavenly Eye, I can't see everything inside and outside the entire realm. If something is hidden deep underground, I won't be able to detect it,"</p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>The four fellow disciples concealed their auras and silently approached Hong Ze's realm. The closer they got, the more they seemed to feel a gloomy aura coming towards them.</p><p></p><p>That desolate, dead intent seemed to vaguely affect one's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If other Supreme Realm martial artists entered, they would probably be affected before long, and their minds would start to have problems," </p><p>Meng Chong said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"A dead realm - this is the first one, at least the first one so far. What will happen is unknown. It's even possible some strange anomalies could be born,"</p><p>Fang Hao continued regretfully, "If I had known earlier, I would have asked Master for some guidance before coming."</p><p></p><p>"The unknown is what gives exploration value. Master didn't say anything because he naturally wants us to explore for ourselves,"</p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother is right!"</p><p>Fang Hao was stunned for a moment, then nodded in sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the fellow disciples arrived outside Hong Ze's realm. They didn't enter the realm immediately, but silently observed the situation inside.</p><p></p><p>In a normal realm, there would be laws of heaven and earth forming a barrier, with spiritual energy and unchanging energy gathering to form a huge ball of spiritual energy enveloping the realm.</p><p></p><p>The dead Hong Ze's realm had no laws, no barrier, and the ball of spiritual energy enveloping the realm also did not exist.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no ball of spiritual energy enveloping it, violent spiritual energy still surrounded the realm, as the violent spiritual energy of the Unchanging Land was everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the realm, it was uneven, and one could especially see a large sunken area, which seemed to be the ocean domain of Hong Ze's realm.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ze's realm was a water realm, with water occupying over 90%. The slightly sunken areas were where lakes and oceans had once been.</p><p></p><p>The entire realm was intact, but the surface was covered with mottled cracks and broken mountain peaks. There were even faint traces left behind from battles.</p><p></p><p>It was desolate and lifeless, with no signs of vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and experience this dead realm. We can also learn about the realm, and even see if we can restore vitality to it. This is the realm Hong Ze created, so we can also sense how it's similar to and different from our realms,"</p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister practices medicine and martial arts. When it comes to restoring vitality, she would have better methods. Perhaps she could research how to save this realm,"</p><p>Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Sister's techniques, while she may not be able to restore vitality to the entire realm, she should be able to bestow vitality to one area of the realm and make plants grow,"</p><p>Fang Hao said approvingly.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, they finally set foot on the land of Hong Ze's realm, feeling the desolation and lifelessness. Looking around, there was no sign of vitality anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even the violent spiritual energy surrounding the realm seemed to lack a certain spiritual essence, and had more of a sense of death.</p><p></p><p>The four fellow disciples walked through Hong Ze's realm. Although a long time had passed, traces of the great battle from back then could still be faintly seen.</p><p></p><p>Like that shattered boulder, which seemed to have come from the collapse of a nearby mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Is the gloomy aura in Hong Ze's realm related to that person from the Unchanging Divine Palace?" </p><p>Xu Yan suddenly said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The injuries on Tai He and Tai Kun also had a gloomy aura entangled with them, as if there was some kind of ill omen.</p><p></p><p>This aura on the two of them came from the master of the Unchanging Divine Palace! According to the sea turtle, Hong Ze was killed by that person from the Unchanging Divine Palace inside the realm, directly devouring him along with all the vitality and spiritual essence of the entire realm.</p><p></p><p>Was the gloomy aura lingering in Hong Ze's realm the aura left behind by the master of the Unchanging Divine Palace at that time?</p><p></p><p>"If it really is the lingering aura of the Unchanging Divine Palace's master, this person is somewhat sinister, and their strength is terrifying. Their lingering aura has not dissipated to this day and is still affecting the dead realm!"</p><p>Jiang Buping said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>After all, Hong Ze's realm was in the Unchanging Land and was already dead. It was constantly swept by the violent spiritual energy and unchanging energy of the Unchanging Land. Even if there was lingering aura, it should have quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>For it to remain until now, still affecting the dead realm, one can imagine how terrifying it must be!</p><p></p><p>"This gloomy aura is different from the one on Tai He and Tai Kun. The changes in Hong Ze's realm and the dead realm produced some deathly aura, which then merged with the lingering aura of that person to form what we see now,"</p><p>Xu Yan said pensively.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the vast dead realm, Xu Yan said solemnly, "Although the realm is dead, it's still intact. Perhaps we can find traces of how Hong Ze created the realm, and also sense the structure and wonders of this realm."</p><p></p><p>"Let's split up to explore. The realm is so large, we can each seek places for enlightenment. Although the dead realm seems somewhat unusual, we haven't discovered any dangers yet. Besides, if there really is some danger we can't resist, we still have Master's jade talisman,"</p><p>Meng Chong said, looking around.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother is right!"</p><p>Fang Hao and Jiang Buping both nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, junior brothers. Try to conceal your auras as much as possible. Although we have Master's jade talisman and won't face true life-or-death danger, we must still exercise necessary caution. Don't become careless or complacent because of Master's protection," Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, senior brother. We understand!" Meng Chong and the other two responded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"There are many peaks over there, so I'll go in that direction," Fang Hao said with a smile, pointing to the left front.</p><p></p><p>"Since fourth junior brother is going that way, I'll go this way," Jiang Buping said, having chosen his own direction to explore.</p><p></p><p>The four brothers separated, each exploring in different directions.</p><p></p><p>After watching his three junior brothers leave, Xu Yan continued forward, taking one step at a time. The invisible sword intent under his feet merged with heaven and earth, silent and imperceptible, as if the sword intent itself was part of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent transformed into mountains and rivers, merging with the lifeless land. It seemed to imitate the lifeless land, and the mountains and rivers formed by the sword intent also appeared somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked slowly, exploring heaven and earth while also comprehending it. The sword intent's mountains and rivers constantly changed.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a sense of death seemed to arise within the sword intent, as if it was the sword intent of death, the charm of death.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere he went became even more desolate.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in comprehension, walking step by step through heaven and earth, comprehending it while also comprehending his own inner world and his own sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Creation is about creating heaven and earth. If I were in the Realm of Creation, I could recreate this lifeless heaven and earth, making it flourish with life again..." Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth were vast. Xu Yan didn't walk particularly fast, as if measuring heaven and earth with his steps, comprehending the differences in various regions.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had also traveled the four directions in the Cang Heaven and Earth before, he hadn't walked through the entire world or comprehended the entire heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the existence of principles and myriad living beings, the Cang Heaven and Earth was ultimately too complex to comprehend its essence.</p><p></p><p>But now, as Xu Yan walked through the Hong Ze Heaven and Earth, this lifeless and desolate world, he was truly comprehending heaven and earth, exploring its essence.</p><p></p><p>Although this world was already dead, it was precisely because of the absence of complex clamor and the aura of myriad beings that it was easier to comprehend the fundamentals and structure of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>From the structure of heaven and earth, it seemed possible to deduce the derivation of principles and the laws governing heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The more he walked through the Hong Ze Heaven and Earth and the deeper he comprehended, the more his sword intent spread and expanded. It was as if everywhere he passed, within a hundred-mile radius, was Xu Yan's domain.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was silent and imperceptible, yet it resonated with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"So this is how heaven and earth are," Xu Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a picture of the laws governing heaven and earth seemed to appear. Although it was rudimentary and only a part of the heavenly laws, it was what he had gradually comprehended from the traces of heaven and earth, step by step.</p><p></p><p>These heavenly laws were integrating into his own inner world. Xu Yan, who was already at the peak of the Heaven and Earth Realm, felt his strength slowly increasing at this moment, entering the stage of establishing his own Way.</p><p></p><p>Establishing the Way meant establishing one's own path and the path of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sensed that the opportunity for his breakthrough had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Walking through the desolate Hong Ze Heaven and Earth, as if measuring heaven and earth and comprehending its structure, he lost track of time, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>At some point, Xu Yan stopped. The image of mountains and rivers appeared, and his sword intent formed a small world. Without any concealment, it manifested openly.</p><p></p><p>Then, Xu Yan sat cross-legged in the center of this sword intent world. With him at the center, a hundred-mile radius became a new small world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this world was constantly changing - sometimes with gentle breezes, sometimes with living beings frolicking, sometimes with golden dragons coiling...</p><p></p><p>In the vast heaven and earth, Xu Yan's mere hundred-mile radius of sword intent seemed extremely insignificant and didn't cause any disturbance. The world remained desolate and silent.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also walking through the desolate Hong Ze Heaven and Earth, treading on the barren land. As far as the eye could see, it was an endless scene of desolation.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, gradually each step seemed to become part of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He practiced body cultivation, where the body itself was heaven and earth, and the acupoints were like mountains, lakes, and seas within heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>But the acupoints were also like stars, reflecting the lakes, oceans, and mountains of heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also comprehending and exploring the essence of heaven and earth, seeking its structure to reflect it in his body's inner world.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how far he had walked, how large an area he had explored, or how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>At some point, as Meng Chong took a step, it seemed to resonate with heaven and earth. The trembling of his muscles was like the trembling of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Within a hundred-mile radius of Meng Chong, heaven and earth rippled slightly, as if it was the vibration of muscles or the trembling of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong didn't even notice the rippling of heaven and earth. He only felt the slight trembling of his own muscles.</p><p></p><p>With each step he took, his muscles were trembling slightly, and every tiny tremor was under his control.</p><p></p><p>His control over his body had reached an extremely minute level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong had entered a peculiar state. With each step, his muscles trembled minutely, and he could control this trembling. Even the tiniest muscle tremor was under his control.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong didn't realize that with each step he took, it wasn't just his muscles that were trembling, but also the heaven and earth within his hundred-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>Having entered this wondrous state, Meng Chong naturally had no time to consider the potential threats or the need to conceal his aura and avoid causing disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Even if Meng Chong had realized it, he wouldn't have held back. How could he miss such a rare opportunity for comprehension?</p><p></p><p>As for potential dangers, with Master's jade talisman, there was no need to worry. In the midst of comprehension, he naturally wouldn't hesitate to use the talisman to eliminate any crisis.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong's body resonated with heaven and earth, insights arose in his mind. He vaguely understood many things and gained a deeper comprehension of his body's inner world.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from breaking through to the peak of the Heaven and Earth Realm in body cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao walked through heaven and earth, using his comprehension of the Qimen martial arts to sense the earth's veins, terrain, and the network of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He comprehended how to use the network of heaven and earth and the terrain to construct heavenly Qimen formations, further perfecting his own Qimen inner world.</p><p></p><p>Using his own Qimen inner world to lay out heavenly Qimen formations, life and death were but a thought away.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was walking when suddenly he dispersed, merging into heaven and earth. He practiced extreme soul martial arts, and at this moment, it was as if his soul was residing in heaven and earth, comprehending the possible existence of "souls" in this world.</p><p></p><p>Walking through heaven and earth, merging with it, reaching the extreme of the soul - how to make the soul's inner world more extreme, more indestructible, imperishable, and immortal; even if heaven and earth die, the soul does not perish!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

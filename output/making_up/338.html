        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>No matter who escapes from the hands of the Refining Deity Celestials, they must be extremely low-key, hiding away, afraid of having their tracks discovered.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was different - he wanted to raid the Dai family's ancestral home!</p><p></p><p>What an audacious move! Shen Haizhou was greatly shocked. Why was Xu Yan so bold? The Dai family was an aristocratic clan, even if just a second-tier one!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. "What, is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, I'm calling you brother, but the Dai family is an aristocratic clan."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said with a cold sweat on his face.</p><p></p><p>"So what if they are an aristocratic clan? If they provoked me, they must pay the price. I, Xu Yan, have never taken insults lying down. If I'm offended, I must vent it out. Since Dai Sheng is hunting me down, then I'll go and raid his ancestral home."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was terrified. Xu Yan actually wanted to raid the Dai family's ancestral home?</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, calm down! Don't be rash!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was extremely anxious. It discovered that ever since following Xu Yan, its days had become more and more thrilling! They had just been chased by the Refining Deity Celestials, and now they were going to destroy an aristocratic clan?</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, I know what I'm doing!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glared at Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou swallowed a mouthful of saliva. "Brother Xu, are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and sneered, "While Dai Sheng is away, I'll go and raid his family's ancestral home. You just tell me, where is the Dai family's ancestral home, and is there any Refining Deity Celestial there?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou also became serious. "The Dai family is a second-tier aristocratic clan in Yuzhou. Outwardly, there is only Dai Sheng as a Refining Deity Celestial, but in reality, there must be two Refining Deity Celestials.</p><p></p><p>"The other Refining Deity Celestial must be guarding the Dai family's treasury. Even if he's weaker than Dai Sheng, he won't be that weak."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up. "The Dai family's treasury?"</p><p></p><p>An aristocratic family's treasury must contain many treasures.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's forehead broke out in cold sweat again, hastily saying, "Brother Xu, don't be rash. Of course the Dai family's treasury contains treasures, but it's guarded by a Refining Deity Celestial."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered. A Refining Deity Celestial guarding the treasury would make it very difficult to raid the Dai family. </p><p></p><p>But it wasn't impossible.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't defeat a Refining Deity Celestial in a direct confrontation, but what if he struck from behind? "When wandering the martial dao, one must know when to advance and when to retreat, not be reckless or single-minded..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan already had some plans in mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as his master had taught him, he couldn't be a reckless person, he had to know when to advance and retreat, and make good use of his own strengths.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me in detail why you are so certain the Dai family has another Refining Deity Celestial."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took a deep breath. It seemed Xu Yan had made up his mind to raid the Dai family's ancestral home, although he didn't know where Xu Yan's confidence came from. Since he dared to do it, it meant Xu Yan was confident.</p><p></p><p>"The Dai family is a second-tier aristocratic clan in Yuzhou. The requirement for a second-tier aristocratic clan is to have either one Refining Deity Realm middle stage expert, or two Refining Deity Realm early stage experts guarding it. This is the standard for a second-tier aristocratic clan.</p><p></p><p>"Dai Sheng is at the peak of the Refining Deity Realm early stage, but has not yet broken through to the Refining Deity Realm middle stage. Since the Dai family is a second-tier aristocratic clan, it means they have another Refining Deity Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"These are things that only the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans know about. Ordinary cultivators outside don't know about the hierarchy of the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou explained to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy of the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans was not arbitrarily divided, but was related to their strength and foundations.</p><p></p><p>First, to become an aristocratic clan, the clan must have a heritage of over 10,000 years, which is the minimum standard.</p><p></p><p>Third-tier aristocratic clans must have at least one Refining Deity Realm early stage expert guarding them.</p><p></p><p>Second-tier aristocratic clans must either have one Refining Deity Realm middle stage expert guarding them, or two Refining Deity Realm early stage experts guarding them.</p><p></p><p>As for first-tier aristocratic clans, they must have at least one Refining Deity Realm middle stage expert guarding them, and the number of Refining Deity Celestials cannot be less than five.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if they have more than five Refining Deity Celestials, if they don't have a Refining Deity Realm middle stage expert guarding them, they can only be considered a second-tier aristocratic clan.</p><p></p><p>This is the minimum standard.</p><p></p><p>"The Dai family is one of the weaker second-tier aristocratic clans. Two Refining Deity Celestials should be their limit."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, so the hierarchy of the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans was divided in this way.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Jade Spiritual Sect? How strong are they?"</p><p></p><p>The biggest force he was provoking now was the Jade Spiritual Sect, known as the number one sect in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spiritual Sect is the number one sect in Yuzhou, and has also entered the ranks of the top-tier sects in the Spiritual Realm. Although they are relatively weak, their strength in Yuzhou is the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"The requirements for the hierarchy of the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans I mentioned earlier are the standards for a single state. As for the top-tier forces in the Spiritual Realm, they must have at least one Refining Deity Realm late stage expert guarding them, and more than two Refining Deity Realm middle stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Yuzhou, only the Jade Spiritual Sect has a Refining Deity Realm late stage expert, so they are the number one sect in Yuzhou, and the only one that has entered the top-tier of the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already talked about the hierarchy of the Spiritual Sect and aristocratic clans, Shen Haizhou also explained it in more detail to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The strength gap between top-tier forces can sometimes be very large.</p><p></p><p>To enter the top-tier of the Spiritual Realm, one must have at least one Refining Deity Realm late stage expert guarding them, which is the minimum requirement.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful top-tier aristocratic clans and sects even have five or six Refining Deity Realm late stage experts guarding them, which is not uncommon.</p><p></p><p>As for super top-tier sects and aristocratic clans, they must have at least one Refining Deity Realm peak expert guarding them.</p><p></p><p>As for super transcendent sects, they are existences that can only be looked up to. Their foundations are unfathomable, and there are only a few of them in the entire Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through a small realm of the Refining Deity Celestial is extremely difficult. Many Refining Deity Celestials can only stop at the Refining Deity Realm early stage.</p><p></p><p>"Many great Celestial Warrior experts are stuck at the gate of the Refining Deity Realm, unable to step out and refine their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>"Many geniuses are stuck at the Great Celestial Warrior realm, or even stuck at the Refining Deity Realm early stage or middle stage..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare say that with his own talent, he was definitely going to become a Refining Deity Celestial in the future.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finally had a more detailed understanding of these Spiritual Sects and aristocratic clans. Shen Haizhou, as the scion of an aristocratic clan, truly understood the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic clans far better than the wild snake Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou doesn't seem that strong?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spiritual Sect, although it had entered the top-tier of the Spiritual Realm, was still at the lowest threshold.</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou is relatively remote, and it's said that there was a great calamity in the past that caused Yuzhou to decline."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou explained.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the location of the Dai family's ancestral home. While Dai Sheng is not back, I'll go and raid it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was dumbfounded. After explaining all this, Xu Yan still wanted to raid the Dai family?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he at all wary of the Dai family's strength?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know much about the Dai family either. Their ancestral land is within the borders of the Zheng State, located here... Among the younger generation of the Dai family, aside from Dai Yingying and Dai Jun, there are a few others.</p><p></p><p>"But their talents are average..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou drew a map on the ground, introducing the location of the Dai family's ancestral home, and even roughly sketched the location of the Dai family's treasury.</p><p></p><p>He also introduced the few younger generation members of the Dai family, their appearances and general personalities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Shen Haizhou suspiciously. Even though Shen Haizhou said he didn't know much about the Dai family, he had drawn such a detailed map and introduction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou smiled awkwardly. He had borrowed Dai Jun's front, and ultimately Dai Jun was also killed by his own hand, so he had specifically gone to learn more about the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>"That's all I know."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and looked at Shen Haizhou, saying, "Brother Shen, help me keep Dai Sheng wandering outside, so he won't return to the Dai family so quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Shen Haizhou nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, are you really confident?" </p><p></p><p>The Dai family had a Refining Spirit Celestial guarding them.</p><p></p><p>"The problem is not big."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I wish you success!" Shen Haizhou clasped his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" Xu Yan clasped his fists and left in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"The Yuzhou is about to be turbulent. The Dai family has been toppled, and how will the Yushen Sect and the Su family be?" Shen Haizhou muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su family must find a way to eliminate this hidden danger, Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Keeping Dai Sheng occupied was not difficult. Shen Haizhou had people spread the false whereabouts of Wen Yong, and even Xu Yan's false whereabouts to Dai Sheng.</p><p></p><p>And Dai Sheng was now frantically searching everywhere for Xu Yan and Wen Yong.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Celestial of the Dai family could not even deal with two wandering cultivators. Where was the dignity of the Dai family?</p><p></p><p>The Dai Prefecture was the territory controlled by the Dai family. The ancestral land of the Dai family was also here.</p><p></p><p>For the people of the Dai family, the recent years had not been favorable. Their highly regarded Dai Yingying was killed, and Dai Jun had also died.</p><p></p><p>Even the current patriarch of the Dai family, Dai Yiping, died in Mang Mountain, at the hands of a wandering cultivator. It was a great humiliation!</p><p></p><p>Dai Yang, the cousin of Dai Yingying, was not outstanding in talent, and at over thirty years old, he had not yet broken through the Small Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Dai Yang returned from outside, his head slightly bowed, his mood unpleasant and very gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family guards and elders did not suspect anything. The Dai family had suffered a great disaster, and in recent days, these younger generations had indeed lost some of their sharpness and become more gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yang wandered aimlessly, finally arriving at the ancestral shrine of the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>"Dai Yang, what are you doing here? Don't be so listless, the treasure vault is a sacred place, and you are not allowed to enter without permission!" The elder guarding the door frowned and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Dai Yang replied gloomily and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"This place is close to the treasure vault and suitable for an ambush. I'll strike here." </p><p></p><p>The disguised Xu Yan slowly buried himself under the ground behind a large tree at the ancestral shrine, concealing all his aura.</p><p></p><p>"I only have one chance. I must severely injure the opponent with a single strike to have a chance of killing him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was solemn.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was silently condensing. He was constantly refining the Xun Wind Sword Intent, relying on it to tear open the opponent's divine soul in order to kill the Refining Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost ready."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense spread out, and suddenly, a giant blue-backed, white-bellied python let out a low roar and appeared in the sky above the Dai family's ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Dai family's warriors were all startled, as if a great mountain was pressing down on them. Those below the Small Celestial Realm instantly fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only the Celestial Realm elders had the strength to resist that overwhelming might, but they were also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Sky Python Corpse had come to the Dai family? Boom! At this moment, a divine soul aura came from the direction of the ancestral shrine.</p><p></p><p>An old man's figure instantly appeared and attacked the Blue Sky Python.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Sky Python, since you've come, don't leave. Let me see how you became a corpse." </p><p></p><p>The Blue Sky Python erupted with overwhelming might, attacking the old man, but under the old man's palm, it was instantly slammed to the ground, breaking a large tree.</p><p></p><p>Howl! The Blue Sky Python fell to the ground, raising its head and roaring, struggling to get up.</p><p></p><p>The old man descended from the sky, somewhat excited. The missing Blue Sky Python Corpse had accidentally trespassed into the Dai family. Was this a compensation for the Dai family's losses?</p><p></p><p>"Damned beast, stop struggling!" The old man was greatly excited, coming in front of the Blue Sky Python, about to use a powerful strike to completely subdue and capture it.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, a strong sense of crisis appeared, and behind him, a fierce sword light flashed!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" The old man's expression was horrified. His divine soul aura was about to erupt, and his figure moved, trying to dodge the attack.</p><p></p><p>However, he had been completely unprepared, and Xu Yan's prepared strike, the Xun Wind Sword Intent, swept in like a raging wind, instantly penetrating his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The old man suddenly felt as if his divine soul was being blown by a hurricane, like a candle in the wind, violently shaking, and cracks appeared in his divine soul, about to collapse at any moment!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The old man let out a piercing scream.</p><p></p><p>The torment of the divine soul was unbearable. In an instant, all his evasive tactics were suspended.</p><p></p><p>Life and death were only a moment apart!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's prepared strike had penetrated the opponent's divine soul. Although it was not enough to shatter the divine soul, it was sufficient to cause the unprepared old man to suffer divine soul damage.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul pain would inevitably make the opponent's figure freeze, and all his countermeasures would pause for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This moment was his opportunity! Boom! The mountain and river images instantly collapsed, transforming into a thunderous sword.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in the shattered mountains and rivers, there was a figure wielding the sword of thunder to strike down.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The old man's body was cleaved in two! The disembodied divine soul became ethereal, as if it had lost its support.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's body was surging with light, the sword intent surging endlessly - the Xun Wind Sword Intent, the Mountain and River Sword Intent, and the Dragon Subduing Palm's Dragon Might Essence - all gushing out!</p><p></p><p>Pu! The divine soul was shattered and began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?!" The old man's divine soul let out an unwilling and angry roar.</p><p></p><p>"The one who kills you!" Xu Yan attacked frantically, not giving the opponent the slightest chance.</p><p></p><p>Crush the bones, scatter the ashes, extinguish the soul!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the old man died! Reduced to ashes and oblivion!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a sigh of relief, reaching out to collect the old man's fallen storage bag, and using the Dragon Subduing Palm to shrink the Blue Sky Python's corpse, also putting it into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked at the stunned and horrified Dai family elders.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a single sword.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I trample the clan, and slay the Refining Spirit Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan's single sword strike killed several Celestial Realm experts, but he did not pursue the frantically fleeing rest of the Dai family elders. Instead, he went to the Dai family's treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>The treasure vault of the clan family contained countless treasures, and time was pressing, so he did not waste time chasing down the Dai family elders.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan broke open the Dai family's treasure vault, not even bothering to look closely. He just collected any storage bags he could find, opening several at the same time to frantically stuff the vault's contents into them.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care what they were, just frantically sweeping everything up, and then directly fled.</p><p></p><p>It was time to return to the Inner Realm! Dai Sheng should be going mad, and the entire Yuzhou would be shaken by this.</p><p></p><p>On the last day of October, please vote for the monthly ticket! (This chapter is complete)</p>

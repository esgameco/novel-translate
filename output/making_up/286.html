        <h1>Chapter 286</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Battle of the Martial Path - it is the easiest way to understand oneself and accumulate one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>"You have already grasped the wondrous methods of divine abilities, so today I shall pass on to you the martial arts techniques that surpass divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely comprehend the principles of the martial path in the clash of celestial talents and the Battle of the Martial Path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "My disciple, you have such confidence, which pleases me greatly. But do not become too obsessed - step by step, you will eventually reach the peak."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had great trust in this senior disciple of his. Xu Yan had an extraordinary aptitude, a brilliant mind, and was not reckless, with considerable martial arts experience as well.</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability realm is the principle of one's own martial arts. Beyond divine abilities is using the principles of heaven and earth for oneself, using the principles of heaven and earth without being constrained by them. </p><p></p><p>"One who has transcended heaven and earth, how can they be bound by the principles of heaven and earth? How can they be inferior to the principles of heaven and earth? Therefore, use the principles, but do not be limited by them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly, word by word.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved. "Indeed, my master has transcended heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Since his master had transcended heaven and earth, a mere flick of his finger could shake the heavens and earth. That's why his master suppressed his cultivation level, acting like an ordinary person, rarely using his full power, and only matching his opponents at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>So the ultimate goal of the martial path is to transcend heaven and earth?!</p><p></p><p>"No, my master said the martial path has no end, and transcending heaven and earth is not the final goal!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I will set a goal for myself - to transcend heaven and earth within a hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had set a martial arts goal for himself.</p><p></p><p>To transcend heaven and earth within a hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "Beyond the divine ability realm is the Divine Manifestation realm, using one's own principles to control the principles of heaven and earth, transforming them into the divine martial arts..."</p><p></p><p>Word by word, he passed on the martial arts of the Divine Manifestation realm to Xu Yan, including the diagrams of the principles of heaven and earth that he had extracted, integrated, and designed in order to create the Divine Manifestation cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Without these diagrams of the principles of heaven and earth, cultivating the Divine Martial Manifestation would be extremely difficult. But with these diagrams, it was as if one had grasped the flaws in the principles of heaven and earth, able to integrate one's own martial arts principles into them and manipulate the principles of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>This was a perfect match. As long as Xu Yan could comprehend it, the cultivation of the Divine Manifestation realm would become much easier.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan carefully memorized the martial arts of the Divine Manifestation realm, including the diagrams of the principles of heaven and earth. Since this was not the first time he had comprehended the diagrams of the principles of heaven and earth, it did not take him too long to memorize them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had carefully selected and repeatedly simplified the principles of heaven and earth in the diagrams to make them easier to memorize. Given Xu Yan's talents, it was not too difficult for him to memorize them after a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan was carefully contemplating the martial arts of the Divine Manifestation realm, Li Xuan silently waited, not continuing to pass on the martial arts of the Transcendent Void realm yet.</p><p></p><p>He would wait until Xu Yan had completely memorized and gained some understanding of the Divine Manifestation cultivation method, then pass on the Transcendent Void realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have memorized it," Xu Yan finally said, opening his eyes respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Li Xuan looked very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have memorized the martial arts of the Divine Manifestation realm, I shall now pass on to you the martial arts that surpass the Divine Manifestation realm," Li Xuan continued.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Manifestation realm was already so powerful, able to use the principles of heaven and earth for oneself. What could possibly be beyond that?</p><p></p><p>"The realm beyond Divine Manifestation is the Transcendent Void realm, shattering the spatial dimensions of heaven and earth, traversing the void..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the power of the Transcendent Void realm.</p><p></p><p>Shattering space, traversing the void.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shocked. Once he broke through to the Transcendent Void realm, a single step would allow him to directly traverse space, roaming freely through the void, covering thousands or even millions of miles in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Although he would not have transcended heaven and earth, he would have disregarded the spatial dimensions and principles of heaven and earth. One could say that at this realm, he would be free to roam within the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"To shatter space and penetrate the principles of heaven and earth requires immense strength, which depends on the power of one's own martial arts principles..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to impart the martial arts of the Transcendent Void realm.</p><p></p><p>Using one's own martial arts principles to break through the principles of heaven and earth and roam freely through the void - this was the Transcendent Void realm. So the key was to cultivate one's own powerful martial arts principles.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan carefully explained the Transcendent Void martial arts to Xu Yan in detail. Fearing that Xu Yan might miss something at this powerful realm, he even repeated the explanation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in the incredible power of the Transcendent Void realm. In his mind, he could already envision the scenes.</p><p></p><p>A single step would shatter the spatial dimensions, his figure disappearing between heaven and earth, only to reappear from a distant space. Even a single palm strike could send a golden dragon crashing through space to attack a distant enemy.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more excited and impassioned he became.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Void realm was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached the Transcendent Void realm, to return to the Inner Realm or come from the Inner Realm to the Spiritual Realm, he would not need to pass through the Spiritual Realm gates - he could simply traverse the space directly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have memorized it!" Xu Yan calmed his excited emotions and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good," Li Xuan nodded, extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After passing on the martial arts, Li Xuan turned and left, not disturbing Xu Yan as he continued to contemplate and settle the teachings.</p><p></p><p>"The future of my martial dao legacy rests on you," Li Xuan thought to himself, filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to reach the Transcendent Void realm, how powerful would I be?" Li Xuan mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had created the realms, he could not fully imagine the power of the Transcendent Void realm. </p><p></p><p>After all, the ultimate strength of the Transcendent Void realm would depend on how Xu Yan comprehended and cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine abilities would the Transcendent Void realm possess?" Li Xuan wondered. If he were in the Transcendent Void realm, could he simply shatter a spatial dimension and stand tall in the void? He could not even begin to fathom such terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not yet embarked on his invincible path, but the first celestial talent had already appeared on the Spiritual Realm Talent Ranking - Jian Zai Yu Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>He had slain a Refining Spirit Celestial Immortal realm talent from the Luo State Alliance, boldly challenging all wandering celestial talents, declaring that only those who could withstand ten of his strikes would be worthy of the title "celestial talent".</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they were all trash!</p><p></p><p>His arrogance matched his strength.</p><p></p><p>After Yu Changfeng made his move, the Demon Slaughter from the Three Seclusion Tower also took action, challenging the talents of the Myriad World Alliance and decisively defeating his opponent.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the Spirit Sect surged, and the disdain for wandering celestial talents was unceasing.</p><p></p><p>The clash of celestial talents had officially begun.</p><p></p><p>But the top celestial talents of the Transcendent Spirit Sect had not yet descended the mountain, not even having their names spread.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that the peak celestial talents of the Transcendent Spirit Sect were all Spiritual Body cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Only those with Spiritual Body talent could become the top celestial talents of the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm martial arts world was bustling, but Jade State was calm.</p><p></p><p>The death of Huang Liang did not seem to have caused much of a ripple. In the eyes of the Thousand Martial Hall, Huang Liang was killed by a strong cultivator of the Myriad World Alliance, and no powerful expert had come to Jade State to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, Xu Yan was about to challenge the celestial talents of the Spiritual Realm, preparing to break through to the Spirit Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The accumulation had been built up.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was the same.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Prodigy Showdown has begun to have rules, but there are many shameless people in the world, especially the arrogant Spiritual Sect. Although I will not take action, I can still provide you with a certain guarantee."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said to the disciple standing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, four jade talismans appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The jade talismans contain the power of a divine technique, similar to the might I used to kill Huang Liang. If you absorb them into your body, you will be able to be protected in life-and-death crises." But remember, do not become arrogant and reckless just because you have my divine talismans. Warriors are not reckless, I have taught you this many times."</p><p></p><p>The divine talismans were Li Xuan's guarantee for his disciples to travel in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>The four of Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>After receiving and absorbing the jade talismans, Xu Yan respectfully said, "Master, rest assured. I will definitely defeat all the Celestial Prodigies in the Spiritual Realm and reach the peak of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I will trample the Thousand Martial Palace underfoot and make them my stepping stones."</p><p></p><p>The fully realized Spiritual Sense Realm Xu Yan was full of confidence. His first target was Yu Changfeng of the Sword Sect! He wanted the martial arts world of the Spiritual Realm to know that the supreme sword dao belonged to Sword God Xu Yan! "Master, I will also let the martial arts world of the Spiritual Realm see what true physical martial arts and the Dao of the Blade are!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thumped his chest and said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, just watch. The position of the Supreme Alliance Leader will definitely be mine. I will lead the World Alliance to surpass the Spiritual Sect's hegemony.</p><p></p><p>"I will truly break the Spiritual Sect's rule and let the world witness the extraordinary Esoteric Martial Arts!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said respectfully, his eyes burning with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"I, I will follow Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling's eyes twinkled as she smiled cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Red Cat jumped out.</p><p></p><p>Its claws wrote on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Beast Clan is too useless. They lack a true king. I, the Red Cat, will go and lead them to rise up, becoming the Demon King of the Spiritual Realm. I will go to Tianling State!"</p><p></p><p>After writing, the Red Cat rubbed against Li Xuan's ankle, mewing adorably.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. He raised his hand and tapped the Red Cat's head with the Jade Scepter, saying impatiently, "You're a tiger, not a cat!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat stopped meowing and let out a deep tiger roar.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have such ambitions, then go."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's strength was still not enough to be called a king, but going out to wander would help it grow faster. Moreover, the Demonic Monarch Technique reaching the Spiritual Realm was a good thing. As long as it cultivated the Demonic Monarch Technique, it would be under his control, and he could command all the Demons at any time.</p><p></p><p>He also gave the Red Cat a divine talisman for protection.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was extremely excited. The Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha looked pitifully at Xu Yan, while one crouched in front of Fang Hao, softly chirping.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. These three pets had really become enlightened.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha had picked up some bad habits from the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed out two divine talismans and waved his hand, "Go!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha were overjoyed, respectfully kowtowing before running to the back of the Red Cat, ready to follow the "Great King" to create a great undertaking.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat went in front of Su Ling, acting cute.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of medicinal pills...</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat has such ambitions, that's good. Take it."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling waved her hand and gave the Red Cat a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The formation in the manor was retracted.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to find the Three Extremes Pavilion's Butcher, see how capable his blade techniques are."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to find Yu Changfeng."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, stepping out and disappearing from the manor.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also rose into the air, quickly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, with Moon Changming by his side, went to the Jade State Alliance headquarters to officially announce his position as the Alliance Leader and participate in the Celestial Prodigy Showdown.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat, with the Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha, also quickly departed.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the Spiritual Realm, today was the day they finally set out on their own paths, walking their own roads.</p><p></p><p>Moon did not follow her grandfather, but stayed with Su Ling.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. His disciples had finally set out on their own paths, even the pet Red Cat had lofty ambitions.</p><p></p><p>Out of the four disciples, only Su Ling remained by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall we continue to stay here?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling blinked her eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to leave, not wanting to stay in the manor any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Since you want to practice medicine, then go to Luo State. There are many injured people there after the battle, enough for you to accumulate your Pill Dao and martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm was so vast, it was time to go out and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling was overjoyed and began to pack up.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu were depressed. Their strength was too weak, they couldn't even go out to wander without being beaten to death at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to break through to the Spiritual Sense Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Even if they broke through to the Spiritual Sense Realm, they still wouldn't have the strength to wander the Spiritual Realm, after all, they weren't like Xu Yan and Meng Chong, possessing such powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Moon was also extremely excited. She had become good friends with Su Ling and was also learning the art of pill-making, able to assist Su Ling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her strength was not weak. She was at the initial stage of Refining the Spirit Celestial, able to defeat ordinary Refining the Spirit Middle Stage, and contend with Refining the Spirit Late Stage without problems.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had the innate talent of a Spiritual Body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly regretted letting the Red Cat leave, he lacked a mount now!</p><p></p><p>"Master, without the Red Cat, what do we do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling also thought of this problem.</p><p></p><p>Without the Red Cat, the Master lacked a mount.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, we'll just walk."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, a look of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the chair was retracted, and he played with the Jade Scepter as he stepped away.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling and Moon closely followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu followed step-by-step, their hearts full of helplessness. Their weak strength and slow speed required them to be taken care of.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being weak was too unbearable.</p><p></p><p>They also missed the Red Cat. If the Red Cat was here, these problems wouldn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Outside the capital of Zheng Kingdom, the manor was now empty. It wasn't until three days later that Zheng Emperor cautiously walked in, confirming that no one was there, and finally felt a sense of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, a terrifying existence like a demonic deity had been living next door, and he had been on tenterhooks every day, afraid of suddenly meeting with disaster!</p><p></p><p>Now that the person had left, the heart he had been holding up was finally put down.</p><p></p><p>In Jade State, Li Xuan's group slowly walked, occasionally admiring the scenery of the Spiritual Realm, and Su Ling would pick the spiritual herbs she found.</p><p></p><p>When they encountered a large city, they would also go in and take a look. The hot topic among the martial artists was the Celestial Prodigy Showdown, all of them not optimistic about the World Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Due to the need to take care of Shi Er and the others, the speed of progress was not fast, and they were still far from entering Luo State. On this day, a spiritual beast flew in from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up and smiled, finally having a mount!</p>

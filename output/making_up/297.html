        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, I missed the pet cat Chihao a bit.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, I felt a bit listless, and I threw the bottle of elixir in my hand, saying, "It's yours!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was excited, and after catching the elixir, it hurriedly expressed its gratitude.</p><p></p><p>What a good master!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng did not deceive himself, he really was doing it for my own good!</p><p></p><p>But Zhu Xingzheng was dumbfounded, he actually gave the entire bottle of elixir to the golden-horned deer?</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu entered the room and began to list the diagnosis fees, preparing for the upcoming treatment of the warrior.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er also came in to assist Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Does Zhu Xingzheng staying behind have some ulterior motive?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind him, even if he has an ulterior motive, he won't succeed. Since he's not leaving, let him be a free laborer. After all, we've already given him a bottle of healing elixir, which is enough to pay for his compensation."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er nodded, with the senior present, no matter how Zhu Xingzheng plots, he can only end up hurting himself.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gold, let me see the elixir, what kind of effects does it have?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng came to the golden-horned deer with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's an elixir that can enhance one's strength!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was very excited, with gratitude in its eyes. If Zhu Xingzheng hadn't sold it, how could it have obtained such a precious elixir? So, it had no guard at all and handed the elixir to Zhu Xingzheng.</p><p></p><p>"This elixir is a bit too much, here, Little Gold, you take this one pill, and I'll keep the rest."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng took out one pill and gave it to the golden-horned deer, keeping the rest for himself.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is mine!" </p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer became a bit irritable.</p><p></p><p>Slap! Zhu Xingzheng slapped it on the head, "Do you think I'm greedy for your elixir? I, Zhu Xingzheng, walk the righteous path, how could I do such a thing?</p><p></p><p>"I'm doing this for your father's sake. This elixir is for your father. Now that there's an opportunity, if your father takes the elixir, he might have a chance to become a super sixth-rank spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>"When he reaches the super sixth-rank, does he still need to be with a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer wanted to say something, but Zhu Xingzheng slapped it on the head again, angrily saying, "How can you have no filial piety? I'm considering your father, and you don't even think about being filial?</p><p></p><p>"Little Gold, how can you be such a deer?</p><p></p><p>"If Mistress Su and Mistress Yue know that you are such an unfilial deer, how will they see you?</p><p></p><p>"After they know you are an unfilial deer, will they still value you?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was suddenly filled with shame, "You're right, take the elixir and give it to my father."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng nodded in satisfaction and said, "From now on, you keep 30% of the elixir, and the remaining 70% you give to me, and I'll pass it on to your father."</p><p></p><p>"This... this... this won't work."</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was dumbfounded, this time it lost 70%, it was really painful.</p><p></p><p>Honoring one's father is not supposed to be like this.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng said with a look of disappointment, "Little Gold, that's your father, he's about to become a super sixth-rank spiritual beast, he needs more elixirs. Once your father reaches the super sixth-rank, it means you have a super sixth-rank father as your backing.</p><p></p><p>"70% is not too much. Besides, if Mistress Su and Mistress Yue know how filial you are, they might bestow more elixirs upon you. With this give and take, the amount of elixirs you obtain will actually increase."</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer blinked its eyes, its brain couldn't quite turn it over for the moment, but it felt that Zhu Xingzheng's words made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>It nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it! You need to be a filial deer. Look at how filial Mistress Su is to her master, if they know you are a filial deer, they will naturally have a good impression of you, and the elixirs bestowed upon you will increase."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng patted the golden-horned deer's head, nodding in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched and listened to it all, and couldn't help but be speechless. This guy Zhu Xingzheng, really knows how to trick spiritual beasts!</p><p></p><p>After fooling the golden-horned deer, Zhu Xingzheng began to make the sign for the Long Qing Pavilion, handling the tasks Suling Xiu had entrusted him with beautifully. Then he went to ask Suling Xiu if he could bring his elder relative who was seriously injured for treatment.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded and told him to prepare the spiritual herbs needed for the diagnosis.</p><p></p><p>At the site of the Crimson Dark Sect's ruins, a manor was built, with a sign that read "Long Qing Pavilion", naturally attracting the attention of the cultivator families in Luo State.</p><p></p><p>They were all silently watching, wondering where this Long Qing Pavilion came from, was it from the Myriad Worlds Alliance, the Thousand Martial Halls, or the Thunder Cloud Mountain Villa.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the cultivator families of Luo State would have gone to inquire about its origins directly. However, after experiencing the Myriad Worlds Alliance's great battle and witnessing the might of the Grandmaster Changda Niu, the cultivator families in Luo State had become more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Yuanlong Feng was recently killed, and the Sword Sect's Sect Master was killed, the scattered cultivators who were originally suppressed had suddenly straightened their backs.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grandmaster Fang Kaishan, who was stationed in Luo State, had a very grim expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was using a transmission talisman to maintain contact with Fang Hao, obtaining the latest news from the Spiritual Dao Realm. As for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, since they were too far away, they were beyond the range of the transmission talisman and could not be contacted.</p><p></p><p>Disciples were roaming outside, and Li Xuan had simply changed locations to continue his carefree and leisurely cultivation of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles, continuing to compile the Divine Martial Classics.</p><p></p><p>And every now and then, the Great Dao Golden Book would provide feedback, either that Xu Yan had slain a Refining Spirit Celestial, or that Meng Chong had slain a Refining Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The eldest disciple and the second disciple seemed to be slaughtering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch of the Jade State Alliance, Fang Hao met with Shen Tai, the number one expert of Jade State, and reached some agreements. Fang Hao even appeared in person, intimidating the other cultivator families and sects.</p><p></p><p>The Jade State Alliance officially emerged and successfully took over the original territories of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, making it public.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when taking over the territories, the official reason was that they had defeated the Shen Family's experts, without exposing the behind-the-scenes dealings with the Shen Family.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Family was a cultivator family, and with this identity, they could obtain some intelligence from other cultivator families and sects. </p><p></p><p>So there was no need to expose their relationship, as it would not be good for either side if it was revealed.</p><p></p><p>After stabilizing the situation in Jade State, the Jade State Alliance officially occupied a place.</p><p></p><p>They also continuously published the Scattered Cultivator Regulations, as well as the principle of equal treatment with cultivator families, and the equal distribution of resources, etc.</p><p></p><p>They also continued to eliminate the second-rate and below cultivator families and sects, leaving only the top-tier cultivator families and sects in Jade State. The situation was maintained with the cultivator families and sects as one camp, and the Jade State Alliance as the other camp.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Zheng Country, the Jade State Alliance did not intervene, allowing it to maintain its neutral and special status, continuing to undertake some of its responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>By now, the landscape of Jade State had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators truly had a place.</p><p></p><p>In addition, martial arts manuals also began to circulate, which were obtained by the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family.</p><p></p><p>Among the eighteen states of the Spiritual Dao Realm, except for the Myriad Worlds Alliance's headquarters in Chenzhou, the remaining seventeen states truly gave the scattered cultivators a place, and achieved equal treatment with the cultivator families and sects, only Jade State has done so.</p><p></p><p>And the name of Fang Hao, the Patriarch of the Jade State Alliance, also began to be known throughout the Spiritual Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The news of the Yuzhou Alliance spread, and the entire Wanshi Alliance was shocked - the Yuzhou Alliance's Sect Master had been quietly replaced.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Yuzhou Alliance accomplished the long-standing goal of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao continued to rectify Yuzhou, continuously publishing a series of regulations, deploying an intelligence system, and constructing a communication network to replace the outdated Feifeng communication method. He set up formations in the Spirit Crystal Mines and built the Yuzhou Alliance's main city.</p><p></p><p>After Shen Tai admitted his inability to stop the Yuzhou Alliance, the other top-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans could only sign agreements under Fang Hao's pressure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, seeing the Shen Clan seize the opportunity to expand their territory and occupy the lands and resources of the lower-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans, they also grew envious.</p><p></p><p>Normally, to occupy the territories of Spiritual Sects and Clans, one would need a legitimate reason, defeat the opponent through strength, and then report it to the higher Sects for recognition and approval. Without a legitimate reason, it is not allowed to completely occupy the lands of other Spiritual Sects and Clans, or else they would be punished by the higher Sects.</p><p></p><p>This is the implicit rule that the Spiritual Sects govern the entire Spiritual Realm. However, the Wanshi Alliance is not bound by these rules, so the Yuzhou Alliance's destruction of the lower-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans, and the Shen Clan's opportunistic annexation, are considered reasonable and appropriate, not violating any rules, but rather maintaining the Spiritual Sects' territories.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after Fang Hao secretly expressed his willingness to grant them some of the lower-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans' lands and resources, the other top-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans immediately agreed, completely disregarding the pleas for help from the lower-tier Spiritual Sects and Clans, which were quickly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Qianwu Palace nor the Leiyun Mountain Villa had the time to care about the situation in Yuzhou, as Yuzhou's overall strength was relatively weak, and Zheng State was not affected.</p><p></p><p>They tacitly maintained Zheng State's special status, which was enough.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Hao's name was remembered by the major Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a giant eagle was flying, with three people sitting on its back.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng had a respectful expression, "Shishu, Miss Su said she can treat it, and since you're in this state, we might as well try, just in case it can actually be cured, wouldn't that be a stroke of luck?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting next to Zhu Xingzheng was a man with a blackened face and heavy breathing, occasionally shaking his head as if to relieve his dizziness.</p><p></p><p>"Little Fatty, is there really such a miraculous doctor? If they can't cure it, then my promise to help your Wanshi Alliance this time would be a huge loss for me."</p><p></p><p>The other person, a beautiful woman, sighed. Her delicate cheeks were also blackened, as if a perfect porcelain vase had been stained.</p><p></p><p>She was wearing a sheer garment that shimmered brilliantly in the sunlight. More eye-catching were the fan-shaped fins that occasionally opened at her elbows and calves, emanating a dazzling glow.</p><p></p><p>There was a moist sensation around her, as if the air was saturated with water vapor.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan! The dominant race of the Azure Sea, the Sea Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't worry, I think she should be able to cure it," Zhu Xingzheng said, his smile fading, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanshi Alliance will not forget your assistance, and we will do our best to find precious restorative treasures to help you recover," the half-blackened man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"You should worry about yourself first, half of your face is already burned," the woman said, rolling her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the sixth-tier Spirit Beast attracted the attention of many cultivators, especially the powerful ones from the Spiritual Sects and Clans.</p><p></p><p>"They are not from the Imperial Spiritual Sect, how did the Wanshi Alliance collaborate with the Spirit Beast Clan?" a Refining Deity-level cultivator from the Qingyu Realm frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Are they going to the Changqing Pavilion? It seems the Changqing Pavilion belongs to the Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the direction the eagle was heading, the Spiritual Sect experts' expressions darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Xingzheng is back?" Su Lingxiu and Yue'er looked up at the giant eagle, a sixth-tier Spirit Beast, in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan suddenly felt gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Golden-Horned Deer, although it looked decent, it was still just a sixth-tier Spirit Beast. Riding a Spirit Beast could not demonstrate his high status as a powerful cultivator.</p><p></p><p>There were also Spiritual Sect experts who rode Spirit Beasts.</p><p></p><p>For example, the people from the Imperial Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Riding a Spirit Beast is too common, as a peerless expert, how can I do something so ordinary?" Li Yuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, flying ships! How could I have forgotten about that? With my Alchemy skills, Formations, and Restrictions, why not forge a flying divine artifact? There are no flying ships in the entire Spiritual Realm, and as a peerless expert, riding a flying ship would truly set me apart and showcase my high status."</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan grew more and more excited. Forging a flying ship, big or small, could be stored in his Storage Ring, or even hundreds or thousands of meters in size.</p><p></p><p>"What a great idea! I should have thought of this earlier. It's time to give Fang Hao something to do and have him forge a flying ship for me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan looked up at the descending eagle.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, his gaze falling on the Sea Spirit Clan woman.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Sea Spirit Clan? She looks so moist, no wonder, since they live in the sea."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of mermaids.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Sea Spirit Clan and mermaids were vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Sea Spirits below the Heavenly Monarch Realm cannot stay on land for too long, but after breaking through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm, they can walk on land.</p><p></p><p>Only at the Refining Deity Realm can they stay on land indefinitely without being affected.</p><p></p><p>However, if their injuries are too severe, they must return to the water to recover more quickly.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan woman currently had serious injuries, but since her cultivation was strong, she could continue to walk on land without needing to return to the water to heal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her injuries were somewhat unique, and even if she returned to the water, it might not necessarily help her recover.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, the patient has arrived!" Zhu Xingzheng supported the man as they got off the eagle's back.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, lay him down."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was excited, pushing a prepared bed for the man to lie on.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li looked at the enthusiastic and eager Su Lingxiu with great disappointment. How could such a young girl possibly be able to cure his condition?</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng must have been deceived, right?</p><p></p><p>But since they had come this far, he might as well give it a try, as Zhu Xingzheng said, since he was in this state already, it was worth trying, even if it was like "treating a dead horse as if it were alive."</p><p></p><p>So he lay down on the bed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

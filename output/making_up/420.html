        <h1>Chapter 420</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was startled. His senior disciple brother was extremely far away from him, yet he had also heard the wind sound, and even saw a green flame?</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, be careful, don't get close to the flame," Jiang Buping hurriedly warned.</p><p></p><p>"I wasn't planning to get close, but the strange fire is approaching me. Let's talk later, I'll see what's unusual about this flame."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the message from his senior brother, Jiang Buping was puzzled. He had never read about the situation his senior brother was encountering in any texts.</p><p></p><p>"The wind sound is getting louder. Two big eyes have appeared in the darkness, which is quite strange," the second senior brother also sent a message at this time.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was shocked. Could it be that the entire wilderness had wind sounds and these unusual things appearing?</p><p></p><p>"The big eyes are coming closer. I'll see what's going on," Jiang Buping read the second senior brother's message and felt tense. He hurriedly became alert to his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Both his senior brothers had encountered unusual things, why hadn't he encountered anything?</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black wilderness, there was the sound of howling wind, but no wind could be felt blowing. Suddenly, Jiang Buping noticed a white, mist-like substance appearing in the darkness, drifting towards him.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression became focused. He sensed an eerie aura emanating from the white mist that he had never encountered before, with an evil feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Remnant soul!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping practiced the Extreme Soul Martial Way, so he was particularly sensitive to matters related to the soul. Therefore, he immediately realized that the white mist was actually some kind of unknown remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul drifted, covering a large area. The eerie aura was extremely thick, and there was a sense of chilling evil just from looking at it.</p><p></p><p>"What changes have occurred in the wilderness?" Jiang Buping frowned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't avoid it, quietly waiting for the remnant soul to drift over. As an Extreme Soul martial artist, how could a mere remnant soul threaten him?</p><p></p><p>"If it has malicious intent, I'll refine this remnant soul," Jiang Buping thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The remnant soul drifted over, enveloping him. Suddenly, the drifting remnant soul paused and began to converge towards his location.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the remnant soul, the sense of eeriness and evil was particularly obvious. Even ordinary True King Celestial Lords would likely feel frightened if they encountered this. If they couldn't escape, they might even go insane.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buping understood a bit. The True King Celestial Lords who went insane crossing the wilderness probably encountered something similar to this remnant soul mist.</p><p></p><p>"This is quite unusual. Martial artists below the True King Celestial Lord level can't disperse this remnant soul mist, and might even get lost in it. How strong was the expert who left behind such remnant souls when they were alive?" Jiang Buping was shocked, thinking of some rumors about the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"However, you're unlucky to encounter me. By refining the power of this remnant soul, my Extreme Soul Martial Way can also improve."</p><p></p><p>Since the remnant soul mist had malicious intent, Jiang Buping didn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He raised his palm, and what seemed like a black vortex appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul Martial Way divine ability - Devouring Abyss!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With a palm strike, a dark abyss appeared in the remnant soul mist, devouring the mist.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, Jiang Buping seemed to hear eerie and strange sounds coming from behind the remnant soul mist, like evil laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, trying to influence my soul and will? Too naive."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He sent messages to his senior brother and second senior brother but received no response. He frowned but wasn't too worried. Both his senior brothers had extraordinary martial skills. These unusual things could threaten True King Celestial Lords and even Immortal Celestial Lords, but with the martial abilities of his two senior brothers, they should be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul mist disappeared, and the wilderness returned to lonely silence.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping set up formations again and entered a state of cultivation, refining the power of the remnant soul mist.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The green flames danced, like a distorted face. An eerie aura permeated the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The flames grew larger and larger, covering an increasingly wide area, even like a huge silk cloth wrapping up a piece of darkness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was in the midst of the green flames. The Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword was endlessly alive, and the Indestructible Sword Intent also surrounded him. A faint dragon aura also emerged.</p><p></p><p>The green flames suddenly appeared and moved extremely fast, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>The flames were like human faces, sometimes appearing like an honest and steady man, sometimes like a sinister and evil person.</p><p></p><p>It was as if two people were entangled, fighting.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned. He didn't sense any dangerous aura in the green flames.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he didn't dare to be careless. These green flames were very strange.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A trace of Indestructible Sword Intent rippled out, surging into the green flames. Suddenly, changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>The dancing green flames suddenly became intense. There were rumbling sounds, sounds of killing, an extremely angry roar, and low, sinister laughter.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The green flames changed. In a trance, the surrounding scenery also changed, no longer the pitch-black wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, alert to his surroundings. A golden dragon flickered in and out of visibility within his body. The Indestructible Sword Intent turned into a gentle breeze, surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan showed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was in the primordial chaos, boundless and limitless, murky and hazy. There seemed to be indestructible qi floating about, endless indestructible qi, and among this indestructible qi were interspersed violent spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this spiritual qi, Xu Yan felt like he had returned to the frontier lands. The spiritual qi in the frontier lands was violent because it had lost the world's spiritual mechanism.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual qi here was also violent, but a hundred times more violent than that in the frontier lands.</p><p></p><p>If the spiritual qi within the world's spiritual mechanism was like mild water, and the spiritual qi in the frontier lands was like boiling water, then the spiritual qi interspersed in the indestructible qi in this primordial chaos was like churning molten iron!</p><p></p><p>"What place is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood a bit. The green flames, upon contact with the Indestructible Sword Intent, sensed the indestructible qi contained within, and thus such changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>An angry roar that seemed to come from ancient times sounded. In the primordial chaos, dozens of extremely powerful figures attacked towards a certain place in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>A fierce battle erupted, an intense battle that left Xu Yan shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even battles between Immortal Celestial Lords seemed like ant fights compared to this!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint light appeared in the primordial chaos, and a figure could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of powerful expert is this?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, from this figure, Xu Yan had a feeling similar to facing his master. This person gave him a sense of being as profound and unfathomable as his master.</p><p></p><p>No! It was somewhat different from his master's unfathomability. His master was mysterious and unfathomable, yet also seemed ordinary and commonplace, closer to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>But this person gave a sense that could make martial artists worship, make martial artists feel reverence, as if like a majestic sage.</p><p></p><p>"Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of inspiration crossed Xu Yan's mind. The Sage Sword Realm, the Great Sage of Swords, no sword would not bow, no sword would not follow, no sword would dare to oppose.</p><p></p><p>He had never understood what kind of realm the Sage Sword Realm truly was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How can one cultivate the Holy Sword Realm? At this moment, seeing that figure, he suddenly had some understanding, some comprehension of the greatness of sainthood, and some understanding of what it means to bow to no sword but the holy sword!</p><p></p><p>"Holy Sword Realm!" Xu Yan murmured to himself. A flash of inspiration struck his mind, and he vaguely understood how to cultivate the Holy Sword Realm. </p><p></p><p>He was just one step away from fully comprehending how to cultivate the Holy Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What level of expert is this person?" Xu Yan was shocked in his heart. This majestic figure, seen only from behind, was so powerful that it could make martial artists bow down in worship.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a Tai Cang martial artist. If Tai Cang martial artists saw this, wouldn't they instantly lose all fighting spirit?" Xu Yan thought in shock.</p><p></p><p>"I'm at the small accomplishment stage of the Wisdom Sword Realm, so this figure doesn't affect me. Its influence on Great Wilderness martial artists is also limited."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of chaos, that figure stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, the chaos parted, light swirled, and he struck towards the depths of chaos.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan heard an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>"Ming Wu!"</p><p></p><p>The scene before him changed, revealing a world floating in chaos, swirling with light.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a world?"</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Xu Yan was shocked once again.</p><p></p><p>The scene rapidly zoomed in. The one who had roared in anger was descending upon this world.</p><p></p><p>As it got closer, the outline of the world became clearer, and its vastness became more apparent.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the martial techniques of the World Realm surfaced.</p><p></p><p>To embody the world! His sword techniques also emerged - Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena, as well as the divine ability Sword of Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>Understanding welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if he could comprehend the martial techniques of the World Realm at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A great battle erupted. The world shook, and the fighting was fierce.</p><p></p><p>Green light withered the world and corroded living beings, while another powerful force continuously shattered the green light.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, with a thunderous sound, a ball of light exploded, and the battle gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Mutual destruction?" Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he somewhat understood. This green flame, transforming into human faces, was formed by the intertwining wills of two supreme experts who had perished together long ago.</p><p></p><p>The scenes he had witnessed were some of what these two powerful beings had once seen.</p><p></p><p>"Far beyond what an Immortal Venerable can compare to," Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Even just these two who had perished together were so powerful that Immortal Venerables would be like ants before them.</p><p></p><p>And that majestic figure was even more terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful experts clearly had opponents as well.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. The experts in this world are beyond imagination," Xu Yan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon became excited again. One day, he too would become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>The chaos disappeared, the scenes vanished, and all he could see again was the leaping green flame.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the scenes he had just witnessed surfaced. He had gained some insights, and was just one step away from fully comprehending the World Realm.</p><p></p><p>He also had some understanding of how to cultivate the Holy Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Wonders Divine Flower should be able to help me fully comprehend," Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've encountered it, I can't miss this opportunity. Let it be incorporated into my Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the green flame, which was formed by the intertwining of a tiny bit of will left behind by two supreme experts, Xu Yan summoned his Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena with a thought, directly enveloping the green flame.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to refine the green flame, incorporating the scenes within it into his Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena, to become a scene of great battle within it.</p><p></p><p>"One of them was called Ming Wu. What was the other one called?" Xu Yan remembered the name of one of the supreme experts and decided to ask his master later.</p><p></p><p>In the Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena, a gentle breeze began to blow on the green flame. The sword intent surged within, and the scenes he had witnessed appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>As darkness receded and the sky began to lighten, the green flame disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled. With a thought, a scene of great battle appeared within his Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena.</p><p></p><p>Living beings were within it, and the battle transformed into a terrifying force striking out.</p><p></p><p>"Mountains and Rivers Myriad Phenomena has become stronger, especially this battle scene. Even an Immortal Venerable would be awed by it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed. His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>The wilderness was now bright, silent and empty, with a sense of desolation scattered throughout.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a communication talisman to reply to Jiang Buping, then began to send a message to his master, inquiring about the supreme expert called Ming Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Off to Long Cloud Realm now? When I get to Long Cloud Realm, I'll find a place to seclude myself and consume the Seven Wonders Divine Flower."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued on his journey.</p><p></p><p>In another part of the wilderness, Meng Chong opened his eyes, revealing a look of joy.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, two stars appeared in his acupoints. Within the stars, there seemed to be an image of the netherworld, capable of submerging an enemy's physical body.</p><p></p><p>These were the two huge eyes he had encountered. When he used his Undying Star power to subdue these two huge eyes, he refined them into his acupoints.</p><p></p><p>The power contained in the huge eyes transformed into two stars. The power of these two stars was like a deep netherworld abyss, capable of submerging physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>"With these two physical body stars, once deployed, few martial artists at the same level would be unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists weaker than me, when illuminated, would all have their physical bodies submerged, find it difficult to move, their bodies would fatigue, and their combat power would greatly decrease."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed. This was an unexpected gain, a stroke of good fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Ming Wu? What kind of expert was this? Even the remnant power of his destroyed eyes has such use."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong became curious. He took out a communication talisman to ask his master.</p><p></p><p>From refining the two big eyes, he had seen some scene fragments and could confirm that this supreme expert called Ming Wu was extremely terrifying in power.</p><p></p><p>"Off to Long Cloud Realm now, just passing through. I'll travel all the way to Great Flame Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued on his journey.</p><p></p><p>Long Cloud Realm was just a place to pass through. He had no plans to enter Long Cloud Realm's heaven cave for training.</p><p></p><p>In Green Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, his disciple was indeed fierce, even defeating an Immortal Venerable. He must have shocked the martial artists of Nine Mountains Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple defeated an Immortal Venerable. You've gained Reverse Killing!"</p><p></p><p>Reverse Killing allows one to kill enemies up to three times stronger than oneself.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again, and I have more confidence!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>With communication talismans that could transmit messages regardless of distance, he could easily keep track of Xu Yan and the others. The brothers would communicate every few days, and Li Xuan was fully informed.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing the wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>"To think such special situations would occur in this wilderness. I hope there's no danger. The jade talismans I gave them haven't been triggered, so it shouldn't be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Then, Xu Yan sent him a message.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, those are all martial artists who have transcended the world? What great battle erupted back then? It's probably related to the changes in the Tai Cang world. That majestic figure was incredibly strong."</p><p></p><p>Reading Xu Yan's message describing what he had seen and heard, Li Xuan felt some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Ming Wu? Your master never remembers the names of ants!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, the Great Chaos in the Qinghua Border, was filled with the sounds of slaughter, agonizing cries, and the roars of warriors.</p><p></p><p>One city after another had become a city of the dead.</p><p></p><p>At the starting point of the Divine Bridge, the Linguan City, a fierce battle was raging in the sky, with several powerful figures engaged in combat with over a dozen blood-colored figures.</p><p></p><p>The sky was illuminated by a bloody glow, and within this glow, thunderous rumbles could be heard, but even the mightiest lightning was being suppressed by the bloody light, as if it could not last much longer.</p><p></p><p>Below, in Linguan City, a massacre was unfolding.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of blood-colored figures were reaping lives, and no matter how the warriors resisted, it was to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blood energy permeated Linguan City, and the blood of the warriors was gathering, forming a surging blood calamity.</p><p></p><p>Crimson longswords were slaughtering throughout the city, slicing open the throats of one person after another. The fresh blood, as if drawn by a force, did not spill onto the ground but transformed into blood energy, converging towards the center of the city.</p><p></p><p>In the city center, within the former city lord's mansion, a blood pool was bubbling, emitting blood vapor, and surrounded by a blood calamity.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"You beasts of the Blood Shadow Tower, you deserve to die! You bastards of the Minghui, this grudge must be avenged!"</p><p></p><p>A sorrowful and furious roar came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>As the last person in the city had their throat slit, their blood transformed into blood energy and converged into the blood pool in the city lord's mansion, and Linguan City became a city of the dead! The blood pool was boiling, as if it was simmering the blood, and the blood within the pool was constantly condensing and descending.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it transformed into a dark red blood gel, emanating a faint bloody scent and an unknown fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Several blood shadows appeared in the blood pool, their eyes filled with excitement and greed, as if they had found the most delectable delicacy in the world.</p><p></p><p>They took out their crimson knives and began to divide the dark red blood gel, storing it in various boxes.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from the towering ravine outside Linguan City, a shockwave came, and a rainbow-colored light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge has opened, how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a man with a red beard, wielding a pair of thunderous hammers and fighting alone against three blood shadows, exclaimed with shock and doubt.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had been severed, and the Spiritual Realm was disconnected!</p><p></p><p>According to his judgment, the Spiritual Realm had likely fallen and become a living hell.</p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal Sovereign could only descend into the Spiritual Realm and could not reconnect the severed Divine Bridge, which could only be restored by itself.</p><p></p><p>But it had not been long, and according to the estimation, the Divine Bridge was far from being able to restore itself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cheng Zhan's heart sank. Could it be that the formidable enemies of the Minghui had the ability to repair the Divine Bridge and then kill their way from the Spiritual Realm to the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, the Qinghua Border would be in grave danger! "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan roared, and his body was surrounded by raging lightning. His pair of lightning hammers unleashed a furious thunderstorm, attacking the three blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>He was an elder of the Wanlei Sect, in the late stage of the Refining True Realm, a True King Sovereign, and his strength was renowned throughout the Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Bridge was severed, he had led the Wanlei Sect and the warriors of the Tianwu Gate to come to the aid of the Spiritual Realm, only to be ambushed.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the encirclement and encountering the attack in Linguan City, the city had now been blood-sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>Although the powerful lightning had a certain suppressing effect on the blood calamity power, facing three opponents, Cheng Zhan was at a disadvantage, and he was also exhausted from the battles along the way.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light shot out from the ravine, indicating that the Divine Bridge had opened, and someone was crossing it to the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge? Let's see who dares to come to the Spiritual Realm. Could it be a genius?"</p><p></p><p>A blood shadow let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, and the blood-sacrificing blood shadows in Linguan City had gathered towards the ravine's exit, waiting for the newcomers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The flying ship finally crossed the Divine Bridge and arrived in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is much more abundant, and the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms seem to be very active," Xu Yan exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this was the Divine Realm, the place of the strongest cultivators. At this moment, he had the same feeling as when he first stepped into the Spiritual Realm from the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others also followed closely behind the flying ship, arriving in the Divine Realm, and they were all excited, especially Wu Tiannan, who felt that he could break through at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship headed towards a massive ravine, and as soon as it entered the ravine, even before truly entering the Divine Realm, they sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>The aura of blood calamity was permeating the area, and the rumbling of battle could also be heard.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is truly in chaos!" Fang Hao sighed.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there had been no powerful cultivators coming to the aid of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the ravine's exit, the blood shadows were waiting in droves, hundreds of them, like predators waiting for their prey.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators behind the flying ship, including Wu Tiannan, felt their hearts sink. Their strength was still weak, and they did not know the fate of their own sect in the Divine Realm. Could it be that upon entering the Divine Realm, they would become wandering cultivators?</p><p></p><p>"They are the blood servants of the Minghui... No, they are not quite the same as blood servants!" Xu Yan frowned as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Their cultivation technique is also based on blood, just like the blood servants," Li Xuan's brow slightly creased. </p><p></p><p>In front of them, the fierce battle was raging, and the city below, which had already become a city of the dead, was permeated with a faint blood aura - it had been blood-sacrificed! Although Li Xuan had heard about blood sacrifice in the Spiritual Realm, he had never witnessed it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>But now, a blood-sacrificed city stood before him, and even though Li Xuan considered himself a superior being, unshakable in his heart, a surge of anger rose within him.</p><p></p><p>This city had once been bustling with people - young and old, children, even newborn infants. But now, all of them had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>These city dwellers had been sacrificed and become the nourishment for someone's cultivation. In his two lifetimes as a human, Li Xuan had never seen such a tragic scene.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them all," he said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and the others were momentarily stunned, as this was the first time their master had openly ordered them to kill.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not question the reason. Since their master had spoken, they would obey.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan took the lead, raising his hand and unleashing the True Dragon Fury. Meng Chong transformed into an eighteen-meter-tall giant, the Great Sun Divine Extinction floating above him, and the wind and thunder raged.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao tapped his armory, and the Heavenly and Earthly Odd Gates, formations, and myriad divine weapons unfurled, as he charged forward.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling held an iron shovel, the blue flames burning fiercely, and she also joined the attack.</p><p></p><p>Since their master had spoken, even though she disliked fighting, she had to act, for she could not disappoint her master.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Crimson Cat was the most eager, finally able to serve its master. It let out a roar and transformed into a mountain-sized giant tiger, pouncing forward.</p><p></p><p>Howl! Jade Little Dragon and Xiao Ha also joined the attack. They had just barely cultivated their own great demonic techniques, and although their strength was not as formidable as the Crimson Cat's, they were still capable of dealing with the blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood shadow of the Condensed Dharma Realm can indeed be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Behind the flying boat, Wu Tiannan and the others now had an expression of shock on their faces, looking at the great battle in front of them, as well as the numerous blood shadows blocking the exit of the ravine, a deep sense of powerlessness welled up.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, they deeply realized their own weakness.</p><p></p><p>What calamity had befallen the Divine Realm? Cheng Zhan roared continuously, wanting to break through the encirclement, but was unable to do so, and was instead beaten back and forth, facing grave dangers.</p><p></p><p>The rest of them were also heavily wounded, and it seemed they would not be able to hold on much longer, while reinforcements seemed to have no hope.</p><p></p><p>While fighting, they were also distracted by keeping an eye on the ravine entrance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens, with a terrifying might that changed the clouds and winds. A golden giant dragon, containing a horrifying dragon aura, its eyes filled with boundless fury.</p><p></p><p>It charged towards the blood shadows! In that instant, including Cheng Zhan and the blood shadows, all were struck with shock, and the battle paused! "A true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the reopening of the Divine Bridge was this true dragon continuing the broken Divine Bridge, stepping from the Spirit Realm into the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of blood shadows blocking the ravine entrance were also greatly alarmed, their forms shaking as they were about to flee!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon was ferocious beyond measure, charging into the blood shadows, in an instant tearing apart and annihilating several blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>Although the hundreds of blood shadows were mostly at the Condensed Dharma Saint realm, more than half of them were still slightly weaker than the Condensed Dharma Saint, and were utterly unable to withstand Xu Yan's furious true dragon strike! "It's not a true dragon, but some kind of martial art technique?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan realized at this moment that the golden giant dragon was not a true dragon, but a dragon-form martial art technique, yet its savagery, power, and nearness to a true dragon was something he had never heard of before!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he saw a young man, with sword wheels circling endlessly, unleash a black sword beam that thunderously slashed towards the blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>Before he could be amazed at this youth's strength, he saw a golden glowing giant, with a sun-like radiance on its head, charge out from the ravine, and with a single punch, directly shattered a blood shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Who are these people?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the other Divine Realm True King Saints were all dumbfounded, when did the Spirit Realm become so strong? This was not right!</p><p></p><p>The last time they brought Spirit Realm geniuses to the Divine Realm, it hadn't been that long ago, and the Spirit Realm didn't have any abnormalities then, nor did it possess such powerful cultivators and unimaginable martial arts.</p><p></p><p>So, in just a short time, the Spirit Realm had produced prodigies?</p><p></p><p>Hum! Then he saw a man walk out, carrying a weapon case on his back, with endless weapons flying out from it, sweeping towards the blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he stepped out, and arcane formations seemed to have already been set up, with wind, fire, thunder, and lightning constantly descending.</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial art was that? In the ravine, a beautiful young lady also emerged, wielding an iron shovel, with blue flames burning, forming a giant cauldron, as if wanting to refine everything.</p><p></p><p>Faintly in the void, there seemed to be starlight following her movements, and even more terrifying was that with a wave of her hand, a blue glow enveloped, seemingly reversing life and death, the vitality of a blood shadow actually withering!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was so shocked that he even forgot he was being surrounded, staring blankly at the four young men and women from the ravine, displaying unbelievable martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't end there, with a tiger roar, a fierce wind suddenly arose, sweeping out from the ravine, a spotted giant tiger the size of a small mountain, pouncing out, standing upright in the air, and drawing a massive blade...</p><p></p><p>Following the spotted giant tiger was a jade-white river dragon, and a toad the size of a small mountain...</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan rubbed his eyes, with an expression of shock, subconsciously looking towards an equally dumbfounded blood shadow, and asked in amazement, "That toad, is it the Swallow Mountain Toad?"</p><p></p><p>Fuck! When did the Swallow Mountain Toad become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Spirit Realm, even the Swallow Mountain Toad of the Divine Realm was at most at the Refining Spirit Realm, and even then only in the early stage, yet this Swallow Mountain Toad, with strength comparable to a Condensed Dharma Saint, actually possessed remarkable abilities, almost like a martial art technique.</p><p></p><p>It opened its mouth, spitting out a black vortex, instantly shredding a blood shadow, and even more astonishingly, its two claws each held a trident, wielding them with great power.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like it's the Swallow Mountain Toad!"</p><p></p><p>The blood shadow also replied dazedly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately his eyes turned cold, what was he spacing out for, killing was the priority!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly slashed a sword towards Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan braced for the impact, once again falling into the encirclement and peril.</p><p></p><p>"Go kill them!"</p><p></p><p>A blood shadow coldly commanded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>One of the blood shadows surrounding Cheng Zhan immediately withdrew his blade, preparing to go slay the battling Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan panicked at this!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the four young men and women, or the spotted giant tiger, dragon, and Swallow Mountain Toad, while their strength was not weak, they were definitely no match for True King Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, quickly flee, don't worry about them, go to Wanlei Sect for reinforcements, the Spirit Pass City has been blood sacrificed by the Blood Shadow Tower, let my Azure Flower Realm cultivators go avenge the Blood Shadow Tower!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan coughed up blood while trying to hold back that blood shadow.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had unleashed all his divine abilities, massacring the blood shadows one after another. These blood shadows were at most at the Condensed Dharma Saint realm, and to him, with a casual wave, he could slay them.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he had some realizations.</p><p></p><p>"My master once said that for one to sweep away countless of the same realm is nothing extraordinary, and now I have this feeling, ordinary Condensed Dharma Saints, I alone can push back dozens of them.</p><p></p><p>"My master sweeping away countless of the same realm, what an unparalleled might!"</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more he marveled, his master was an insurmountable mountain.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he was very strong in the same realm, but thinking of his master, there was a sense of being unreachable, as if no matter how hard he tried, he could never reach even half of his master's strength in the same realm!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, hearing Cheng Zhan's call, he looked up, seeing the fierce battle in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Those blood shadows were not much weaker than the Seventh Bloodline Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit surged, the Seventh Bloodline Disciple could not be dealt with by him, and any of the blood shadows above him also could not deal with him, as long as he was not surrounded!</p><p></p><p>"My opponents have never been those of the same realm, but those I fight against adversity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure moved, instantly breaking out from the blood shadows, rushing towards the battlefield in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you block one!"</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword Wheel circled, with a raise of his hand, the Heavenly Sword instantly slashed out, towards one of the blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>When did the young people of the Spirit Realm become so courageous?</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, listen to me..."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was anxious.</p><p></p><p>This youth was so reckless, didn't he see that the opponent's strength was greater? But before he could finish speaking, the sword had already slashed towards a blood shadow, and with a heavenly and earthly phenomenon, it instantly enveloped the blood shadow, separating it from the battlefield to another side.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

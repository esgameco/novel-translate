        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was in chaos, with sounds of fighting, screams, and roars of warriors everywhere in the Qinghua Territory.</p><p></p><p>City after city turned into dead cities.</p><p></p><p>At the starting point of the Divine Bridge, in Lingguan City, fierce battles were raging that shook the heavens. Several powerful figures were engaged in combat with over a dozen blood-colored shadows in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Bloody light illuminated the sky, and within it, thunder rumbled. But even the mightiest lightning was being suppressed by the bloody glow, seemingly unable to hold out much longer.</p><p></p><p>Below, in Lingguan City, a massacre was unfolding.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of blood-colored shadows were reaping lives, rendering the resistance of warriors futile.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Blood energy permeated Lingguan City as the blood of warriors converged, forming rolling waves of blood essence.</p><p></p><p>Crimson long swords slaughtered throughout the city, slitting throat after throat. The fresh blood, as if drawn by some force, did not spill onto the ground but transformed into blood energy, converging towards the city center.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the city, inside what was once the governor's mansion, a blood pool bubbled, emitting blood energy with blood essence swirling around it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"You beasts of the Blood Shadow Tower, you deserve to die! You bastards from the Netherworld, this grudge will be avenged!"</p><p></p><p>Grief-stricken roars echoed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>As the throat of the last person in the city was slit, their blood transformed into blood energy and converged into the blood pool in the governor's mansion. Lingguan City became a dead city! The blood pool bubbled with blood energy, as if boiling, seemingly brewing the blood. The blood in the pool continuously condensed and receded.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it turned into a dark red blood gel, emanating a faint bloody smell mixed with an unknown fragrant aroma.</p><p></p><p>Several blood shadows appeared by the blood pool, their eyes revealing excitement and greed, as if they had seen the world's finest delicacy.</p><p></p><p>They took out crimson small knives and began dividing the dark red blood gel, storing it in boxes.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, outside Lingguan City, that towering canyon trembled, and a beam of rainbow light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge has opened, how is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, a red-bearded man wielding twin hammers crackling with lightning, fighting alone against three blood shadows, wore an expression of shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had collapsed, cutting off contact with the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>According to estimates, the Spirit Realm had likely fallen and turned into a living hell.</p><p></p><p>Even if an Immortal Venerable intervened, they could only descend to the Spirit Realm but couldn't reconnect the broken Divine Bridge. They could only wait for the Divine Bridge to repair itself.</p><p></p><p>But it had been such a short time, far from when the Divine Bridge was expected to self-repair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cheng Zhan's heart sank. Could it be that the powerful enemies from the Netherworld had a way to repair the Divine Bridge and then invade from the Spirit Realm to the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>If so, the Qinghua Territory was in grave danger!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan roared, violent lightning enveloping his body. His pair of lightning hammers summoned fierce thunderbolts, striking at the three blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>He was an elder of the Ten Thousand Lightning Sect, at the late stage of Refining Truth Realm, a True King Venerable. His strength was renowned throughout the entire Qinghua Territory.</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Bridge collapsed, he led the experts from the Ten Thousand Lightning Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate to provide support, intending to rescue the Spirit Realm, but they were intercepted.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the encirclement, they encountered an ambush at Lingguan City, which had now been blood sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>Although the intense lightning had some suppressive effect on the blood essence power, fighting one against three, Cheng Zhan was at a disadvantage. Moreover, after fighting all the way here, he was greatly exhausted and could barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Rainbow light shone through from the canyon, confirming that the Divine Bridge had opened and someone was crossing it!</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge? Let's see who comes from the Spirit Realm. Could it be a prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>A blood shadow let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, while the blood shadows who had sacrificed Lingguan City gathered towards the canyon exit, waiting for the newcomers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The flying ship finally crossed the Divine Bridge and arrived in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is much denser, and the world's spiritual mechanisms seem very active," Xu Yan remarked in admiration.</p><p></p><p>As expected of the Divine Realm, a place with stronger cultivators. He felt the same sensation he had when first entering the Spirit Realm from the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others followed closely behind the flying ship into the Divine Realm, all excited, especially Wu Tiannan, who felt he could break through at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship flew towards a huge canyon. Just as they entered the canyon, before truly entering the Divine Realm's territory, they sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Blood essence energy permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>And the rumble of battle could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm has truly fallen into chaos!" Fang Hao sighed.</p><p></p><p>No wonder no powerful experts had come to rescue the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the canyon exit, blood shadows were everywhere. Hundreds of blood shadows were waiting, like predators anticipating their prey.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others behind the flying ship felt their hearts sink. Their strength was still weak, and with the Divine Realm in chaos, the fate of their sects was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Would they become wandering cultivators as soon as they entered the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Those are Netherworld blood slaves... no, they're different from blood slaves, somewhat unlike them!" Xu Yan said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"The blood cultivation technique they practice is no different from blood slaves," Li Xuan frowned slightly. Upon entering the Divine Realm, this was the scene they encountered.</p><p></p><p>Battles raged ahead, while the city below was completely empty, permeated with a faint blood energy. It had become a dead city!</p><p></p><p>Blood sacrifice! An entire city had been sacrificed. Although they had heard of blood sacrifices in the Spirit Realm, it was only hearsay, never witnessed firsthand.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing a blood-sacrificed city before his eyes, even Li Xuan, who considered himself above worldly matters and whose mindset couldn't be shaken by anything, felt a trace of anger rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This city must have been bustling and prosperous not long ago, filled with young men and women, children, even newborn infants. But all of this had vanished.</p><p></p><p>The people in this city had all been sacrificed, becoming nourishment for others' cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Having lived two lives, this was the first time Li Xuan had seen such a tragic scene. His eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them all," he said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were startled. This was the first time their master had ordered them to kill.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't question why. If Master said to kill, then kill they would!</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan took the lead, striking out with a palm. Divine ability: Dragon's Fury!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong directly transformed into an 18-zhang tall giant, with the Great Sun Divine Annihilation hovering above, wind and thunder raging as he charged forward.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao tapped his weapon box, and Heaven and Earth Wondrous Gates, great formations, and myriad weapons spread out as he attacked.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling, holding her iron shovel, with green flames burning fiercely, also joined the attack.</p><p></p><p>Master had spoken, so even though she disliked fighting, she had to act. She couldn't disappoint Master.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The red cat was even more eager, finally able to serve its master.</p><p></p><p>It roared, transforming into a tiger as large as a small mountain, and pounced forward.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha also joined the attack.</p><p></p><p>They had just barely cultivated their own great beast divine abilities. Though not as strong as the red cat, let alone Xu Yan and the others, they could still handle one</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadows at the Condensed Law realm could still manage it.</p><p></p><p>Behind the flying ship, Wu Tiannan and the others now had shocked expressions as they watched the great battle ahead and the crowd of Blood Shadows blocking the canyon exit. A deep sense of powerlessness welled up within them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they acutely realized their own weakness. </p><p></p><p>What exactly had happened in the Divine Realm? Cheng Zhan roared angrily again and again, wanting to break out of the encirclement, but was never able to do so. Instead, he was beaten back and forth, in constant danger.</p><p></p><p>The rest were even more battered and wounded, looking like they could barely hold on, while reinforcements seemed hopeless.</p><p></p><p>They fought while also keeping an eye on the canyon entrance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar that shook heaven and earth rang out. A terrifying aura surged, changing the wind and clouds. A golden giant dragon, containing a fearsome dragon might, its eyes filled with endless fury.</p><p></p><p>It smashed towards the crowd of Blood Shadows! In that instant, including Cheng Zhan and the Blood Shadows, all revealed shocked expressions, and the battle momentarily paused.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon?" Cheng Zhan exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the reopening of the Divine Bridge was this true dragon reconnecting the broken Divine Bridge, crossing from the Spirit Realm into the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of Blood Shadows blocking the canyon entrance were even more shocked, their forms wavering as they were about to flee!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon was extremely violent, killing into the Blood Shadows. In an instant, it tore apart several Blood Shadows, blasting them to death on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Although many of the hundreds of Blood Shadows had the strength of Condensed Law Celestial Venerable realm, over half of them were still a bit short of that level, and simply couldn't resist Xu Yan's attack of True Dragon Fury!</p><p></p><p>"It's not a true dragon, but some kind of martial art technique?" Cheng Zhan realized at this moment that the golden giant dragon was not a true dragon, but some kind of dragon-shaped martial art. However, this level of violence, this level of power, this martial art technique that was almost indistinguishable from a true dragon - he had never heard of such a thing!</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw a young man, surrounded by revolving sword wheels, endlessly generating power. A black sword light slashed out violently, killing towards the crowd of Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>Before he had time to be shocked by this youth's strength, he saw a golden shining giant, with a sun-like orb above its head, charge out from the canyon. With one punch, it instantly blasted a Blood Shadow to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Who... are these people?" Cheng Zhan and the other Divine Realm True King Celestial Venerables were all dumbfounded. When did the Spirit Realm become so strong? This wasn't right!</p><p></p><p>It hadn't been that long since the last time Spirit Realm geniuses were brought to the Divine Realm. At that time, the Spirit Realm showed no abnormalities, and there were no such powerful martial artists, let alone such unimaginably powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>So, in just a short time, had the Spirit Realm produced such freakish talents?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Then, they saw another man walk out carrying a weapon box on his back. Weapon after weapon flew out of the box, seemingly endless, sweeping towards the crowd of Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his feet stepped out, laying down mysterious formations. Then wind, fire, thunder and lightning continuously descended - what kind of martial art was that?</p><p></p><p>From the canyon floated out a beautiful young woman, wielding an iron shovel in her hand. Green flames ignited, forming into a giant furnace, as if to refine everything.</p><p></p><p>In the void, starlight seemed to move with her. Even more terrifying, when the girl waved her hand, green light spread out, as if reversing life and death. A Blood Shadow's life force actually began to wither!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was so shocked he forgot he was being surrounded and killed. He stared blankly at Xu Yan and the other three who had walked out of the canyon, displaying inconceivable martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't over yet. With a tiger's roar, fierce winds suddenly arose, sweeping out from inside the canyon. A striped tiger as big as a small mountain pounced out, rearing up on its hind legs in mid-air and drawing out a giant blade...</p><p></p><p>Behind the striped giant tiger was a jade-white flood dragon, and a toad as big as a small mountain...</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan rubbed his eyes, a look of shock on his face. He unconsciously looked towards an equally dumbfounded Blood Shadow and asked in astonishment: "Is that toad a Mountain Swallowing Toad?"</p><p></p><p>Damn! Since when did Mountain Swallowing Toads become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Forget about the Spirit Realm, even in the Divine Realm, Mountain Swallowing Toads at most reached the Refining Divinity realm, and even then only early stage. Even so, a Mountain Swallowing Toad of that level was already considered extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>But the Mountain Swallowing Toad before their eyes not only had strength comparable to a Condensed Law Celestial Venerable, it even possessed extraordinary abilities comparable to martial art techniques.</p><p></p><p>It opened its mouth and spat out a black vortex, instantly shredding a Blood Shadow. Even more exaggerated, this Mountain Swallowing Toad held a fork in each of its front claws, and wielded them with considerable power.</p><p></p><p>"It does seem to be a Mountain Swallowing Toad!" That Blood Shadow replied blankly.</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes turned cold - what was he spacing out for, killing was the urgent matter!</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!" He hurriedly slashed his blade towards Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan barely managed to block, and in an instant fell back into being surrounded and attacked, in constant danger.</p><p></p><p>"Go kill them!" A Blood Shadow coldly ordered.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!" One of the Blood Shadows surrounding Cheng Zhan immediately withdrew his blade and retreated, preparing to go kill Xu Yan and the others who were battling the crowd of Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan became anxious when he saw this!</p><p></p><p>No matter if it was those four young men and women, or the striped giant tiger, flood dragon and Mountain Swallowing Toad, although their strength was not weak, they were absolutely no match for a True King Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Young friends, quickly flee! Don't worry about us, go to the Myriad Thunder Sect for help! Blood Shadow Tower has blood sacrificed Ling Gate City. Tell the martial artists of our Qinghua Border to seek revenge against Blood Shadow Tower!" Cheng Zhan shouted while coughing blood, still trying to hold back that Blood Shadow despite his injuries.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was using all his divine abilities, one-sidedly slaughtering the Blood Shadows. These Blood Shadows were at most Condensed Law Celestial Venerable realm. For him, he could kill them with a wave of his hand, fully displaying the might of his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>"Master once said that for one person to easily defeat thousands at the same level was a common occurrence. Now I have that feeling. I alone can easily defeat over ten ordinary Condensed Law Celestial Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"When Master easily defeated tens of thousands at the same level, what an impressive sight that must have been!"</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more he marveled. Master was an insurmountable mountain.</p><p></p><p>He had thought himself very strong at the same level, but when he thought of Master, he had a feeling of being far out of reach. It seemed that no matter how hard he tried, he could not reach even 50% of Master's strength at the same level!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he heard Cheng Zhan's shout and looked up to see the fierce battle in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Those Blood Shadows were not much weaker than Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's emotions surged. Blood Disciple 726 could not defeat him, and neither could any of the Blood Shadows above. As long as he was not surrounded, it would be fine!</p><p></p><p>"My opponents have never been those at the same level, but those above me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's form moved, instantly breaking out from the crowd of Blood Shadows and charging straight towards the battlefield in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you hold off one of them!" The Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword revolved around him. With a raise of his hand, the Heaven Severing Sword instantly slashed out, killing towards one of the Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>When did the young people of the Spirit Realm become so brave and fierce?</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, listen to me..." Cheng Zhan became anxious.</p><p></p><p>How could this youth be so reckless? Couldn't he see that the opponent's strength was much greater?</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish speaking, that sword strike had already slashed towards a Blood Shadow. Mountains and rivers appeared, instantly enveloping the Blood Shadow and removing him from the battlefield to another location.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

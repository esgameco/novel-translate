        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cui'er came in.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, if we go to the Spirit Realm, won't we not see Young Master Xu anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying turned back and looked at her, softly saying, "That won't happen."</p><p></p><p>"Then Miss, when will you be able to be with Young Master Xu?"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er's face was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Her jade-like face blushed slightly, thinking that if the Miss and Young Master Xu were together, she could become a maid.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed deeply and said, "I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>She was thinking whether she should go to Canglang Island to deepen her relationship with Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Spirit Realm, Yuzhou, Mangshan.</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed with lightning-like speed, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And after this figure, another figure also flew out from Mangshan, its speed not slow either, its spiritual power aura completely uncovered, intimidating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Refiner Celestial!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, "Things are unpredictable. I killed Dai Yingying, but the black pot was taken by Wen Yong. The Dai family didn't find the real culprit, me."</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that he would still end up entangled with the Dai family!</p><p></p><p>No, it was the Dai family that got involved with him.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the earth spiritual dragon qi, accumulating enough foundation, Xu Yan smoothly broke through the Spirit Sense Realm, and even elevated and transformed into a Mountain-River Spiritual Bone, with a huge leap in his strength.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Spirit Sense Realm, he just started on the path of the Dao of the Celestials.</p><p></p><p>The power of a Refiner Celestial lies in its spiritual soul, and under the coverage of the spiritual soul power, even the smallest insects are within its grasp.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sense of a Refiner Celestial is like the power of its spiritual soul. Under the Spirit Sense, everything is clear, and even the smallest insects are fully understood.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Earth Spiritual Jade Essence location, there was an earth spiritual dragon qi, but Yulong was not sure if it was the one he had discovered before.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after breaking through the Spirit Sense Realm and consolidating his realm, Xu Yan collected the remaining Earth Spiritual Jade Essence, intending to go and find the earth spiritual dragon qi that Yulong had discovered.</p><p></p><p>If there was another earth spiritual dragon qi, collecting it and bringing it back to the Inner Realm, it would be enough for Mengchong and Suling Xiu to accumulate a foundation and complete their transformations after breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>As for the pursuit by the Yuling Sect and the Su Clan, Xu Yan was completely unconcerned. With his enhanced strength after breaking through the Spirit Sense Realm, even if they were Great Celestial Realm cultivators, he could still kill them. Even if they were Refiner Celestials, he could still clash with them, and even if he couldn't defeat them, he could easily escape.</p><p></p><p>While wandering in Mangshan, following Yulong's guidance to search for the earth spiritual dragon qi, he didn't find it, but instead encountered a Great Celestial Realm elder from the Dai Clan.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Dai Yingying's death, with Wen Yong taking the blame, when Xu Yan encountered the other party, he didn't mind, as they didn't know he was the real culprit.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dai Clan elder, upon discovering that Xu Yan was the one being pursued by the Yuling Sect and the Su Clan, immediately hatched a plan to capture Xu Yan and hand him over to these two major powers, in exchange for their help in capturing the fugitive Wen Yong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but sigh, "It seems I am destined to be an enemy of the Dai Clan."</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was so overbearing, wanting to capture him for the Yuling Sect and the Su Clan, Xu Yan wouldn't be polite either. He had just broken through the Spirit Sense Realm, so he could use the Dai Clan Great Celestial to test the power of his Spirit Sense.</p><p></p><p>He immediately unleashed a sword strike, enveloping the mountains and rivers, the Xunfeng Sword Intent sweeping towards the other's spiritual consciousness like a raging wind.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Spirit Sense Realm, Xu Yan's sword intent had also undergone a transformation, becoming even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Dai Clan elder's expression was horrified, feeling as if his consciousness was instantly clouded, like being pressed down by a great mountain, experiencing a sense of an irresistible Heavenly Will.</p><p></p><p>He roared in anger, unleashing his Great Celestial Realm power to resist that feeling like a great mountain, the Heavenly Will. But then he also felt a fierce gale sweeping through his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A tearing sensation came, his consciousness in excruciating pain, as if he had lost consciousness in an instant, and his physical body also lost control. When he regained a bit of clarity, the sword light had already engulfed him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slew the Dai Clan's Great Celestial Realm cultivator with a single sword strike, also gaining a clearer understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>His Spirit Sense could suppress Lesser Celestials, but could not completely subdue Great Celestials, though it could suppress their spiritual consciousness, preventing them from fully unleashing their strength.</p><p></p><p>Based on this, he judged that his current Spirit Sense was a bit weaker than the spiritual soul power of Refiner Celestials, and he might not be able to completely resist the spiritual soul power of a Refiner Celestial.</p><p></p><p>However, if he unleashed the Xunfeng Sword Intent, he could still collide with the spiritual soul power of a Refiner Celestial.</p><p></p><p>But the power of Refiner Celestials did not rely solely on their spiritual soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Below Refiner Celestials, I am invincible!" Xu Yan exhaled, having a clear understanding of his strength in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect in the Spirit Realm are doing? Within the same realm, I'm confident I can subdue them. But if they are one realm higher than me, can I still defeat the geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had the idea of clashing with the geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Transcendent Spirit Sect was lofty and high, and their geniuses even more so. They might not even come to the Yuzhou region.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Dai Clan's Great Celestial, Xu Yan continued to search for the earth spiritual dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>However, he encountered another Dai Clan Great Celestial. And this one was Dai Yingying's father, the current Dai Clan patriarch, Dai Yiping! A late-stage Great Celestial Realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>When Dai Yiping struck, Xu Yan knew that the Dai Clan was well-versed in the art of taking lives.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, then he would oblige them!</p><p></p><p>So, he killed Dai Yiping.</p><p></p><p>Although Dai Yiping's strength was much greater than the previous elder, Xu Yan only needed three to five sword strikes to completely annihilate him, leaving not even ashes behind.</p><p></p><p>After killing Dai Yiping, he actually encountered an elder from the Yuling Sect and a clan elder from the Su Clan, both coming to capture him. Naturally, he killed them all.</p><p></p><p>The end result was that the Refiner Celestial of the Dai Clan, Dai Sheng, upon learning of his son's death, went mad with rage. And the news of Xu Yan killing Dai Yiping was quickly exposed.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Refiner Celestial, Xu Yan was not the least bit afraid. He clashed with the other party a few times, but found that he was no match, so he immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng, crazed like a madman, continued to pursue him.</p><p></p><p>Yulong, coiled around Xu Yan's wrist, was now somewhat regretful. Why did he decide to follow Xu Yan? It's only been a short while, and he's already being targeted by a Refiner Celestial!</p><p></p><p>"There's a city over there, go hide in the city."</p><p></p><p>Yulong hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Xu Yan's concealment and evasion techniques were profound, and even a Refiner Celestial would have difficulty searching for him if he hid in the city.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "I, Xu Yan, have never been hunted down since entering the martial dao world. Dai Sheng, I'll kill you sooner or later!"</p><p></p><p>Glancing back at the pursuing Dai Sheng, Xu Yan completely disregarded the rule of no flying in the city, directly entering the city at an extremely fast speed. The Great Celestial guarding the city hadn't even reacted yet when Xu Yan had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A vast spiritual aura descended!</p><p></p><p>The various cultivators in the city instantly felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p></p><p>They immediately looked up in alarm.</p><p></p><p>A Refiner Celestial!</p><p></p><p>There was actually a Refiner Celestial descending, causing their faces to tighten, not daring to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>The city lord's face changed drastically, and he mustered the courage to come out.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, esteemed senior. May I ask what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's eyes were bloodshot, his killing intent palpable, as his spiritual soul power continuously searched, but he could not find any trace of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I am Dai Sheng, and I have come to kill!"</p><p></p><p>The city lord's heart trembled. Dai Sheng, the Refiner Celestial of the Dai Clan?</p><p></p><p>Although the Dai Clan was only a second-rate power, Dai Sheng was a Refiner Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As a top-tier existence, even if he was the city lord of a first-class aristocratic family, he still had to be careful in dealing with it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which senior Dai wants to kill?" The city lord thought about the figure that had just entered the city.</p><p></p><p>The other party was too fast, flashing and disappearing into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The celestial warriors in the city guard couldn't even react in time.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng circled the city wall, carefully searching with his divine soul power, but he couldn't find a trace of Xu Yan, and his gaze grew colder and colder.</p><p></p><p>His most beloved granddaughter, Dai Yingying, who had the hope of leading the Dai family to greater heights, was actually killed, and his son had also died. At this moment, Dai Sheng's heart was filled with the intent to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone in the city, come out one by one, clear the city, and if anyone disobeys, they will be killed without mercy!" </p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng spoke in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul pressure shook the surroundings, and all the warriors in the city turned pale with fear.</p><p></p><p>The city lord's expression changed repeatedly. He could see that Dai Sheng was about to go mad with anger, and if he didn't obey, he might be killed in a fit of rage.</p><p></p><p>He was not a core member of the aristocratic family, while Dai Sheng was a Refiner Celestial. After compensating a bit, this matter could be swept under the rug.</p><p></p><p>The forces behind him would not fight a Refiner Celestial for the sake of a minor city lord like him.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, leave the city in order!"</p><p></p><p>The city lord immediately issued the order.</p><p></p><p>The warriors in the city had long wanted to flee, that terrifying pressure almost made them unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of the city guards, they fled the city one by one.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's divine soul power covered the city gate, and every departing warrior could not escape his search.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had changed his clothes and his aura, simulating the aura of a Spiritual Realm warrior. At the moment, he frowned slightly. If he changed his appearance with true essence, it might be difficult to hide from Dai Sheng's search at such close range.</p><p></p><p>But if he didn't change his appearance and blended into the crowd, he was not sure if he could hide from Dai Sheng.</p><p></p><p>If he was discovered, he could only rely on his speed to flee.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?" Jade Little Dragon had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, at worst I'll just flee directly. With my speed, he won't be able to catch up." Xu Yan was calm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd, and a chubby young man, leading a few attendants, arrogantly pushed aside the warriors and strode towards the city gate.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of the way! Don't block the path of Young Master!" Shen Haizhou cursed as he pushed the warriors aside, causing chaos.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes narrowed slightly as he silently blended into the crowd around Shen Haizhou.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Shen Haizhou's attendants were wearing clothes similar to Xu Yan's, and some of the accompanying warriors were actually loose cultivators, not his real attendants.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou charged and blustered forward, and the number of attendants following him increased, as well as some warriors who joined the chaotic group.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's gaze fell on them, and his divine soul power fluctuated, seemingly about to erupt in rage.</p><p></p><p>But Shen Haizhou was unafraid, puffing out his chest to reveal the embroidered pattern on his clothes, and shouting, "My father is Shen Wang, Senior Dai, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's face turned black!</p><p></p><p>"Quickly get out of here, or else don't blame the old man for teaching you a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou casually grabbed his attendants and threw them out, as if venting, "Didn't you hear Senior Dai's words? Quickly get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the attendants were thrown out, and some loose cultivators were also caught up in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Haizhou!" Dai Sheng roared.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou shrank his neck, but then straightened his back and said, "My father is Shen Wang, my ancestor is Shen Tai!"</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Dai Sheng's mentality was somewhat shattered. What the hell was this brat?</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't really do anything to Shen Haizhou. Shen Wang was the Shen family patriarch, a Refiner Celestial, even stronger than him. And Shen Tai was also a Refiner Celestial of the Shen family, and quite protective of his descendants.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou cursed and blustered as he rushed out of the city, grabbing his attendants and throwing them out, "Didn't you hear Senior Dai telling us to leave? Hurry up and get out."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was mixed in with Shen Haizhou's attendants, and he couldn't help but suspect that Shen Haizhou was doing this intentionally to create an opportunity for him to escape the city.</p><p></p><p>A hand suddenly grabbed at him.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it touched Xu Yan's clothes, he was flung out sideways, as if he had been thrown.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou continued cursing as he grabbed and threw one person after another out of the city.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's divine soul power was searching everywhere, even the attendants that Shen Haizhou had thrown out.</p><p></p><p>But when Xu Yan was flung out, his face was facing down, avoiding Dai Sheng's gaze. And the Blend with the Surroundings technique made his aura blend in with the other attendants.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's divine soul power didn't detect anything, and Xu Yan had already escaped the city and fled quickly.</p><p></p><p>After successfully evading Dai Sheng's search, Xu Yan changed his clothes and began to return to the Central Domain.</p><p></p><p>He had already broken through, and had accumulated Earth Spirit Jade Essence and other spiritual items, it was time to go back to the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>But being chased by Dai Sheng made him feel annoyed, this grievance couldn't be tolerated.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he decided to find this little fatty Shen Haizhou and inquire about the location of the Dai family, and while Dai Sheng was not there, destroy the Dai family!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou cursed and left the city, his heart filled with excitement. He had finally reconnected with that brother, this was a true dragon! Sooner or later, he would soar to great heights, unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, we meet again."</p><p>Xu Yan appeared before Shen Haizhou.</p><p></p><p>"My brother, it's been a while!" Shen Haizhou didn't mention the incident in the city.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sword Immortal Xu Yan, I've come to inquire about some matters."</p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever I, Shen Haizhou, know, I will tell you without holding back!"</p><p>Shen Haizhou thumped his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Dai family's main stronghold, and besides Dai Sheng, are there any other Refiner Celestials?"</p><p>Xu Yan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was stunned, was this implying that he wanted to destroy the Dai family's stronghold?</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Fu Yunian and cupped his hands, saying, "Great Monitoring Master, I shall take my leave. I will come visit the Seven Star Academy again when I have the time."</p><p></p><p>This visit to the Seven Star Academy was basically over.</p><p></p><p>As for the Treasure Vault, he would come take a look again if needed in the future.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would go to Canglang Island to receive Yin Hong's legacy, purchase some spiritual herbs, and then return to the Frontier.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Xiaoyou is always welcome to visit," Fu Yunian said with a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white clothes said in a clear voice, "I was fortunate to witness Young Master Xu defeat a Grand Master today. It has been some time since we last met at the Matchless Manor. Shall we catch up?"</p><p></p><p>Her words filled the listeners with renewed vigor.</p><p></p><p>"It's you," Xu Yan said, patting Xie Lingfeng's shoulder. "This is the friend I mentioned. He also needs to temper his mind. Why don't you help him with that?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng swallowed hard and chuckled awkwardly, "Brother Xu, that's not necessary. I've already tempered myself!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in white clothes' gaze was smiling, but Xie Lingfeng felt a chill down his back.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you see, Xie Lingfeng doesn't need it," the woman said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stared at her for a while, feeling a bit wary. Her attitude was different from when he had seen her at the Matchless Manor, becoming more gentle.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was also filled with vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then so be it!" Xu Yan cupped his hands and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the students of the Seven Star Academy seemed to have regained their senses.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, I have some doubts about the Martial Way and hope you can enlighten me."</p><p>"Young Master Xu, my mind has been in turmoil lately, and I don't know if there's a problem with my Martial Cultivation. Could you please help me resolve this?"</p><p></p><p>A group of female students swarmed around him.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng swallowed hard, thinking these women had all gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan had a look of envy on his face.</p><p></p><p>Many male students also had envious eyes that were about to turn red.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, I'll see you at the side hall!" Xu Yan's figure flashed, and he disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After he left, the swarming Seven Star Academy students were all disappointed, and some even blamed Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Sword Sovereign Cliff's first genius is this? It's all just hype!"</p><p>"That's right, he's just relying on the reputation of his father, the Grand Master Xie, to be praised."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was furious when he heard this. "I may not be as good as Xu Yan, but what are you all? Do you have the right to question me?" His expression turned cold as he drew his sword and said, "Today, Xie Lingfeng challenges all Seven Star Academy students under the age of thirty!"</p><p></p><p>He soared into the air, heading towards the Training Platform.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I want to see how capable you Seven Star Academy students are. In my eyes, you are all trash!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan became excited and shouted, "My young master, Xie Lingfeng of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, is challenging all Seven Star Academy students under the age of thirty. In my young master's eyes, you are all trash!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the woman in white clothes were speechless.</p><p></p><p>On the Training Platform, Xie Lingfeng stood with his sword.</p><p></p><p>He didn't originally have these thoughts, but after being so disdained by the Seven Star Academy students, how could he endure it? After all, he was a renowned genius, and his pride and arrogance were high.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan alone broke through nine layers of the Training Platform. If I can't match that, then today I will subdue all the Seven Star Academy students under the age of thirty! These insignificant beings, how dare they mock me!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was furious.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was in an uproar, and all the students were enraged. Such arrogance! Xie Lingfeng directly challenged the entire Seven Star Academy under the age of thirty, equivalent to suppressing his peers.</p><p></p><p>The departing Xu Yan had returned. He approached Hu Shan and asked, "Hu Shan, how about we make a bet on the outcome in the Seven Star Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What kind of bet?" Hu Shan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited, as if he could see the opportunity to earn spirit stones. "Just bet on whether your brother will win or the Seven Star Academy will win!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan immediately understood, and the corner of his mouth twitched as he said, "That doesn't seem right."</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity to make money!" Xu Yan was very confident in Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Hu Shan thought about it for a moment and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would be the one to handle this. If people knew that Xu Yan was betting on Xie Lingfeng, how could he make money?</p><p></p><p>So Hu Shan went to a large rock, placed his sword on it, and shouted loudly, "Today, my young master is challenging the students of the Seven Star Academy. I am confident that my young master can subdue all his peers. Who dares to make a bet with me?"</p><p></p><p>The gathered Seven Star Academy students were all holding back their anger. Xu Yan's arrogance was understandable, as he had the qualifications to be arrogant. But Xie Lingfeng, what right did he have to be arrogant? He was just a hyped-up genius.</p><p></p><p>"How do we bet?" A student immediately came forward.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. If you bet on the Seven Star Academy winning, my sword will belong to the Seven Star Academy, representing my young master's defeat. If my young master wins, all your spirit stones will be mine!" Hu Shan looked at the students present and added, "You're only betting spirit stones, while I'm betting the reputation of the Sword Sovereign Cliff. Don't think I'm taking advantage of you. If you don't have the confidence to bet your spirit stones, you might as well just admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>These words stirred up the Seven Star Academy students.</p><p></p><p>"Bet it is! Let's see what Xie Lingfeng is capable of, challenging our Seven Star Academy!"</p><p>"Haha, we'll take the reputation of your Sword Sovereign Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>The students quickly opened their pouches and placed their bets. They were all betting on the Seven Star Academy winning. A pile of spirit stone pouches had accumulated in front of the large rock, and Xu Yan looked at them excitedly. This was another opportunity to make a big profit.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng on the Training Platform twitched his mouth. He suddenly felt the immense pressure. If he lost, he would not only lose the reputation of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, but also Xu Yan's money pouch!</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and coldly said, "Those below the Grandmaster level need not come up."</p><p></p><p>Boom! A Grandmaster-level aura was unleashed, shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy students were stunned. Xie Lingfeng was a Grandmaster-level cultivator! Considering his age, being a Grandmaster at around twenty years old, there were few in the Inner Realm who could match him. The rumors were not just hype.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!" A Seven Star Academy student soared up and landed on the Training Platform. He was also a Grandmaster-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Please proceed," Xie Lingfeng said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The Grandmaster student raised his hand and struck with a sword.</p><p></p><p>However, a flash of sword light was seen, and his sword was knocked away, with a hole pierced in his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Next!" Xie Lingfeng said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy students were stunned into silence. One sword strike had defeated a Grandmaster! Fu Yunian's expression also became serious. Xie Lingfeng's strength was indeed not as good as Xu Yan's, but it could be said that his strength matched his genius reputation.</p><p></p><p>This battle...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It also concerned the reputation of the younger generation of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Let Ping Dong come, if he loses, then no one under the age of 30 in the Seven Star Academy can match Xie Lingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian paused for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Ding Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The second disciple of the Seven Star Academy master stepped onto the stage. His strength was a bit stronger, but Xie Lingfeng defeated him with two sword strikes! Then the third, the fourth...</p><p></p><p>Not a single one could withstand Xie Lingfeng's three sword strikes! And those Seven Star Academy master disciples who stepped forward were all approaching 30 years old. Both in terms of age and strength, they were far inferior to Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>At this, many Seven Star Academy disciples fell silent.</p><p></p><p>And the impulsive disciples who had put up spirit crystals as bets were now regretting it, looking at the pile of bags on the stone platform, wanting to take them back.</p><p></p><p>However, they were afraid of losing face for the Seven Star Academy, so they could only watch helplessly without daring to go and retrieve their own bags.</p><p></p><p>The most excited one was Xu Yan, who had made a huge profit in spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>The trip to the Seven Star Academy had been fruitful - he had crushed a great master, obtained Canglan Island, and now with this bet, even if each person only had a thousand spirit crystals, they had still accumulated over a hundred thousand spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>A huge profit! "Is there anyone else who wants to come and fight?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stood with his sword, looking down disdainfully at the group of Seven Star Academy disciples.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura came from the Seven Star Academy, and a long saber flew and landed on the arena. Immediately, a man with an expressionless face appeared and grasped the long saber.</p><p></p><p>"Ping Dong, I've come to learn from you!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was around the same age as Xie Lingfeng, both in their twenties, and their cultivation levels were also similar.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression became serious. "So it's Ping Dong."</p><p></p><p>Ping Dong, the top genius of the current Seven Star Academy, was on par with Xie Lingfeng and was known as one of the three youngest great masters in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, you've met a worthy opponent!" Xu Yan said to Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, who do you think will win?"Du Yuying asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it will be Brother Xie!" Xu Yan replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had already refined his true qi, greatly enhancing his strength. His comprehension of the sword dao was also not lacking. While Ping Dong's strength was not weak, he was still a step behind Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Xie Lingfeng had not refined his true qi, his strength would be on par with Ping Dong, and it would be hard to say who would win.</p><p></p><p>"Please." Xie Lingfeng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Ping Dong, being a man of few words, simply nodded. With a flick of his saber, a burst of fierce saber energy surged forth, exuding a sharp killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng waved his treasured sword, unleashing the Myriad River Sword Art, which had been improved from its initial form.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi surged forth, and then he also unleashed the Flying Rainbow Sword! The sword light flashed like lightning, interweaving with the sword qi. For a moment, the two fought fiercely.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the sword qi converged into a vortex, sweeping upwards, and the sword light flashed, as if piercing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The saber light shattered, the saber qi dissipated, and before Ping Dong stood a gleaming sword.</p><p></p><p>"I have lost," Ping Dong said after a moment of silence, letting out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"I'm honored," Xie Lingfeng said with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng, your reputation is well-deserved!" Ping Dong turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Who else wants to come and fight?" Xie Lingfeng stood with his sword, looking down arrogantly at the Seven Star Academy disciples.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Seven Star Academy disciples were deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xie, you have won, there's no need to continue fighting," Fu Yuntian shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>With Ping Dong defeated, there was no one in the younger generation who could match Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan happily bundled up all the bags on the stone platform and carried them in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng came down from the arena and walked together with Xu Yan. Hu Shan, Du Yuying, the woman in plain clothes, and the old woman followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Seven Star Academy, Hu Shan handed the bundle to Xu Yan, saying, "Young Master Xu, here are your things!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't be polite." Xu Yan took it happily.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in Seven Star City, Xu Yan immediately went to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to exchange the spirit tickets for large denominations.</p><p></p><p>"Eight hundred thousand spirit crystals, this money is really hard to earn!" Xu Yan sighed as he came out of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others were speechless.</p><p></p><p>The group arrived at the elegant place Du Yuying had mentioned. </p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, didn't I tell you to book the place?" Du Yuying frowned as she saw a few cultivators sitting and enjoying the spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, those people seem to be of noble status, the shop owner wouldn't let us book the whole place," Cui'er whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, there's no need to spend too much, as long as there are people, it's fine," Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The group sat down in a graceful courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voices of the cultivators nearby reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? Apparently the genius Xie Lingfeng from Sword Saint Cliff is actually bald!"</p><p></p><p>"What? I've never heard that Xie Lingfeng is bald?"</p><p></p><p>"That's because he's wearing a wig!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yuan, how did you find out about this?"</p><p></p><p>"The news is from Yan Kingdom. Xie Lingfeng has killed several great masters, and he has also provoked a powerful enemy. Rumor has it that a great master is chasing after him!"</p><p></p><p>"Whoa! What kind of great master dares to chase after Xie Lingfeng? Aren't they afraid of Sword Saint Cliff and Xie Tianhe?"</p><p></p><p>"That's unknown."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone interjected, "Brother Yuan, your information is outdated. You just returned to Seven Star City, so you don't know that Xie Lingfeng is currently at the Seven Star Academy, and he has already passed the Nine-Level Arena."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? There's actually such an event?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the one being chased by the great master is actually Hu Shan, that bald guy is Hu Shan!"</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan is being chased by a great master? But Hu Shan's father, the great master Hu Hai, used to be Xie Tianhe's disciple. Doesn't he fear Hu Hai?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, maybe it's because of some treasure."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others looked at each other in bewilderment. What kind of rumor is this? Xie Lingfeng tugged at his own hair, his mouth twitching, "When did I become bald?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was also dumbfounded, "That's not right, I'm right here. When was I being chased by a great master? And with my strength, a great master wouldn't even need to chase me, they could just kill me directly. Where would I have the chance to run?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the woman in plain clothes were also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The information from those people was too outdated and too absurd.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan's eyes widened, and he angrily said, "It must be my disciple junior Meng Chong. What kind of nonsense great master is daring to chase my disciple brother!"</p><p></p><p>He stood up furiously.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

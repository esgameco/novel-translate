        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A small matter," Li Xuan said calmly, twirling the jade scepter in his hand, ready to reveal his omniscient demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"The junior disciple's physical constitution is limited by her environment, inherently deficient, and she is now just making up for that deficiency."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke indifferently, as if he had seen through everything.</p><p></p><p>"This breakthrough to the Innate Realm, she was already prepared. Not only can she make up for the deficiency in her constitution, but she can also refine and transform, gaining an even stronger physique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched Suling Xiu, who was now in the final stage of her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Green light swirled around her, and the trees beside her seemed to emanate vitality, entering Suling Xiu's body.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan exclaimed, admiring his master's mastery of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what constitution will my junior sister have after her breakthrough?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>After his own breakthrough, Xu Yan's jade bone had further transformed into spiritual bone, which was extremely powerful. Any warrior who tried to compete with him in consumption would be unable to outlast him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled but did not answer what constitution Suling Xiu had gained, as he had not yet received the feedback from the system. Instead, he said, "My disciple, constitution is not the only thing. Rising from the mundane world, each realm and transformation, with a solid foundation, the transformed constitution will be more stable and unbreakable.</p><p></p><p>"As you continue to refine and transform, when you stand on par with those of innate constitutions, you will be stronger, more indestructible, and more unbreakable than them!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's words were meant to encourage Xu Yan to constantly refine and transform during his future realm breakthroughs, something that others might not be able to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly inspired. "Master is telling me that while there are innate constitutions that are very powerful, I, without an innate constitution, can continuously transform and surpass them. They have reached the limit of their innate constitutions, but I, rising from the mundane, have no boundaries!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood boiled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Xu Yan, knowing that his disciple was once again lost in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Keep contemplating, the more you do, the stronger you will become, the more you can comprehend the supreme martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly excited. He was not afraid of his disciples contemplating, but rather feared that they would not.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's breakthrough had no more obstacles, and she was in the process of refining and transforming. Li Xuan turned and walked back to the manor with a leisurely pace, anticipating what kind of constitution Suling Xiu would have after her transformation, and what it could bring him.</p><p></p><p>He now had the Innate Unbreakable Spiritual Bone and the Dragon Soaring Mountain and River Spiritual Body. If Suling Xiu's transformation could grant him a new constitution, what could he gain?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was confident that even if there were powerful innate constitution wielders, they would still be left behind by Xu Yan, who cultivated the powerful martial dao that Li Xuan had created.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the manor, Li Xuan sat down in a chair, leisurely waiting for the system's feedback on Suling Xiu's transformation.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu felt herself becoming increasingly ethereal, as if she had a natural affinity with plants and flowers. She could even clearly perceive the properties of medicinal herbs, including their age and characteristics, even for herbs she was unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly spiritual energy continuously refined into her innate true qi, which was warm and gentle yet contained a fierce intensity. A faint blue flame of true qi appeared on her palm, the manifestation of the medicinal dao's innate realm.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu swallowed another medicinal pill, and her breakthrough had entered the final stage, her physical transformation complete.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the Medicinal Dao's innate realm," Suling Xiu marveled, her strength rapidly increasing. Even peak sect masters would not be her match, though she was still inferior to Xu Yan and Meng Chong in terms of pure combat power.</p><p></p><p>However, this was still not enough. There were great masters and peak great masters within the Black-Robed Faction, and to deal with them, she needed to reach the Innate Realm Perfection and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with her two senior brothers, she could finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that even if a great master attacked, she could escape, or her senior brothers could handle it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blue radiance burst forth from Suling Xiu, and the plants and trees around her flourished, their leaves becoming even more vibrant.</p><p></p><p>She had broken through to the Innate Realm!</p><p></p><p>Her constitution had also completed its refinement and transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has broken through to the Innate Realm, and your Medicinal Dao has advanced to the Profound Realm," the system's feedback came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has broken through to the Innate Realm and transformed into the Azure Wood Spiritual Body. You have gained the Innate Spiritual Body."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wood Spiritual Body! Suling Xiu's special constitution had transformed into this after her refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Innate Spiritual Body?" Li Xuan contemplated the changes in his body. With the Innate Spiritual Body, he could feel it perfectly harmonizing with his Innate Unbreakable Spiritual Bone. His physical body had become even stronger, and his affinity with the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy had skyrocketed, allowing the spiritual energy to constantly flow into him and instantly transform into his innate true essence.</p><p></p><p>To outsiders, it would seem as if the spiritual energy around him had simply become denser, without any obvious changes.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soaring Mountain and River Spiritual Body had been refined into the Innate Spiritual Body, inheriting all its characteristics and becoming even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again!" Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The true source of happiness was the growth of one's strength.</p><p></p><p>"This junior disciple is impressive, no wonder I took her in as my disciple and even killed a great master for her."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation, eager to see what benefits Suling Xiu's transformation would bring him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The three disciples, each with their own strengths, would bring him rich rewards every time their strength increased.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan was the core of the three disciples.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan breaks through the Tong Xuan realm, if he undergoes another transformation, what kind of feedback will he bring me? Surpassing the Spirit Bone and Spirit Body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. Xu Yan was not too far from the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>He was currently accumulating his foundation and was about to break through the Innate Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had broken through and was in seclusion, while Xu Yan and Meng Chong continued to perfect themselves, accumulate their foundation and trump cards, preparing for their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng felt stimulated.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he might not be able to defeat Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>He dared not be the slightest bit negligent, diligently cultivating, striving to break through to the Great Perfection Sect Master realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>As for Hu Shan, he was even more depressed.</p><p></p><p>When Su Ling Xiu had not broken through, he had sparred with her, but he had not been able to defend against those golden needles and had been pierced several times.</p><p></p><p>Now that Su Ling Xiu had broken through, he might be turned into a hedgehog.</p><p></p><p>"I can't compare with the geniuses, I, Hu Shan, have to compare with the Sect Masters in the Inner Domain. Among those at the same realm, I am quite strong."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought to himself, and suddenly felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was extremely excited, the young miss who originally needed her protection and care, had now far surpassed her in strength.</p><p></p><p>"I also need to break through to the Innate realm as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying also buried herself in arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>She was only one step away from reaching the peak of the Blood Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed with the harvest from her breakthrough in seclusion, finally breaking through to the Innate realm, and her constitution seemed to be somewhat extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what kind of constitution do I have?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu returned and asked happily as she massaged her master's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Green Wood Spirit Body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean I have an extremely talented natural aptitude?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu became even more delighted.</p><p></p><p>"The Green Wood Spirit Body is not that special, don't be complacent, have ambition, and constantly strive to elevate yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu stuck out her tongue coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Innate realm and refining her Green Wood Spirit Body, Su Ling Xiu began her first pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>Her hands burned with the Cinnabar Flame, directly refining pills with her bare hands, the speed was so fast that it exceeded her expectations.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a batch of pills was successfully refined, and the quality was even better than the ones she had refined at the Blood Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she continuously refined various pills, quickly accumulating a pile of pills, including Blood Qi Pill, Essence Gathering Pill, Strengthening Pill, and so on.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Innate realm, Su Ling Xiu became even busier. She needed to prepare for her return to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>She spent more time guiding the pill refinement disciples in the Long Qing Hall, striving to refine pills with spiritual herbs and improve the success rate and quality.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying had reached the peak of the Blood Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was a little depressed, as he had fallen behind a bit.</p><p></p><p>The size of the Red Cat was getting larger and larger, becoming more and more like a fat tiger.</p><p></p><p>However, its aura was still constantly increasing, its physical body becoming more and more powerful, but it still felt far from reaching the threshold of the Great Demon realm.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in the midst of this busy activity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the first batch of assembly line refined Blood Qi Pills came out of the Pill House, the quality was acceptable, and the failure rate was less than 30%.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, at least the failure rate was not high, and the waste of spiritual herbs was not much.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was the refinement of the Essence Gathering Pill, Strengthening Pill, and Healing Pill.</p><p></p><p>These days, the Red Cat had eaten too much and was lying on the ground, not wanting to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the half-bowl of waste pills in front of it, it had a feeling of being utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, hurry up and eat, don't waste it!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu put another handful of waste pills into the bowl, urging it.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat let out a pitiful low roar.</p><p></p><p>It really couldn't eat anymore! Su Ling Xiu frowned, holding a golden needle in her hand, looking for the appropriate acupoint on the Red Cat to help it refine the medicinal power of the waste pills it had consumed.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the golden needle in her hand, it seemed a bit short for the Red Cat's massive body, so she called Shi Er to prepare a golden needle about a foot long.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heard the pitiful howling of the Red Cat outside the manor, and the corner of his mouth twitched slightly. Su Ling Xiu was using the long golden needle to stimulate the Red Cat's acupoints, helping it digest the medicinal power of the waste pills.</p><p></p><p>That bowl of pills needed to be eaten up quickly, or it would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the principle of not wasting even a bit of the hard-earned spiritual herbs, Su Ling Xiu had to lend a hand to help the Red Cat digest the waste pills.</p><p></p><p>After being pricked many times, the Red Cat remembered those acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, Red Cat, you actually finished it so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Su Ling Xiu was pleasantly surprised to find that the Red Cat had quickly finished eating the waste pills, and it even seemed unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stared at the Red Cat for a long time, this fat tiger was likely to truly become a Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng had broken through to the Great Perfection Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>He was very excited and went to spar with Xu Yan in the Sword Dao, although he might not be able to withstand Xu Yan's sword, but honing his sword techniques could still bring him a considerable improvement.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's assembly line pill refinement finally succeeded, the Blood Qi Pill could be refined with a 100% success rate, and the Essence Gathering Pill was also close to a 100% success rate. The daily output was not low.</p><p></p><p>With no shortage of pills, the members of the Long Qing Hall saw a significant increase in their cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>The pills that were not refined from spiritual herbs had already begun to circulate in the Borderlands, causing the cultivation speed of the Borderland cultivators to increase as well.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began to research how to refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow, a rare fifth-grade spiritual herb.</p><p></p><p>Refining the Heavenly Dew Marrow required extreme caution, as a failed attempt would result in a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Fifth-grade spiritual herbs were already rare, let alone the precious Heavenly Dew Marrow.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Innate Perfection, and your true essence has doubled in strength."</p><p></p><p>The golden light flashed, and the Spiritual Feedback came.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the Innate Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited in his heart, Xu Yan was only one step away from the Tong Xuan realm, and once he broke through, he could pass on the higher-level techniques to him.</p><p></p><p>However, after breaking through to the Innate Perfection, Xu Yan did not immediately break through to the Tong Xuan realm, but continued to refine his foundation.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to accumulate his foundation and roots to an extremely powerful level before breaking through to the Tong Xuan realm, so that his strength after the breakthrough would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could feel Xu Yan's growth, as well as some of his changes.</p><p></p><p>"This is to enhance his foundation for the breakthrough to the Tong Xuan realm and the subsequent transformation. "</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Xu Yan did not directly break through to the Tong Xuan realm in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Every realm breakthrough is for the purpose of transcendence and transformation. My words have been deeply remembered by Xu Yan, is it to crush any potential innate constitution cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had such ambition and lofty goals, and Li Xuan was very gratified.</p><p></p><p>However, a delay of one or two years in breaking through to the Tong Xuan realm was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Especially if the breakthrough could lead to a transformation, even if it was delayed by one or two years, it would be worth it! Of course, Xu Yan would most likely only need to accumulate for one or two months before breaking through to the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

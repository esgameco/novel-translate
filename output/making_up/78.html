            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 78 Xu Yan Comprehends the Dao of the Sword, His Sword Heart Becomes Clear</p><p></p><p>In the mountain forest, only Xu Yan remained.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the mountain forest, his gaze sweeping around. Countless sword marks criss-crossed, and there were numerous small holes pierced through the large trees.</p><p></p><p>The neatly severed trees lay on the ground, cut into over a dozen segments.</p><p></p><p>The remnants of the sword techniques and sword moves could be faintly discerned.</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan looked, the more he seemed to have a vague comprehension, as chaotic sword moves surfaced in his mind - they were all the techniques his master had once displayed.</p><p></p><p>But he had forgotten them.</p><p></p><p>No! It's not that he had forgotten, but rather he had forgotten the sequence of the sword moves, forgotten which move was from which previous display.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic sword moves in his mind and the marks around him verified each other. Suddenly, one move overlapped with a sword mark on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This sword mark was left by that move."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"For the sword heart to become clear, the first requirement is for the sword heart to be pure, not constrained by sword moves or sword techniques, and then it will become clear..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he had gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still far from achieving a clear sword heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt as if he had returned to the small village, to the time when he had just begun cultivating the martial dao. Everything was not quite clear, yet he had some comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Forgetting the sword moves, forgetting the sword techniques, not being bound by forms... The first thing I should do is to make my sword heart pure, and that first step is to completely forget the sword techniques my master had displayed.</p><p></p><p>"No! It's not true forgetting, but forgetting the forms, breaking free from the framework of the sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Then, what I need to do next is to retrace the sword marks, reproduce them one by one, and then forget the framework, freely picking up sword moves and techniques, and ultimately forming my own sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first step. Once I complete this step, I should not be far from achieving a clear sword heart!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a sudden enlightenment, understanding how he should cultivate and enter the realm of a clear sword heart.</p><p></p><p>He jumped onto a large tree, sitting on a horizontal branch, looking at the sword marks below, silently overlapping them with the sword moves in his mind, verifying them.</p><p></p><p>"This sword mark covers the previous one, the previous one is almost unrecognizable now, how should I verify it...</p><p></p><p>"Why am I still constrained by sword techniques and moves?</p><p></p><p>"That sword mark, although covered, still has its trace... It should be this move."</p><p></p><p>It was not until nightfall that Xu Yan returned to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>But his mind was filled with sword moves and sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw his disciple return, observing him silently, not saying anything, letting him cultivate on his own.</p><p></p><p>Saying too much would only create interference.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scene of Xu Yan's cultivation in the small village, and now it was just about retracing that process of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that Xu Yan could comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>The sword dao he had created was much more complete and refined than the one he had randomly made up before, and he had even personally demonstrated the sword moves for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"A clear sword heart is the foundation of cultivating the sword dao. The starting point I've set for this sword dao has raised the requirement for talent greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Once one enters the sword dao, the power will naturally be stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>"This is a framework, and in the future, any sword moves or techniques can be fitted into it. When Xu Yan goes to the inner domain, no matter what sword techniques he learns, he can integrate them into this framework, and they will become his own.</p><p></p><p>"And blue can give birth to green, creating new sword techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was silently contemplating.</p><p></p><p>He had passed on the sword dao to Xu Yan, while Meng Chong, a muscular man, had his talent not in the sword dao, but in the dao of the blade!</p><p></p><p>He should also create the related blade dao and pass it on to Meng Chong when the time comes.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan remembered my sword techniques after just one demonstration, showing that his memory is extraordinary, which is also the foundation of a clear sword heart. With this foundation, his comprehension should be much easier."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also sighed inwardly, admiring Xu Yan's exceptional memory.</p><p></p><p>He had demonstrated the techniques at a fairly quick pace.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Xu Yan spent every day cultivating the sword dao, striving to achieve a clear sword heart.</p><p></p><p>He would go to the mountain forest in the morning to contemplate, and only return when it was dark.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, stimulated by the Blood Heartless, had become even more diligent in his cultivation, and the progress of refining his golden bones was accelerating.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had also completed the skin refinement, and his progress was good.</p><p></p><p>There were still no major changes in Qi State.</p><p></p><p>In the capital city, Qi King Guo Rongshan remained the foremost among the ministers.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince visited to pay his respects every day.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince had already gone out to seek out high-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The other ministers' offspring were also enthusiastically seeking out high-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although the sons of the Minister of War had become dried corpses, and the reason was unknown, Xu Yan had not provided any answers, and no one dared to inquire further.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was speculating that they might have encountered unknown demonic creatures, which led to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>When entering the Endless Mountains to explore, they all became more cautious, not daring to venture too deep.</p><p></p><p>The Endless Mountains had countless peaks, and it would take an unknown amount of time to search through them all. Various teams were traversing the mountains, but they consciously avoided the exploration area of the Minister of War's sons.</p><p></p><p>That place was too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>A month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's golden bones were almost complete, about to reach the bottleneck of golden bone refinement, unable to continue.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had completed the skin refinement.</p><p></p><p>With his martial arts at the peak of the jianghu, it had taken him so long to complete the skin refinement, his talent was ultimately inferior to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Xuan discovered that after Shi Er completed the skin refinement, the strength of his skin membrane and his qi and blood were not as strong as Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Skin refinement also has different levels of quality, it's not the same for everyone who completes it."</p><p></p><p>This was the difference in martial arts talent.</p><p></p><p>After completing the skin refinement, Shi Er's strength had increased.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then taught him the bone refinement technique.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Yan, his father had already begun bone refinement, and his mother had just completed skin refinement, which also showed the gap in martial arts talent and the disparity in cultivation gains.</p><p></p><p>Pang the Physician had also entered the bone refinement stage.</p><p></p><p>A small portion of the other trusted guards had entered bone refinement, while some had completed skin refinement.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to Pang the Physician's concoction of nourishing medicinal pills to assist their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for Guo Rongshan, due to his advanced age and declining qi and blood, he had missed the best cultivation period, and could only barely enter skin refinement by relying on precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai's talent was a bit better, he had already completed skin refinement and was about to enter bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>His two cousins, one had completed skin refinement, the other had begun bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>"They are still too far from entering the martial dao, in the short term, it is impossible to verify what kind of feedback they can obtain."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Among these people, some might get stuck at the threshold of entering the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>He noticed that the nourishing qi and blood medicines concocted by Pang the Physician had a very good effect in assisting their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Should I try to refine some medicinal pills? But how do I create medicinal pills? I don't know anything about that."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"That young lady from the Heavenly Mother Sect, her medical skills are superb, perhaps I can try to learn from her and see if I can comprehend anything?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect, that young lady.</p><p></p><p>The evil people she had persuaded had truly reformed and never committed evil again, truly a remarkable technique.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he had asked Shi Er to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The messenger said to summon the young lady from the Tianmu clan, but she has not yet arrived in the Qi state, still remaining in the Wu state.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, Meng Chong has not even entered the door yet, he will be the third disciple. Let's observe and examine him further."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan temporarily set aside this matter.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan went out yesterday, he did not return at night, seemingly having gained some harvest, and should be about to comprehend the essence of the sword soon!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the county town of Yunshan, on a hillside.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged, silently gazing at the sunset on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>He no longer looked at the sword marks in the mountains and forests, but instead destroyed all the sword marks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as he looked at the sunset on the horizon, his mind was clear, and the sword techniques in his mind were constantly evolving.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques passed down by his master, he had long since forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Now, a new set of sword techniques was about to take shape in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His state of mind became increasingly clear, as if he had comprehended all the sword techniques and sword moves.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, there seemed to be a flash of inspiration in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The evolving sword technique was completed!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he entered a mysterious state.</p><p></p><p>His heart was clear and bright.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>The treasure sword resting on his knees suddenly began to tremble, as if it wanted to leave the sheath.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the sword was comprehended! Xu Yan had comprehended the essence of the sword!</p><p></p><p>At the moment he comprehended the essence of the sword, the door to the sword dao had opened.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he already had a sword technique, a trace of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>He had already broken free from the shackles of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Even the Dragon Palm had gained new insights and been enhanced as a result.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Dragon Palm was completed!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes, tapped the treasure sword resting on his knees, and with a crisp sound, the sword was drawn.</p><p></p><p>Gripping it, he raised his hand and slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was like a long rainbow, cutting through the air and slashing into the distance hundreds of feet away.</p><p></p><p>The sword light landed without a sound. If one were to approach, they would see a thin crack on the ground, extending dozens of feet, the depth unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, Xu Yan, have comprehended the essence of the sword and finally entered the door of the sword dao. Let this be called the Tong Ming Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said as he stroked the blade with his middle and index fingers.</p><p></p><p>The Tong Ming Sword! This was his first sword, and the witness to his entry into the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended the essence of the sword and entered the door of the sword dao. Next, it is to achieve full qi and blood, and break through to the Xiantian realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an excited expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>If he had already comprehended the essence of the sword and entered the sword dao back then, how could Blood Wuxin be his opponent?</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Domain!" Xu Yan looked towards the boundless mountains.</p><p></p><p>His heart was surging with excitement, the martial artists in the Inner Domain, the martial dao world of the Inner Domain, he had long yearned for.</p><p></p><p>He had long wanted to venture into the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a little longer, after the Xiantian realm, then I'll go to the Inner Domain!"</p><p></p><p>His parents' strength has not yet risen, and he has not yet broken through to the Xiantian realm. Therefore, he could only suppress the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, Li Xuan, as always, sat in the chair, his mind organizing the martial dao he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>Especially the subsequent martial dao techniques, how to compile them, how to perfect them.</p><p></p><p>He had already determined the realms beyond the Xiantian realm, and the cultivation direction had also been determined.</p><p></p><p>But for the subsequent martial dao realms and cultivation directions, he also needed to have an outline.</p><p></p><p>"My martial dao is stronger than the martial dao of this world from the very beginning, so the subsequent martial dao realms must also become stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>"The realms must be well connected, if there is a disconnect, the theoretical connection will not be able to be comprehended."</p><p></p><p>After repeated contemplation and pondering these past few days, Li Xuan had basically straightened out the direction of his subsequent martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, it still needs to be step by step. Only by successfully cultivating it can it be confirmed to be feasible, and then the next realm can be perfected.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's Golden Bone Refinement is complete, stuck at the Golden Bone Refinement, unable to refine the Diamond Lotus Bone. It's time to try to help my second disciple successfully refine the Diamond Lotus Bone."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Meng Chong, who was still engrossed in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Once the Diamond Lotus Bone is formed, he can break through and enter the Qi and Blood realm. After all, his cultivation is refining skin, bone, and viscera all together.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the essence of the sword and entered the door of the sword dao, your comprehension of the sword essence has reached the peak, the sword dao has reached the peak!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt the sword essence was clear and bright, understanding all swords, and the insights into the sword dao also constantly emerged.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the sword dao, but it can only be considered the foundation of the sword dao!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple has the talent of a sword god, I did not misjudge him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did indeed comprehend the essence of the sword and enter the door of the sword dao. The subsequent advancement of the sword dao will depend on him.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan believes that once Xu Yan goes to the Inner Domain, his sword dao advancement will not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>And the advancement of his disciple's sword dao will also bring more advancement to his own sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of sword dao after comprehending the sword essence should also be passed on to Xu Yan, try to comprehend the sword intent as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought happily to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, the second layer of the Dragon Palm is completed, your Dragon Palm has reached the second layer of perfection!"</p><p></p><p>Another harvest.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Dragon Palm is perfected.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan comprehended the essence of the sword, his insights into the Dragon Palm have also been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>This is understandable.</p><p></p><p>This shows that Xu Yan's talent and insight have been enhanced with the comprehension of the sword essence.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his finger, and a sword qi appeared and floated into the air, silent and undetectable, even the fierce edge.</p><p></p><p>In the air, a sword qi was criss-crossing.</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao I compiled is truly powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>"It should be much stronger than the sword techniques in the Inner Domain, right?"</p><p></p><p>The sword dao strength in the martial dao world of the Inner Domain is unknown for now.</p><p></p><p>But it can be roughly estimated that it is still at the powerful sword technique stage, and has not yet reached the sword dao realm, naturally it cannot match the sword dao he compiled.</p><p></p><p>To the eyes of those who have comprehended the essence of the sword, the sword techniques of the Inner Domain martial artists can be seen through at a glance, their flaws and reality can be grasped, and their sword techniques can be easily taken for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even a Grand Master can be slain with a single sword strike!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flicked his finger, and the sword qi in the air disappeared.</p><p></p><p>His strength has increased tremendously, even the Grand Masters of the Inner Domain will not be his opponents.</p><p></p><p>This is completely stable now.</p><p></p><p>No need to worry about the strong experts of the Inner Domain posing a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted and said, "My disciple has the talent of a sword god, I truly have not disappointed you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirits were immediately lifted upon hearing this, and his entire spirit seemed to have undergone a transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Master said I have the talent of a sword god!"</p><p></p><p>Patting his chest, he said, "Master, your disciple will definitely carry forward your sword dao, your disciple will definitely not disappoint you, and will surely become a sword god!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! My disciple has such ambition, your master believes you can do it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed in his heart, his disciple will surely become a sword god in the future, and as for himself... the title of Ancestor of the Sword Dao can be worn in advance!</p><p></p><p>I also want to update more, but I really can't write anymore (╥﹏╥)</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

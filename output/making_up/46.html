            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 46: This person is treacherous and malicious, I cannot keep him (Seeking to continue reading)</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi stood up, bowing and scraping with a fawning smile, and said, "I am the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect, at the youthful age of twenty-eight, the most beautiful woman under the heavens, and I am the unparalleled beauty in the world. You, Young Master Xu, are a perfect match made in heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu is the Great Celestial Heavenly Emperor, and he is the husband of the Heavenly Mother. The Heavenly Mother Sect naturally also belongs to Young Master Xu, there is no difference."</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan heard this, he had a look of surprise on his face, "The Heavenly Mother Sect has a Heavenly Mother? She's very beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was overjoyed to see this, and thought to himself, "Xu Yan's divine might is unrivaled, and his appearance is outstanding. The Heavenly Mother should also be delighted, and with the Heavenly Mother's beauty, how could Xu Yan not be moved?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the current Heavenly Mother is twenty-eight years old, the most beautiful under the heavens, as beautiful as a celestial being. Young Master Xu, as long as you become the Great Celestial Heavenly Emperor, you can be married to the Heavenly Mother.</p><p></p><p>"It's not me boasting, but I, Kou Ruozhi, have traveled through the Qi and Wu kingdoms, and have never seen a beauty like the Heavenly Mother."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi hurriedly spoke up, continuously praising the beauty of the current Heavenly Mother, saying she is unparalleled in the world, trying to tempt Xu Yan to join the Heavenly Mother Sect with her beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Is there truly such an exquisitely beautiful woman?" Xu Yan suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>"I have no intention of deceiving Young Master Xu. The beauty of the Heavenly Mother is beyond words to describe. Among the countless men in the world, only Young Master Xu is worthy of her.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't the Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Mother a perfect match?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, join our sect, become the Great Celestial Heavenly Emperor of our sect, and together we will overthrow the old Qi Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi kept tempting him, seeing that the great matter could be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually such a beautiful woman in the world?" Xu Yan became curious about the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>Something's not right!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly became alert, "This person keeps describing the beauty of the Heavenly Mother, he must be trying to seduce me with her beauty. Once I join the Heavenly Mother Sect and become the Great Celestial Heavenly Emperor, I will be immersed in the beauty of the current Heavenly Mother.</p><p></p><p>"Would this not be a waste of my martial arts cultivation? Would I not be indulging in pleasure day and night, neglecting the martial dao, becoming hopelessly addicted to beauty?</p><p></p><p>"Over time, with excessive indulgence, my vital energy and blood would dry up, my appearance would wither, my body would waste away, and the path of the martial dao would be cut off.</p><p></p><p>"If that Heavenly Mother has some method to replenish my yang energy, my powerful vital energy would just fulfill her needs."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more deeply he contemplated, and his heart grew colder.</p><p></p><p>An image emerged in his mind of himself with sunken eye sockets, hollow cheeks, a withered body, depleted vital energy, on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan took a deep breath, and his gaze towards Kou Ruozhi changed, his heart filled with dread: "This person is actually so treacherous and malicious, trying to disrupt my martial arts cultivation, I cannot keep him!"</p><p></p><p>He glared angrily and said coldly, "You treacherous and malicious scoundrel, daring to try and disrupt my martial arts cultivation, do you not know that I, Xu Yan, cannot be moved by female beauty? Today, I will not keep you!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised his hand, and the power of the Descending Dragon Palm manifested, a huge scarlet dragon about to burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait, Young Master Xu, wait!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had been observing Xu Yan's expression the whole time, and seeing that it was not good, he hastily knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu's will is as firm as a rock, unmoved by female beauty. I, Kou, submit. In this world, only Young Master Xu is worthy of becoming the Great Celestial Heavenly Emperor of our sect.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I mentioned the beauty of the Heavenly Mother only to witness Young Master Xu's steadfast will, your lofty state of mind unaffected by beauty. I had no intention of disrupting your martial arts cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi hurriedly swore an oath to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression eased somewhat, and he withdrew his palm power.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was drenched in cold sweat, shocked in his heart: "At this youthful age, to not be moved by the unparalleled beauty of the Heavenly Mother, which young man can achieve this? </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Xu Yan does not like women, but instead has a liking for men?!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Kou Ruozhi's mind raced, and he had a new idea.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, among our Heavenly Mother Sect members, there are no lack of handsome men, whether they are delicate and refined, or ruggedly handsome, all kinds..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We have everything. As long as you join our sect, Young Master Xu, you can become the Great Saint of the Heavenly Emperor and freely choose whomever you desire."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still young and had his heart set on the martial dao, so he did not immediately understand the meaning behind Kou Ruozhi's words.</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he asked, "Beautiful men? Freely choose?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, our sect has beautiful men. Young Master Xu can freely choose whomever you desire!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi wiped the cold sweat from his brow and stood up, putting on a fawning smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan blinked his eyes, about to ask what the purpose was of choosing beautiful men.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu's mother became anxious and trembled as she said, "Yan'er, don't be scared. Do you have a liking for the same sex?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan immediately understood. He became furious and shouted, "So you are vicious and malicious! Your beauty scheme has failed, and now you intend to ruin my reputation, disturb my mind, and shake my resolve in the martial dao. I cannot keep you here!"</p><p></p><p>Plopping down, Kou Ruozhi's soul seemed to have fled his body.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait, Young Master Xu, please wait. It's a misunderstanding, I didn't mean that!" </p><p></p><p>Feeling the terrifying pressure emanating from Xu Yan's palm, Kou Ruozhi was drenched in cold sweat, his face pale. Quickly racking his brain, he hurriedly explained, "What I meant was for Young Master Xu to choose beautiful men to give to the old Emperor Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, to give to the old Emperor Qi. It is rumored that the foolish Emperor Qi enjoys the company of men. We will send beautiful men to him, causing instability in his harem and making him lose focus on state affairs, throwing him into disarray.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, we will raise the banner of condemning Emperor Qi's tyranny and the chaos of yin and yang, which will surely win the people's hearts. We can then easily attack and capture Jin'an, and apprehend the foolish Emperor Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi could only put a shit bucket on Emperor Qi's head.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Supreme Masters of the Heavenly Mother Sect looked at their strategist Kou, admiring him greatly.</p><p></p><p>Truly their strategist, with his ability to read the situation and respond accordingly - no one could match him. If it had been any of them, they would have likely been killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was somewhat distraught in his heart: "What's wrong with this Xu Yan? He doesn't like women, nor does he like men? Why does he think I'm trying to disturb his resolve in the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm wronged! Did he misunderstand my words?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned as he looked at Kou Ruozhi, coldly saying, "Whether I, Xu Yan, rebel or not, has nothing to do with your Heavenly Mother Sect. You don't need these despicable methods. What is the old Emperor Qi? I can go straight to the capital and behead him with ease."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi stood up, drenched in cold sweat. That was a close call! He had managed to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Glancing over at Xu Junhe, he smiled awkwardly and said, "Master Xu, shall we talk?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked at the furious County Governor of Donghe, then replied indifferently, "Kou Ruozhi, bring something worthy of discussion."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, I will bring something worthy of discussion." </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Waving his feather fan and wiping the sweat from his brow, he looked at the Heavenly Mother Sect's masters and said, "Start the attack!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Strategist Kou!"</p><p></p><p>A man took out a whistle, put it in his mouth, and blew a series of short and long notes three times.</p><p></p><p>Soon after the whistle sounds, a series of whistle calls echoed from within Donghe County City.</p><p></p><p>"Father, should we kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the County Governor of Donghe and asked.</p><p></p><p>How to deal with the County Governor of Donghe and the others - whether to kill them all or handle it in some other way, he decided to let his father make the decision.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe pondered for a moment, then said, "Don't be hasty in attacking. Let's wait for news from the Heavenly Mother Sect."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he let out a sigh, and the look he gave his son was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought his son was not very bright, having believed the legends in story books.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, his son had truly cultivated a terrifying strength. </p><p></p><p>That crimson dragon, like a divine might, was something beyond human capability.</p><p></p><p>PS: Dear readers, please continue reading and supporting me. ^_^</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

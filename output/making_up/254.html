        <h1>Chapter 254</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and Fang Hao surrounded and attacked the Refining God Celestial Being Xu Liancheng. Meng Chong wielded his blade with fierce and ruthless strikes, sometimes with a sharp and violent edge, and sometimes with a silent and stealthy approach. </p><p></p><p>His mastery of the Dao of the Blade had reached a new level, exhibiting both domineering ferocity and cunning trickery, as well as agile versatility.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu fired her golden needles in a flurry, while the Great Marsh Divine Hoe struck heavily, entangling and slowing down Xu Liancheng's speed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, on the other hand, used formations and celestial arrays to provide cover for Su Lingxiu and Meng Chong, restraining Xu Liancheng. As the three of them coordinated better and better, Xu Liancheng was forced into a passive position.</p><p></p><p>Several of his attacks went in the wrong direction, influenced by the disorienting and confusing formation.</p><p></p><p>"If only I had the Mysterious Armaments Casket," Fang Hao lamented inwardly, as he had not yet refined his own Mysterious Armaments Casket.</p><p></p><p>Xu Liancheng knew that if he continued fighting like this, he would be in a passive position, even facing the danger of being defeated.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, and a series of scarlet lights surged forth from his body, one layer after another, causing his aura to instantly increase by thirty percent. </p><p></p><p>In this moment, he unleashed a secret martial art technique!</p><p></p><p>The mighty Refining God Celestial Being had been forced to resort to a secret martial art technique. Xu Liancheng felt overwhelming anger, and he raised his hand, shooting out a short spear towards the direction of Fang Hao's voice.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression changed slightly, and with a step, the Bagua patterns flashed in his mind, allowing him to instantly shift to another location.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of Fang Hao's evasion, Xu Liancheng roared furiously and launched a frenzied attack towards Su Lingxiu, whose strength was relatively weaker.</p><p></p><p>He struck her down!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's expression changed, and her figure flickered with multiple afterimages as she hastily evaded, wielding the Great Marsh Divine Hoe, causing the power of the Great Marsh to become viscous, attempting to restrain Xu Liancheng's movements.</p><p></p><p>The golden needles rained down like a shower.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Liancheng kept his gaze fixed on them, launching a relentless attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong struck with a powerful fist, the Absolute Deity Slash descending with deadly force.</p><p></p><p>Xu Liancheng suddenly retreated, and in an instant, he was right in front of Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" </p><p></p><p>He viciously thrust the short spear towards Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Fang Hao's expression changed. While his elder brother's physical body was incredibly robust, if that spear were to pierce him, he would undoubtedly suffer a severe injury.</p><p></p><p>Within Fang Hao, the celestial patterns instantly bloomed with radiance, as if the might of the heavens and earth had manifested in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Rise!"</p><p></p><p>The celestial array, drawing upon the great formation, was activated.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Fang Hao felt his vision darken, and his bones cracked as he struggled to withstand the immense power of the heavenly and earthly forces.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xu Liancheng felt a mysterious and overwhelming force envelop him, as if he had been trapped within a mysterious array. This caused him to pause momentarily.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the spiritual pressure surged, and he violently broke through the restraint of the array.</p><p></p><p>The short spear thrust out! Boom! But the strike missed its target.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure had already shifted to a different position, and the Absolute Deity Slash descended upon Xu Liancheng one strike after another.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, the medicinal pill!" Su Lingxiu hurriedly came to Fang Hao's side and placed a medicinal pill in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, I'm fine!" Fang Hao said after swallowing the pill, and to his delight, he found that the celestial patterns within him had actually been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao looked at Xu Liancheng, his eyes shining with insight. He had discovered a better way to perfect his celestial patterns.</p><p></p><p>By continuously invoking the great power of the heavens and earth, pushing himself to the limit, even to the point of nearly being unable to withstand it and suffering injuries, he could accelerate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of medicinal pills, the situation would be different. The recovery time would be reduced, allowing him to continue his cultivation without delay.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, the medicinal pills, I've found a cultivation method," Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took out several medicinal pills and handed them to him, expressing her concern, "Junior brother, is this method truly viable?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Fang Hao nodded enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Chong and Xu Liancheng were engaged in a fierce battle, their Indestructible Divine Armors constantly shattering and regenerating, while Xu Liancheng's relentless attacks continued to pound against Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong's expression remained unchanged, as if he was intentionally allowing Xu Liancheng to strike him, using Xu Liancheng's attacks to cultivate the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Temperings Technique.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took action again, feeling that she was too weak and lacked the means to attack the spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>"I am a Pill Cultivator Martial Artist, and if I can heal spiritual injuries, then I should also be able to inflict them!" </p><p></p><p>Raising her hand, a delicate golden needle appeared.</p><p></p><p>An idea had formed in Su Lingxiu's mind.</p><p></p><p>She raised her hand and fired the golden needle.</p><p></p><p>The needle struck Xu Liancheng's spiritual power, and in an instant, his spiritual power began to dissolve under the needle's influence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Liancheng was shocked, his own spiritual power was being dissolved, what kind of needle was this?</p><p></p><p>"If this needle can dissolve the spiritual power itself, it would be truly terrifying!" </p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Liancheng felt a desire to retreat, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, trapped within the formation, he could not find a way to escape.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Su Lingxiu's needle was more dangerous than Meng Chong's Absolute Deity Slash. If that needle could penetrate the spiritual power and directly attack the spiritual domain, even if it only dissolved a little, he would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The Absolute Deity Slash, while overwhelmingly powerful, could be resisted by refining the spiritual power. But Su Lingxiu's needle possessed a corrosive power that could erode and dissolve the spiritual power itself.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power was much more difficult to defend against this type of attack.</p><p></p><p>"It's effective!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed joyfully. "Of course, I can heal spiritual injuries, so there's no reason why I can't also inflict them, I just haven't figured out how to do it until now."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao once again invoked the power of the heavens and earth, using the formation as a foundation to step into the celestial array, enveloping Xu Liancheng within it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Liancheng's heart sank, wondering who the mysterious person was and what kind of techniques they were using, the methods were so bizarre and unpredictable, making him feel as if he had been trapped in some kind of array, unable to control his own actions.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent's strange techniques were not slightly weaker, he would have been completely restrained and at their mercy.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He forcefully broke through the mysterious restraint, his gaze turning cold as he launched a frenzied attack towards Meng Chong, wanting to inflict a heavy blow while the other was still underestimating him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's body swayed, his face deathly pale, but his eyes were bright. After hastily consuming another medicinal pill, without fully recovering, he once again invoked the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu flicked her finger, and a scarlet needle beam instantly shot out, striking Xu Liancheng's spiritual power. This attack was even stronger than the previous one, instantly dissolving his spiritual power, the scarlet needle beam nearly piercing into the core of his spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>At this, Xu Liancheng was filled with a sense of dread and a strong crisis. He let out a roar and recklessly charged in a certain direction, wanting to flee!</p><p></p><p>"You're not going anywhere!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not that easy!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a cold snort, his figure moving as he shifted sideways, blocking Su Liancheng's path.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the phoenix fire surged, the mist layered, even the directions became inverted, as Fang Hao once again activated the formation. He took a step forward, and a beam of light emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>A force of the terrain, like chains, rose up and bound Su Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly extraordinary formation has locked the extraordinary formation!</p><p></p><p>The three of them, Meng Chong and the others, suppressed Su Liancheng, even using Su Liancheng to enhance themselves. In another formation, Xu Yan was surrounded by sword light, and the formation had transformed into a sword formation.</p><p></p><p>The formation set up by Fang Hao, with a single thought from Xu Yan, had transformed into a mountain and river sword formation, and Ke Linping now felt as if he was within a mountain and river realm.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was the lord of this mountain and river, the sword intent swirling, the power of the mountain and river sword formation constantly surging forth, making Ke Linping increasingly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>He had a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He tried to break out of the sword formation multiple times, but was forced back each time.</p><p></p><p>Outside the formation, Li Xuan silently observed the battle within. Xu Yan had broken through to the initial stage of the Shen Yi Realm, and had comprehended the sword formation, his strength greatly enhanced. Now, on his own, he could already contend with cultivators at the initial stage of the Lian Shen Tian Ren Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The outcome has already been determined!"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Ke Linping or Su Liancheng, the moment they entered the formation, their life and death had already been decided.</p><p></p><p>"After this battle, Fang Hao's mastery of the Qi Men martial arts will be more refined, and he will gain more insights."</p><p></p><p>This battle was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has comprehended the Fusion Spirit Needle, and you have gained the Fusion Spirit Art."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was a Dantian martial artist, and since she could heal spiritual wounds, she naturally also understood how to injure the spirit, how to make the spirit dissolve.</p><p></p><p>This was an inevitable result.</p><p></p><p>"The Yushen Sect and the Su family, let them be just stepping stones."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The strong, they all step up to the peak one step at a time, using countless stepping stones. Xu Yan and Meng Chong, just entering the Ling Domain, the Yushen Sect and the Su family were the stepping stones for their rise.</p><p></p><p>"The Yuzhou, its strength is ultimately not strong enough, the true geniuses of the Ling Domain are not in this state."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Ke Linping and Su Liancheng, although they were at the Lian Shen Tian Ren Realm, in terms of strength, they were probably not among the strongest in the Lian Shen Tian Ren Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the Yushen Sect and Su family incident, it was about time to leave the Yuzhou and head to the true great states of the Ling Domain, to contend with the geniuses of the Ling Domain.</p><p></p><p>The battle was reaching its end.</p><p></p><p>Su Liancheng's face was deathly pale, he had consumed too much. He had also gone mad, staring at Su Ling Xiu, frantically attacking, wanting to drag someone down with him even if he died.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Ling Xiu's strength was relatively weak, her speed was not slow. As she deployed her techniques, illusions layered, and she was within the formation, making it difficult for Su Liancheng to accurately determine her true location.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong and Fang Hao also attacking, wanting to injure Su Ling Xiu was just a pipe dream! Suddenly, Su Ling Xiu's golden needles shot out like rain, and in the gap of Su Liancheng's defense, Meng Chong's Absolute God Slash struck, shaking his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a fine needle, condensed from Dan Yan, pierced into his spiritual power, opening a small crack.</p><p></p><p>The needle had entered his spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the area pierced by the needle, a hole the size of a finger, was familiar and dissolving, and continuing to expand! "Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Excruciating pain came from his spirit, Su Liancheng let out a miserable scream, his eyes bulging slightly from the pain, his whole body trembling, his defense and attack both showing openings.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The blade light descended, the phoenix fire like a python, the power of the formation engulfed him!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xu Yan's expression was cold, raising his hand with a gesture, within the sword formation, the Thunder Annihilation Sword fell, the Xun Mie Sword fell, the mountains and rivers collapsed, the sword formation like a raging flood.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ke Linping's body was pierced through, his spirit constantly disintegrating under the Xun Mie Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you come from?"</p><p></p><p>Ke Linping's face was filled with unwillingness and anger, he could not believe that he was about to perish here.</p><p></p><p>"What realm are you in?"</p><p></p><p>At this point in the battle, he had already sensed that Xu Yan's realm was somewhat unusual, neither the Small Heavenly Realm of the Gathering Spirit Realm, nor the Great Heavenly Realm of the Uniting Spirit Realm, nor the Lian Shen Tian Ren Realm! But there was something similar to spiritual power, yet vastly different from spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>"The Shen Yi Realm!" Xu Yan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Ke Linping was completely dumbfounded, the Shen Yi Realm, what realm was that, he had never heard of it before?</p><p></p><p>Before he could continue asking, his spirit had already dissipated, completely vanishing from the world.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Liancheng also fell in the formation, with unwillingness and anger.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has killed Lian Shen Tian Ren, you have gained the third form of the Shen Hui."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stepped out, already back in the manor.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, Fang Hao's face was pale, this battle had brought him great gains, but also great consumption. Regarding formations, the extraordinary heavenly and earthly formations, he had gained more insights.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the formation artifacts flew back, the formation was dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"I killed a Lian Shen Tian Ren!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was like in a dream, just recently he was still a humble cultivator, pursuing the art of forging, and now he had laid down a formation and, together with his senior siblings, slain the lofty Lian Shen Tian Ren of the great families.</p><p></p><p>The twists and turns of life, truly wondrous!</p><p></p><p>The battle was over, the Lian Shen Tian Ren of the Yushen Sect and the Su family had fallen, this would undoubtedly cause a huge upheaval in the Yuzhou, the Yushen Sect and the Su family would all be trembling in fear!</p><p></p><p>The four of them returned to the manor, and the first thing Fang Hao did was to once again set up formations in the manor, upgrading the formations.</p><p></p><p>After the setup was complete, each of them began to absorb the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not far from the initial success of the Indestructible Golden Body first layer, Su Ling Xiu was only a step away from the initial success of the Shen Yi Realm.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly extraordinary patterns within Fang Hao were already nearing perfection, and it would not be long before he could set up an extraordinary formation and refine the next heavenly and earthly extraordinary pattern.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu, they had all been stimulated, and began to cultivate diligently, wanting to break through to the Shen Yi Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>And the Red Cat was even more so, it wanted to become the great demon king!</p><p></p><p>On the second day after Ke Linping and Su Liancheng were killed, some cultivators passed by the vicinity of the manor, but they did not discover the location of the manor.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao reinforced the formations, they became even more concealed and harder to detect.</p><p></p><p>Near the capital of Zheng Country, cultivators gathered, almost conducting a carpet-like search of the surrounding area, the cultivators of the Yushen Sect and the Su family had almost swarmed out.</p><p></p><p>By the sixth day, two Lian Shen Tian Ren passed by.</p><p></p><p>And they were mid-stage Lian Shen Tian Ren cultivators, from the Yushen Sect and the Su family respectively.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quietly observed them, the mid-stage Lian Shen Tian Ren, they were not much, he could still easily destroy them with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzhou was shaken! The two Lian Shen Tian Ren from the Yushen Sect and the Su family, joined forces to search for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, but they had disappeared without a trace, they didn't even know where they had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su family were greatly enraged, the bounty was further increased, Lian Shen Tian Ren almost swarmed out, searching the four corners of the Yuzhou, they even hired Lian Shen Tian Ren cultivators to participate in the massive search.</p><p></p><p>The thunderous large-scale search operation covered the Yuzhou, they were determined to find Xu Yan and Meng Chong, even if they had to dig up the earth. But even after half a month passed, there was still no clue.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong, it was as if they had vanished into thin air.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 108 Meng Chong's Qi and Blood are Complete, a Dangerous Aura</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Wu Kingdom, after Meng Chong, there was another uproar. The ministers trembled in fear, and the Wu Emperor's face was deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The renowned elder of the jianghu, Senior Wu, had single-handedly stormed the imperial palace and slashed open a long gully with a single stroke, shocking the ministers and the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards were all shivering in fear, not daring to step forward.</p><p></p><p>Even Senior Wu's disciple was hiding far away, realizing that something was off with his master.</p><p></p><p>In the court, the Blood Spirit Patriarch casually crushed a hapless minister to death and sat on the imperial throne, resting a serrated knife by his feet. The Wu Emperor stood pale-faced before the ministers.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Wu was even more ferocious than Meng Chong, ready to kill at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Emperor of the Wu Kingdom?" the Blood Spirit Patriarch looked down at the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Senior Wu, what are your orders?" the Wu Emperor replied tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with resentment. As the sovereign of a kingdom, he was now like a servant, awaiting his master's commands.</p><p></p><p>"Find a man named Meng Chong, and bring him to me!" the Blood Spirit Patriarch bared his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly said, "No problem, I'll have someone find him immediately. Meng Chong has no respect for his elders, and I've long been dissatisfied with him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wu, please wait a few days, he will soon come to the capital of the Wu Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Patriarch stood up, "Very good, this seat awaits your news. If you fail to find the man, you all... will become my food!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the taste is a bit lacking, it's still better than nothing!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Patriarch walked past the Wu Emperor, casually crushing another hapless minister to death, and then left.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was completely drained, collapsing to the ground. The rest of the ministers were in the same state.</p><p></p><p>Their former lofty status had changed since the Meng Chong incident, and today was even more unbearable, almost costing them their lives.</p><p></p><p>All the ministers felt utterly humiliated.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute power, their so-called authority was so easily shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Dismiss the court!" the chief eunuch hurriedly ordered the ministers to leave.</p><p></p><p>He supported the Wu Emperor, "Your Majesty, what are we to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Find Meng Chong, notify Meng Chong that I have a request for him, and let him come to the capital!" the Wu Emperor gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong didn't come, the consequences would be unimaginable. And he knew that given Meng Chong's character, if he heard that the Emperor had a request, he would surely come.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Meng Chong that there is a martial arts expert in the capital of the Wu Kingdom!" the Wu Emperor paused and then said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"But... we don't know where Meng Chong is," the chief eunuch said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Have the Heavenly Mother Sect spread the news, the jianghu will have its own channels of information," the Wu Emperor pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!" the chief eunuch ordered it to be done.</p><p></p><p>In a secluded palace of the Wu Kingdom, the Wu Emperor entered an ancient stone house.</p><p></p><p>"You said this place cannot be cultivated, but one martial artist after another has appeared. What's going on?" a mysterious voice sounded from the stone house after a while.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're trying to trick me again, impossible, absolutely impossible, I won't fall for it," the voice continued.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor took a deep breath and said solemnly, "I'm not tricking you. A renowned figure from the jianghu of my Wu Kingdom came to the palace today, wanting to find a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"His strength is extremely terrifying, and he even drinks blood!"</p><p></p><p>The stone house fell silent for a while, and then the mysterious voice spoke again, "Really? You're not lying?"</p><p></p><p>"I can swear an oath!" the Wu Emperor replied.</p><p></p><p>"There's no reason for it. The remote border, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have already died, how could martial artists appear? If the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth were to recover, I would definitely come out," the mysterious voice muttered to itself.</p><p></p><p>"You taught me the cultivation method, let me try it, and then I'll know. Even if I can't cultivate, you won't lose anything," the Wu Emperor seized the opportunity to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I knew it, you're trying to trick me, all of you are liars, wah... all liars, a group of liars, how can there be so many liars in this world..." the mysterious voice became somewhat frantic.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor frowned, once again getting nothing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying to you, martial artists have truly appeared, I swear!" the Wu Emperor pleaded.</p><p></p><p>"Liars... wah, liars, I won't fall for it, I definitely won't, I'm so smart, I won't fall for it..."</p><p></p><p>"Just consider it, teach me something a bit inferior, or even just an entry-level cultivation method, I really haven't lied to you, martial artists have truly appeared..."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor's tone carried a hint of begging.</p><p></p><p>However, the mysterious voice ignored him, repeatedly saying, "Liars, all liars..."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor left the stone house helplessly and with discontent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt his treasured sword trembling, almost in sync with his own heartbeat. Whenever his palm gripped the hilt, it felt as if it was a part of his own body.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this sword had been forged bit by bit by him, imbued with consciousness and a soul.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time!" Meng Chong had an intuition that the day to draw the sword was not far away.</p><p></p><p>When the sword was unsheathed, it would be the day the sword's spirit awakened.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that under my nourishment, this sword contains tremendous power. When I draw it, it may be able to slay a Sect Master!" Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After nourishing the treasured sword for so long, his qi and blood had been constantly circulating. The sword had accumulated tremendous power under his nourishment.</p><p></p><p>When this sword was unsheathed, it would surely shake the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"I also have a clue about the Great Sun Golden Body, I'm almost able to comprehend it," Meng Chong thought.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment during his cultivation, his body flashed with iridescent golden light, and a bell-like sound resonated within his body.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Bell was complete!</p><p></p><p>"My qi and blood are now complete, I only need to fully comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body, successfully nourish the sword, and then I can start working on breaking through to the Xiantian Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Xiantian Realm was not far away.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Xuan was studying an ancient leather book, while also keeping an eye on Su Ling Xiu's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"This girl's bone refinement speed has finally slowed down."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was currently refining golden bones, and the speed had finally slowed down. To refine the golden bones to perfection would require a significant amount of time.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ling Xiu was concocting medicinal pills to assist her bone refinement, so her cultivation progress was not too slow.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, after her golden bones are perfected, she will encounter another bottleneck. How to break through that bottleneck and refine the evergreen bones, that is a problem," Li Xuan also fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Whether Su Ling Xiu could refine the evergreen bones was related to his own gains, so he was also pondering how she could refine the evergreen bones.</p><p></p><p>"The characteristic of the evergreen bones is eternal vitality, and the general methods cannot refine them. As for medicinal pills..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mulled it over but had no clue.</p><p></p><p>He could only let Su Ling Xiu try to comprehend it herself. He had already passed on the Medicinal Dao Classics to her, and with her talent, she might be able to find a solution.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, the Great Sun Golden Bell is complete, your physical body has been enhanced, and your true qi has been elevated."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>The golden finger feedback came, and Meng Chong's qi and blood were full.</p><p></p><p>"Second disciple, you are also not far from the Xiantian realm, and you should be able to comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanxin was excitedly thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>He also knew that Meng Chong planned to succeed in cultivating the Dao of the Sword, and then awaken the Sword Spirit, before breaking through to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>"If he fails to succeed in cultivating the Dao of the Sword for a long time, I can't let him stay in the Qi and Blood realm forever. It's better for him to break through to the Xiantian realm early. Perhaps once he reaches the Xiantian realm, he will find it easier to succeed in cultivating the Dao of the Sword and awaken the Sword Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanxin was thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not yet fully comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body, and was still a distance away from breaking through to the Xiantian realm. He could only wait until Meng Chong had fully comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to succeed in cultivating the Dao of the Sword and awaken the Sword Spirit for a long time, Li Xuanxin would let him break through to the Xiantian realm first.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong's breakthrough, he was extremely excited. He had a feeling that he was about to succeed in cultivating the Dao of the Sword, and once the Sword Spirit awakened, and he comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body, he would be able to break through.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er came over.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had come specifically to find him, so there must be something.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, a message has come from the Sky Mother Sect, saying that the Emperor of Wu wants to find you, it seems he has encountered a powerful enemy and needs your help."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er relayed the message from the Sky Mother Sect to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>This was a small matter, and the Sky Mother Sect had only passed on the message to Cloud Mountain County, without the intention of helping the Emperor of Wu find Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the news of the Emperor of Wu encountering a martial arts expert was also ignored, and was passed on as the Emperor of Wu encountering a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>After learning this news, Shi Er pondered for a while, and still decided to tell Meng Chong, after all, the Emperor of Wu was the one who had helped Meng Chong avenge his great grievance back then.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the Emperor of Wu has encountered a powerful enemy?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his eyebrows and said, "Well, I'll go take a look. The old Emperor of Wu, how can I say, he helped me avenge my grievance back then, so I'll help him deal with this powerful enemy, and we'll be even."</p><p></p><p>"Then you'd better hurry, if you're late, the Emperor of Wu might be killed."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, if I go and he's already dead, I'll just avenge him. You go back and tell my master that I'm going to the capital of the Wu Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The so-called powerful enemy that the Emperor of Wu had encountered was nothing to Meng Chong, he could easily crush it. So Shi Er was also not too concerned about this matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the remote border regions, there were no martial artists, let alone Meng Chong, Shi Er could also walk around freely.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought the same way, and directly set out for the capital of the Wu Kingdom, this time he did not ride a horse, but used the Furious Thunder Soaring Body Technique to rush towards the capital of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Wu Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The officials and nobles were in a panic, and many even hid in the cellars, afraid of being unlucky and targeted by the ferocious senior Wu.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, dozens of people had already died.</p><p></p><p>They had all become "blood food", drained of their blood and essence by senior Wu.</p><p></p><p>Among them, several young masters had become blood food and died a miserable death.</p><p></p><p>As for the common people of the capital of the Wu Kingdom, they were clapping and cheering. These beasts who had oppressed the common people had finally received their retribution.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had not become blood food.</p><p></p><p>In the entire capital of the Wu Kingdom, officials and nobles were nowhere to be seen, they had all gone into hiding, and for the common people of the capital, this was a good time, their faces were full of smiles as they set up stalls and did business, no longer afraid of being robbed or attacked.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal only consumed the officials and nobles, not for the sake of punishing the evil and upholding the good, nor for the sake of the common people, but purely because the officials and nobles were plump and well-fed, their blood and essence were more nutritious and cleaner.</p><p></p><p>Those common people were poor and dirty, just not appetizing at all!</p><p></p><p>"So you're the Emperor of Wu, huh? My patience is limited, if I don't see Meng Chong in a few days, you know what will happen, I've always been looking for tasty blood food."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal sneered as he patted the Emperor of Wu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu's face was deathly pale, his whole body trembling, "Senior Wu, don't worry, Meng Chong will definitely come."</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong didn't come, he could only hide in the stone house and hope to save his life. He didn't want to expose the existence of the stone house unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I hope so!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal let out a sinister laugh and strode away.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall of the capital of the Wu Kingdom,</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal stood on the city wall, looking at the crowd coming and going through the city gate, selecting suitable blood food.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed, and he looked towards the distant outside the city.</p><p></p><p>His eyes lit up, revealing an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"He's here, the young man who carries horses, you are the foundation for my Blood Spirit Immortal's resurgence, I've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>Holding a serrated knife, he leaped down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu and his ministers soon received the news and hurried to the city tower to watch.</p><p></p><p>"Evacuate the civilians nearby, close the city gates!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Mystery Guards mobilized, driving the civilians away and closing the city gates.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was rushing towards the capital of the Wu Kingdom, and could see it in the distance, when suddenly his expression changed and he abruptly stopped in his tracks!</p><p></p><p>Dangerous aura!</p><p></p><p>His expression slightly tightened, he was already a cultivator at the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, ordinary inner domain martial artists could not pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his keen martial artist's intuition sensed danger!</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor of Wu has summoned a powerful expert to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned.</p><p></p><p>Where did the Emperor of Wu find such a powerful expert? He couldn't have gone to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>A figure leaped down from the city wall, landing silently, a strong aura of danger emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze focused on the person.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wu?"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, it was actually the respected senior Wu from the rivers and lakes of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"No, how could Senior Wu have such power? If he had this power, I would have been captured by him when I stormed the Grand Martial Arts Assembly last time!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the approaching Blood Spirit Immortal, Meng Chong's expression became grave, the golden light emerged as the Great Sun Golden Bell Technique was activated to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely powerful opponent!</p><p></p><p>However, he was not afraid, nor did he retreat, but rather his fighting spirit was high.</p><p></p><p>"He's not Senior Wu, something seems off!"</p><p></p><p>But the person in front of him was clearly the renowned senior Wu, Meng Chong couldn't figure out what was going on.</p><p></p><p>"Young man who carries horses? You are truly formidable, this blood and essence, mmm..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal's eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was greatly puzzled, this young man who carries horses, he had thought he was just physically strong, but unexpectedly he was also a martial artist?</p><p></p><p>And somewhat different from ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Is he from the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Did the Emperor of Wu send you to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor of Wu? What a piece of trash, does he think he can command me? You will be the foundation for my resurgence, just obediently submit, and I'll give you a quick death!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Immortal sneered coldly, the serrated knife in his hand emanating a chilling sword qi.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

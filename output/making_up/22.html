        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 22: Fierce Battle with the Maned Wolf (Seeking Readers)</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan confirmed that he had reached a bottleneck, and if he could not break through this bottleneck, he would be unable to refine his bones into jade-like quality!</p><p></p><p>He was just one step away, but he was stuck and unable to make any progress.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a barrier blocking him, and without breaking through this barrier, achieving the jade-like bones would be hopeless.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan had no idea how to break through this barrier.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he circulated his qi and blood, or how he continuously refined his bones, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because I haven't grasped the insight? Do I need to relax my mind and seek enlightenment to break through the barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"But I have a feeling that I need pressure, an internal and external interaction, to break through. However, I don't know what kind of pressure is required..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He decided to seek advice from his master.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Xuan came out of the house.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, come here!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan perked up, thinking that his master had noticed his bottleneck and was here to guide him.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" he respectfully greeted.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was somewhat serious as he said, "Disciple, after you hunted down the evil tiger in the Evil Abyss Forest, did you search the entire forest?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"In the Evil Abyss Forest, besides the tiger, there is also a fierce beast. Be careful and take care of it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan warned him solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Based on the description in the old cow's diary, that fierce beast was not ordinary, and if it came to the small village, it would be a grave threat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he realized, "The Evil Abyss Forest has another fierce beast? Stronger than the Red-Eyed Tiger? I understand now, Master is telling me that the opportunity to break through is in the Evil Abyss Forest!"</p><p></p><p>"Battling the fierce beast, unleashing my potential, breaking through the barrier, the jade-like bones will be achieved!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, a flash of insight struck Xu Yan's mind, and he suddenly understood what kind of pressure he needed to break through the barrier and achieve the jade-like bones.</p><p></p><p>The fierce beast in the Evil Abyss Forest was his chance!</p><p></p><p>He immediately nodded excitedly and said, "Master, I understand. I'll go take care of it right away!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly mounted his horse and headed straight for the Evil Abyss Forest.</p><p></p><p>"Why the hurry? I haven't finished speaking yet," Li Xuan said, somewhat exasperated.</p><p></p><p>This foolish disciple of his got so excited upon hearing about the fierce beast in the Evil Abyss Forest. Was he addicted to hunting?</p><p></p><p>"With many people, the fierce beast shouldn't be able to escape." Li Xuan sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>Although he had learned that the external martial artists were not particularly strong, belonging to the lower martial realm, with a group of people, dealing with a fierce beast should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Even if the beast was powerful, it couldn't be that strong compared to the low-level martial artists, right?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rode his horse to the Evil Abyss Forest and began searching.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the forest, the trees grew increasingly massive, and his horse started trembling, slowing down and even wanting to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit was roused, and he circulated his qi and blood, remaining alert to his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a deep roar echoed, and a fiery figure burst out from behind a large tree, its fangs gleaming with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>It pounced directly at Xu Yan on the horse.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes gleamed, and relying on his robust physique, he directly unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>A claw also came swinging at him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a tremendous force, and he was knocked off the horse.</p><p></p><p>The horse, terrified, immediately collapsed to the ground, trembling.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" Xu Yan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He was a cultivator who had nearly refined his bones into jade-like quality, with extraordinary strength.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If the tiger were to encounter him at this moment, a single punch would be enough to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rolled on the ground and got up, a fiery red figure charged at him again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a loud roar, his entire body boiling with energy, and he charged straight at it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A paw slammed heavily onto his chest, and Xu Yan also punched the fierce beast with all his might.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan staggered back a few steps, feeling a sharp pain in his chest.</p><p></p><p>As for the fierce beast, it was also pushed back two steps by the punch.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan looked closely and saw that the fierce beast's entire body was fiery red, especially the mane around its neck, burning like a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>It had the head of a wolf, emerald green eyes, and two fangs over a foot long that gleamed with a cold light. Its hind body was smaller than the front, but the hind legs were incredibly thick and sturdy.</p><p></p><p>Its front paws were like tiger claws, with sharp talons exposed, like small daggers.</p><p></p><p>Its body was more than half larger than a crimson-eyed tiger, standing there with an aura of ferocity. Its emerald green eyes gave off a sinister and savage feeling.</p><p></p><p>Being stared at by those eyes would make one shudder involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those emerald green eyes were fixed intently on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It sensed a powerful life force from this human, which aroused its bloodthirsty desire.</p><p></p><p>"A Fire-Maned Wolf?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with awe. The appearance of this fierce beast was exactly the same as the one he had seen in an ancient storybook, a creature called the Fire-Maned Wolf.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the Fire-Maned Wolf was incredibly powerful, once rampaging into the city and causing countless deaths and injuries, and had retreated unscathed even under the siege of elite troops!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was actually a Fire-Maned Wolf in this evil forest!</p><p></p><p>"Who says storybooks are all lies? Even the Fire-Maned Wolf has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, his blood surging, his entire being filled with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Maned Wolf, the legendary fierce beast.</p><p></p><p>Many had read about the Fire-Maned Wolf in storybooks, but no one took it seriously. A fierce beast rampaging into the city and retreating unscathed even under the siege of troops? That was too absurd!</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan believed it now. From their earlier clash, the Fire-Maned Wolf's strength was indeed capable of retreating unscathed from a military siege.</p><p></p><p>Its formidable physique, agile speed, and immense power. Even Xu Yan felt some pressure, which showed how powerful the Fire-Maned Wolf was.</p><p></p><p>"This is my chance to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan believed that the Fire-Maned Wolf was the key to his breakthrough to the Jade Bone realm. Battling the Fire-Maned Wolf, under such intense pressure, would allow him to break through the shackles.</p><p></p><p>"Come, today I, Xu Yan, will use your Fire-Maned Wolf's life to temper my Jade Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan roared, his blood boiling, his body even emanating a faint jade luster, as he charged forward.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Maned Wolf let out a fierce howl and pounced at him, its massive paws swiping, its gaping jaws dripping with saliva as it viciously bit towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed the Fire-Maned Wolf's paws with both hands, and before it could bite, he delivered a powerful kick to its body, sending it flying and crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He then rushed forward and started raining down punches.</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Maned Wolf let out a roar, its eyes turning blood-red, an aura of savagery permeating the air, its fiery red mane now billowing like raging flames.</p><p></p><p>It pounced at Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was sent flying back, his heart filled with shock. How had the Fire-Maned Wolf's body become so scorching hot?</p><p></p><p>The Fire-Maned Wolf pounced down.</p><p></p><p>The man and the beast engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a roar, pushing the Fire-Maned Wolf back, then rushed in again, grabbing its paws and pinning it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But the Fire-Maned Wolf kept kicking with its hind legs, each strike with tremendous force, shaking Xu Yan's blood and nerves with excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mustered all his strength and flung the Fire-Maned Wolf away. His entire body was boiling with energy, and at this moment, a mist was rising from Xu Yan's skin, which was gradually turning red.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

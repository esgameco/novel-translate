        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's figure disappeared into the clouds, but she also revealed a piece of information - that divine bridge could be summoned earlier by the Superb Spiritual Sect!</p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall Masters' faces were extremely gloomy. Wu Tiannan's strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Trying to kill him would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had the ties of the Martial Dao Academy, but now he was alone, unattached, without any weaknesses. To them, he had become a huge threat.</p><p></p><p>Even if they mobilized the full might of the Superb Spiritual Sect, they might still not be able to slay him.</p><p></p><p>If they angered him, the Superb Spiritual Sect would face a terrifying retaliation, not to mention their sect disciples, even the mightiest cultivators who had refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth could be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the clash of geniuses wonderful? Let the young ones fight it out. After all, is the Superb Spiritual Sect afraid of scattered cultivators? You all defeated the Myriad Star Martial Dao Academy back then. Has the Spiritual Sect become so weak that it lacks geniuses to uphold its reputation?" Fu Tianhai spoke leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Tianhai, your Qinghai City is also part of the Superb Spiritual Sect. What are you saying these sarcastic words for?" Lei Yunzhuang Master angrily retorted.</p><p></p><p>"My Qinghai City is different from yours. We are in Qinghai, not the Eighteen Prefectures, and we don't oppress scattered cultivators like you Spiritual Sect does. In our Qinghai City, we only look at talent and strength, not background," Fu Tianhai sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Lei Yunzhuang Master coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see, the Spiritual Sect's martial arts competition should be coming up soon, right? It's just counting the Myriad Worlds Alliance into it. If the Spiritual Sect has the ability, they should defeat all the geniuses of the Myriad Worlds Alliance. </p><p></p><p>"That way, there won't be any geniuses from the Myriad Worlds Alliance who can ascend the divine bridge." Fu Tianhai chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"How about this suggestion? If you really want to fight on, Taimiao won't intervene, and the Great Zhou probably won't either, after all, the Great Zhou is not the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"With just the three of you, you can't stop him, even if you use some of your sect's resources. What can you do?" </p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Fu Tianhai looked at the Thousand Martial Hall Master and smiled, "Thousand Martial Hall, it's time for your sect's geniuses to descend the mountain and challenge the Spiritual Sect's geniuses, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many geniuses your Thousand Martial Hall has this generation. Can they dominate the martial dao? </p><p></p><p>"The geniuses of my Qinghai City are waiting for your Thousand Martial Hall's little ones."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was holding a book, no longer exuding the majestic aura as before, but rather a scholarly demeanor like a teacher, gently tapping the book pages with a ruler.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the decision of the Thousand Martial Hall Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good, then let the young ones fight it out. Let's see how many geniuses your Myriad Worlds Alliance has, and how many geniuses Wu Tiannan can produce.</p><p></p><p>"The ones who could once defeat your Myriad Star Martial Dao Academy can now also defeat your Myriad Worlds Alliance." The Thousand Martial Hall Master sneered.</p><p></p><p>"It's for the best." Wu Tiannan smiled. "The clash of geniuses, what a wonderful atmosphere of the martial dao! The elders should not interfere. Everything should be done according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>"Victory or defeat is the business of the young ones, life and death is also their affair."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, his gaze gradually became more fierce. "However, Wu shall say this in advance - if any elder dares to come out and bully the small, killing the geniuses of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, for every one he kills, I will kill three of theirs!</p><p></p><p>"Let's see who can stop me, who can protect their geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>The three Thousand Martial Hall Masters all had a startled expression. Wu Tiannan had completely let go, even directly saying such words, unlike when he was still at the Martial Dao Academy, restrained.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Wu Tiannan's threat was so great.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Then let the young ones fight it out, we elders won't interfere!" Lei Yunzhuang Master sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Your Leiyan Mountain Sect still has some credibility, but the Thousand Martial Hall is the most shameless. Wu doesn't trust them much, I will keep an eye on the Thousand Martial Hall." Wu Tiannan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai mediated at this moment: "Alright, alright, the elders of the Thousand Martial Hall may have been shameless in the past, but the current Thousand Martial Hall Master is not shameless, he still has some credibility.</p><p></p><p>"Although they occasionally do some sneaky and underhanded things, they haven't done anything too outrageous, like ambushes, assassinations, or rape and plunder..."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master's face turned livid as he gritted his teeth: "Fu Tianhai!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai smiled awkwardly, but then his expression became serious as he said, "Thousand Martial Hall Master, you still need to restrain your people and uphold the rules!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The great battle between the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the Spiritual Sect has temporarily come to an end, and the matter of the clash of geniuses has been brought up again. The two sides will decide the outcome through the battles of their respective geniuses, determining the ownership of a region.</p><p></p><p>Just like the past clash of geniuses at the Myriad Star Martial Dao Academy.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses under the age of thirty can fight freely, but the protectors and powerful figures of the geniuses' factions must not intervene, must not use their strength to bully the weak!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this genius clash is not limited to just the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the Spiritual Sect, but all the geniuses in the Spiritual Realm can participate.</p><p></p><p>The top ten geniuses will receive great rewards and mysterious opportunities! The genius clash will soon begin, lasting for ten years!</p><p></p><p>With the restart of the genius clash, some Spiritual Sects have increased their efforts in cultivating geniuses and have started to recruit scattered cultivator geniuses to represent their sects, providing them with resources and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it seems that all the scattered cultivator geniuses in the world have been given a chance to change their fate.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Spiritual Sect's strength and its deep-rooted dominance over the Spiritual Realm, many outstanding scattered cultivators still choose to join the Spiritual Sect, seeing it as an opportunity to rise from the bottom to the top.</p><p></p><p>As for the Myriad Worlds Alliance, there hasn't been much movement, and no news of any geniuses has been heard.</p><p></p><p>However, the names of the top geniuses from the major Spiritual Sect families have started to become widely known, building hype for the genius clash.</p><p></p><p>Only the Superb Spiritual Sect's geniuses' names have not been revealed.</p><p></p><p>But the names of the geniuses from the Superb Spiritual Sect's subordinate sects have been gradually released.</p><p></p><p>For example, Cai Yunhong, the genius of the Azure Cloud Dynasty under the Leiyan Mountain Sect, possessing the number one divine power body of the Ten Great Treasure Bodies, a Refined Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>For example, Yu Changfeng, the current strongest genius of the Sword Sect under the Thousand Martial Hall, a Refined Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall's Three Absolutes Tower, with its three geniuses in sword, spear, and fist - Wumu, Lu Yi, and Bao Sheng.</p><p></p><p>This is obviously the Spiritual Sect's hype, and some of the older martial artists seem to vaguely recall the era of the genius clash, as well as the era of martial arts competitions between the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a genius ranking list appeared, listing the top one thousand geniuses in the Spiritual Realm, but without any names yet.</p><p></p><p>To enter the ranking, the geniuses must defeat other geniuses, and the defeated geniuses must be at the Refined Spirit Celestial realm. </p><p></p><p>Those below the Refined Spirit Celestial realm are no longer qualified to participate in the genius clash.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Spiritual Realm has changed too quickly - from the great battle between the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the Spiritual Sect, to the appearance of powerful figures and their unceasing battles, to the sudden ceasefire and the opening of the genius clash, all within a short period of time, less than half a month.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the manor, the news has already arrived.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, this clash of geniuses was prepared for Xu Yan and Meng Chong. Although Xu Yan only had his divine will realm perfected, he would soon be able to accumulate a foundation and break through to the divine source realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physical martial dao was unparalleled in defense, it would be very difficult for the geniuses of the Spirit Realm to injure him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the great battle, he would definitely be able to rapidly increase his strength and break through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's strength was also not bad, he had no problem with refining the divine celestial human. Once his Heaven and Earth Mysterious Gate and formations were deployed, these geniuses of the Spirit Realm would probably be dumbfounded in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"If Suli Xiu also participates, the top four geniuses will definitely all be my disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted in his heart. As for the rules of the Genius Confrontation, not to bully the weak, the protectors and the powerful of the factions were not allowed to intervene or interfere. Whether the Spirit Sect would abide by this remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Transcendent Spirit Sect had compromised to a certain extent and initiated the Genius Confrontation, there must be some reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also very excited, ready to challenge the geniuses of the Spirit Realm, but then the Genius Confrontation came, and even a genius ranking list was released.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Perfections Pavilion, a top-tier sect under the Thousand Martial Palace, has the three perfections of sword, spear, and fist. It's just right for me to refine my dao of the knife." Meng Chong rubbed his head excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Pavilion is also a sect under the Thousand Martial Palace, the sword dao genius Yu Changfeng, he will be the first one I challenge." Xu Yan had also chosen his target, his face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly wait to go challenge Yu Changfeng, to let the Sword Pavilion see what true sword dao was!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's Mysterious Gate Armory had reached the final critical moment of refinement.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, the armory burst with light. </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao infused a few drops of his essence blood, and on the surface of the armory was a pattern, which was a copy of the Heaven and Earth Mysterious Pattern within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Retract!"</p><p></p><p>With an excited finger tap, the Mysterious Gate Armory instantly shrank and turned into a beam of light, entering his body.</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's face was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>To refine this Mysterious Gate Armory, he had spent too much time and energy, and also consumed many treasures from the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family.</p><p></p><p>Especially some rare materials, they were almost depleted.</p><p></p><p>But it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming and Yue'er were stunned, what was this technique? What kind of spiritual weapon was refined that could be absorbed into the body?</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Yue, you are the grand elder of my Jade State Alliance, tell me what weapon you need, I'll make it for you."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at Yue Changming and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming had followed him and become the grand elder of the Jade State Alliance, with Yue Changming by his side, he would even have a high status in the main alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Alliance Master." Yue Changming said excitedly, "The Crescent Moon Blade I used before was destroyed, so please refine a pair of Crescent Moon Blades for me."</p><p></p><p>He described the appearance of the Crescent Moon Blade.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded, refining this pair of Crescent Moon Blades was not difficult for him, and the grade would be much higher than Yue Changming's previous one.</p><p></p><p>The power would also be much stronger, beyond what the Spirit Realm's spiritual weapons could compare to.</p><p></p><p>After all, the spiritual weapons refined by Fang Hao were far beyond the so-called spiritual weapons of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I want one too, I want one too!" Yue'er exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>She took out a pile of refining materials from her storage bag and said, "I have these to refine with."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er wanted to refine a whip and a pair of Crescent Moon Blades.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao immediately agreed and started the refinement.</p><p></p><p>Chicat, Jade Little Dragon, and Xiao Ha all gathered around...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held the jade talisman in his hand, hung it on his back, and walked with a leisurely pace up the mountain peak next to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>His disciple was about to walk into the Spirit Realm and challenge the geniuses of the Spirit Realm, to ascend to the peak of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, the challenge he faced was not only the geniuses of the Spirit Realm, but also the powerhouses of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Including the Supremes! His invincible path was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan needed to pass on the realms beyond the divine sense realm to Xu Yan, so that he would have the opportunity to comprehend them while walking the invincible path.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Appearance Realm is the control of the laws of heaven and earth, the divine martial appearance. And beyond the Divine Appearance Realm, one naturally cannot transcend heaven and earth, but can further break free from the constraints of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"And this constraint is the space of heaven and earth, to shatter space and travel through the void, unhindered by the laws, to penetrate the laws.</p><p></p><p>"This is the beginning of transcending heaven and earth, breaking free from the constraints of the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>After these days of contemplation, Li Xuan had determined the realms beyond the Divine Appearance Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Appearance Realm transforms the laws of martial dao into the divine appearance, controlling the laws of heaven and earth. And beyond the Divine Appearance Realm is the Shattering Void Realm, where one breaks through the constraints of the space of heaven and earth, traversing the laws of heaven and earth without obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the space, crossing the void, transcending the laws of heaven and earth, roaming freely!</p><p></p><p>Advancing further towards transcending heaven and earth! Beyond the Divine Appearance Realm is the Shattering Void Realm! Shattering the space of heaven and earth, crossing the void, disregarding the resistance of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Shattering Void Realm, although not yet transcending heaven and earth, has already surpassed the laws of heaven and earth, unbound by the constraints of the space of heaven and earth, not far from the true meaning of transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, breaking through the Shattering Void Realm is not easy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the information on the Shattering Void Realm given by the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Technique for the Shattering Void Realm: Technique Perfection Degree: Medium.</p><p>Realm Connection Degree: Medium-High.</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: High.</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High+.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cultivation difficulty given by the Great Dao Golden Book, he knew that cultivating the Shattering Void Realm was not easy, after all, it was about shattering space and crossing the void, disregarding the laws and constraints of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivation difficulty was high, as long as he could comprehend it, he would be able to obtain the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book and break through to the Shattering Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>And for Xu Yan, once he had comprehended it, the actual cultivation would only be a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Shattering Void Realm, I still don't have a clear idea of how to cultivate further. I can't leap too far ahead, as the martial dao realms are raised, the subsequent realms will also be easier to compile.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just pass on the Divine Appearance Realm and the Shattering Void Realm for now, hoping that Xu Yan can comprehend them before ascending to the peak of the Spirit Realm in the Genius Confrontation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had already compiled the subsequent martial dao for Xu Yan, but he had not yet compiled the cultivation beyond the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body for Meng Chong's physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>He could only pause for now, after all, Meng Chong was still far from completing the cultivation of the third layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>There was enough time to slowly ponder the subsequent cultivation of the physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you can't wait, you're eager to go meet the geniuses of the Spirit Realm, aren't you?" Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan said with an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Demon Lord came from the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, fleeing to the Inner Realm, with a group of powerful cultivators pursuing and attacking him here. </p><p></p><p>"The Demon Lord alone slaughtered all his pursuers, but he was also grievously wounded."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun spoke excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Spiritual Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was very curious.</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that it is the gate leading to the Spiritual Realm, but I don't know the specifics. Those who know of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm are extremely rare in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I only know this much by chance, even my father the Emperor doesn't know about it."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun said proudly.</p><p></p><p>As they delved deeper into the ravine, the chill grew more intense, to the point that even Ziyun seemed unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>"This chill is not right!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's the residual power left behind by the powerful cultivators who were killed when they ambushed the Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>For such a long time, the residual power still remained, showing how formidable those cultivators were.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also related to the special terrain of the ravine or some other factors.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun took the opportunity to cling to Meng Chong again, curling up like a little cat.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Golden Body apertures started circulating, and the chill surged into the apertures, nourishing the Golden Body. At this moment, Meng Chong suddenly gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body was extremely powerful and unyielding, but to advance and transform, he needed to accumulate a solid foundation, and the nourishment of the Golden Body apertures was crucial.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong realized that by using the chill to nourish himself, he could activate the yang vigor of the Great Sun Golden Body. Yin and yang interacting and transforming, he would be able to advance and break through.</p><p></p><p>"The breakthrough is right in front of me, the opportunity has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Continuing forward, he suddenly saw a concave area at the base of the mountain wall, covered in a thick layer of ice.</p><p></p><p>The yin-cold energy was emanating from the concave area.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, it seemed that under the thick ice, there was a broken corpse.</p><p></p><p>And the source of the chill was this corpse.</p><p></p><p>The remains of the powerful cultivators who had ambushed the Demon Lord, containing the yin-cold power they had cultivated, had diffused and accumulated in the concave area.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, the icy chill was still bone-piercing. The power of this expert was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked around the ravine, feeling that this place seemed to have some special qualities that allowed the residual power of the experts to dissipate slowly.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that even after such a long time, the remaining power of the experts was still formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Choosing to ambush the Demon Lord here was likely also because of the special nature of this place."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He walked towards the concave area in the mountain wall, and the yin-cold energy became even more piercing, like fine needles stabbing into his body.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, what are you going there for? It's too cold."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun's delicate body trembled, her teeth chattering, her face paling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grabbed her and threw her back, saying, "I need to cultivate for a while, you stay out here for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Ziyun's angry protests, he directly entered the concave area.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he felt the chill like needles constantly stimulating him, but the Great Sun Golden Body immediately started rotating, shining with golden light, his body like a human sun.</p><p></p><p>"This person died quite miserably!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the shattered corpse under the thick ice in the concave area, as if it had been slashed dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged in the concave area and began to cultivate, preparing to break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun could only watch helplessly from afar, waiting for Meng Chong to finish his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lifting her head to look deeper into the ravine, there was a hint of caution in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Hunting Battlefield, will there really be a Jade Token? The Gate of the Spiritual Realm, it shouldn't be too far from here, but how to open it, why can't I see it?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun took out a small notebook from her storage bag and began to study it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Meng Chong sitting in the lotus position had his body radiating golden light, and the ice in the concave area seemed to be melting.</p><p></p><p>The permeating yin-cold energy had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong's aura surged, the golden light grew stronger, and his aura became more powerful.</p><p></p><p>His bald head reflected the light, and he sat there like a golden arhat.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun put away the notebook and watched from afar, her eyes filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the Great Sun Golden Body was a foregone conclusion, and Meng Chong had broken through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm, and at the same time, he had advanced and transformed, becoming a Golden Immortal Body!</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was exhilarated as he sensed the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>"This advancement and transformation has made the Great Sun Golden Body even stronger, with a more solid foundation. This is the Penetrating Mystery Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood up, carefully feeling the changes in his physical body.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Body apertures were filled with profundity, and with just a thought, he could manifest a thirty-foot golden body, becoming a small giant!</p><p></p><p>"With my current physical body, even treasured weapons would have difficulty harming me!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling his master's feat of single-handedly pushing back dozens of peak sect masters, Meng Chong reckoned that he could probably do the same now. Manifesting the thirty-foot golden body, becoming a small giant, and disregarding the attacks of great sect masters, directly pushing them away with brute force.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Hunting Battlefield is a good place!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked towards the depths of the ravine.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun ran up to him, her face flushed, and she reached out to caress his sturdy and powerful muscles, which were filled with a formidable aura.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong slapped her hand away, frowning, "Keep your hands to yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun pouted and giggled, "Meng Chong, congratulations on your further advancement in strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued walking into the ravine, and not far away, he saw a fifth-grade spirit herb under the mountain wall.</p><p></p><p>The spirit herb was crystalline, blending into the snowy white, almost overlooking it.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun went forward to dig up the spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>As they continued forward, they discovered several more fifth-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"This is strange, fifth-grade spirit herbs are extremely rare, how come there are so many here?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>"It should be that the powerful cultivators who ambushed the Demon Lord had spirit herb seeds on them, which scattered and grew into fifth-grade spirit herbs over the years!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glanced at her, this woman knew a lot of things, she must know some secrets about the Demon Hunting Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking for here?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"A Jade Token!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun's expression became serious. "Finding the Jade Token can open the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, Meng Chong, why don't you come with me then?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Meng Chong with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong replied evasively.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spiritual Realm, what kind of place it was, was still unknown, and he felt that his current strength was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for what the Jade Token was, he couldn't be bothered to ask further.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly stopped in his tracks, his gaze grave as he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>A faint aura was perceptible up ahead, and he saw a massive footprint in the snow.</p><p></p><p>It was the footprint of a fierce beast!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>As the two of them appeared, the fierce beast in the depths of the ravine seemed to have sensed their presence and let out a low growl. Soon, a giant, humanoid beast came into view.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive bear, standing upright and walking, its snow-white fur blending in with the snowy landscape, like a moving snowflake.</p><p></p><p>The giant bear standing upright was over twenty feet tall, like a small giant. What troubled Meng Chong even more was that the bear had a short spear gripped in one of its paws! The spear was not actually short, it just appeared so compared to the bear's massive stature.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, the situation is not good, we need to flee!" Zi Yun said with a changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"You retreat! I'll handle this," Meng Chong said grimly as he drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>He realized that this giant bear was not quite normal, its eyes had a non-bestial gaze.</p><p></p><p>"But..." Zi Yun was anxious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the giant bear approaching ever closer, its fierce aura surging, and its speed increasing, she could only retreat to a distance, afraid of hindering Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>After retreating far away, Zi Yun hurriedly flipped through the small book, "It didn't say there was a giant bear here!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The giant bear began to charge, raising the short spear in its paw, the spearhead gleaming with a cold light as a sharp aura swept towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The spear beam tore through the thick snow, lunging at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A majestic aura burst forth from Meng Chong, his sword cutting through the spear beam. Instead of retreating, he advanced directly, intent on slaying the bear.</p><p></p><p>He had just entered the Tong Xuan realm, and this was a good opportunity to temper himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this snow bear was no ordinary beast, and killing it would be a good harvest. The white fur, if presented to his master, would not be in vain for this trip.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The bear's eyes seemed to express surprise at Meng Chong's strength, and the spear beam surged out again, countless spear beams shooting out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a roar, his sword sweeping up a thunderous aura, slashing out like a raging storm, engaging the giant bear in battle.</p><p></p><p>However, the giant bear's towering stature gave it an advantage.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the massive bear, Meng Chong, though burly, seemed like a child.</p><p></p><p>Clang! The sword and spear collided, and Meng Chong felt his palm tremble, his treasured sword slightly shaking. His expression changed - the bear's spear was no ordinary treasure!</p><p></p><p>The battle grew increasingly fierce, Meng Chong's sword flashing with a domineering aura, but the bear also exuded a powerful pressure, like a divine might, trying to suppress his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was neutralized by Meng Chong's domineering sword intent and could not take effect.</p><p></p><p>"A giant bear at the Half-Step Celestial Realm?" Meng Chong's brow furrowed. This pressure was more refined than the pressure exuded by the Hidden Pavilion's master, able to directly suppress the spirit.</p><p></p><p>Yet it seemed weak.</p><p></p><p>And vaguely, it gave him a familiar feeling, as if he had once sensed this faint pressure and fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Meng Chong asked sternly as he battled the giant bear.</p><p></p><p>From its appearance to now, the bear had not let out a single roar, not even a low growl, which was uncharacteristic of a beast.</p><p></p><p>The spear beams grew increasingly fierce, surges of powerful aura pulsing from the bear's body, its eyes becoming more and more ruthless, its attacks suddenly growing much stronger, and continuing to strengthen.</p><p></p><p>It was as if its power was awakening.</p><p></p><p>And that pressure and fluctuation also became more intense.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, the bear's spear clashed with Meng Chong's sword, and at that moment, the bear seemed to have calculated it perfectly, as its other paw swiftly struck down.</p><p></p><p>Not towards Meng Chong, but onto the sword and spear.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Meng Chong felt a massive force strike his sword from the side, and the long spear vibrated as if stuck to the sword, and with the bear's strike, a force tried to knock his sword away.</p><p></p><p>The giant bear's combat experience was rich, like a seasoned warrior, able to use cunning to disarm the enemy during battle.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression remained unchanged as he punched out, the thunderous fist force striking the long spear, and in an instant, both the sword and spear flew away.</p><p></p><p>The bear paid no heed, its two paws crashing down, the palms flipping, kicking up swirling snow, the powerful palm force like towering mountains pressing down on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong struck out with his fists, colliding head-on with the giant bear, the thunderous sounds echoing through the ravine as craters appeared on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The giant bear was towering and powerful, its physique formidable, occupying the advantage, its palms constantly striking, and even its standing legs would kick out when the opportunity arose.</p><p></p><p>This was not the way a normal bear should fight.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's aura surged, his eyes gleaming with icy coldness. He increasingly felt that the bear's pressure and the surrounding fluctuations were familiar.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, an image of a bug flashed in his mind, followed by the figure of Senior Wu!</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Wu was weak and that bug was not strong, the pressure they exuded was almost identical to the bear's!</p><p></p><p>This bear must have been possessed!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong roared furiously, coldly saying, "No matter what you are, you will die today!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his anger surged. In his previous battle with Senior Wu, he had nearly died, and the other party had inexplicably tried to kill him. The giant bear in front of him seemed to be the same.</p><p></p><p>"You think, by relying on your powerful beast body, you can gain the advantage?" Meng Chong realized the other party's intention, as it constantly drew closer, wanting to use its massive, formidable physique to suppress and engage in close-quarters combat.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In that instant, golden light burst forth from Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"When it comes to comparing physiques and close-quarters combat, I fear no one!" </p><p></p><p>His acupoint cultivation cycled, and in that moment, the changes nurtured in his acupoints were unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Under the giant bear's astonished gaze, Meng Chong's body seemed to inflate like a balloon, his clothes instantly shattering.</p><p></p><p>Golden light swirled around him, his bulging muscles exuding a powerful, fierce aura, his eyes glaring, his bald head gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a roar, his fists clenched, looking down at the snow bear from his towering height.</p><p></p><p>With his Three-Zhang Golden Body unleashed, the situation had reversed, and he was taller, more muscular, and more formidable than the giant bear!</p><p></p><p>The giant bear was already stunned, its body trembling slightly, its eyes revealing panic, yet also containing ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's engage in close-quarters combat!" Meng Chong sneered.</p><p></p><p>A fist whirling up wind and thunder, he struck down.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The giant bear let out its first roar.</p><p></p><p>Dropping to all fours, it charged towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression hardened. He sensed that the faint fluctuation had disappeared from the bear's body, as if hidden somewhere?</p><p></p><p>A dangerous aura! But Meng Chong was not the least bit afraid. With his Three-Zhang Golden Body unleashed, he was invincible at the moment.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

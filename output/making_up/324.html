        <h1>Chapter 324</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan, accompanied by Ziyun Emperor, headed to the Thousand Martial Hall, where they were brewing plans for an action against the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion had already descended upon the famous scenic spot of Small Star Lake in the Great Zhou Kingdom, and the number of consultations and visits they allowed per day did not exceed a hundred, first-come-first-served.</p><p></p><p>On Small Star Lake, there was a queue of wounded martial artists from all over the Great Zhou, as well as some prodigies, all wanting to ascend the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the miraculous medicinal arts of the pavilion, the Evergreen Pavilion itself was an astonishing divine artifact, and many powerful experts wanted to ascend the divine artifact and witness its extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion atop the Evergreen Pavilion, Li Xuan was seated calmly, and Su Ling Xiu was massaging his shoulders. "Master, I'm preparing to cultivate the pill-refining technique I've comprehended, and I need some special raw materials to practice with. I need your help."</p><p></p><p>"Your master doesn't have any heavenly materials or earthly treasures to give you," Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not heavenly materials or earthly treasures, I want you to help me condense some heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms and laws of the Dao. I want to use the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms as the main materials to cultivate a new pill-refining technique," Su Ling Xiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The pill-refining technique Su Ling Xiu wanted to cultivate was the Heavenly and Earthly Divine Furnace Pill-Refining Technique that she had comprehended. She planned to use the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms and laws of the Dao as the main materials to practice the Heavenly and Earthly Divine Furnace Pill-Refining Technique, and the pills refined would make even the strongest experts in the Spiritual Realm envious.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>She took out a few small bottles, which were used to store the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms and laws of the Dao, and were refined by Fang Hao, containing seals that could lock up the spiritual mechanisms and laws of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and grasped, and the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms condensed in his hand, continuously being poured into the small bottles.</p><p></p><p>He could even grasp and condense the laws of the Dao, let alone the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu plugged the bottles, sealing the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms inside.</p><p></p><p>She then took out a few more small bottles.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and grasped, and the laws of the Dao condensed, with a thread of the laws of the Dao being poured into each small bottle.</p><p></p><p>The reason he only poured a thread into each bottle was that he was worried that too much of the laws of the Dao would be beyond Su Ling Xiu's control, as this was her first time refining pills with the laws of the Dao, and she was using them to cultivate a new pill-refining technique.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Su Ling Xiu was excited, putting the small bottles away and hurrying off to refine pills.</p><p></p><p>As for the visiting martial artists, they were naturally received by Shi Er and the others, and Yue'er was busy assisting her, having no time to deal with these trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>As for Cai Lingier, she was no different from Li Xuan's maids, always serving Li Xuan, and had even started learning how to make delicious spiritual cakes and other delicacies.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion's flying boat formation had already been activated, and those who wanted to ascend the Evergreen Pavilion could only enter through the gate, and they needed to obtain permission to do so.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Meng Shushu were directly providing medical treatment at the entrance, and they even refused to let people in if they had no injuries. </p><p></p><p>When it was time to be overbearing, they would be overbearing. The Evergreen Pavilion had the confidence to do so.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous sound came from the refining room specially prepared for Su Ling Xiu in the Evergreen Pavilion's flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!" Yue'er's originally delicate white face was now blackened by the smoke, and black smoke was still coming out when she coughed.</p><p></p><p>"Miss!" Zhou Ying was startled and hurriedly rushed into the refining room.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's hair was a bit messy, but she was uninjured, with a sullen expression on her face. The furnace had actually exploded! Yue'er was even blackened by the charred spiritual medicine.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, I'm fine," Su Ling Xiu shook her head and took out another bottle, preparing to refine the pills a second time.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er came over, holding the spiritual medicine, ready to add it to the furnace according to Su Ling Xiu's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying could only retreat from the refining room. Her strength was weak, and if an explosion occurred, Su Ling Xiu would have to protect her, making it even more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hands, Su Ling Xiu's spiritual power transformed into a furnace, and the furnace flames burned, with a thread of heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms being thrown into the furnace, slowly breaking the seals that confined the spiritual mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>With a light sound, the refining room shook.</p><p></p><p>"It failed again," Su Ling Xiu looked at the black pill in her hand, a bit regretful, "If Crimson Cat were here, this pill wouldn't have been wasted."</p><p></p><p>After three failures, Su Ling Xiu finally succeeded in refining the pill using the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, and she was excited, as was Yue'er.</p><p></p><p>This meant that she could condense the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms into her spiritual sea more quickly and easily.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms are actually everywhere. Even these spiritual medicines contain heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, otherwise they couldn't be spiritual medicines. It's just that the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms contained in them are extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>"The higher the grade of the spiritual medicine, the more heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms it contains. But once the spiritual medicine is picked, the spiritual mechanisms will dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"We must find a way to completely seal the spiritual mechanisms contained in the spiritual medicines when picking them, so that they won't dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Only then can we rely on the spiritual medicines to refine pills by extracting the spiritual mechanisms within them," Su Ling Xiu thought as she looked at the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanism pill in her hand.</p><p></p><p>She could ask her master to condense the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms for her pill refining. If she couldn't condense the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, wouldn't she be unable to refine pills?</p><p></p><p>So she needed to find a middle ground, even if the pill effects were a bit weaker, as long as she could refine the same type of pills without relying on the help of powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>As for refining pills with the laws of the Dao, there was no way around it - she had to rely on the help of powerful experts to condense the laws of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I don't have to rely on powerful experts, perhaps I can rely on formations to condense the laws of the Dao," Su Ling Xiu pondered, deciding to have Fang Hao research how to use formations to condense the laws of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Evergreen Pavilion, there was a long queue, including many prodigies of the Great Zhou Kingdom and people of noble status, but they were being kept waiting, naturally causing some resentment. However, Shi Er and Meng Shushu paid no attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to immerse himself in the great martial dao, adding another divine technique to the Martial Divine Classic.</p><p></p><p>The theoretical framework for the realms beyond the Void Boundary had been further improved.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent cultivation methods for the physical martial dao had also been outlined, and the first layer had been compiled.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the path of cultivating the Wisdom Sword Realm, you have broken through to the Wisdom Sword Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned for a moment, then became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Such a mysterious Wisdom Sword Realm, such a profound and difficult-to-comprehend third realm of the sword dao, and Xu Yan had actually found the direction for its cultivation?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his sword dao had broken through to the Wisdom Sword Realm, and the profound and mysterious realm had manifested.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Wisdom Sword Realm!" Li Xuan sighed inwardly, no wonder it was the third realm of the sword dao he had compiled, so profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had not advanced, but by entering the Wisdom Sword Realm in his sword dao, his strength had undergone a tremendous increase!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a water sword condensed on the shore of Small Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>This sword seemed to have its own intelligence, as if it naturally grasped the Dao of the Water Sword.</p><p></p><p>On the shore of Small Star Lake, an eight or nine-year-old boy was holding a sword and swinging it, muttering, "I want to become the second Xu Yan, I also want to become a powerful swordsman!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Friend, do you like the way of the sword?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice came.</p><p></p><p>The little boy looked up, his eyes widening in shock.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a water sword stood upright, its blade even twisting, and the hilt seemed to have a mouth, speaking: "Can you tell me why you like the way of the sword?"</p><p></p><p>"You, you are, what are you?"</p><p></p><p>The little boy was a bit surprised, but he was not scared away by this sight.</p><p></p><p>"I am a water sword, mastering the way of the sword of water."</p><p></p><p>"Can you teach me then?"</p><p></p><p>"I can, but first tell me why you like the way of the sword."</p><p></p><p>"My idol is Xu Yan, I want to be like him and go challenge the gate of the Lingzong Sect in the future!" the little boy said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, you have ambition, come grip me, and I'll guide you into the way of the sword."</p><p></p><p>The water sword nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The little boy was extremely excited, stepping forward and grabbing the hilt of the water sword with both hands, taking the water sword back home. But as soon as the little boy returned home, he found that a battle was erupting in his house.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that his family's enemies had come, and his parents were desperately resisting, but they were already wounded.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen'er, run away quickly!" </p><p></p><p>His mother saw him and cried out in panic.</p><p></p><p>"I won't run, I'll make you all die!"</p><p></p><p>The little boy held the water sword and charged forward, towards one of the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, follow my feelings and I'll guide you into the world of the sword."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the water sword came, and at that moment, the little boy's mind seemed to have entered a profound realm, it was not him wielding the sword, but the sword teaching him the way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! The fine and soft sword light, like rippling waves, soft as water, yet containing the sharpness of killing.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, all the enemies were slain.</p><p></p><p>The little boy was immersed in the profundity of the sword, while his parents were already stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The marvel of the wise sword!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had condensed a water sword, and then released it, resulting in the water sword bringing a little boy into the world of the sword, awakening his sword talent.</p><p></p><p>In a dozen years, this spiritual domain will produce a sword prodigy.</p><p></p><p>In a good mood, Li Xuan raised his hand and grabbed, the power of the laws of heaven and earth converged and was refined by him into a Dao Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Here you go!" </p><p></p><p>He casually tossed it to the colorful spirit girl who had just brought up a plate of spiritual cakes.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Colorful Spirit Girl was startled, but excited, hurriedly taking the Dao Pill and absorbing it into her spiritual soul, carefully comprehending and slowly refining it.</p><p></p><p>She became more and more convinced that her decision was wise, indeed staying by the side of the senior was the greatest opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan picked up a spiritual cake and put it in his mouth, nodding, "The taste is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Colorful Spirit Girl's heart was even more resolute, she must learn more pastry-making skills, as long as the senior is happy to eat, a casual reward would be the greatest opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Colorful Spirit Girl withdrew to comprehend the Dao Pill in her spiritual soul, while Li Xuan drank spiritual tea and ate spiritual cakes, continuing his great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked up and withdrew the flying boat formation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!" </p><p></p><p>Outside the Qingcheng Pavilion, Meng Chong came with Zi Yun, looking at the Qingcheng Pavilion with a look of amazement, this was the flying boat his junior brother had refined?</p><p></p><p>It was truly amazing.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun pays respects to the senior!" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, this girl, it seems, will become the second disciple's wife.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the jade talisman he had previously given to Zi Yun was infused with a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for your generous bestowal!" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun joyfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>When she was previously besieged, if Meng Chong had not intervened, she would have had to activate this jade talisman to fight desperately. But she was not sure about the power of this jade talisman, it should be able to subdue Cultivated Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Now that the senior has empowered the jade talisman, she will no longer fear even the strongest in the future.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was about to take Zi Yun to visit Su Ling Xiu, when suddenly his brows furrowed, his saber abruptly drawn, looking up at the sky, he coldly snorted, "Daring to come and cause a ruckus here?"</p><p></p><p>He was about to strike with his saber, but Li Xuan smiled and said, "Dreams are just illusions, you little girl, are you the Xin Mengrou that Wu Tian Nan spoke of."</p><p></p><p>The illusory image in the sky suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>A beautiful figure descended, she was shocked to see the figure sitting calmly in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou! She came from Taimiao Sect, only because Yaru told her that Xu Yan came from the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou first thought of Blood Spirit Master, could it be that he didn't die? </p><p></p><p>Was Xu Yan his disciple?</p><p></p><p>So she personally came to the Qingcheng Pavilion to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you were Blood Spirit Master, but it turns out you are from the Inner Realm after all?" </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou calmed herself and said.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm, there are such powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>"Both yes and no." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly exclaimed, looking at Xin Mengrou, as if he saw the shadow of Du Yuying, surprised, "Are you a descendant of Miss Du?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou nodded, looking at Meng Chong, her heart greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The two great prodigies of the Spiritual Realm were actually each other's disciples!</p><p></p><p>No, there was one more, the Pill Immortal Fairy of the Qingcheng Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed to the chair in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou sat down, withdrawing the illusory power that shrouded her, revealing her true appearance.</p><p></p><p>Breathtakingly beautiful, a peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, Xin Mengrou's cultivation method was not simple, dreamlike and illusory, extremely powerful. Even cultivators of the same realm, if not careful, would be trapped in the illusion, unable to distinguish dream from reality.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Wu Tian Nan had praised her so highly, claiming that in the entire Spiritual Realm, only Xin Mengrou was his opponent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also had a certain understanding, Xu Yan had found the way of the wise sword, it was likely related to Xin Mengrou's illusions.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"One, Xu Yan said that in front of his master, I am just an ant; two, I want to see if the powerful one from the Inner Realm is an old friend of mine." </p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou did not hide, she was a straightforward and outspoken person.</p><p></p><p>"And how do you feel about it now?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled slightly, his mysterious aura faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou took a deep breath and said, "The senior is unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>"What's so unfathomable, I'm just an ordinary idle person." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and smiled, his mysterious aura disappearing, he seemed like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, the more he was like this, the more shocked Xin Mengrou became, the more she felt he was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Colorful Spirit Girl did not continue to comprehend and refine the Dao Pill, but came over and served Li Xuan, pouring a cup of tea for Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou looked at her, her heart greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there such powerful Dao power in your spiritual soul?"</p><p></p><p>Colorful Spirit Girl had just been trying to comprehend and refine the Dao Pill, so there was a trace of Dao aura leaking out, causing Xin Mengrou to sense the Dao power contained in her spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

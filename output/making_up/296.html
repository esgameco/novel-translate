        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was completely dumbfounded, because he was too weak, so he did not have the qualifications to exchange insights on the martial dao with Xu Yan's master?</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and said, "Young friend, you may not know my strength, which is why you think I'm weak. Let me tell you, my current strength is almost at the limit of the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>He felt that Xu Yan said this because he did not understand his own strength. </p><p></p><p>He mistakenly thought that he was just an ordinary cultivator who had refined the spiritual essence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But he did not know that his strength had already reached the limit of the Spirit Realm, and he would definitely not be weaker than Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>"That's why I said you are weak," Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's mentality was about to collapse. Did Xu Yan not know what it meant to be at the limit of the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Dean Wu, although my words are a bit blunt, they are the truth. I don't want to deceive you," Xu Yan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>You really are an honest person! Wu Tiannan inwardly mocked, but on his face he said with a wry smile, "Young friend, you may not know how powerful the strength at the limit of the Spirit Realm is. I can assure you that I am definitely not weaker than your esteemed master."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him so stubborn, thinking that he was already at the peak of the Spirit Realm and could match his master, Xu Yan couldn't help but let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his hands and said, "Dean Wu, the strength at the limit of the Spirit Realm is really not that strong. I admit that you are powerful in the Spirit Realm, but my master - has already transcended the heavens and earth, he is a true supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>"In my master's eyes, you are really very weak. If you want to visit my master, you can contact the Jade State Alliance Master. If my master is willing to see you, it will certainly be a great opportunity for you.</p><p></p><p>"To meet a supreme expert, you must have deep blessings. Dean Wu, I wish you good luck. I'll take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Xu Yan's figure quickly disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>It's time to find a place to break through!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was dumbfounded, standing there blankly, his mind buzzing.</p><p></p><p>What was Xu Yan talking about? His master has already transcended the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>Can cultivators really transcend the heavens and earth? What kind of martial dao is that?</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to break through the limit of the Spirit Realm, but the idea of transcending the heavens and earth was something he had never even thought of, not only him, but probably countless other cultivators had never even considered this idea.</p><p></p><p>"To meet a supreme expert, you must have deep blessings. I wish you good luck?" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan looked in the direction Xu Yan left, his thoughts in disarray. There are supreme experts in this world who have transcended the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>And these supreme experts are actually not far from him?</p><p></p><p>"The Jade State Alliance Master? I must see this supreme expert, to see if he is truly a high-level expert!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strong curiosity welled up in Wu Tiannan's heart, and he even had the absurd idea that he must seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Wu Tiannan, Xu Yan came to a desolate and uninhabited mountain, found a place to sit cross-legged, and prepared to break through to the Divine Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p></p><p>As for whether Wu Tiannan believes it or not, and whether his master will see him, Xu Yan did not care. As he said, to meet a supreme expert, you must have deep blessings. If Wu Tiannan has this blessing, he will naturally be able to see the master.</p><p></p><p>He took out an array plate from his storage ring and waved his hand to set up a large formation. </p><p></p><p>These array plates were all forged by Fang Hao, and were prepared for traveling in the Spirit Realm. With the array plates, setting up formations was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not ignorant of formations.</p><p></p><p>After setting up the formation, Xu Yan began to break through to the Divine Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Thousand Martial Hall, a stage was set up, and one person slaughtered five geniuses. The name of the Sword Immortal Xu Yan was spreading rapidly throughout the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the competition among the geniuses in the Great Xuan City had reached a new level, and geniuses from all over were gathering there.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Knife Sovereign Meng Chong was also spreading at an extremely fast pace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Taixuan Peak, the headquarters of the Taixuan Sect, the lofty mountain was shrouded in clouds and mist, seeming ethereal and elusive.</p><p></p><p>On the Taixuan Peak, the elegant courtyards were dotted on the mountain like chess pieces, each one the residence of a Taixuan Sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other transcendent spirit sects, the Taixuan Sect did not have many disciples, and they were relatively aloof, not participating much in the martial dao competitions, making them seem even more transcendent, like a sect outside the world.</p><p></p><p>However, the strength of the Taixuan Sect has always been difficult to estimate, and it is even rumored that the Taixuan Sect is the number one spirit sect, transcendent and outside the world.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Sect disciples are mostly female, but there are also male disciples, though the Taixuan Sect has extremely high requirements for male disciples.</p><p></p><p>First of all, in terms of appearance, they can eliminate nine out of ten geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Sect has no ugly people, this is almost a common understanding in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>On the Taixuan Peak, in two adjacent elegant courtyards, a young lady, her jade-like face flushed, her eyes full of excitement and excitement, was hopping and jumping lively as she ran into one of the courtyards, heading towards the house.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, miss, big news, big news!"</p><p></p><p>She was shouting excitedly even before entering the house.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, as a disciple of the Taixuan Sect, you should be more composed," a woman's voice came from inside the house.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Miss," Cui'er pouted her little mouth and said, "I thought the Miss would be happy to hear the news about Young Master Xu."</p><p></p><p>"What? News about Xu Gongzi?" </p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying rushed out of the house.</p><p></p><p>She rubbed Cui'er's head anxiously and asked, "Quick, what news!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Cui'er sister, what news about Xu Gongzi?" </p><p></p><p>A graceful figure floated over from the neighboring courtyard, her face full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er became even more excited, blushing as she happily said, "Xu Gongzi is so amazing, he directly blocked the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall and challenged them!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan was mentioned, Cui'er became excited and her jade-like face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying and Yun Cangcang heard this and immediately became anxious. Xu Yan actually blocked the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall and challenged them? </p><p></p><p>That was a transcendent spirit sect after all.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Spirit Realm, especially being in the Taixuan Sect, they deeply realized the power of the transcendent spirit sects. Xu Yan blocking the Thousand Martial Hall's gate, wouldn't that be dangerous?</p><p></p><p>"Quick, what happened to Xu Gongzi?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Gongzi is so amazing, he defeated five geniuses single-handedly..."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er detailed all the news about Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal Xu Yan is now renowned throughout the Spirit Realm, known as the number one unaffiliated genius."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er became more and more excited, her eyes full of adoration, and finally asked, "Miss, when can you be with Xu Gongzi?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't wait to become a maid-in-waiting!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has become so strong? But he has offended the Thousand Martial Hall, even with the rules of the Genius Competition, the Thousand Martial Hall is said to be the most shameless..."</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's master, that senior was extremely powerful, but could one person really fight the entire Thousand Martial Hall?</p><p></p><p>She didn't know!</p><p></p><p>"The gap between me and Xu Yan is getting bigger and bigger, the Genius Competition has already begun, I can't fall behind either, I must participate."</p><p></p><p>Yun Cangcang gritted her teeth and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?" </p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"To find the Ancestral Master, I also want to participate in the Genius Competition, it's just that my strength is still too weak now!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Cangcang left without looking back.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ying hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, only Cui'er remained, dreaming of when she could become a maid.</p><p></p><p>In another courtyard, Wushuang had a helpless expression on her face. Hearing Xu Yan's name, her disciple and Du Yatou had their souls drifting away.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from being handsome, powerful, and having outstanding talent, what else is good about that kid?" she muttered to herself.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Xu Yan's master was more captivating!</p><p></p><p>After all, that senior could be the strongest of the strong! The peak of Taomiao Mountain, with light clouds, everything seemed unreal, like a dream.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao respectfully came to the small platform at the foot of the mountain and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Yuying seeks an audience with Grandmother!"</p><p>"Miaomiao seeks an audience with Grandmother!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, a dreamlike voice came from the mountain peak: "Come up."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the two carefully climbed to the mountain peak, coming to a grass hut where a beautiful figure sat, surrounded by light clouds, seeming unreal, like a dream.</p><p></p><p>The two bowed respectfully, heads lowered, not daring to look directly.</p><p></p><p>"What is it, speak."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, I want to participate in the Heavenly Prodigy Confrontation, but my strength is still too weak..."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, me too!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The light clouds surged, and no sound came, the surroundings were silent, and the two women became nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Then participate."</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to give up, the voice finally came.</p><p></p><p>Two jade tokens flew over and fell into their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Take the jade tokens and find the Sect Master, she will make the arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were overjoyed, hurriedly and respectfully saying, "Thank you, Grandmother!"</p><p></p><p>Holding the jade tokens, they carefully descended the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the person in the grass hut turned around, looking at the two women going down the mountain. On her flawless face, there was no expression, as if she was indifferent to everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, in the depths of her eyes, there was a trace of complexity, a bit of memory surfacing.</p><p></p><p>These two women, one was the bloodline she left behind in the Inner Realm to repay a debt; the other was also to repay a debt, leaving a legacy in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is like a dream."</p><p></p><p>A sigh sounded, and the clouds on the mountain peak became thicker.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Luozhou, the former location of the Crimson Abyss Sect, a manor was established.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was diligently working, very hard-working, while Li Xuan was sitting in a chair, leisurely reading the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had already seen the ninth page of the Taicangshu. </p><p></p><p>He had already seen half of it.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly laws on the ninth page were more profound and mysterious, constantly changing. To completely remember them, he needed to remember the changes in the laws on this page.</p><p></p><p>And the changes in the heavenly and earthly laws on the ninth page were not something that could be seen through in a short time, it required a certain amount of time to accumulate.</p><p></p><p>"This page of heavenly and earthly laws seems to be a fusion of nine pages, or it may be the general outline of the nine pages of heavenly and earthly laws," Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was still creating divine martial arts, and had already created several small divine arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Refining Deity Celestial, your combat experience has improved."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao opened, and a golden light surged out, Xu Yan had slain another Refining Deity Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was already used to this.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Refining Deity Peak, you have obtained the sixth move of the Divine Oblivion."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had slain a Refining Deity Peak, and the Divine Oblivion had already obtained six moves.</p><p></p><p>"Nine moves of the Divine Oblivion combined is a divine art, and another divine art is about to be completed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a look of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>Of course, news about Xu Yan would soon be passed on.</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng, the Sword Pavilion Prodigy, would naturally not be Xu Yan's opponent, even if he was the Sword Pavilion Master, because he cultivated the Sword Dao, and naturally would not be Xu Yan's opponent either.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had reached the initial success of the Heart Sword Realm, would be able to contend with the Sword Pavilion Master's sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Zhu Xingzheng, this little fatty was really diligent, this manor was almost all built by him, Shi Er and Meng Shushu were both idle.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, how do you think of this manor?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"This bottle of healing elixir is your reward."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling handed him a bottle of elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, you shouldn't say that, I, Zhu Xingzheng, am not doing this for a reward. It's just that I can't bear to part with Little Jin, and want to keep it company."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two ladies, he was not the kind of person who did rough work, so he lent a hand, but he never thought of any rewards.</p><p></p><p>He quickly put the elixir into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you're done here."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling rolled her eyes and turned to leave, but suddenly remembered something and said, "Oh yes, hang a sign, 'Long Qing Hall', and also spread the news that Long Qing Hall can treat all kinds of injuries and illnesses of martial artists in the world, including root damage, soul damage, essence and blood deficiency, and strange diseases.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it will cost money, the more serious the injury or illness, the more precious the medicinal materials required for payment, no spirit stones are accepted."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was stunned, swallowing a mouthful of saliva, and said in amazement, "Miss Su, you're not joking, right? Root damage, soul damage, can all be treated?"</p><p></p><p>Soul damage was not that serious, it could be healed by nourishing the soul with spiritual medicines, and slowly recuperate over time.</p><p></p><p>If the damage was severe, it would be almost impossible to completely recover.</p><p></p><p>Root damage was even more impossible to recover, it was an irreversible serious injury in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"They are all minor problems, as long as you can afford the spiritual medicines, my elixirs you've seen are not lies, are they?" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The path her senior brother and junior brother took was not suitable for her, she wanted to accumulate a foundation, enhance her insights, and improve her strength. Treating illnesses and injuries was an excellent way to do so.</p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely make it happen!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was extremely excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There were many severely injured martial artists in the Myriad Worlds Alliance, even some Supremes had been injured by the transcendent spiritual treasures of the Exalted Spiritual Sect, almost crippled, let alone recovering.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's true or not, just try it and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng decided to find someone to try it out, since they were already so injured, what if it really could cure them?</p><p></p><p>"Go now, first hang the sign of Long Qing Hall for me."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling said.</p><p></p><p>Then she took out a medicine bottle and walked towards the golden-horned deer, habitually taking out a pill and throwing it to it, just like feeding the red cat.</p><p></p><p>"Here, have a pill!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was excited, let out a light cry, raised its front leg and opened its mouth to catch the thrown pill.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was dumbfounded, this was a medicinal pill, just fed to the golden-horned deer like that? If he could fool the golden-horned deer, would it really come true, and he would never lack medicinal pills to eat in the future?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

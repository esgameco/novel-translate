        <h1>Chapter 505</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even he could not avoid it!</p><p></p><p>The other side intended to wipe out the Sea Spirit Clan! Although the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder had sent some Sea Spirits away from their territory to hide elsewhere, even so, once the Sea Spirit Clan's territory was destroyed, it would be extremely difficult for them to establish a foothold in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>They might even be enslaved, barely clinging to existence!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan snorted coldly. Mountains and rivers appeared, and in an instant, the other party's Divine Venerable aura was enveloped by this landscape.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and others hurriedly retreated, while instructing clan members to quickly leave this place. </p><p></p><p>It didn't matter if their territory was destroyed, as long as the clan members survived, they could rebuild.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures are none of your concern. Do you intend to take them by force? Since the treasures are with me, Xu Yan, no one can snatch them from my hands!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Dragon Subduing Youth, you do have some ability. No wonder you're so arrogant!" The cold and proud woman revealed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard you have a method to subdue dragons? This palace will give you a chance - tell me the dragon subduing method, and I'll overlook today's matter. However, you must hand over those two treasure robes.</p><p></p><p>To be frank, these are items our Realm Lord likes. You should know the consequences of intercepting the Realm Lord's treasures."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised. Those two treasure robes were actually items a certain Realm Lord liked?</p><p></p><p>"Your Realm Lord is female?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's thoughts turned, seeming to realize something.</p><p></p><p>Those two treasure robes seemed to belong to the Sea Spirit Empress, and were women's attire. Since that Realm Lord liked them, she was clearly female, and possibly acquainted with the Sea Spirit Empress. Judging from the cold woman's attitude towards the Sea Spirit Clan, she likely had a grudge against the Sea Spirit Empress.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Lord's status is not for you to inquire about! Xu Yan, I'll give you three breaths to consider - hand over the dragon subduing method and the treasure robes!"</p><p></p><p>A cold, crescent-shaped blade appeared in the proud woman's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, the Realm Lord's status? Which Realm Lord dares to covet my, Xu Yan's, possessions? Moreover, how dare a waste like you covet the dragon subduing method?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, and sword light surged forth, along with a vast and mighty aura that suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the mountains, rivers, and landscape shifted positions. Before the cold woman could react, the two of them had been moved from the Sea Spirit Palace to the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>"You?" The cold woman's expression changed. What kind of technique was this, that even she, a Divine Venerable, couldn't respond in time before being moved here?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Seawater surged into the sky, transforming into huge swords. Chilling sword light illuminated the heavens and earth, with an intent of annihilation and slaughter permeating the world.</p><p></p><p>"Which Realm Lord covets my, Xu Yan's, treasures?" Xu Yan asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you dare kill me? I am the personal maid of Realm Lord Yun Luo!" The cold woman's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The chilling sword light and intent of annihilation and slaughter made her tremble with fear. She had never felt such a sense of crisis before.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword technique is this? Could this be his dragon subduing method?" The cold woman thought in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord Yun Luo, I see. I, Xu Yan, will remember this." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. The other party coveting the two treasure robes was a significant threat. If necessary, he would kill without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already given away both treasure robes.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, Xu Yan, shall slay a Divine Venerable in the Azure Sea Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed, and sword light descended fiercely, instantly enveloping everything.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, if you dare kill me, the Realm Lord won't spare you!" </p><p></p><p>The cold woman's expression changed drastically as she shouted in anger. The crescent blade in her hand radiated intense cold light.</p><p></p><p>Her Divine Venerable aura erupted, shaking heaven and earth. At this moment, she too was fighting for her life.</p><p></p><p>However, under the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword, no matter how desperately the cold woman fought, it was futile. The final result was her complete annihilation with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>The first Divine Venerable had fallen in the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>A Divine Venerable from the Yun Luo Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Xu, for coming to our rescue!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and others gratefully thanked him respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter." Xu Yan waved his hand and turned to leave, saying: "My promise to your Sea Spirit Clan still stands."</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully see Young Master Xu off!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was overjoyed, grateful for his previous wisdom in latching onto Xu Yan as a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>"A Divine Venerable has fallen?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle, who had been pretending to be dead, couldn't help but raise its head to look towards the Sea Spirit Clan's direction, its eyes revealing shock.</p><p></p><p>"That sword intent... it was Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Sea Turtle's heart was trembling. It truly hadn't misjudged - Xu Yan was indeed a monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, he had already slain a Divine Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, won't he be able to slay even Minor World Lords before long?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Ancient Sea Turtle couldn't help but get excited.</p><p></p><p>"My decision to give him the Primordial Turtle Shell back then was truly wise. The day of my recovery is near, and as for that great opportunity, Xu Yan might truly be able to obtain it. Following such a powerful expert would also be a great opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle sighed at its own foresight in recognizing talent.</p><p></p><p>"Continue pretending to be dead, and wait for Xu Yan to grow even stronger."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle continued its act of playing dead.</p><p></p><p>At Cloud Sky Island, Xu Yan reunited with Xie Lingfeng, while news of the Divine Venerable's death had already spread throughout the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The news that the Dragon Subduing Youth had slain a Divine Venerable in the Azure Sea Realm spread throughout the entire Divine Realm, shocking all martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This was even more shocking than when Xu Yan had previously subdued the dragon.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Venerable warrior, shortly after descending to the Divine Realm, had been slain by Xu Yan? It should be noted that the descended Divine Venerable's strength far surpassed that young dragon from before.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, Xu Yan's strength had greatly increased again. This rate of improvement was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Divine Realm, Tian Seventeen's scalp was now tingling!</p><p></p><p>Even Yin Jue's death hadn't made him so terrified.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yin Jue died at the hands of a Realm Lord, which wasn't particularly surprising. No matter how strong an Extreme's concealment techniques were, they couldn't resist a Realm Lord's might.</p><p></p><p>But the news of Xu Yan slaying a Divine Venerable made Tian Seventeen tremble with fear.</p><p></p><p>No one understood better than him how Xu Yan had risen step by step. His monstrousness had already exceeded imagination.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Nine Mountains Realm, Xu Yan's strength was still inferior to an Immortal Venerable. But now, he had already slain a Divine Venerable! How much time had passed?</p><p></p><p>In this short period, for most practitioners above the Spirit Refinement Realm, it wasn't even enough time to break through a minor realm. But Xu Yan had grown from being weaker than an Immortal Venerable to slaying a Divine Venerable! This cultivation speed, this rate of strength increase, could no longer be described merely as monstrous.</p><p></p><p>"In ten years, or a few decades, won't Xu Yan be able to slay Realm Lords?" Tian Seventeen couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He felt his scalp tingling and his heart trembling. If Xu Yan found out that he had targeted him before, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"This can't go on. We can't let him keep growing stronger. Otherwise, in ten or several decades, even Lord Tiansa might not be his match."</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Tianshiqi could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>"If one Supreme Lord is no match for him, what about three? Or five or six?"</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi's eyes flickered. Even if it angered the World Lords behind Xu Yan, they had to nip this in the bud. Otherwise, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few Supreme Lords descending to the Divine Realm this time, not just one or two. Some are independent cultivators, and others are Supreme Lords from weaker worlds. Xu Yan's dragon-subduing technique, his powerful martial arts, and even his secret technique for breaking through limits are all extremely tempting..."</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi began plotting in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Taking action himself was out of the question. He absolutely could not act personally - it was too dangerous. </p><p></p><p>But he could instigate and manipulate other Supreme Lords to take action, especially those who were frustrated by bottlenecks in their martial arts cultivation and unable to break through. For a chance at a breakthrough, they would certainly be willing to take risks.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with multiple Supreme Lords joining forces, it wouldn't even be considered risky. These Supreme Lord martial artists would surely be willing to take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>"Among the Supreme Lords descending this time, there are several who have long been seeking a chance for breakthrough. They've been stuck at the late Supreme Lord stage for a long time. There's even one who's nearly gone mad trying to break through to the Sovereign realm. They can all be put to good use."</p><p></p><p>In Tianshiqi's mind, a list of certain Supreme Lord martial artists descending to the Divine Realm this time appeared.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Lords from great worlds were not easy to manipulate and use. But those independent cultivator Supreme Lords, as well as those from small worlds, especially those who had long been desperately seeking breakthroughs, were easier to use and more willing to go all out.</p><p></p><p>"I can't handle this matter personally. Some Supreme Lords from the Tiansa World have also come this time. I'll let Seventy-six handle these things."</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi quickly decided on a candidate.</p><p></p><p>Instigating Supreme Lords to surround and kill Xu Yan was extremely dangerous. Tianshiqi didn't dare let anyone know he was behind this plot.</p><p></p><p>So he had to find a scapegoat.</p><p></p><p>Even if they failed to kill Xu Yan in the end and the matter was exposed, Xu Yan wouldn't immediately come after him. Instead, he would place the blame on the Tiansa Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a small fry. I must make myself into a small fry, the kind that's insignificant. That way, if Lord Tiansa is killed someday, I won't easily be targeted as a small fry..."</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi muttered to himself. He began plotting how to lower his role and status within the Tiansa Shadow.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the impression for outsiders. To Lord Tiansa, he would still be a subordinate worth cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Achieving this goal was not easy. He had to make outsiders see him as an insignificant small fry, while to Lord Tiansa he was still an outstanding subordinate worth cultivating.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't easy to achieve both, but Tianshiqi knew he had to do so just in case, for the sake of his own life.</p><p></p><p>"What if... what if Lord Tiansa is defeated? Could I defect to Xu Yan at the critical moment, backstab Lord Tiansa, save my own life, and even be valued as someone who abandoned darkness for light?"</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi pondered various problems he might encounter in the future and how to preserve his own life.</p><p></p><p>"First complete this task and see if we can nip Xu Yan in the bud."</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi began to take action. "Seventy-six is simple-minded. With a little arrangement, he'll go do it, while keeping me out of it. Even if he's exposed and captured by Xu Yan, he won't know I was the one plotting against him."</p><p></p><p>Not long after news of Xu Yan, the dragon-subduing youth who had made a name for himself in the Dao Realm, killing a Supreme Lord in the Azure Sea Realm spread like a storm across the entire Divine Realm, five Supreme Lords gathered together in a certain place.</p><p></p><p>"We've all come for Xu Yan, for the chance to break through our bottlenecks. Since we're joining forces, we should discuss the terms in advance to avoid any disputes later that could sour relations."</p><p></p><p>A white-haired Supreme Lord spoke solemnly, wearing a mask to conceal his appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>The other four Supreme Lord martial artists also wore masks, not revealing their true faces.</p><p></p><p>"Rumor has it that Xu Yan's dragon-subduing technique is not only capable of subduing dragons, but is also an incredibly powerful martial art that can break through the limits of the Supreme Lord realm. I've come for this technique, and I believe you all have as well."</p><p></p><p>Another Supreme Lord martial artist spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's agree - we'll each make a copy of whatever technique we obtain from Xu Yan. If there are any treasures we're interested in, we'll divide them equally. If there aren't enough treasures to divide equally, we'll allocate them based on who is stronger and who contributed more effort. How does that sound?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Supreme Lord laid out the distribution method.</p><p></p><p>"Let's do it that way!"</p><p></p><p>The five Supreme Lord martial artists, having finished their discussion, set off for the Azure Sea Realm with remarkable tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the five Supreme Lords left, a figure silently appeared, wearing a dark cloud mask.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshiqi is truly useless, not knowing how to seize the opportunity. Once I obtain the dragon-subduing technique and present it to the Lord, Tianshiqi's position will be mine."</p><p></p><p>With a movement, he silently followed the five Supreme Lord martial artists in secret.</p><p></p><p>"Five Supreme Lords, plus Seventy-six - can Xu Yan still match them?" Tianshiqi thought to himself from afar.</p><p></p><p>"If Supreme Lords can't defeat him, we'll have to wait for Sovereigns to descend. But I can't get too deeply involved in targeting Xu Yan anymore. I need to leave myself a way out."</p><p></p><p>Tianshiqi calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Sea Realm, Xu Yan's killing of a Supreme Lord shook the Divine Realm. Powerful figures like the Cloud Sky Island Master all respectfully visited Xu Yan, hoping to establish some connection.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, we'll meet again in the Azure Flower Realm!"</p><p></p><p>On this day, Xie Lingfeng bid farewell to Xu Yan, setting off for the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and his family left Cloud Sky Island, embarking on their journey to the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he also said goodbye to the Cloud Sky Island Master and the Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder. After leaving Cloud Sky Island, he was about to contact the Azure Sea Turtle.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached the Heaven and Earth realm, absorbing the principles of heaven and earth was not difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan also wanted to obtain more information about the Great Azure Heaven and Earth and the Unchanging Land beyond the sky from the Azure Sea Turtle.</p><p></p><p>He even hoped to learn about a certain great opportunity the Azure Sea Turtle had mentioned. Perhaps with this opportunity, he could comprehend the mysteries of the Creation realm.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the Azure Sea, Xu Yan suddenly halted and said with a mix of calmness and slight mockery: "Are Supreme Lord realm martial artists also so secretive that they dare not show themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Five figures surrounded him, their auras powerful. Each one's strength was no less than that of the Cloud Luo World Supreme Lord, and even somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Xu Yan?" the white-haired Supreme Lord asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"I am," Xu Yan replied calmly. "Have you also come for the dragon-subduing technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you already know our purpose, hand over the dragon-subduing technique. We won't make things difficult for you," the white-haired Supreme Lord said, his gaze sharpening and his aura surging with a threatening intent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

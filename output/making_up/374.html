        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The... the... Underworld Army? The Heavenly Citadel has fallen?" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was shocked beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>Although the Qi Yun Prefecture had already been bloodily sacrificed, and Blood Offspring Xu was also in the Qi Yun Prefecture, the fall of the Heavenly Citadel was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>But seeing this scene unfold before his eyes still left him utterly stunned.</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Citadel fallen, the Blood Slaves and Blood Servants invading the Azure Flower Realm would bring calamity that would last for a long time. Even if the Heavenly Citadel Upheaval was quelled again, it would still take a considerable amount of time to cleanse the Blood Slaves and Blood Servants within the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if some Blood Slaves and Blood Servants were to hide themselves deeply, by the time they were discovered, they would have likely already caused much havoc and bloodily sacrificed many people.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the remote small cities and towns, once they encountered this, they would be utterly powerless to resist, and would be completely bloodily sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>"This is disastrous!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He could almost imagine the turmoil the Azure Flower Realm would face, and how many weak small cities and towns would be massacred.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw two figures fleeing in a disheveled manner in the midst of the surging blood miasma.</p><p></p><p>Their auras, though chaotic, were extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Supremes!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's heart sank. Two Immortal Supremes working together were actually fleeing in such a disheveled manner. Could it be that it was not just Blood Offspring Xu? Even more terrifying was that if Blood Offspring Xu alone could force two Immortal Supremes to flee in such a disheveled manner, how terrifying would his strength be? Looking across the Azure Flower Realm, only the Great Mountain Emperor, the Myriad Thunder Sect Master, and the Heavenly Martial Sect Master would be capable of this, right?</p><p></p><p>These were the three strongest Immortal Supremes in the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So this is an Immortal Supreme?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also looked at the fleeing Feng Yan and Sui Hong Wu, slightly surprised, as their power was a little less than what he had estimated for Immortal Supremes.</p><p></p><p>"Are these two too weak, or did I previously overestimate the strength of Immortal Supremes?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but fall into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, crushing these two Immortal Supremes with a single hand would be effortless.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already reached the Void-Piercing Realm, and the Void-Piercing Power could slay Immortal Supremes, break open the Immortal Supremes' fusion with Heaven and Earth, and wield the power of a local domain, without much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his divine abilities, spiritual awareness, and physical body had all been enhanced a hundredfold. He could not be simply regarded as a Void-Piercing Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Offspring Xu? His strength is indeed impressive. So this is the power of the Blood Dao? Using pure blood as nourishment... No, the Underworld cultivators themselves are somewhat different, likely related to the Underworld environment.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Refinement to enhance one's strength seems rapid and powerful, but the drawbacks are also very obvious. The higher the realm, the easier it is to lose control and harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>"The only way to solve this problem is to settle one's foundation. But in doing so, one would lose the advantage of rapid strength enhancement.</p><p></p><p>"Yet without settling one's foundation, there will inevitably come a day when one loses control and harms oneself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was profound as he looked towards the surging blood miasma, like a raging storm, with the youthful and androgynous figure of Blood Offspring Xu leading the tens of thousands of Underworld Army.</p><p></p><p>Blood Refinement may enhance strength rapidly, but the drawbacks are also very obvious - the risk of losing control and harming oneself.</p><p></p><p>At Blood Offspring Xu's level, if he does not settle his foundation and continues to rely on Blood Refinement to improve himself, he will likely lose control and harm himself very soon.</p><p></p><p>It could be called "going mad with the Blood Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Rapidly advancing the Blood Spirit is impossible. Even if he does advance, he will quickly lose control and harm himself. Although he can temporarily suppress it with a supreme treasure, the time he cannot utilize the Blood Spirit's power while suppressing it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, who could now be considered a true master in the Dao, could see through the advantages and disadvantages of the Underworld Blood Dao technique at a glance. This was aided by his understanding of the Blood Spirit legacy left behind.</p><p></p><p>"So this is an Immortal Supreme, so strong!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "They're just a bit disheveled, that's all!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan: ...</p><p></p><p>Those were Immortal Supremes! Two Immortal Supremes working together could only flee, and they were in such a disheveled state, yet you all are so calm?</p><p></p><p>You actually have the heart to comment on them? "Blood Offspring Xu is too strong, the Underworld Army is surging menacingly, let's flee and defend at the Myriad Thunder Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan swallowed hard and suggested.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave him a sidelong glance, this True King Supreme from the Spiritual Realm, why was his courage so small?</p><p></p><p>"Just a small matter, what's there to be anxious about!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan: ...</p><p></p><p>Just a small matter? Were there even bigger matters in the Spiritual Realm? At this moment, Cheng Zhan was a bit dazed. These people from the Spiritual Realm, how could their tone be so grand?</p><p></p><p>As a True King Supreme himself, he had never seen such a scene, and was scared out of his wits, after all, two Immortal Supremes were fleeing in a disheveled manner, an unprecedented sight!</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Yan actually said it was just a small matter? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, looking at Meng Chong and the others, they seemed to very much agree with Xu Yan's "small matter" statement!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan took a look, the senior cultivators were so calm and composed, and suddenly he understood.</p><p></p><p>"I see, the two Immortal Supremes were fleeing in a disheveled manner, but with this senior, that makes three Immortal Supremes. And this senior is obviously stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Three Immortal Supremes working together can surely stabilize the situation, there's no need to panic!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling that he had figured it out, Cheng Zhan straightened his back and nodded, "Yes, no need to panic!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go find the two seniors and explain the situation, we'll join forces immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan hurriedly left the airship, rushing to communicate with Feng Yan and Sui Hong Wu, so that they could join forces without delay to deal with the threat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others: ???</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was truly a frog at the bottom of a well, unaware of the true power of their master! They disdained Cheng Zhan thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>As for the two True King Supremes who came with Cheng Zhan, they heaved a sigh of relief, nodding their heads, "Yes, joining forces, we can definitely deal with Blood Offspring Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others couldn't be bothered to say anything anymore, when their master acted, these people would know what a true expert was.</p><p></p><p>In their master's eyes, Immortal Supremes were no different from ants!</p><p></p><p>The two True King Supremes were a bit bewildered, since even the weaker cultivators like Wu Tian Nan were looking at them strangely, yet Xu Yan and the others didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hong Wu were in the midst of fleeing when they saw the mysterious giant airship ahead, their expressions immediately changing.</p><p></p><p>Such a divine artifact did not exist in the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the neighboring Nine Mountains Realm did not possess such a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>As for the entire Spiritual Realm, they had not heard of the existence of such a divine artifact for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Could it be another Underworld divine artifact, with another Underworld Blood Offspring entering the Azure Flower Realm? If so, the Azure Flower Realm was in grave danger! Feng Yan and Sui Hong Wu's expressions darkened, about to avoid the airship to prevent being attacked from both front and back, when a figure suddenly flew out from the airship.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, quickly come aboard the airship to join forces and deal with the formidable enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan called out hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, seems to be an elder from the Myriad Thunder Sect," Sui Hong Wu remarked with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Go ask!" </p><p></p><p>Sui Hong Wu said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu walked up to them.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sui Hongwu, the commander-in-chief of the Great Yue Inner Guard. And you are?" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was startled. So this was the commander-in-chief of the Great Yue Inner Guard. But now he seemed so disheveled. Rumor had it that this Inner Guard commander wielded a powerful halberd, but it was nowhere to be seen. This showed that he had encountered a grave crisis.</p><p></p><p>"I am Cheng Zhan from the Wanlei Sect. There is no time to waste, please come with me, senior..."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, there was an Immortal Venerable in the flying boat who told Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu. And this senior seemed even more powerful. With the three Immortal Venerables joining forces, they would surely be able to withstand the ferocious Blood Demon!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, with the three of us working together, we can hold off the Blood Demon. Wait for the Sect Master of the Wanlei Sect to make his move, and we'll annihilate him!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Blood Demon was about to chase after them, along with tens of thousands of Blood Slaves, the two did not dare to delay. They grabbed Cheng Zhan's shoulders, and their speed suddenly increased dramatically, arriving on the flying boat in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, their gaze fell on Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was an impatient person. He strode over and said, "There's no time to waste. The three of us working together can surely restrain the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pondering the fifth door of the Martial Dao. He raised his gaze and calmly said, "Young man, don't be so hasty."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was stunned for a moment, then he puffed out his chest and glared, looking furious. "What did you call me? Young man? Do you know who I am, Feng Yan..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised a hand and placed it on Feng Yan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan swallowed his saliva. "The senior actually called me a young man. I'm so excited, I'm so happy. I thought I had already grown old, but it turns out I'm still young."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan continued, "Senior, you've made me, Feng Yan, realize that I'm still young, that I can continue to strive. I'm truly grateful to you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at him. Was this man really so thoroughly cowed?</p><p>He seemed to be a very prudent person.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was about to persuade Feng Yan not to get angry, as the greater good was at stake. After all, a mighty Immortal Venerable being called a young man would be an affront to his dignity. And Feng Yan had a fiery temper, he was bound to explode in rage.</p><p></p><p>But to Sui Hongwu's surprise, Feng Yan had become docile, constantly addressing the senior with respect.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan himself was clear about it. At this moment, his heart was trembling. That hand resting on his shoulder, he had clearly seen it come, yet he was unable to avoid it. Even more terrifying was that in that instant, he felt as if a huge mountain was pressing down on him, as if he could be crushed into a meat patty at any moment!</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying! The strength of the person before him exceeded his imagination!</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to cower. Li Xuan withdrew his hand and said, "Be quiet."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan assumed the manner of a young junior, respectfully nodding and standing quietly to the side.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu realized something was amiss. Feng Yan was actually behaving like a young junior. He was greatly shocked. This person's strength must be extremely terrifying, otherwise Feng Yan would not have acted this way! "I, Sui Hongwu, pay my respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sui Hongwu hastily paid his respects reverently.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was completely dumbfounded at this point. Even Immortal Venerables were addressing this person as "senior". What an incredibly powerful existence this must be.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan had said this was just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, his gaze turning towards the surging horde of Blood Slaves, like a blood-red demonic storm, as well as the powerful Blood Demon wielding a crimson long saber that radiated a bloodthirsty chill.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Blood Dao may have allowed for rapid early-stage cultivation, but the drawbacks are also great. You have not walked the righteous path, yet you commit such brutal acts. What crime is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice thundered like the might of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon's expression slightly tightened, then he let out a cold laugh. "What drawbacks? I have simply not yet mastered the true transmission of the Blood Dao. Once I refine the Cyan Flower Realm and ascend to the Blood Spirit, I will become a true inheritor of the Blood Dao. How can you compare to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Master? A mere clown. So-called Blood Dao is nothing but a deviant and evil path!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>How powerful the Blood Master might be, he did not know. But that did not prevent him from disdainfully looking down on it, in order to showcase his own peerless and supreme bearing.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu involuntarily sucked in a cold breath. Just who was this senior? He actually looked down on the rumored Blood Master with such contempt, his words full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was also momentarily stunned, then he became enraged. "Insulting the Blood Master? I will refine you for three days and three nights, making you suffer the torments of the world..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the Blood Demon suddenly started trembling in shock.</p><p></p><p>In his moment of fury, Li Xuan had taken a step forward, towering majestically between heaven and earth, his imposing presence making the heavens and earth seem insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the flying boat was awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Venerables Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were trembling all over. What a terrifying existence was this? A supreme divine being?</p><p></p><p>Even Wu Tiannan and the others who knew Li Xuan was a peerless expert were stunned. Was this the true form of the great master? Although they had seen the master display the divine ability of Heavenly Manifestation before, the sight of it still left them greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was completely dumbfounded, his mouth agape.</p><p></p><p>"This is a great master, an unsurpassed great master!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan patted Cheng Zhan's shoulder, sighing in awe.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan swallowed his saliva, then became greatly excited. The great master had displayed his divine might, the Cyan Flower Realm was saved!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon felt his saber suddenly go limp, his entire being becoming numb. What a terrifying existence was this? Was the Blood Master himself this terrifying? He did not know!</p><p></p><p>"I call the Blood Master a clown, that is his honor. Otherwise, he would not even be worth a speck of dust!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice thundered down from the heavens, like the might of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A palm strike descended, and at the last moment, the Blood Demon unleashed the strongest power of his life, blood light surging to the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, all resistance was futile.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon and the tens of thousands of Blood Slaves were annihilated in that palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The power of that single palm strike shook heaven and earth. It was as if the heavens and earth were collapsing, trembling, and a black hole even appeared in the space between heaven and earth, as if unable to withstand the might of that palm, the laws of heaven and earth were shattered.</p><p></p><p>The black hole, with the laws of heaven and earth swirling around it, was gradually closing and restoring.</p><p></p><p>On the flying boat, Li Xuan sat calmly in the chair, observing the awestruck expressions of Feng Yan, Sui Hongwu, and the others. He was greatly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Let these divine domain cultivators witness the divine might of this peerless great master!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was dead! Tens of thousands of the Underworld's great army had been annihilated.</p><p></p><p>A great calamity had been effortlessly resolved.</p><p></p><p>The great master had displayed his divine power, shaking heaven and earth with a single palm strike! Even mighty Immortal Venerables like Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had their hearts trembling and their scalps tingling, watching the Blood Demon and tens of thousands of Blood Slaves turn to ash, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

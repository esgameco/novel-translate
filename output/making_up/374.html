        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The... the Netherworld army? Has the Heavenly Cave fallen?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was extremely shocked!</p><p></p><p>Although the city of Qiyun Prefecture had been blood sacrificed, and Blood Child Tu was in Qiyun Prefecture, the fall of the Heavenly Cave was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>But seeing this scene before his eyes was still incredibly shocking. </p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Cave fallen, blood disciples and blood slaves invading the Qinghua realm would bring disaster that would last for a long time. Even if the chaos at the Heavenly Cave was quelled again, it would still take considerable time to clear out the blood disciples and blood slaves within the Qinghua realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if any blood disciples or blood slaves managed to hide themselves deeply, by the time they were discovered, they may have already caused much trouble and blood refined many people.</p><p></p><p>Especially in remote small cities and towns, once encountered, they would have no way to resist and would inevitably be completely blood sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>"This is terrible!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He could almost imagine what kind of turmoil the Qinghua realm would face, and how many weak small cities and towns would be massacred.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw two figures fleeing in a sorry state ahead of the rolling blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Though their auras were chaotic, they were extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's heart sank. Two Immortal Venerables joining forces were fleeing so miserably - could there be more than just Blood Child Tu? Even more terrifying, if it was Blood Child Tu alone forcing two Immortal Venerables to flee so pathetically, how horrifyingly powerful must Blood Child Tu be? In the entire Qinghua realm, probably only Great Yue Emperor, Sect Master of Ten Thousand Thunders, and Sect Master of Heavenly Martial could achieve this?</p><p></p><p>These were the three strongest Immortal Venerables in the Qinghua realm.</p><p></p><p>"So these are Immortal Venerables?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also watched Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu fleeing pathetically, feeling a bit surprised in his heart. Their strength was somewhat less than what he had estimated for Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Are these two just too weak, or did I overestimate the strength of Immortal Venerables before?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he could crush those two Immortal Venerables ahead with one hand, without any difficulty at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was already at the Void Breaking realm. The power of Void Breaking could easily kill Immortal Venerables and shatter their unity with heaven and earth, controlling the power of a region of heaven and earth without much difficulty. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, his divine abilities, primordial spirit, and physical body were all enhanced a hundredfold. He couldn't be regarded as a simple Void Breaking martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Child Tu? His strength is indeed impressive. So this is the power of the blood path? Using blood essence as nourishment... No, Netherworld martial artists themselves are somewhat different, probably related to the environment of the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"Blood refining to increase strength seems rapid and powerful, but the drawbacks are also very obvious. The higher the realm, the easier it is to lose control and harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>"To solve this problem, the only way is to settle one's own body. But in doing so, one loses the advantage of rapidly increasing strength.</p><p></p><p>"However, without settling one's body, there will inevitably come a day of losing control and harming oneself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was deep as he looked towards the rolling blood qi sweeping forward like a storm. Among the tens of thousands of Netherworld troops, he focused on the effeminate young man at the lead.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu.</p><p></p><p>Blood refining may increase strength quickly, but its drawbacks were also very obvious - it was easy to lose control and harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>At Blood Child Tu's level, if he didn't settle himself and continued to blood refine to increase his strength, he would likely lose control and harm himself very soon.</p><p></p><p>It could also be called going berserk!</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to quickly advance to Blood Spirit is impossible. Even if one advanced, they would soon lose control and harm themselves. Even if one could temporarily suppress it with supreme treasures, waiting to slowly settle and digest it.</p><p></p><p>"But during the time of suppression, one cannot use the power of Blood Spirit. And if one forcibly uses it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could now be considered a great master of martial arts, truly worthy of being called an expert. He saw through the advantages and disadvantages of the Netherworld blood path techniques at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also due to him having read the techniques left behind by Blood Spirit Child, giving him a deeper understanding of the blood refining path.</p><p></p><p>"So these are Immortal Venerables. So strong!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "Just a bit too pathetic!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan: ...</p><p></p><p>Those are Immortal Venerables! Two Immortal Venerables joining forces can only flee, and so pathetically at that. How are you not panicking at all?</p><p></p><p>You even have the mood to comment and criticize?</p><p></p><p>"Blood Child Tu is too strong. The Netherworld army's momentum is fierce. Let's flee and return to Ten Thousand Thunders Sect to hold out!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan swallowed and suggested.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him. How could this True King Venerable from the Divine Realm be so cowardly?</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small scene, what's there to panic about!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan: ...</p><p></p><p>This is a small scene? Are there even bigger scenes in the Spirit Realm? At this moment, Cheng Zhan was a bit dazed. How could these people from the Spirit Realm speak with such big words?</p><p></p><p>He himself was a mighty True King Venerable, yet he had never seen such a scene before and was so frightened his heart was trembling. After all, two Immortal Venerables were fleeing pathetically! Unheard of!</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Yan actually said this was a small scene?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, looking at the expressions of Meng Chong and the others, they seemed to very much agree with Xu Yan's statement about it being a small scene!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan glanced at the senior who was calm and composed, and suddenly understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I see, two Immortal Venerables are fleeing pathetically, but with this senior added, that makes three Immortal Venerables. And this senior is clearly stronger.</p><p></p><p>"With three Immortal Venerables joining forces, it's enough to stabilize the situation. Indeed there's no need to panic!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking he had figured it out, Cheng Zhan immediately straightened his back and nodded, "That's right, no need to panic!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go explain the situation to the two seniors and we'll join forces immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan eagerly moved, flying towards Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>Time was pressing. To avoid miscommunication and inability to join forces in time, Cheng Zhan hurriedly left the flying ship to communicate in advance and join forces immediately to deal with the threat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others: ?? Join forces?</p><p></p><p>Old Cheng Zhan was truly a frog in a well, not knowing how powerful Master, this expert, was! They thoroughly looked down on Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>The two True King Venerables who came with Cheng Zhan felt relieved in their hearts and nodded, "Right, join forces. We'll definitely be able to deal with Blood Child Tu!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others couldn't be bothered to say anything more. When Master made his move, they would know what a true expert was.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerables were no different from ants in Master's eyes!</p><p></p><p>The two True King Venerables felt a bit dazed. Xu Yan and the others stopped talking, but even weaklings like Wu Tiannan were looking at them with strange gazes?</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were in the midst of fleeing when they saw the mysterious giant ship ahead. Their hearts skipped a beat and their expressions immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>Such a divine artifact absolutely did not exist in the Qinghua realm.</p><p></p><p>It also did not exist in the neighboring Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the entire Divine Realm, they had not heard of such a divine artifact existing for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a Netherworld divine artifact? Had another Netherworld Blood Child entered the Qinghua realm? If so, the Qinghua realm was in danger!</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's expressions turned gloomy. They were about to avoid the flying ship to prevent being caught between two forces, when they saw a figure fly over from the ship ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Seniors, quickly come to the flying ship to join forces and deal with the powerful enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan called out hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it seems to be an elder from Ten Thousand Thunders Sect."</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go ask!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu stepped forward to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sui Hongwu, commander of the Great Yue Imperial Guard. And you are?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was startled - it was actually the commander of the Great Yue Imperial Guard. But he now looked so disheveled. Rumor had it that this guard commander wielded a divine halberd as his weapon, but it was nowhere to be seen. </p><p></p><p>This showed what a crisis they must have encountered.</p><p></p><p>"I am Cheng Zhan of the Wanlei Sect. There's no time to lose, please follow me quickly, seniors..." Cheng Zhan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He then told Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu that there was an Immortal Venerable senior on the flying ship, and that senior seemed even more powerful. With three Immortal Venerables joining forces, they would surely be able to resist Blood Child Tu's fierce onslaught! Upon hearing this, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go! The three of us together can hold back Blood Child Tu. When the Wanlei Sect Master makes his move, we can destroy him in one strike!" Feng Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Blood Child Tu was about to catch up in pursuit, along with tens of thousands of blood slaves, the two didn't dare delay. They grabbed Cheng Zhan's shoulders and their speed suddenly increased dramatically, arriving at the flying ship in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With one glance, their eyes fell on Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan had an impatient personality. He rushed over quickly and said: "There's no time to lose. The three of us joining forces can surely hold back Blood Child Tu!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pondering the fifth gate of martial arts. He raised his eyes and said calmly: "Young man, don't be so hasty."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was stunned for a moment, then immediately puffed up his beard and glared, looking like he was about to explode in anger. "What did you call me? Young man? Do you know who I am? I, Feng Yan..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reached out a hand and placed it on Feng Yan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan swallowed hard. "Senior actually called me a young man. I'm so excited, I'm so happy! I thought I was already old, but it turns out I'm still young.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've made me, Feng Yan, realize that I'm actually still young, that I can still continue to strive forward. I'm truly so grateful to you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at him. Was this guy really so thoroughly cowardly?</p><p></p><p>He was quite a pragmatic person.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was about to advise Feng Yan not to get angry, to consider the bigger picture. After all, for a dignified Immortal Venerable to be called a young man was an affront to his dignity. </p><p></p><p>And Feng Yan had such a hot temper, he would surely fly into a rage.</p><p></p><p>But what did he hear instead? Feng Yan had cowered, and was calling the other "Senior" over and over?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Only Feng Yan himself knew clearly that his heart was trembling in fear at that moment.</p><p></p><p>That hand just rested on his shoulder. He clearly saw the hand coming, but was unable to avoid it. Even more terrifying was that in that instant, he felt as if he was being pressed down by an enormous mountain, about to be crushed into meat paste at any moment!</p><p></p><p>It was too frightening!</p><p></p><p>The strength of the person before him was beyond imagination!</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to cower! Li Xuan withdrew his hand and said: "Be quiet!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan nodded respectfully like a young junior, standing quietly to the side.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu realized something was amiss. For Feng Yan to act like a junior disciple, this person's strength must be incredibly terrifying. Otherwise Feng Yan wouldn't behave like this!</p><p></p><p>"Sui Hongwu pays his respects to Senior!" At this moment, Sui Hongwu hurriedly bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>By now Cheng Zhan was dumbfounded. For even Immortal Venerables to call someone "Senior", what an incredibly powerful being this must be.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan had said this was a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, his gaze turning to the army of blood slaves that had swept over like a bloody storm, as well as Blood Child Tu with his imposing aura, wielding a crimson long blade gleaming with a bloodthirsty cold light.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Blood Path may increase one's strength rapidly in the early stages, but it also has great drawbacks. You do not walk the righteous path, but instead commit such brutal acts. What punishment do you deserve?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice resonated like the majesty of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu's expression tightened slightly, then he sneered, "What drawbacks? I simply haven't received the true transmission of the Blood Path yet. Once I refine the Qinghua Realm with blood and ascend to become a Blood Spirit, becoming the heir of the Blood Path, how could the likes of you compare?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord? Nothing but a clown. The so-called Blood Path is nothing more than a crooked and evil way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly. </p><p></p><p>He didn't know how powerful the Blood Lord was, but that didn't stop him from expressing his disdain, in order to display his demeanor as a peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu secretly drew in sharp breaths. Who exactly was this senior? He actually didn't even take the legendary Blood Lord of the Netherworld seriously, his words full of contempt.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu was stunned for a moment, then flew into a rage: "You dare insult the Blood Lord?! I will refine you with blood for three days and three nights, make you suffer the world's..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Blood Child Tu suddenly began trembling in shock.</p><p></p><p>As he was raging, Li Xuan took a step forward, using the Heaven and Earth Manifestation technique to tower between heaven and earth. His majestic presence made heaven and earth seem tiny in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the flying ship was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu, who were Immortal Venerables, trembled all over. What terrifying being was this? A supreme god or demon?</p><p></p><p>Even though Wu Tiannan and the others knew Li Xuan was a peerless expert, they were still stunned at this moment. Was this the true form of an expert? Although it wasn't the first time they had seen their master use the Heaven and Earth Manifestation technique, Xu Yan and the others were still greatly shaken to see it again.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was already dumbstruck, his whole person in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"This is an expert, a supreme expert, you know?" Wu Tiannan patted Cheng Zhan's shoulder and said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan swallowed hard, then became extremely excited. The expert was displaying his divine might - the Qinghua Realm could be saved!</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu felt the blade in his hand go soft. His whole person was dazed, his heart trembling in fear. What terrifying being was this?</p><p></p><p>Was the esteemed Blood Lord this terrifying? </p><p></p><p>He didn't know!</p><p></p><p>"My calling the Blood Lord a clown is an honor for him. Otherwise he wouldn't even be worthy of being an insect!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice resonated down from the sky like majestic heavenly authority.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A palm struck down. At the last moment, Blood Child Tu roared in fury, unleashing the strongest power of his life. A bloody light shot up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, all resistance was futile.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous crash!</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu and the army of tens of thousands of blood slaves were obliterated to ashes with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The might of that palm strike shocked heaven and earth! It was as if heaven and earth were collapsing, as if they were shaking. They even saw a black hole appear between heaven and earth, as if the space of heaven and earth could not withstand the might of that palm strike and had collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth were entwined around the black hole, gradually mending and restoring it.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, Li Xuan sat calmly in his chair, looking at the shocked expressions of Feng Yan, Sui Hongwu and the others with great satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Let these Divine Realm martial artists witness the divine might of a peerless expert like himself!</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu was dead!</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of Netherworld troops had been obliterated to ashes.</p><p></p><p>A great calamity had been so easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>The expert had displayed his divine might, shocking heaven and earth with a single palm! Even ones as strong as Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu now had trembling hearts and tingling scalps, looking at the obliterated Blood Child Tu and tens of thousands of blood slaves as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

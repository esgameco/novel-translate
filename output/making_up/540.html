        <h1>Chapter 540</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ocean Turtle's voice trembled, its eyes filled with fear as it looked at Xu Yan and the other three. "I often think about how incredibly lucky I am. The entire world died, Hongze perished too, but I somehow managed to survive.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Turtle was so close to surviving as well, but in the end it couldn't hold on. Only its shell remained. When I left, I took the Primordial Turtle's shell with me.</p><p></p><p>"Every time I look at the Primordial Turtle's shell, I feel grateful for my own survival. In the entire world, I was the only one who lived."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan and the others began to understand the Ocean Turtle's fear. That scene must have truly been terrifying, causing immense psychological trauma to the Ocean Turtle.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Turtle's shell actually contained a small world space within it. This meant that not everything of the Primordial Turtle had been completely devoured, which is why some of the laws of its small world still remained in the shell.</p><p></p><p>The Ocean Turtle was indeed fortunate. If the Primordial Turtle had been able to hold on just a bit longer, it likely would have survived too. </p><p></p><p>This was also because the Primordial Turtle's strength was not as great as the Ocean Turtle's, and especially not as great as the Ocean Turtle's innate ability of Turtle Breath Mystique. That's why it wasn't able to survive.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that when Hongze died, Taicang had not yet perished. The master of the Immutable Divine Palace retreated to go battle Taicang. He may have discovered that I had not yet died within Hongze's world.</p><p></p><p>"But to him, the tiny bit of life essence I possessed was inconsequential. After all, the entire world had already died. Leaving behind this small remnant of me made no difference."</p><p></p><p>The Ocean Turtle speculated.</p><p></p><p>"What did that person from the Immutable Divine Palace look like? What was his name?" Jiang Buping asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!" To everyone's surprise, the Ocean Turtle shook its head.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know? But didn't you see him?" Fang Hao was astonished.</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't see his true form. I only saw a terrifying silhouette, indescribable and unfathomable. That day it was as if the world was enveloped in darkness, like a giant mouth swallowing up everything..."</p><p></p><p>The Ocean Turtle's eyes were filled with fear, its smile bitter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were dumbfounded. That person from the Immutable Divine Palace was quite mysterious. Even Taihe and Taikun, who had participated in the great battle, were unable to describe his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strange aura on Taihe and Taikun's bodies came from that person. Su Lingxiu was still researching it, not yet fully understanding the peculiarity of that aura.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that once contaminated, it was like a persistent parasite, difficult to remove. It also had an ominous quality, as if it could erode the fortunes of living beings. It was very unique.</p><p></p><p>"To be completely honest, I barely escaped with my life. My whole body went limp, I was trembling and couldn't stand up. I even soiled myself all over the ground. But I don't feel ashamed at all, not one bit. It was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"I don't even know how long I lay there paralyzed. I only know that the great battle had ended, and the chaotic realm had been silent for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>"The world was completely dead and empty. It took me a very long time to slowly stand up, to drag my severely injured body away from the dead world of Hongze, to leave that place of terror.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I could have stayed in that world. I could have even tried to recover my injuries and then use Hongze's world as a foundation. I might have had a chance to ascend to become the master of that world.</p><p></p><p>"But you see, Hongze's world had become a psychological barrier for me, a shadow in my heart. When I was there I felt constant, uncontrollable fear. So I had no choice but to flee."</p><p></p><p>After pouring out his heart, the Ocean Turtle felt as if a great weight had been lifted. His spirit felt much lighter in that moment.</p><p></p><p>He had kept these things bottled up inside for far too long, always wanting to find someone to confide in but never finding the right person. For a long time he didn't even dare to speak of these matters, or even recall them.</p><p></p><p>Before this, the Ocean Turtle had even sealed off this part of his memories, wanting to completely forget.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the Ocean Turtle's confession, Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but sigh. This old turtle was truly fortunate to have survived that great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even after the passage of eons, the Ocean Turtle still couldn't help but feel fear when recalling that catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>That person from the Immutable Divine Palace was truly terrifying, directly devouring Hongze and everything in Hongze's world.</p><p></p><p>"After I left the dead world of Hongze, I came towards the world of Taicang. I wanted to confirm the final outcome of that great battle. When I saw that Taicang's world still existed, and that the worlds of Mingyu and Wumo, though damaged, still existed and had not completely collapsed, I was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"I had thought that the six great worlds were ultimately victorious. But then I discovered that Taicang had fallen!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Ocean Turtle's tone was helpless and sorrowful, still finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Taicang had been such a powerful existence, able to kill world master level beings with a single strike. The fact that the Ocean Turtle had been able to survive was also related to Taicang. Yet in the end, Taicang was defeated!</p><p></p><p>"My injuries were severe. Even with my Turtle Breath Mystique, I couldn't stay in the immutable realm forever. Otherwise there would be no possibility of recovery. So I took a chance and snuck into Taicang's world.</p><p></p><p>"Only after entering Taicang's world did I discover that this world had changed. Moreover, there was still conflict between it and the worlds of Wumo and Mingyu. I was also an outsider. If I was exposed it probably wouldn't end well for me, so I went into hiding.</p><p></p><p>"I was also confused. If Taicang had been defeated in battle, why did its world still exist? The Immutable Divine Palace seemed to have retreated. What exactly happened in that great battle? Was the master of the Immutable Divine Palace severely injured?</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't dare to ask anyone about it, not even former acquaintances. After all, times had changed. To those realm lords, I would be very valuable - a treasure."</p><p></p><p>The Ocean Turtle gave a self-deprecating smile as he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>There were still many mysteries surrounding that great battle. How exactly did Taicang fall? Just how powerful was that person from the Immutable Divine Palace? If he killed Taicang, why didn't he devour Taicang's world? And since Taicang's world has survived until now, is it possible that the master of the Immutable Divine Palace was severely injured and unable to take action against Taicang's world again? If so, the strength of the Immutable Divine Palace's master may not have been much greater than Taicang's.</p><p></p><p>But only those who participated in the final battle would know the truth. Even Taihe and Taikun didn't know exactly what happened - they were on the periphery of the battle's core.</p><p></p><p>And everyone else had perished.</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with Mingyu? Wasn't it said that as a world master, he couldn't join the Immutable Divine Palace? How did he successfully join them without being devoured?" Xu Yan asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>According to what the Ocean Turtle had said, living beings of a world, especially world masters, were unable to join the Immutable Divine Palace. There was an irreconcilable conflict between them.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Immutable Divine Palace would ultimately result in being devoured by them.</p><p></p><p>But Mingyu had become a member of the Immutable Divine Palace. He had appeared, devouring the world of Mingyu that he had created, and left with five blood lords.</p><p></p><p>"Mingyu..." The Ocean Turtle pondered. "Among the seven world masters, Mingyu was one of the more bloodthirsty. As you know, the people of Mingyu cultivated the blood dao, consuming the essence blood of martial artists to cultivate. According to rumors, Mingyu gained sentience and wisdom by devouring the blood of immutable true spirits and using it to strengthen himself. He cultivated using blood.</p><p></p><p>"Mingyu's sea of blood was formed from countless true</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Formed from the blood of spirits, he created the Netherworld realm and slaughtered countless undying true spirits. The reason he could be accepted by the Undying Temple was probably related to his cultivation method that could devour essence and blood?</p><p></p><p>"The specifics are unknown, but this Netherworld person has always been unyielding and never submits. He was once suppressed by Cang Tsang for a period of time but never bowed his head. His allegiance to the Undying Temple is indeed unexpected," the Ancient Sea Turtle sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think it's possible that Cang Tsang fell because of Netherworld's betrayal?" Fang Hao pondered thoughtfully. Of the six realm lords, so far only Netherworld is confirmed to be alive and has joined the Undying Temple. It would make sense if he betrayed and suddenly attacked Cang Tsang during the great battle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Cang Tsang had suppressed Netherworld before, so there was some enmity between them. It's possible that Netherworld backstabbed Cang Tsang.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!" The Ancient Sea Turtle shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"I once heard Old Hong Ze say that Netherworld was arrogant but straightforward, never hiding his likes and dislikes of others, and never concealing his hatred. Even when suppressed by Cang Tsang, he was never seen to resent Cang Tsang, since it was for good reason.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this doesn't mean Netherworld wouldn't betray. It's just hard to believe."</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle headed towards a certain direction in the vast primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>Looking back towards the Great Wilderness realm, they could only see a small, beautiful jewel in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>Until even the Great Wilderness realm disappeared from view, Xu Yan and the other three felt excited as they looked towards the boundless primordial chaos ahead.</p><p></p><p>The great battle of the realms and the mystery of Cang Tsang's fall were already ancient history. But curiosity about this period of history remained, even if they weren't witnesses and felt no sadness or regret.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, where is the Hong Ze realm? How much further?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were very curious about this dead realm, once one of the seven great realms.</p><p></p><p>"After such a long time, the Hong Ze realm is no longer in its original location. But it should generally be in this direction. If we keep searching, we should be able to find it," the Ancient Sea Turtle explained. "Realms in the Undying Land don't stay in one place. They move slowly due to the influence of the chaotic spiritual energy and undying qi, although very slowly. But they don't remain stationary.</p><p></p><p>"Realms that have lost their principles and become desolate move even faster. But they generally don't deviate too far from their original direction. Even if not in the original location, as long as you know the general direction of the realm, it's quite easy to find."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others nodded, not in a hurry. After all, they didn't enter the Undying Land just for the Hong Ze realm.</p><p></p><p>The vast Undying Land contained too many unknowns and too many places worth exploring.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why is that mountain shaped so strangely? Could it be a true spirit?" Fang Hao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>A large mountain appeared in view ahead, shaped like some kind of beast lying down.</p><p></p><p>"The mountains in the Undying Land are all formed from dead true spirits. The strength and size of the mountain can indicate the power of the true spirit when it was alive," the Ancient Sea Turtle explained. "The more powerful the true spirit, the larger the mountain it forms after death under the influence of the undying qi, rather than rotting away.</p><p></p><p>"Generally, the area around a mountain is the territory of a particular true spirit. A mountain range indicates the tribal grounds of a powerful true spirit.</p><p></p><p>"That mountain looks quite ancient, with no true spirit aura remaining. Either it was formed by a solitary true spirit that died here, or this tribe's true spirits were wiped out or migrated away."</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan and the others realized.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look inside the mountain and see if we can find anything useful," Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle had no objections and carried the four of them to the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the scale and strength of this mountain, the true spirit that formed it was probably at the level of a minor realm lord when alive. Not weak," the Ancient Sea Turtle said after examining the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"How do you determine a true spirit's strength when it was alive?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. Look at the size of the mountain, its strength, and whether other things have grown on it..." The Ancient Sea Turtle patted the mountain, producing a muffled sound, and began to explain.</p><p></p><p>"The mountains in the Undying Land are usually hollow inside, though some are not. But solid mountains are quite rare. If you need to hide from pursuing true spirits, you can conceal your aura and hide inside a mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the true spirits in the Undying Land have little intelligence. If they don't sense any aura, they'll quickly leave without entering the mountain to search.</p><p></p><p>"However, if you're being pursued by powerful figures from the Undying Temple, you need to be more careful. After all, they also know mountains are hiding places. To use a mountain as a hiding place, you need to choose a suitable one.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the inside of a mountain may be the lair of some true spirits. Entering carelessly can lead to attacks. All kinds of true spirits exist in the Undying Land, some with special abilities.</p><p></p><p>"No one knows exactly how many types of true spirits exist in the Undying Land. Even the seven realm lords once compiled a catalog of undying true spirits, but lamented that it probably included less than one percent..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle, having once been a true spirit roaming the Undying Land for ages, naturally knew it extremely well.</p><p></p><p>Elders like Old Xiao's understanding of the Undying Land was far inferior to the Ancient Sea Turtle's.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others listened attentively, as this was all valuable experience for traversing the Undying Land.</p><p></p><p>"There are no true spirits in this mountain. To determine if there are true spirits inside a mountain, you can look for traces. Most true spirits leave excrement, but some like to conceal themselves and don't leave any traces, so you need to be careful.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the entrance to the mountain may be hidden or obvious with a visible opening. If you examine the entrance carefully, you can usually tell if it's a true spirit's lair inside.</p><p></p><p>"Except for some extremely special true spirits that leave no traces, you can detect them by sweeping with your divine sense. These undying true spirits have almost no intelligence and will reveal themselves when they sense divine sense..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle imparted his experience to Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also examining the mountain, looking for useful materials. One of the purposes of entering the Undying Land this time was to collect materials that didn't exist in their realm.</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle entered the mountain. Fang Hao spotted a large light red stone and couldn't help but look delighted.</p><p></p><p>"This is good stuff, excellent material for forging," Fang Hao said as he collected the stone with a wave of his hand. "After refining, it's enough to forge a divine artifact, and it has scorching power."</p><p></p><p>This large stone was clearly formed from the true spirit's heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 226</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How can I just sit by and do nothing? I must certainly give him a lesson."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mouth twitched slightly as he turned his head and continued to ponder the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>After this commotion, the group of talented youths in the Black Cloud Swamp all quietly observed this mysterious young man, Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His strength was undoubtedly very powerful.</p><p></p><p>They speculated whether he was a talented disciple of a powerful Spiritual Sect, or truly just a wandering cultivator. Wandering cultivators were not necessarily lacking in talent.</p><p></p><p>However, Yuzhou had never heard of such a young talented cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was a talented wandering cultivator from another state?</p><p></p><p>Generally, such talented wandering cultivators would be recruited by major forces. Except for the rare extremely proud wandering cultivators, most would rely on their talents to join major forces, as it was better to bask in the shade of a big tree.</p><p></p><p>And it would also allow them to rise from the lower ranks of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The gathered talented youths began to suspect that Xu Yan might be one of these talented cultivators, recruited by a major force due to his outstanding talents. However, he still had a bit of arrogance in his bones, so even in this grand event, he did not wear the insignia of any faction.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even the most arrogant wandering cultivator would not dare to defy the power of the top families' Refined Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sat on the ground, looking at Xu Yan on the giant boulder, with a gloomy and conflicted expression, occasionally revealing a pained look.</p><p></p><p>This loss was a bit too much! The precious items he had accumulated over a long time were all gone!</p><p></p><p>The commotion ended with Shen Haizhou retreating, occupying Dai Jun's position. The other talented youths felt that Shen Haizhou was embarrassed, but it was not their own face that was lost.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan was powerful, and was suspected to be a top disciple of a Spiritual Sect, so the talented youths would not take any extreme actions until they were certain that he was just a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun frowned, watching Shen Haizhou gritting his teeth, secretly vowing that once the Dai family had connections with the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, he would definitely reclaim this face.</p><p></p><p>He then remembered his sister, why had she not arrived yet?</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon Tomb would be entered in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that she has given up on entering the Azure Sky Flood Dragon Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the miasma in the Black Cloud Swamp had become much lighter, and the Black Rock Mountain in the center of the swamp was clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, preparing to enter the Azure Sky Flood Dragon Tomb to compete for the treasures within.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished his cultivation of the Martial Dao, his brow slightly furrowed as he noticed Shen Haizhou occasionally glancing at him, his expression conflicted and pained, as if he had suffered a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>"Did his storage bag contain precious treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted, and immediately took out Shen Haizhou's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Upon opening it, he couldn't help but exclaim. It was indeed a young master of a top family, with over 100,000 spirit stones, and several stacks of spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of fifth-grade spirit herbs, hundreds of sixth-grade spirit herbs. There were even over a dozen fourth-grade spirit herbs, and numerous bottles and jars, two of which likely contained the "Spirit Gathering Pills" he had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these bottles and jars, Xu Yan felt pained, thinking of how many spirit herbs had been wasted.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, the storage bag also contained a long sword, a set of armor, both of which were of extraordinary grade, even surpassing the level of treasures.</p><p></p><p>What particularly caught Xu Yan's attention was a purple wooden box, which seemed to contain something extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit was stirred, could this be the thing that Shen Haizhou was pained about? He couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>He took out the purple wooden box. It was made of some unknown wood, with a faint fragrance, and carved with two enchanting dancing female figures.</p><p></p><p>Opening the box a crack, Xu Yan was stunned. Inside were various colored, semi-transparent women's undergarments. His expression gradually became strange as he opened the box fully, rummaging through the undergarments to find several small booklets and scroll paintings underneath.</p><p></p><p>Picking up a booklet, he opened it to see a painting of a man and woman embracing, with some descriptive text beside it. Putting that down, he picked up another, and Xu Yan's expression became increasingly strange. The booklets were all erotic literature with illustrations.</p><p></p><p>He unrolled a scroll painting, revealing a beautifully drawn nude female figure, graceful and charming, with several such women in different poses. Unrolling another, it was also a painting of enchanting nude female figures, each one breathtakingly beautiful, whether alluring, cute, or pure...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression became strange, and he didn't continue looking, closing the box and turning to look at the conflicted and pained Shen Haizhou, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The thing that the other party was pained about was likely not the spirit stones or spirit herbs, but the contents of this box!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou saw Xu Yan looking at him, quickly putting on a smile, trying his best to look amiable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the wooden box, saying, "What kind of thing is in here?"</p><p></p><p>Pretending to throw it into the Black Cloud Swamp, Shen Haizhou immediately panicked, jumping up and saying, "Brother, wait, wait! This is my precious collection!"</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the danger, he hurriedly came to the giant boulder, rubbing his hands and smiling obsequiously, "Brother, you don't want it, just give it back to me, okay? I spent a lot of time and effort to get these."</p><p></p><p>"It's very important?" Xu Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, very important!" Shen Haizhou nodded frantically.</p><p></p><p>"But this is the compensation you owe me, so it belongs to me now..." Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll buy it, I'll buy it!" Shen Haizhou quickly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, "Then you can name the price yourself, how much do you think it's worth?"</p><p></p><p>Now Shen Haizhou was in a dilemma. If he quoted a low price, it would seem like he was insulting his own precious collection, and might be seen as an insult. But if he quoted a high price, it would be painful.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he gritted his teeth and held up a finger.</p><p></p><p>"Deal, 1 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, that's not what I meant..." Shen Haizhou was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to say 10,000 spirit stones, but you directly said 1 million spirit stones? In your eyes, this thing is worth that much?</p><p></p><p>"What, you're not the one who quoted 1 million spirit stones? If it's not worth 1 million spirit stones, then what use is it to me? Am I someone who lacks spirit stones?" Xu Yan frowned unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"It's worth it, it's worth it!" Shen Haizhou gritted his teeth. After all, he was the young master of the top family Shen, 1 million spirit stones was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had put in a lot of effort to collect these precious items. If they were destroyed, he didn't know how long it would take to collect them again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted the box and smiled, "Then give me the money."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have that many spirit stones right now." Shen Haizhou looked embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just throw it in the Black Cloud Swamp." Xu Yan made a motion to throw the box in.</p><p></p><p>"I have the money, wait a moment." Shen Haizhou hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Then he rushed over to Dai Jun.</p><p></p><p>"Lend me 1 million spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun's face turned green, furious and raging, he said, "No, I won't lend it!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I, Shen Haizhou, am lending you money because I think highly of you, a mere second-rate family. Lending money to a first-rate family is an honor. Dai Jun, are you going to abandon the glory of the Dai family?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun's chest was about to explode with anger, gritting his teeth, he said, "No, I won't lend it!"</p><p></p><p>With Shen Haizhou's character, would he even return the money if lent? Shen Haizhou sneered and said, "Dai Jun, you have used the Shen family's Lianshentianren to make a case against me, this is a great disrespect. You, a second-rate family scion, what qualifications do you have to mention my first-rate Shen family's Lianshentianren?"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't lend it, you'll have to bear the crime of slandering my first-rate family's Lianshentianren!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun glared at Shen Haizhou, gritting his teeth, he said, "Shen Haizhou, don't be too greedy. When have I slandered the Lianshentianren?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, either lend it or I'll go to the Zheng Kingdom's royal family and say that your Dai family is disrespectful, disdains first-rate families, is arrogant and rude, and even intends to gather followers to attack me, Shen Haizhou..."</p><p></p><p>"Lend it!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun's face changed color again and again, gritting his teeth and saying.</p><p></p><p>This Shen Haizhou has completely lost his shame! He was really afraid that Shen Haizhou would cause trouble, leading to changes in the Dai family's alliance with the Zheng Kingdom's royal family.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun frowned, took out all the spirit crystals and spirit tickets from his attendant and himself, barely scraping together one million spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Write an IOU!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You are disdaining me, Shen Haizhou, the young master of a first-rate family. Am I a man of no integrity? You despise me, Shen Haizhou, which means you despise my Shen family. How dare you question the credibility of a first-rate family?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Shen Haizhou jumped up and angrily shouted at him.</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun almost died of anger, wishing he could dismember Shen Haizhou into eighteen pieces!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou came back happily, exchanging his treasures back from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for the one million spirit crystals?</p><p></p><p>Since it wasn't his own money, he didn't feel the least bit heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>As for the repayment, he directly threw it out of his mind, daring to slander him, the young master of a first-rate family, for not repaying the loan?</p><p></p><p>He's tired of living!</p><p></p><p>The poisonous miasma of the Black Marsh dissipated, and the Black Rock Mountain stood clearly visible in the center of the marsh, a huge black mountain body, as if cast in ink.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>The young geniuses of various forces instructed the scout warriors to head towards the Black Rock Mountain.</p><p></p><p>When all the scout warriors had safely reached the Black Rock Mountain without any accidents, the group of young geniuses took to the air and flew towards the Black Rock Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped out, neither hurried nor lagging behind.</p><p></p><p>The Black Rock Mountain was as black as ink. On the mountainside, there was a protruding giant rock.</p><p></p><p>"Open the tomb entrance."</p><p></p><p>A young genius commanded.</p><p></p><p>The scout warriors took out their weapons, unleashing their aura, and bombarded the protruding black giant rock.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Fragments flew, and a layer of black dust rose up.</p><p></p><p>A few rock fragments shot towards two of the scout warriors. The two warriors immediately took action to block the incoming rock fragments.</p><p></p><p>At first, they didn't pay much attention, after all, the force of the flying rock fragments was limited, and they could easily defend against them.</p><p></p><p>However, with a sizzling sound, the rock fragments actually corroded their power, instantly approaching their bodies. They were suddenly shocked, wanting to dodge was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Surging power formed a defensive shield.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! To their surprise, the rock fragments, like burning hot iron blocks, penetrated the defense as if they were entering oil, instantly hitting them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Cries rang out, and the two warriors immediately collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Save me!"</p><p></p><p>The areas hit by the rock fragments turned pitch black and were rapidly spreading.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that after falling to the ground, they made sizzling sounds, and their clothes were actually being corroded. In no time, their bare skin was exposed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Upon contact with the black rock, their entire backs instantly turned black, and the color continued to spread throughout their bodies.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths, the two warriors turned into black charcoal, their breath faint, unable to utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Rock Mountain is highly toxic, be careful not to touch it."</p><p></p><p>All the young geniuses were startled.</p><p></p><p>The scout warriors were now very cautious in dealing with the flying rock fragments.</p><p></p><p>One careless move, and they would end up like those two.</p><p></p><p>Rock fragments flew, and black dust filled the air.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The giant rock disappeared, revealing a circular cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>The circular cave entrance, about ten feet high, was like a giant snake emerging from the ground. The young geniuses were overjoyed, this seemed to be the true tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Go in!"</p><p></p><p>The scout warriors levitated, not daring to touch the mountain walls, one after another entering the cave. The group of young geniuses exchanged glances and also entered one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, after you!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You go first."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou stepped into the cave entrance, and Xu Yan was the last to enter.</p><p></p><p>As they went deeper, the cave became as black as ink. Even the warriors could only rely on their senses to move forward.</p><p></p><p>The scout warriors in the front took out a luminous pearl.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shone in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Continuing forward, suddenly, the person in the lead holding the luminous pearl abruptly fell to the ground with a thud. The warriors behind him were horrified.</p><p></p><p>In the light of the luminous pearl, they saw that the fallen person had no breath, his face blackened, having been silently poisoned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't use the luminous pearl, it will provoke the deadly poison!"</p><p></p><p>The third warrior in the line solemnly said.</p><p></p><p>His expression was terrified. Through the light of the luminous pearl, he saw wisps of black mist flowing into the fallen person's body along the light.</p><p></p><p>"Continue forward!"</p><p></p><p>A young genius in the back commanded.</p><p></p><p>The scout warriors continued forward, leaving only a pitch-black corpse behind.</p><p></p><p>The cave was as black as ink, and no one dared to take out the luminous pearl to light the way. They could only rely on the warriors' extraordinary vision and keen senses to step forward.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was at the very back. He had already taken an antidote pill and had an anti-poison pill in his mouth, silently sensing the situation. Although the poison was fierce, the antidote pill and anti-poison pill were still effective against it.</p><p></p><p>With this, he felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Black Rock Mountain, a snake about ten feet long, with a crystalline body and a bulging head, crawled up the Black Rock Mountain and came to the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>A pair of cold eyes emerged.</p><p></p><p>The snake's forked tongue flickered as it murmured, "This belongs to me, no one can covet it. I am the descendant of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, I have the blood lineage of the Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I obtain the Flood Dragon's body inside, my bloodline will be further purified, and I can break through to the fifth realm!"</p><p></p><p>The crystalline snake slithered towards the cave entrance. As it entered the pitch-black cave, its originally crystalline body gradually turned black, blending into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

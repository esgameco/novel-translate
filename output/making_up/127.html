        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man did not dare to inquire further. Whoever could make such a powerful master become a coachman must have an extraordinary identity, and he could not afford to offend them.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Shu-shu, there was absolutely no way he could be in the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the clues, Meng Shu-shu has fled to Tieshan County. Now the county is under lockdown, let's see how he escapes. But is the intelligence accurate?"</p><p></p><p>The old man had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>Tieshan County was a remote and impoverished place. If Meng Shu-shu had fled here, wasn't he just seeking his own death?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong drove the carriage towards Qinglin City. In the carriage, Meng Shu-shu had some hidden worries - the person he had hired was a master, and a very powerful one at that.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, are you a peak master?" Meng Shu-shu asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>He now suspected that Meng Chong might be colluding with those people and eyeing his treasures.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, you can rest assured. I, Meng Chong, have an excellent reputation. As long as you keep your promise, I will not betray you," Meng Chong said, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Brother Meng, you misunderstood. I, Meng Shu-shu, would never doubt you. I was just curious about your abilities," Meng Shu-shu laughed.</p><p></p><p>The journey to Qinglin City was long and turbulent. To avoid exposure, Meng Shu-shu remained hidden in the carriage the entire time. Fortunately, Meng Chong was so powerful that with just a slight display of his aura, no one dared to approach or inspect the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Anyone capable of having a master-level cultivator as their coachman could not be an ordinary person...</p><p></p><p>While Meng Chong was heading to Qinglin City, Xu Yan bid farewell to Du Yuying and returned along the same path, carrying the spiritual medicine. He arrived at the Blue Peace Prefecture and deposited the medicine at the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy is considered a sacred place of martial arts in the inner domain. The greatest martial artists in the world gather there, and it recruits the most talented individuals regardless of their origins.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts there must be boundless. As my master said, the inner domain martial arts also have their merits. I should go to the Seven Star Academy to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had set his next goal. In addition to continuing to earn spirit crystals and purchase more spiritual medicines, he would go to the Seven Star Academy to explore the inner domain martial arts, learn from them, and integrate them into his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the inner domain had already yielded him tremendous gains in a short time. He had comprehended the true meaning of the Dragon Roar and mastered the Sword Dao technique of Mountain River Dragon Roar. If he went to the Seven Star Academy, he would surely be exposed to even more inner domain martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, I need to refine my mental state!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that his sword dao had progressed, but his mental state had become a bit unstable, allowing external things to disturb him. He must refine his mental state and elevate it further.</p><p></p><p>"In the remote frontier, I used the imperial concubines of Qi Emperor to refine my mental state, but those were ordinary women, no matter how beautiful. </p><p></p><p>"Du Yuying is a cultivator, her strength is not weak, and her bearing is extraordinary, captivating the heart and soul. So I must go to a place where beauties abound to refine my mental state.</p><p></p><p>"And these beauties are all cultivators, with diverse styles of beauty and unparalleled allure, which will be the perfect tempering ground for my mental state."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Xu Yan inquired about such a place, and the answer he received was the Thousand Star Lake in the Great Yue Kingdom, the Matchless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators had become enthralled and unable to extricate themselves from this place. The dancing girls and courtesans of the Matchless Pavilion were all peerless beauties, with exceptional skills and not insignificant cultivation.</p><p></p><p>From first-grade to ninth-grade cultivators, there were all kinds, and it was even rumored that there were Grandmaster-level beauties among them.</p><p></p><p>"The inner domain actually has such a place. This is far superior to brothels. It is truly the perfect place to refine my mental state. Once I go to the Thousand Star Lake, I will surely elevate my sword dao to new heights!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed and immediately set out for the Thousand Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Star Lake and the Matchless Pavilion were renowned as the number one place of romance and beauty in the Great Yue Kingdom. Their fame had even spread throughout the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had become lost in this place, indulging in the pleasures of the flesh and neglecting their martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The beauties of the Matchless Pavilion came from all over the inner domain - some were cultivated from a young age, some were bought from the Imperial Courtesans Bureau of the Great Yue Kingdom, and some were even captured enemies sold to the Matchless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The background of the Matchless Pavilion was unfathomable. It was rumored that even the princes of the Great Yue Kingdom had to pay exorbitant fees to enjoy the pleasures there.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Star Lake was not a single lake, but a network of interconnected large and small lakes, like a thousand stars dotting the landscape, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>The lakes were connected by artificial waterways, and there were bridges between them, allowing both water and land access.</p><p></p><p>The Matchless Pavilion was located within the Thousand Star Lake. The deeper one went into the lake, the more beautiful the courtesans and the stronger their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that at the core of the Thousand Star Lake, there were several gilded pleasure boats and a grand water palace, where Grandmaster-level courtesans resided. </p><p></p><p>Only cultivators at the Grandmaster level and above, with abundant wealth, could enter that inner sanctum.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the shores of the Thousand Star Lake, one could see the pleasure boats moored in the shimmering waters, and the elegant painted boats gliding between the lakes, disappearing into the flower-filled coves.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the sound of guqin music drifted out from the boats, it would be accompanied by the occasional coy feminine murmurs, eliciting envy and longing from the impoverished cultivators watching.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators with the means to rent the Matchless Pavilion's painted boats and cruise the Thousand Star Lake with their beauties were all individuals of substantial wealth and resources.</p><p></p><p>More cultivators would go aboard the pleasure boats moored in the lake, listening to the music, watching the dances, and when the mood struck them, they would call for a beauty to retreat to a private room.</p><p></p><p>It was worth noting that entering the pleasure boats was free, but the prices of the tea, snacks, and alcohol served there were quite high.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the inner domain were relatively proud, so even though entry was free, they would not dare to freeload. Upon entering, they would always order at least some tea and snacks.</p><p></p><p>So far, no one had ever entered without ordering anything.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the Thousand Star Lake and the Matchless Pavilion, Xu Yan had been worrying that his meager spirit crystals would all be spent here. But this was a place for him to refine his mental state, not to indulge in pleasure, so he was determined not to spend a single crystal.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, entering the pleasure boats did not require any payment! This was an unexpected delight. He had come to the Matchless Pavilion to cultivate his mental state, to achieve the realm of "no women in the heart, the sword dao as if divine," not to revel in the pleasures of the flesh.</p><p></p><p>The boats were filled with beautiful women, and the cultivators were whistling, chattering, and flirting. Which of them would not be tempted by such allure? But Xu Yan was determined to remain unmoved, to use this as an opportunity to refine his mental state.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A martial artist would not be disturbed by this.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan came here to temper his state of mind, to overcome all these external interferences, so that he could achieve a clear and undisturbed mind.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>The servant greeted him with a smile. This young man was clearly a first-time visitor.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he would bring a pot of fine tea, a plate of delicious snacks, and shower him with compliments, then promptly pull out some spirit crystals. He was well-versed in these matters.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered the treasure ship, directly ascending to the upper deck, and chose an empty spot to sit down. He watched the group of beautifully dressed women below, leaping and dancing with graceful movements.</p><p></p><p>Their dance was exquisite, with a considerable degree of sensuality, and their enchanting faces and alluring eyes seemed to captivate the soul.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that they had undergone rigorous training, and what amazed Xu Yan even more was that all of these dancers were at the seventh realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although their actual combat strength might be slightly inferior to ordinary seventh-realm cultivators, they were still seventh-realm martial artists, which spoke volumes about the depth and powerful backing of the Peerless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of martial artists watched, entranced, wishing they could afford to summon one of the Peerless Pavilion's ladies for a carefree and joyful time. But even just sipping a cup of tea, savoring some snacks, and enjoying the enchanting dance and captivating songs would fill their hearts with excitement, their blood rushing to a single point, and a slight movement of their hands would bring them great happiness.</p><p></p><p>The servant approached Xu Yan, carrying a pot of tea and a plate of snacks. "Young master, your tea and snacks have arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment," Xu Yan stopped him, asking with a serious expression, "Do I have to pay for this tea and snacks?"</p><p></p><p>The servant was puzzled. "Of course you have to pay for them. Why would we provide them for free?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. "No, no, I don't want the tea and snacks. Don't bother me."</p><p></p><p>The servant was bewildered. "But, young master, everyone who comes here orders tea and snacks. What are you..."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a rule that says I have to order tea and snacks when I come here?" Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"No, there's no such rule!" the servant replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then that's it. Others order tea and snacks, but that's their business, not mine. I'm not ordering any, so leave me alone!" Xu Yan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>What a joke, he had worked hard to earn these spirit crystals, and he needed them for medicinal herbs to support his family's cultivation. How could he just waste them carelessly?</p><p></p><p>The servant was completely dumbfounded. "But, young master, you see..."</p><p></p><p>"Go away, I don't want the tea and snacks, and I won't pay for them if you don't take them away," Xu Yan said firmly, then sat cross-legged, his gaze fixed on the dancing women below, not blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>The servant was utterly bewildered by this young man's thick-skinned behavior. He hurriedly took the tea and snacks and went to find the manager.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Pavilion had never encountered a customer who tried to freeload before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't care what the servant thought. At the moment, he was focused on intently watching the graceful movements of the dancing women, and his heart gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, all the dances, the songs of the performers, became faint and distant in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to be isolated from him, and his mind was clear.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a martial artist. These dances, these movements, these figures are far more beautiful than the imperial concubines, but they can no longer disturb my heart," Xu Yan mused.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Pavilion is truly a place to temper one's mind, and it doesn't even cost any money!</p><p></p><p>The servant returned with a manager.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what is the reason that you feel these dancers are not worth spending a fortune on?" the manager asked with a smile, finding it truly hard to imagine that this was the first person in the history of the Peerless Pavilion to have such thick skin.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and replied, "Your dancers are mediocre and cannot captivate me."</p><p></p><p>The manager was taken aback, suspecting that this young man might be an experienced patron of the pleasure quarters, as ordinary dancers could no longer stir his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is a public venue, and if the dancers do not impress the young master, that is understandable. On this treasure ship, there are twelve private rooms, each with a peerless beauty. Their dance, music, and artistry are all extraordinary. They may be expensive, but they will surely satisfy the young master."</p><p></p><p>The manager's meaning was clear - it's just a matter of whether you have the money or not.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then pulled out a stack of spirit notes from his pocket, the hard-earned money he had obtained by defeating many sect masters.</p><p></p><p>"I have the money, but how do I know the beauties in your private rooms can satisfy me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>The manager saw the stack of spirit notes and knew this young man was indeed wealthy, with at least tens of thousands of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you can rest assured. Those who enter the private rooms have never left unsatisfied. They will surely captivate you."</p><p></p><p>"Are you certain?" Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely!" the manager replied.</p><p></p><p>"And if I'm not satisfied, not captivated, and don't enjoy myself?"</p><p></p><p>"Then we won't charge you a single penny!" the manager said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then take me to the private room," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But, young master..."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm satisfied and enjoy myself, I'll pay. But if I haven't even seen them yet, and you want me to pay first? What if the goods don't match? And if I'm not captivated and don't enjoy myself, the Peerless Pavilion isn't afraid that I won't pay?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>The manager thought about it and realized he had a point.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare cause trouble at the Peerless Pavilion? Moreover, this young man was in the prime of his youth, and even if he was an experienced patron of the pleasure quarters, how could he resist the charms of the beauties in the twelve private rooms, who were all masters of the art of seduction?</p><p></p><p>Once he was captivated, how could he dare not pay?</p><p></p><p>"This way, young master," the manager said with a smile, leading Xu Yan to the topmost level of the treasure ship.</p><p></p><p>They stopped in front of a private room. "Please, young master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>The private room was exquisite, and a beautiful and enchanting woman came to greet him, her eyes filled with affection, as if gazing at her beloved.</p><p></p><p>Every movement of hers was filled with allure. She wore a thin, pink silk garment, and through the window's light, one could faintly see the wondrous figure beneath.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I've been waiting for you," she said in a soft, seductive voice that seemed to caress his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath, thinking, "Much better than those dancers. It can indeed continue to temper my heart."</p><p></p><p>He sat down on the chair and said, "Show me what you can do."</p><p></p><p>"Then, young master, shall I play a piece for you?" the woman said coquettishly, her delicate hands plucking the strings of the zither, her every expression and movement becoming richer and more captivating as the music filled the air.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 473</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan heard this, he knew that Tianzi was about to explain the reason for the changes in heaven and earth, as well as Taicang's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Could such a legendary figure have already perished?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the scenes Xu Yan had witnessed crossing the wilderness, and that towering figure, could that imposing silhouette have been Taicang? If someone as powerful as Taicang had fallen, how formidable must the enemy have been?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was very likely that even with all seven of them joining forces against that being, Taicang and the others were still no match?</p><p></p><p>"Taicang and the others discovered that a powerful aura had appeared in the depths beyond the world, approaching heaven and earth, but then suddenly halted somewhere in the unchanging realm.</p><p></p><p>"At first, Taicang and the others thought it was just a powerful unchanging true spirit hiding in the unchanging realm, and didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"Just like that, countless years passed. Then one day, an extremely powerful aura surged in the unchanging realm beyond the world. Taicang immediately prepared to go investigate.</p><p></p><p>"But then, an unexpected turn of events occurred."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Tianzi's expression became extremely solemn as he continued gravely: "The Fenyun realm was annihilated. Everything in that world was devoured and plundered. Fenyun, the lord of the Fenyun realm, also disappeared, seemingly perishing!" It's worth noting that Fenyun was one of the seven realm lords, with immense power. The Fenyun realm was also home to numerous powerful beings, yet it was still annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"This came as a huge shock to Taicang and the other five. They realized the gravity of the situation and went to investigate that powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"But that aura seemed to be evading them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly astounded as he listened. The Fenyun realm, one of the seven great realms, was just annihilated like that? The lord of the Fenyun realm had just died like that?</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps the annihilation of the Fenyun realm was part of some conspiracy?" Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi continued his account.</p><p></p><p>Taicang and the other five were unable to track down the source, and worried about the safety of heaven and earth, so they could only return. However, they all became more cautious, ready to provide support immediately if any of them encountered a crisis.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, Wumo, whose power was second only to Taicang's, encountered a powerful enemy and was gravely injured, nearly perishing.</p><p></p><p>But Wumo also discovered the remnants of the fallen Fenyun, as well as clues about the attacker.</p><p></p><p>At some point, a divine palace had appeared in the unchanging realm, calling itself the Unchanging Divine Palace. It seemed to have wandered in from somewhere within the unchanging realm.</p><p></p><p>The annihilation of the Fenyun realm was connected to the powerful beings of this Unchanging Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Their goal was to invade and devour the seven great realms.</p><p></p><p>The existence in the Unchanging Divine Palace was so powerful that even Taicang could not guarantee he could match it.</p><p></p><p>As the situation developed and the crisis in heaven and earth became more urgent, Taicang and the others finally launched an attack against the Unchanging Divine Palace after thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang knew he might not survive this battle. Fearing that the Taicang realm would be invaded and annihilated, he left some contingencies in place.</p><p></p><p>"Those bastards Taicang and the others tricked me into coming here, gave me good food and fun things, but then locked me up here, just afraid I would be discovered.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicang realm is very special. Because of my existence as the spirit of this realm, to invade it, they would have to destroy me first. Otherwise, trying to invade or annihilate this realm would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"That battle was too brutal. Even though I didn't participate, I know Taicang died. He really died."</p><p></p><p>By the end, Tianzi couldn't help but start crying again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell silent. To think that even someone as powerful as Taicang had died.</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful were the beings of the Unchanging Divine Palace to be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>"I can't get cocky or arrogant. My current power doesn't even match Taicang's, let alone those from the Unchanging Divine Palace. If I encountered them, I'd surely die.</p><p></p><p>"Even though I've transcended this realm, I should continue lying low in the Taicang realm until my power surpasses Taicang's and those from the Unchanging Divine Palace."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became more vigilant internally.</p><p></p><p>However, despite Taicang's fall so long ago, the Taicang realm was still intact. Although some changes had occurred, it hadn't suffered severe damage.</p><p></p><p>This showed how truly remarkable Taicang was. The powerful beings from the Unchanging Divine Palace likely didn't have an easy time in that battle either.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi wiped away his tears and started cursing again, "Taicang is such a bastard. To protect the living beings of this realm, he forcibly locked me up for so long.</p><p></p><p>"He said he'd be back soon, lied to me saying that person was no match for him, but he actually died.</p><p></p><p>"I'll never believe Taicang is invincible again. He's too useless. So what if this realm was gone? Why fight to the death for it?</p><p></p><p>"If I had the power, I'd change this realm. Taicang is dead, so this realm isn't his anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was full of resentment towards Taicang at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He continued rambling on, describing more details about that battle and the changes to the Taicang realm.</p><p></p><p>In that battle, the powerful beings who followed Taicang suffered heavy casualties. Of the other five great realms, it was known that the Wumo realm and Mingyü realm still existed, but whether Wumo and Mingyü themselves had perished was unknown for now.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Tianzi's guess, they had most likely perished.</p><p></p><p>Now, both the Wumo and Mingyü realms were trying to invade the Taicang realm. There was a good chance that the remaining powerful beings from these two realms had allied with the Unchanging Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Of course, being locked up here, Tianzi couldn't know the specifics.</p><p></p><p>"After that battle, the Taicang realm was in turmoil for a long time, and some changes occurred. For example, my current location is in the borderlands, the frontier of the Taicang realm. There's no spiritual energy here, and the qi has become violent.</p><p></p><p>"I know why Taicang did this. With no spiritual energy, the borderlands appear to have suffered heavy damage. This diverts attention and prevents people from discovering I'm here..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi sighed wistfully, but then said angrily: "But Taicang was too cruel. All the things he left for me are gone. Now I don't even have a bed left. How am I supposed to live from now on?"</p><p></p><p>Then Tianzi looked at Li Xuan expectantly and said, "Senior, do you think you could...?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled in surprise and said, "This might actually be a good thing for you. Since you've been hidden away, why expose yourself now?</p><p></p><p>"Releasing you would be easy for me, but you should think about whether you really want to expose yourself after being hidden for so long."</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as Taicang had died. Although the Taicang realm currently seemed safe, what if Tianzi's exposure attracted that powerful being from the Unchanging Divine Palace?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wasn't certain that he could oppose that powerful being from the Unchanging Divine Palace even if he mobilized the power of the entire Taicang realm while inside it.</p><p></p><p>After all, even with his current Realm Establishment level, his many divine abilities, the Wuxijidao Sword in hand, and the ability to harness the power of the Taicang realm, he still couldn't guarantee victory over Taicang.</p><p></p><p>So it was impossible to grant Tianzi complete freedom for now, but a plan could be arranged.</p><p></p><p>"What good does it do if I'm not resigned to this? I don't want to be locked up here for another moment. Taicang is such a bastard, dying and leaving me here to suffer alone."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's resentment ran deep.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I know the one I should hate most is that terrifying being. But that terrifying being is too strong. I can't beat him. Otherwise I'd want to kill him too."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for him, how could I, Tianzi, have suffered here for so many years?" </p><p></p><p>When speaking of the powerful figures of the Unmelting Divine Palace, Tianzi was clearly full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he was created by Taicang, so in a sense, Taicang was like his father.</p><p></p><p>"Those who followed Taicang are all useless. After so many years, has not a single one of them broken through their limits and reached the level Taicang once did?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi continued angrily, then started cursing and swearing.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in the Taicang world, the layouts of the frontier, inner regions, and spirit realms, were all for the purpose of cultivating new lords of heaven and earth. Those guys haven't taken any action at all, or they all have their own selfish motives...</p><p></p><p>"The former core region of the Taicang world is now the Three Hundred Realms of the Dao Domain. Those realm lords are all bastards..." Tianzi cursed more and more angrily, rambling on and on, occasionally also lamenting how miserable his own life was.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained silent. This Tianzi fellow was trying to gain sympathy.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Hundred Realms of the Dao Domain? Three hundred realm lords? Now, there aren't that many anymore." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Three Hundred Realms of the Dao Domain was like a small world unto itself.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, these three hundred realms were all opened up by former small world lords, powerful figures who had followed Taicang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already gained insight into the martial arts power system of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Union, Divine Venerable, Supreme, Realm Lord... Now Realm Lord is the strongest in the Taicang world, while the Seven of Taicang are the Lords of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lords were once also called Small World Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang is the strongest among the Lords of Heaven and Earth, while the powerful figures of the Unmelting Divine Palace are even stronger than the Lords of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan evaluated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts at the Heaven and Earth Realm are comparable to Divine Venerables and Supremes. When I reach great completion in the Heaven and Earth Realm, I'll have the power of a Supreme. The Establishing the Dao Realm is equivalent to a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Between Supreme and Realm Lord is an insurmountable gap, and the difference in power between the Heaven and Earth Realm and Establishing the Dao Realm is also vast.</p><p></p><p>"If I reach great completion or perfection in the Establishing the Dao Realm, could I kill Taicang?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked himself. Even if he reached perfection in the Establishing the Dao Realm, he probably still couldn't kill Taicang, but he should be no weaker than Taicang. Among the other six Lords of Heaven and Earth, he should be able to kill the weakest one? Of course, there would also be significant differences in power between Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Taicang alone could subdue the other six showed how powerful Taicang was.</p><p></p><p>"Only those above the Establishing the Dao Realm have the power to kill Taicang and not fear the powerful figures of the Unmelting Divine Palace..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan now had a clear understanding.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Establishing the Dao Realm was equivalent to or slightly stronger than a Realm Lord, but he was not an ordinary Establishing the Dao cultivator, which was why he had such power within the Establishing the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's not impossible to find another path and continue to increase my power before breaking through to above the Establishing the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan looked at Tianzi, who was still cursing and occasionally crying pitifully, and said with a smile, "Little one, you are the spirit of the Taicang world. Do you want to improve the Taicang world?</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to prevent those who covet this world from laying hands on it?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I want to, I dream of it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and walked out of the small stone house. Tianzi instinctively followed, actually walking straight out of the small stone house, and even out of the palace that covered it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tianzi was shocked to find that some of the shackles on his body had been loosened!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky and said with a smile, "As I said, this world is missing something, and it's also too weak. You can make up for what's missing."</p><p></p><p>"If I make up for what's missing, will I die?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi couldn't help but shrink his neck.</p><p></p><p>"No, you won't."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly and patted Tianzi's shoulder, saying, "I came to the Taicang world to travel, and on a whim, I took on a few disciples. They are still growing.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts I teach is called the Great Wilderness Martial Arts, and the inner region is now the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"What this world is missing still needs to be supplemented. Taicang is dead, and now only you can do it."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi asked puzzledly, "Senior, you keep saying this world is missing something. What is it missing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned to look at him and uttered two words: "Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>Tianzi became dazed, mumbling, "Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "The Taicang world has principles but lacks the Dao of Heaven. It seems complete and self-regulating, but ultimately lacks the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Dao existed, it would rotate the sun and moon, the world should constantly strengthen and expand, and maintain the balance of the world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to instill in Tianzi the concept of Heavenly Dao that he had figured out.</p><p></p><p>"You are the spirit of this world, perfectly suited to merge with the world and become the Heavenly Dao. However, as a new Heavenly Dao, you shouldn't operate the entire Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"And since Taicang is dead, this world is no longer truly the Taicang world. This can also conceal your identity, and you can shed all past karma..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued his persuasion, explaining how powerful the Heavenly Dao is, how it operates the world, how it is revered by all living beings, how to strengthen the Heavenly Dao itself, and how to continue strengthening the world.</p><p></p><p>The more Tianzi listened, the brighter his eyes became. He excitedly said, "Senior, I want to become this Heavenly Dao. Please teach me!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you want to become the Heavenly Dao? Then what kind of Heavenly Dao do you want to be?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's expression became solemn as he said seriously, "Taicang is dead, the Great Wilderness should be established. I am the Heavenly Dao of the Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly. This Tianzi fellow was indeed clever.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you can make such a resolute decision. Since that's the case, this Dao Ancestor will pass on to you the method of becoming the Heavenly Dao, teaching you how to become the Heavenly Dao. Of course, if you're too stupid to comprehend it, it would only mean that you have no affinity with the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Dao Ancestor Senior. I have very high talent," </p><p></p><p>Tianzi said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mention anything about accepting disciples. Tianzi's true strength, within the Taicang world, was three parts stronger than those Realm Lords, after all, he was the spirit of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Ancestor Senior, you're passing on to me the method of the Heavenly Dao. From now on, I'll be the Heavenly Dao of the Great Wilderness, and you, Dao Ancestor Senior, are the Martial Ancestor of the Great Wilderness. So am I... your servant?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi scratched his head and asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever you like!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's settled. I, Tianzi, am the Dao servant under the Dao Ancestor!" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi said gleefully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and shook his head. This Tianzi fellow was indeed quick-witted.</p><p></p><p>"As the spirit of this world, it's much simpler for you to become the Heavenly Dao. The method of the Heavenly Dao is also simple. Initially, use the principles of the Taicang world as a foundation, but don't follow them completely..."</p><p></p><p>A book appeared in Li Xuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>It was the Taicang Book! Tianzi was startled, his expression suddenly becoming a bit dejected. He sighed and said, "Taicang indeed left a backup plan, wanting later generations to follow his path again, to become the new master of the Taicang world and protect it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 398</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong held a sword in his hand, his entire body shining with golden light, looking like a heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>The four assassins, without saying a word, attacked simultaneously from four directions. </p><p></p><p>Their coordination was flawless, instantly cutting off any escape routes for Meng Chong. He had no choice but to face the attacks head-on, with no room to dodge.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong activated his Great Sun Divine Annihilation technique. Surrounded by wind and thunder, in an instant he transformed into an 18-zhang tall giant, the long sword in his hand also becoming a giant blade.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He unleashed his Hidden Blade Intent, turning rocks and stones into flying swords that swept towards the four assassins from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, godlike in appearance, was covered in golden armor with divine energy surging. However, the four assassins were all peak True King Celestial Venerable experts, not weak in strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Meng Chong, so this is your true form!" One person sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Fierce attacks still came crashing in from all directions, cutting off any retreat and giving Meng Chong no chance to escape!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The powerful attacks landed on Meng Chong's body. Divine energy surged, dissipating the terrifying offensive force. Within the divine energy was another layer of golden armor.</p><p></p><p>Although the impacts made his body shake, Meng Chong was not injured at all.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you can kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's left hand reached out and grasped the Great Sun Divine Annihilation, as if holding the sun itself, and he fiercely attacked the assassin in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he unleashed all his divine abilities, focusing his attacks on the assassin before him while relying on his Infinite Divine Energy's incredible defense to withstand the attacks from the other three.</p><p></p><p>Although each attack made his body shake and his divine energy fluctuate violently, as if it could collapse at any moment, he ultimately endured.</p><p></p><p>The assassin facing Meng Chong's ferocious assault seemed somewhat flustered, unable to defend properly.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a True King Celestial Venerable, Meng Chong kept closing in on him, as if wanting to engage in close combat. Faced with such a fierce attack, he became panicked for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His instincts told him that if Meng Chong got close enough for hand-to-hand combat, even as a peak True King Celestial Venerable, he would surely die.</p><p></p><p>However, to prevent Meng Chong from taking the opportunity to escape, he couldn't pull back too far, so he was in a very passive position.</p><p></p><p>The other three assassins also had gloomy expressions. Meng Chong's terrifying defense and powerful physique exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The three also frantically continued their attacks, but each terrifying strike felt like it was hitting waves in the ocean, with the force dissipating into nothingness as the waves rippled.</p><p></p><p>Although each hit made Meng Chong's body shake and even stagger a bit, they still couldn't injure him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong grasped the sun, his blade wrapped in wind and thunder. At this moment he truly had the majesty of a god. In an instant, he suddenly lunged forward, his giant-like body abruptly returning to normal size.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change caught the assassin who was defending against Meng Chong's attack off guard. Meng Chong had already pounced on him.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>A sense of crisis arose in his heart, and he hurriedly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Even so, Meng Chong's fist, as if holding a sun, grazed his arm. In an instant, there was a crack as the bone broke! Just as Meng Chong was about to follow up with another attack, his expression suddenly changed slightly as a cold glint, thin and long, suddenly shot towards him.</p><p></p><p>An assassin wearing a fierce mask with five leaves engraved on it suddenly appeared, thrusting forward with the slender blade in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The thin, long cold glint pierced into the divine energy. Although the Infinite Divine Energy dissipated half the force of this strike, the thin blade still continued to penetrate.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The golden armor within the divine energy was also pierced, leaving a small hole. Meng Chong felt a slight pain in his shoulder! He was wounded!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sun was thrown out, exploding violently. Fierce, blazing light flashed out, forcing back the masked assassin.</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember you all!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snorted coldly, took a step, and vanished into the horizon like a sun crossing the sky!</p><p></p><p>The last assassin to attack, the one with the fierce mask, had strength beyond ordinary peak True King Celestial Venerable martial artists. Meng Chong sensed the threat he posed.</p><p></p><p>That slender blade had impressive armor-piercing power, actually penetrating his Infinite Divine Energy and wounding him slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although this small injury didn't amount to much, it made Meng Chong realize that continuing to fight would likely become dangerous, especially since he didn't know how many more enemies might arrive.</p><p></p><p>So he decisively retreated!</p><p></p><p>"Chase him!"</p><p></p><p>The fierce-masked assassin, holding the slender blade, took the lead in pursuit. But Meng Chong's speed was extremely fast. In just an instant, they only saw a flash of light before he disappeared into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong escaped, what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Divine Meng Chong, he's too powerful. His physical body is as strong as a divine artifact."</p><p></p><p>"The stronger and more monstrous he is, the better. Killing him will cause even greater turmoil."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Celestial Assassins discussed with sighs of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Continue pursuing Meng Chong. Use any means necessary, we just need him dead!" </p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Celestial Assassin said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Celestial Assassins dispersed, beginning to track Meng Chong's trail and plan how to assassinate him. Since a frontal assault couldn't break through his defenses, they could use underhanded methods instead.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Meng Chong entered the Nine Mountains region, he encountered an ambush, was injured, and fled. Meanwhile, in the Spiritual Venerable Mountain area, a tiger, a dragon, and a toad were walking through the forest.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, what should we do next?" Jade Little Dragon asked Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"Did you all understand the information old Feng Yan gave us? This Spiritual Venerable Mountain is a mountain of spirit beasts, and that Spirit Beast King Wind Spirit Tiger is much stronger than old Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>"So, we won't mention demon clan matters for now. I, Red Cat Demon King, can be flexible. Since our strength is inferior now, we naturally need to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger Beast King is a great power of our tiger clan. We're here to pay respects to this great power of our tiger clan, so be smart about it."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat said as they walked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, big brother!" </p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha nodded.</p><p></p><p>How to proceed, how to gain Wind Spirit Tiger Beast King's trust, and ultimately how to take control of Spiritual Venerable Mountain, then establish the demon clan and ascend the Demon King's throne - it all depended on Red Cat's scheming.</p><p></p><p>On Spiritual Venerable Mountain, a tiger's roar echoed in all directions as a majestic striped tiger walked on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the spirit beasts of Spiritual Venerable Mountain were alerted and looked at the three newcomers with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat, relying on his glib tongue, quickly fooled the group of spirit beasts and gained a not-low status among the spirit beasts of Spiritual Venerable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He also learned more information about Wind Spirit Tiger from these spirit beasts. Red Cat soon discovered that due to Wind Spirit Tiger's lofty position, few dared to approach it.</p><p></p><p>However, Wind Spirit Tiger seemed to be a Beast King who enjoyed being flattered. Upon learning this, Red Cat immediately had an idea.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, it was all about "our tiger clan"...</p><p></p><p>In just over ten days, Red Cat had made his way into the ancient forest of Spiritual Venerable Mountain and met Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger, lying on the ground, now looked at Red Cat with a bewildered expression. This member of its own clan seemed a bit off.</p><p></p><p>That power was somewhat different from spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, it also wasn't</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After deep thought, there were indeed many spirit beasts. Even among the tiger clan, some spirit beasts possessed special powers due to their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The red cat stood up on two legs, walking with a fierce and imposing manner. It wore a large gold chain around its neck, had a precious sword hanging at its waist, and was followed by a jade dragon and a toad.</p><p></p><p>The dragon and toad were carrying a huge golden chair, following closely behind the red cat. This scene left the Wind Spirit Tiger dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Especially the red cat - walking upright on two legs with a sword at its waist, its posture exuded an air of majesty.</p><p></p><p>"Red cat, paying respects to the great Wind Spirit brother of the tiger clan!" the red cat said, clasping its front paws together in a salute.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger continued to be bewildered, unconsciously standing up. "What did you call me?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Wind Spirit brother of our tiger clan!" </p><p></p><p>As the red cat spoke, Little Jade Dragon and Little Ha had already nimbly set down the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Please be seated, great Wind Spirit brother!" the red cat said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to deceive the Wind Spirit Tiger, the red cat had already learned that on the entire Spirit Veneration Mountain, besides the Wind Spirit Tiger, there were only three tigers including himself.</p><p></p><p>In the red cat's view, the other two tigers were simpletons who were easily fooled.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Wind Spirit Tiger, as king of the spirit beasts, would not casually punish this tiger.</p><p></p><p>After all, tigers were scarce! If one was killed, there would be one less.</p><p></p><p>It was also because of this that the red cat dared to take action today.</p><p></p><p>As a cultured tiger, the red cat was confident that although his current strength was not as great as the Wind Spirit Tiger's, his mind was sharper.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wind Spirit brother, your divine posture is fierce and unmatched in the world. As the great one of our tiger clan, you should naturally sit upon this throne to fully display the majesty of the tiger king and reveal your divine might that covers the world..."</p><p></p><p>The red cat unleashed a string of flattery. The Wind Spirit Tiger went from initial bewilderment to eventually becoming elated.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, you speak the truth!" </p><p></p><p>The more he listened, the more he felt this tiger underling was making sense. </p><p></p><p>He was indeed fierce and unmatched - how could he lie on the ground? </p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that diminish the divine might of the great one of the tiger clan?</p><p></p><p>In high spirits, the Wind Spirit Tiger walked to the golden chair, shrunk his body, and lay down on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the red cat thought to himself that the Wind Spirit Tiger was indeed not very bright - what difference was there between lying here versus on the ground?</p><p></p><p>"Great Wind Spirit brother, listen to me. Lying down cannot display your divine might. You should sit..."</p><p></p><p>The red cat stepped forward, instructing the Wind Spirit Tiger on how to sit majestically on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"This is a large gold chain with 36 glittering jewels. Wearing it can bring out your noble aura..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Tiger Might Scepter, fully displaying the divine might of our great tiger clan..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Wind Spirit Tiger wore the large gold chain around his neck, with 36 jewels glittering brilliantly, fully displaying a nouveau riche appearance.</p><p></p><p>He grasped a golden tiger-headed scepter in one paw, planting it on the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wind Spirit Tiger sat upright on the throne, wearing the large gold chain and holding the tiger-headed scepter, looking majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>"Great brother, see how this fully displays the divine might of our great tiger clan?" </p><p></p><p>The red cat waved a paw, and Little Ha and Little Jade Dragon brought over a huge mirror they had prepared, setting it up in front of the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>When the Wind Spirit Tiger looked, he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! Indeed, only like this can my kingly divine might be fully displayed!"</p><p></p><p>"Great brother, I see that the spirit beasts on Spirit Veneration Mountain are too disorderly and cannot properly display your tiger king's might. They must be trained," the red cat said, seizing the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"You make a good point. I'll leave this matter to you, worthy brother."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, great brother. I'll handle it perfectly!" the red cat said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>Next, the red cat selected four good-looking spirit beasts on Spirit Veneration Mountain to be responsible for carrying the throne, bearing the Wind Spirit Tiger on a tour around the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they passed, the crowd of spirit beasts bowed and shouted: "We welcome the arrival of the great Wind Spirit King, whose divine posture is fierce and unmatched, with invincible divine might!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger was extremely excited, feeling that he had lived in vain before. This was the treatment a king of spirit beasts should enjoy!</p><p></p><p>"Worthy brother Red Cat, you truly understand how to display the might of our tiger clan."</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, it's all thanks to your divine might, great brother. Without your divine might and unmatched power, how could there be such an imposing presence?"</p><p></p><p>The red cat offered another piece of flattery.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger was delighted and immediately announced: "From this day forward, Red Cat shall be the second king of our Spirit Veneration Mountain, second only to me, Wind Spirit Tiger King. You all must obey Red Cat's orders..."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat successfully established a firm foothold on Spirit Veneration Mountain, ruling over all the spirit beasts except for the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable masters of Spirit Veneration Sect were all somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>How had the Wind Spirit Tiger suddenly changed like this?</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of Spirit Veneration Sect came to the ancient forest and saw the Wind Spirit Tiger sitting on the golden throne, wearing a large gold chain around his neck with jewels gleaming, a tiger paw grasping a tiger-headed scepter. He couldn't help but rub his eyes - was he seeing things?</p><p></p><p>Hadn't this tiger always lain on the ground? How was it now sitting on a chair like a person?</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master has arrived, bring tea!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger raised a paw, and immediately spirit beasts brought over a table, while another spirit beast swiftly prepared tea.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, please be seated!" The Wind Spirit Tiger pointed at a chair.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Veneration Sect Master was completely dumbfounded. Something was wrong with this Wind Spirit Tiger's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Sect Master, you should address me as Wind Spirit Supreme Elder, or Wind Spirit King. Don't be so ignorant of etiquette."</p><p></p><p>"You are the Sect Master of Spirit Veneration Sect, representing the face of our Spirit Veneration Mountain. How can you be ignorant of etiquette and lose face for our mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, don't accuse me, Wind Spirit, of being an arrogant elder. I'm thinking of Spirit Veneration Mountain's interests. Worthy brother Red Cat, give the Sect Master a copy of the etiquette manual..."</p><p></p><p>Damn! The Spirit Veneration Sect Master's facial muscles twitched as he looked at the little booklet handed to him. He felt terrible.</p><p></p><p>To be scolded for lacking etiquette by a spirit beast?</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit... Elder, what is this..."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Veneration Sect Master felt uneasy. Had the Wind Spirit Tiger really developed mental problems?</p><p></p><p>It was the strongest being on Spirit Veneration Mountain!</p><p></p><p>"As the great one of the tiger clan, I should lead by example, teaching the younger generation about etiquette and honor. What you see is just that."</p><p></p><p>"This is my worthy brother Red Cat, who manages all matters concerning my spirit beasts. Sect Master, if you have any issues, you can find worthy brother Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>"Meeting worthy brother Red Cat is like meeting me. I hope the Sect Master understands..."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Veneration Sect Master looked at the striped tiger standing upright, wearing a large gold chain around its neck and a long sword at its waist. The corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>Damn! He suspected that the Wind Spirit Tiger's transformation was all because of this striped tiger!</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Veneration Sect Master couldn't stay any longer. He made some perfunctory remarks and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger now spoke in a refined manner, no longer crudely. He found it hard to get used to!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

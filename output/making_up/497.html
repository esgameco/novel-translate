        <h1>Chapter 497</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mighty army of powerful cultivators in the Divine Realm moved like a storm towards the Qinghua Realm. As the Shadow Realm fell, spiritual energy storms erupted and Dao patterns appeared, sweeping across the entire Divine Realm as they advanced towards Qinghua Realm, as if carrying the momentum of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The realm gates between the various realms in the Divine Realm all disappeared during this great change, as Dao patterns swept across the entire Divine Realm. There were no more realm gates separating the different realms.</p><p></p><p>The wilderness also returned to normal, with all the realms interconnected. The 36 realms became one.</p><p></p><p>Traveling from the Nine Mountains Realm towards the Qinghua Realm, one could first see the unusual nature of the Qinghua Realm, as if it was an independent small world.</p><p></p><p>This was due to the Qinghua Grand Formation covering the entire Qinghua Realm. Although the realm gate no longer existed, one still had to enter through a portal to enter the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless one forcefully broke through the Qinghua Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>As the momentum grew greater and greater, the entire martial arts world was shaken. Even cultivators below the Immortal Realm were discussing and watching the outcome of this battle.</p><p></p><p>The mighty army of powerful cultivators was given a name - the Vengeance Alliance!</p><p></p><p>They even shouted a slogan: "Slay the Sword God, capture the True Dragon, avenge past humiliation!" When this news reached the Qinghua Realm, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"So they've increased their strength and think they're capable now?" Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh. The mental cultivation of these martial artists was lacking, how could they become so arrogant so easily?</p><p></p><p>His own disciples surpassed these people in terms of strength and cultivation speed, yet remained steady and not arrogant at all.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I as the Dao Ancestor have taught them well." Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>As for that mighty Vengeance Alliance army, it was nothing but a farce. Once Xu Yan took action, they would know what true power was.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so angry! Young Master Xu is such a good person, how did he offend them that they want to join forces to attack him!"</p><p></p><p>"If only my strength wasn't lacking, I would go destroy them!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were indignant.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, my Meng Chong is also very fierce, how come there's no one wanting to attack Meng Chong?" Zi Yun asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao rolled their eyes at her.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, news came that another slogan had emerged from the Vengeance Alliance: "The Treasure Alliance goes forth to subdue the Heaven God, avenge past humiliation!"</p><p></p><p>"See, I told you Meng Chong is also very fierce. How could there be no one seeking vengeance against him? The Treasure Alliance has indeed stepped up." Zi Yun said with relief, as if it would have been abnormal if no one wanted to attack Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do now? That Vengeance Alliance has great momentum and many cultivators." Du Yuying frowned.</p><p></p><p>"This is a small matter for Senior Brother Xu." Zi Yun said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"But Young Master Xu is in closed cultivation. He can't come out just for this, can he?" Yun Miaomiao furrowed her brows.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we ask Senior Xiao to take action?" Yue'er came over and suggested.</p><p></p><p>There were many Heaven Fusion Realm cultivators in the Vengeance Alliance. With Qinghua Sect's current strength, they could not resist. Apart from Xu Yan and a few others, only Old Man Xiao could block so many powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Such a small matter obviously wouldn't require the Dao Ancestor to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat had returned. Su Lingxiu had gone into closed cultivation, so unable to find Su Lingxiu, it could only continue to try to please its master.</p><p></p><p>"You big cat, why aren't you staying in your beast realm and coming back here?" Li Xuan couldn't help but be speechless seeing the red cat rubbing against his leg.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Beast King was actually acting like a fat cat trying to be cute.</p><p></p><p>But it had to be said, the red cat was as shrewd as ever, knowing who it should please most and how to make them happy.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat acted cute, then took out a pile of various divine medicines and spirit fruits. These were all delicious items, including many spiritual ingredients that could be used to make spirit cakes and other delicacies.</p><p></p><p>It handed them all over to Cai Ling'er in one go.</p><p></p><p>"You big cat, always so full of schemes." Li Xuan chuckled. The red cat was here to consolidate its backing.</p><p></p><p>The Vengeance Alliance's army had already entered the Nine Mountains Realm. Although the beast race was not weak in strength and Yu Xiaolong was powerful, they could only keep a low profile in the face of so many Heaven Fusion Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Beast Generals and many beast commanders all kept extremely low profiles, not daring to show any beast aura, and even found places to hide temporarily.</p><p></p><p>"I should hide too. If they discover me, this true dragon, they'll definitely chase and kill me." Yu Xiaolong was very depressed.</p><p></p><p>He shrank his body and directly went into hiding.</p><p></p><p>When the Vengeance Alliance cultivators saw that the so-called beast race had all cowered and hidden, not daring to show any aura, their momentum became even greater, with the posture of subduing the world and sweeping all before them.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm is not far!"</p><p></p><p>A Heaven Fusion Realm cultivator was full of vigor, with an air of having the world in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of how he could only nod and smile obsequiously under Xu Yan's might before, he felt extremely humiliated and became even more determined to avenge this humiliation on this trip!</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, follow me to pressure the Qinghua Realm and intimidate that brat Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, his voice resounding like thunder.</p><p></p><p>"Slay the Sword God, capture the True Dragon, avenge past humiliation! Xu Yan you brat, come quickly to meet your death!"</p><p></p><p>The many Heaven Fusion Realm cultivators, faces flushed red, also roared loudly, their voices like thunder shaking heaven and earth, spreading far and wide.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of powerful cultivators advanced towards the Qinghua Realm while their voices rumbled, wanting to use this momentum to intimidate Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful cultivators of the Wan family had cowered, afraid of being known to have connections with Xu Yan and bringing great trouble upon themselves!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu is truly a world-shaking prodigy!" Wan Tianlin couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>To be able to provoke so many powerful cultivators to attack, which genius in history could achieve this? Only Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go take a look!" Old Man Xiao had also received the news and decided to make a trip to intimidate the attackers.</p><p></p><p>Having received the great kindness of the Dao Ancestor's guidance, he should do some small things in return.</p><p></p><p>"No need!" Xu Yan's voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you've had a breakthrough?" Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"They're just a bunch of annoying flies. No need to disturb Master's peace. I'll go to the Nine Mountains Realm and subdue them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had also come out of closed cultivation, rubbing his head and revealing a ferocious smile, "The Treasure Alliance has gotten bold again, huh? Do they really think breaking through to the Heaven Fusion Realm means they can seek revenge on me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had also come out of closed cultivation, with an excited look of waiting to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat ran over.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Red Cat, you're back!" Su Lingxiu was delighted, reaching out to rub the red cat's fat head.</p><p></p><p>Croak! Little Ha let out a light cry and jumped onto Fang Hao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to take action. Wu Tiannan, Yue Changming and the others all came out of closed cultivation with looks of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Great Yue Emperor, Feng Yan and other Qinghua Sect powerhouses were also full of interest.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Realm, the Vengeance Alliance marched mightily towards the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The momentum was like a rainbow, stirring up the winds and clouds of heaven and earth. Even the trembling of the world was weakened by this sweeping force.</p><p></p><p>The roar of "Slay the Sword God, capture the true dragon, avenge our humiliation" sounded like rolling thunder, carrying an unstoppable momentum surging towards the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's roar came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's might was overwhelming. Winds and clouds gathered, and the rolling force advancing forward scattered amidst the surging dragon's power.</p><p></p><p>The warriors of the Vengeance Alliance focused their gazes and saw a snow-white true dragon appear in the sky above the Qinghua Realm, coming to meet the momentum they had unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Standing proudly on the dragon's head was a handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>The Sword God, Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ao Yuxue felt some regret. She should have left that mongrel dragon Yulong in the Qinghua Realm. Then Xu Yan would have ridden the mongrel to the Nine Mountains Realm instead of choosing her.</p><p></p><p>However, what was more hateful were those people of the so-called Vengeance Alliance in front. If not for them constantly talking about slaying the Sword God and capturing the true dragon, how would Xu Yan have thought to appear in this manner?</p><p></p><p>The warriors of the Vengeance Alliance fell silent for a moment. When truly facing the might of the true dragon and Xu Yan's strength, their hearts involuntarily skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young man standing proudly on the dragon's head, for a moment, the vast army fell silent.</p><p></p><p>From the dragon-subduing youth to now the dragon-riding youth, there had never been such a prodigy in the history of martial arts! At the edge of the Qinghua Realm, the youth stood on the dragon's head, proudly facing the crowd of warriors, unmoved by the surging winds and clouds, his expression unchanged despite the thunderous atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The great formation of Qinghua had been temporarily withdrawn by Fang Hao, so the warriors of the Vengeance Alliance had not noticed anything special about the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Yin Jue frowned slightly, looking towards the Qinghua Realm with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm seemed a bit off.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you humiliated us greatly that day. Today we have come to avenge ourselves. We give you two choices: either kneel down, kowtow and admit your mistake, and hand over the true dragon, or be slain by us!"</p><p></p><p>The temporarily elected leader of the Vengeance Alliance stepped forward and shouted sternly.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, with a boom, his aura erupted, revealing the might of a Tianhe Realm warrior without doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, even if you can defeat me, can you defeat all of us?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the warriors of the Vengeance Alliance unleashed their auras one after another. At this moment, the world truly changed color, with powerful auras stirring the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This part of the world seemed to have completely merged with the warriors, entirely under their control.</p><p></p><p>Although Ao Yuxue was a true dragon, and her strength surpassed any individual in the Vengeance Alliance, she felt intense pressure facing so many Tianhe Realm warriors.</p><p></p><p>If a real battle broke out, even though she was a true dragon, she could only avoid their sharp edge. Otherwise, if surrounded, it would be extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled contemptuously, "A bunch of clowns, thinking you've improved your strength and can now amount to something? I, Xu Yan, won't bully you. I'll give you two choices.</p><p></p><p>"One, kneel on the ground, kowtow and apologize for three days and three nights, and I'll spare your lives. Two, you'll be reduced to ashes!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant brat!" The leader of the Vengeance Alliance was furious and said coldly, "Which one of us hasn't cultivated for long years? Which one of us hasn't tempered ourselves at the peak of the Immortal Realm for thousands of years or more? Now that we've broken through in one go, our profound foundation and powerful strength are beyond what a little brat like you can imagine.</p><p></p><p>"With our combined forces, we could fight even a Divine Venerable. Xu Yan, you little brat, don't tell me you're a Divine Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly, "Cultivating for a long time doesn't mean you're formidable. It only proves you're useless, needing such a long time to cultivate to this level of strength.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of useless trash, and you dare to be proud?"</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Huang and the others felt a bit embarrassed inside. They had also cultivated for a long time to reach their current strength. Compared to Xu Yan, they were indeed quite useless.</p><p></p><p>However, their expressions remained unchanged, calm and composed. The useless ones in Xu Yan's words weren't them, but those people in front.</p><p></p><p>They had cultivated divine abilities, so how could they be compared to those people in front!</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! Arrogant brat, today we must slay you!"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Vengeance Alliance and the other Tianhe Realm warriors were so angry their faces turned green, as if their shameful secrets had been exposed, making them exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Who will go and slay the little brat Xu Yan!" The leader of the Vengeance Alliance turned back to ask the crowd of strong warriors.</p><p></p><p>Silence! For a moment, the crowd fell silent. The warriors looked at each other, and surprisingly, not one dared to step forward to fight.</p><p></p><p>After all, the scene of Xu Yan subduing the dragon, especially that enormous sword light, had intimidated them so much they dared not have any other thoughts, leaving a considerable shadow in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>On the way here, they had all been full of vigor, seemingly ready to fight Xu Yan for three hundred rounds. But when it came down to it, when they were about to step forward alone to fight, they suddenly lacked confidence.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Vengeance Alliance's face darkened. It was too embarrassing, too humiliating! Before they could avenge their old shame, they had added new shame!</p><p></p><p>"Leader, you are recognized as the strongest among us. You should naturally be the first to fight!" a Tianhe Realm warrior said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I am the leader. Being the strongest, how can I fight first?" The leader of the Vengeance Alliance glared and said.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers from the Qinghua Sect sighed inwardly. Xu Yan's fierce prestige was indeed strong, as no one dared to fight.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had broken through to the Tianhe Realm, when truly facing Xu Yan, they all became cowards.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered and said, "You can all attack together."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the warriors of the Vengeance Alliance became furious, their faces turning red. One of the Tianhe Realm warriors angrily stepped forward, "Let me experience just how skilled you, the Sword God, really are!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his aura erupted, and he instantly attacked Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His first move was an extremely powerful killing technique. A giant fist condensed between heaven and earth, smashing towards Xu Yan standing on the true dragon's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! His first move was seemingly frenzied, one punch after another, each punch stronger than the last. Moreover, he directly used secret techniques and even burned his own essence blood.</p><p></p><p>The violent fist force thundered, covering a wide area, completely engulfing Xu Yan, as if trying to thoroughly block all of Xu Yan's escape routes.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The leader of the Vengeance Alliance shouted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The others also started shouting, after all, someone was willing to step forward and test the waters, which was a good thing. Moreover, this person was truly brave enough to fight with his life on the line as soon as he stepped up, showing his deep hatred for Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged. He didn't even move his hand. With just a thought, sword lights appeared out of thin air, one after another, densely packed like raindrops sprinkling down.</p><p></p><p>Each sword light contained killing sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Puff!</p><p></p><p>One fist force after another was slashed away, while the sword lights seemed endless, continuously pouring down.</p><p></p><p>"This person's mind has been bewitched. Who is controlling him from behind?" Xu Yan's gaze swept through the crowd, but he didn't see any traces related to the Charm Witch.</p><p></p><p>Such mind-bewitching power made Xu Yan think of the Charm Witch first, and the Charm Witch indeed had this capability.</p><p></p><p>When the warriors of the Vengeance Alliance erupted with their auras, stirring up the winds and clouds of heaven and earth, Yin Jue had quietly left the crowd and hidden on another side, gradually approaching the Qinghua Realm, searching for his target.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yin Jue's gaze focused. He had found someone!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

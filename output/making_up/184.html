        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard of the Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan was sitting leisurely in a chair, sipping on Yunwu Spirit Tea, while Xu Yan and Meng Chong were contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was excitedly drawing diagrams of various instruments and tools to be used for her upcoming research and investigation on the premises.</p><p></p><p>There was not the slightest sense of urgency in the entire Changqing Pavilion, despite the imminent arrival of dozens of peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi were discussing how the Changqing Pavilion should develop next, and how the Great Wilderness could rise up, and what methods they could use to bring down the imperial house of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Rebellion was Kou Ruozhi's specialty, but after conversing with Xu Junhe, Kou Ruozhi's gaze towards Xu Junhe had changed.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he could become the wealthiest, being able to marry the daughter of the Prefect with his humble origins, Xu Junhe is truly cunning and crafty!" Kou Ruozhi muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan raised his head to look outside the Changqing Pavilion, then indifferently lowered his head to continue sipping his Yunwu Spirit Tea.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong abruptly opened their eyes, their eyes shining with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura was converging from all directions, the sky churning with clouds, like an invisible storm sweeping in.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu stopped drawing the instrument diagrams and looked up to see dozens of peak grand masters surging towards the Changqing Pavilion with imposing momentum.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu swallowed hard, feeling his heart and liver trembling. The peak grand masters, who were rarely seen, had now gathered in large numbers!</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, Kou Ruozhi, and the others, being the weakest in strength, felt the terrifying might the most, and despite knowing that their elders were present, they were still unable to remain calm, their faces slightly paling.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the dozens of peak grand masters was overwhelming, like a terrifying storm, even more impressive than the Headmaster of the Hidden Palace.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the peak grand masters, there were also over a hundred great grand masters below the peak level, their imposing presence clearly conveying their determination and attitude - directed at the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Telling the Tianbaoge that the Changqing Pavilion would never allow them to monopolize the Blossoming Qi Pill, and that they would not let the Tianbaoge control it alone!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Robe King stepped forward, his gaze stern, and shouted, "Changqing Pavilion, you have defied your superiors, what crime is that? Surrender immediately and await your punishment!"</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Robe King's eyes, subduing the Changqing Pavilion was inevitable, as their focus was on the Tianbaoge in the county city.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the Purple Robe King's words fell, a terrifying sword light came slashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion is not something the Great Yue Kingdom can meddle with. Today, I will slay you!" Xu Yan roared, leaping into the air.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, the four directions trembled, mountains and rivers collapsed, the thunderous sword qi seemed to appear out of thin air, like divine retribution, slashing towards the Purple Robe King.</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events shocked many of the powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Robe King was also startled, his aura surging, he roared and unleashed his full power, trying to block the strike.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan's sword strike was not easily blocked. The peak grand masters around the Purple Robe King changed color in their faces and rushed to help him.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Even so, the Purple Robe King was struck by the sword, coughing up blood and sent flying back, sustaining heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!" The crowd of powerful cultivators sank in their hearts. The Changqing Pavilion was actually related to Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Now, who in the martial arts world did not know the name of the Sword God Xu Yan, who had slain three peak grand masters, including the notorious Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign, one of the Nine Great Demon Lords of the Evil Cult?</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert, such an extraordinary genius destined to stand at the peak of the inner domain martial arts, how dare they offend him?</p><p></p><p>"We must kill him. Don't forget the purpose of this trip. If Xu Yan is so strong, is it related to the pills? If we also possess the pills, would our strength not surpass his?" The Purple Robe King, while shocked, also realized that if they did not kill Xu Yan, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd of powerful cultivators steeled their expressions. Since they had already made a move, and Xu Yan was so strong, they were not his match. Moreover, the Purple Robe King's words made sense - Xu Yan's strength might be related to the pills of the Changqing Pavilion. No one could sit still now.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with excitement and greed as they roared, "Xu Yan, hand over the pills, hand over the Changqing Pavilion, or you will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood there defiantly, surveying the crowd, and coldly said, "With all of you, you think you can kill me? The royal house of the Great Yue Kingdom is doing well. One day, I will personally go to the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom to teach them a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Robe King's gaze grew even more serious. Xu Yan had to be killed. If Xu Yan survived, with his formidable strength, the royal house of the Great Yue Kingdom would face a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring his injuries, the Purple Robe King erupted with powerful aura, along with the Great Guard Commander and the hidden cultivators of the Great Yue Kingdom, they attacked Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The other peak grand masters, seeing this, also did not dare to be careless. If Xu Yan escaped, the consequences would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Since they had offended him, they must use their numerical advantage to eliminate this threat.</p><p></p><p>"Slay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Sword Dao erupted, one sword strike after another, his Descending Dragon Palm lashing out, one dragon after another.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's massive body suddenly expanded, his golden light dazzling, his unparalleled saber light surging towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>He also charged into the fray.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of powerful cultivators grew more solemn, becoming more determined to kill the two. If they were allowed to escape, even individually, they might not be able to withstand a few of their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten peak grand masters attacked, yet Xu Yan still held his ground without falling back! What a terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>While the peak grand masters were shocked, their killing intent also grew stronger. They exchanged glances and unleashed their attacks.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the terrifying might, a myriad of attacks intertwined, like a cataclysmic storm, pouring down towards Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The people in the Changqing Pavilion were all tense, looking up to see those terrifying attacks cascading down, as if they could destroy the heavens and earth, targeting Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Yan and Meng Chong were strong, under the combined assault of so many, they appeared somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's heart was in his throat, his face full of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The powerful attacks came crashing down, Xu Yan slashing out sword after sword, tearing open one gap after another in the onslaught, but the terrifying attacks poured down like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he swung his sword, he could not block such a horrifying assault.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body was shining with golden light, his acupoints glittering, his saber light intertwined with the true essence of wind and thunder, frantically slashing, but his strength was ultimately weaker than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was a thunderous crash as he fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed disheveled but uninjured.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also about to reach his limit, his body constantly falling, slashing out sword after sword, but the cascading attacks were endless and growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful he revealed his strength to be, the more the peak grand masters were terrified and determined to eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up from his chair, stretched his waist, and moved his limbs.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He bounced back and forth a few times, as if warming up.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a raise of his hand, true qi surged, harmonizing with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Suddenly, the spiritual energy around them became violent, converging above the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Coalescing into a massive spiritual energy shield!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of the attacks from the group of martial artists was all blocked by the spiritual energy shield.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan descended from midair, looking at the shield formed by the condensed spiritual energy, his whole being filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>This was the wonder of the Tong Xuan - controlling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, transforming it into the power of Tong Xuan! Even peak grand masters could only mobilize the spiritual energy around them to a certain extent, transforming it into formidable power. But compared to the power of the Tong Xuan realm, the difference was vast.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, watch closely, and see what Tong Xuan is, what it means to comprehend the mysteries of heaven and earth!" Li Xuan looked at Xu Yan with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Today, the master would personally take action to demonstrate for his disciple the power of Tong Xuan!</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully, this is Tong Xuan. I hope that once you enter the Tong Xuan, you will be able to comprehend the wonders of Tong Xuan, grasp the essence of Tong Xuan."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, he held a jade scepter behind his back with one hand, and with a wave of the other hand, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth transformed into a gigantic sword dozens of meters long, spanning the sky above the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, staring intently. Seeing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth transform into a massive sword, a flash of insight seemed to appear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was related to the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he seemed to have a vague understanding of how to cultivate the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The wonders of Tong Xuan, the heaven and earth are all my sword..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention, looking at his master who was leisurely and unrestrained, ascending to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he was about to witness his master's display of power again.</p><p></p><p>Although his master was not revealing his true strength, but rather the power he possessed when he was at the Tong Xuan realm, it still filled him with longing.</p><p></p><p>His master was putting in great effort to teach him. His master, though now so powerful, never used his realm to oppress others, even if the enemies were numerous. Xu Yan sighed inwardly: "My master must have once fought countless powerful opponents alone, and has already gotten used to fighting a group of enemies single-handedly. Even though his realm is now extremely high, he still treats his opponents as equals."</p><p></p><p>This confidence and unrestrained nature of a true expert, Xu Yan was still far from achieving.</p><p></p><p>His master's realm was so lofty, he could only look up to it in awe.</p><p></p><p>In midair, the group of martial artists were all stunned. Such a terrifying attack could not break through the massive shield covering the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, they saw a young man of leisurely and unrestrained bearing, stepping into the sky, and with a wave of his hand, a gigantic sword materialized in midair.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts sank.</p><p></p><p>They realized they had run into trouble, that there was such a terrifying expert within the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>What realm of existence was this? Could it be even beyond the Grand Masters?</p><p></p><p>But the Grand Masters were already the pinnacle of the inner domain's martial arts!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Backed into a corner with no retreat, these Grand Masters did not hold back. After all, each of them had once been a prodigy, to have reached the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they reached a tacit understanding - they must exert their full power to fight!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists unleashed their full might, the terrifying power converging in midair, stirring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. In a moment, the sky above the Qingqing Pavilion darkened.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a cataclysmic storm had arrived!</p><p></p><p>On the Sky Treasure Pavilion in Tieshan County, two Half-Step Celestial Beings watched the scene above the Qingqing Pavilion with grave expressions, this mysterious existence seemed to be a peerless expert at the true Celestial Being realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet he did not suppress them with his realm?</p><p></p><p>What incredible confidence!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and swung, the gigantic sword descended, a sense of annihilation rippling through the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Annihilation Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A single sword strike tore through the storm, parting the darkness, and instantly reduced dozens of peak Grand Masters to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a golden giant dragon hundreds of meters long appeared in midair, its eyes opened, its draconic might surging, it let out a roar and charged into the group of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, the Grand Masters were destroyed, no matter how they unleashed their attacks, no matter how frantically they fought, even resorting to martial arts secrets.</p><p></p><p>They were still unable to withstand it in the slightest, being crushed and annihilated by the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, one palm, had already eliminated a third of the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Then, a massive fist appeared in midair, surging with wind and thunder, violently crashing into the group of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Under the horrified and desperate gazes of the Grand Masters, this terrifying fist power, unrivaled and unstoppable, swept through like a thunderous gale, annihilating another batch of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Grand Masters were now trembling with fear, their faces deathly pale, cold sweat dripping constantly.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>Facing the young man's attacks, they felt like ants trying to shake a tree, or a mantis trying to stop a chariot - utterly powerless. One sword strike, one palm, one fist, had instantly wiped out nearly half of them.</p><p></p><p>How could they fight against this?</p><p></p><p>In the Qingqing Pavilion, everyone looked up at this scene, their hearts shaken.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong, not far from the Tong Xuan realm, had excitement and fervor in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>So this was the Tong Xuan realm? It was truly powerful beyond measure, seemingly on a completely different level from the peak Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in terms of realms, the two were actually at the same level. The gap was simply too vast.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desert martial artists like Kou Ruozhi were excited to the point of frenzy, their reverence and faith in the Great Desert Martial Ancestor had reached the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is truly powerful beyond measure, the Tong Xuan realm that is on par with the Grand Masters is completely crushing them!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Desert martial artists were burning with passion, their eyes wild with fervor, their belief in cultivating the martial dao and reaching the Tong Xuan realm becoming even more resolute.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not yet obtained the Tong Xuan technique!</p><p></p><p>In midair, a blade appeared.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, it was as if the entire heaven and earth belonged to this one blade, with an aura that dominated the world.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes widened, his gaze burning with excitement, his heart racing - his master was about to unleash the Heaven and Earth Dominating Blade!</p><p></p><p>Boom! A single blade strike slashed through the sky, and another large group of martial artists were reduced to ashes under the blade light.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Grand Masters had lost the will to fight.</p><p></p><p>This was no different from courting death.</p><p></p><p>Many Grand Masters regretted being greedy and misled by the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family, coming to join forces to plunder the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Grand Masters were terrified. If they were to somehow survive, this would haunt them for the rest of their lives, an inescapable shadow of fear!</p><p></p><p>However, now that Li Xuan had taken action, how could he let anyone escape?</p><p></p><p>As a teacher who had instructed disciples, when it came to enemies, he must grind their bones to dust and extinguish their souls. Of course, he would lead by example and not spare a single one.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth instantly became violent, transforming into swords, blades, fists, and the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The violent attacks swept out, annihilating all the Grand Masters who had attempted to flee.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

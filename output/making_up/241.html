            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Cultivators of Divine Beings, the top powerhouses in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were reduced to ashes just like that.</p><p></p><p>With just a casual slap of the hand, as if swatting two mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>"My teacher is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He could only sneak attack to kill a Cultivator of Divine Beings, while his teacher just casually slapped his hand and the Cultivator of Divine Beings turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his teacher obviously did not use his true strength, it was just an ordinary gesture, like swatting a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to reach that level?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his bald head, his Indestructible Golden Body was still a bit weak, and he could not yet reach the level where his teacher could just slap his hand to kill a Cultivator of Divine Beings.</p><p></p><p>"I should be close to breaking through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong silently mused.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the elders from the Jade Deity Sect and the Su Family was just a minor incident, the group continued on to the place Jade Little Dragon had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>In the Zheng Kingdom, a hundred miles outside the capital city, there was a picturesque location, a newly established manor nestled in a small valley.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat leisurely in a chair.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth constantly surged into his body, even without cultivation, his cultivation was slowly rising on its own.</p><p></p><p>The resting place in the Spiritual Realm had been built.</p><p></p><p>That day, Xu Yan and Meng Chong came to take their leave, the two were going to venture into the Spiritual Realm and compete with the geniuses there.</p><p></p><p>"Go, the path of martial dao has never been smooth, more experience, more battles, will help with your insights, learn from the strengths of many, gather the methods of many, comprehend the true meaning of the martial dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke in a stern teacher's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Once you have comprehended the methods of divine abilities, come back, and I will teach you the martial dao beyond divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his two disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple will diligently cultivate and constantly ponder the wonders of divine abilities, to comprehend them as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple will definitely break through the second and third layers of the Indestructible Golden Body as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also said the same.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go then!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had ultimately decided that after Xu Yan comprehended the methods of divine abilities, he would then pass on the martial dao realms beyond divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Without comprehending divine abilities, even if he passed on the martial dao beyond divine abilities, Xu Yan would not be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial dao beyond divine abilities, although he had a general direction and outline, Li Xuan had not yet composed it satisfactorily, perhaps after breaking through divine abilities, he would have new ideas and be able to compose even better martial dao methods.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong departed.</p><p></p><p>The Jade State would certainly be in turmoil again, after all, Xu Yan was being hunted by the Jade Deity Sect and the Su Family, with a bounty of hundreds of millions of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>They even offered the identity of a Spiritual Sect or Aristocratic Family cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Many wandering cultivators wanted to seize this opportunity to soar and shed their identity as wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the type to swallow his pride, how could he let this go?</p><p></p><p>Just like how he went to destroy the Dai Family after they had been chasing him.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling gently massaged her teacher's shoulders, with a coquettish expression.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is too weak."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>She had been chased by the Hidden Pavilion, and Zhou Ying had taken her to hide in the remote wilderness, she never felt truly safe. There were many powerful cultivators in the Spiritual Realm, and she was only at the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>If she encountered a Cultivator of Divine Beings, she could only flee, if she made a mistake, she wouldn't even have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>So, she lacked a sense of security and had no desire to venture out.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not like my senior brothers, even when facing Cultivators of Divine Beings, they can resist and even counterattack. I've decided, after breaking through the Divine Source Realm, I'll go out and venture."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling squinted her eyes.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Divine Source Realm, she would have some confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you wish."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not insist.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling was a Pill Dao cultivator, she was not particularly adept at combat, as long as she had spirit herbs, she could constantly refine pills and perfect her Pill Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well, break through the Divine Source Realm as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan encouraged her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>As for Shi Er, Meng Shu Shu, and Zhou Ying, they had no desire to venture into the Spiritual Realm either, they were not even at the Divine Will Realm, their strength was too weak in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they would be in danger at any time.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat also had no intention of venturing out, it was currently focusing its efforts on improving its own strength, striving to become the King of Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "Dai Sheng once chased me, although I destroyed the Dai Family once, the Dai Family has not been completely eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"I can't swallow this resentment, and the Jade Deity Sect and the Su Family are also hunting me.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to teach the Spiritual Realm's Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families a lesson."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, his gaze turned cold and he said, "Your strength, brother, can easily kill a Great Celestial Cultivator, I can hold off Dai Sheng, even if I can't defeat him, I won't be without the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>"So, we're going to destroy the Dai Family!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was already close to breaking through to the Divine Will Realm, he had broken through to the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Heart Sword Realm, his strength had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't defeat Dai Sheng, he could still hold him off without any problem.</p><p></p><p>And with Meng Chong's strength, as a six-zhang tall giant, he could easily sweep through the Dai Family without any issues.</p><p></p><p>Great Celestial Cultivators could not even harm Meng Chong, let alone break through his Indestructible Divine Armor, much less his physical defense.</p><p></p><p>"Good, our teacher-disciple prestige will start with destroying the Dai Family!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon poked his head out from Xu Yan's sleeve, he swallowed a mouthful of saliva, looking a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"You two teacher-disciples are truly crazy! You're already preparing to destroy the Dai Family?"</p><p></p><p>"If I had the strength, I could help too."</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>He ultimately had not been able to learn the Great Demon Techniques from the Crimson Cat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "You want to learn the Great Demon Techniques, just wait a bit longer, once the Crimson Cat breaks through, it will teach you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally knew the Crimson Cat's intentions.</p><p></p><p>It was simply afraid that after passing the Great Demon Techniques to Jade Little Dragon, its strength would surpass the Crimson Cat's, so the Crimson Cat was planning to break through first, increase its own strength, and then it could easily suppress Jade Little Dragon when passing on the Great Demon Techniques.</p><p></p><p>And Jade Little Dragon would be the first demonic soldier and general on its path to becoming the King of Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Cat does have some ambition."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Go find a friend to understand the situation in the Jade State, and get some information on the Dai Family."</p><p></p><p>After changing his appearance, Xu Yan led Meng Chong towards the large city under the Shen Family's jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>To inquire with Shen Hai Zhou about the news.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xu Yan killed the Dai Family's Cultivator of Divine Beings and raided the Dai Family's treasury, the Jade Deity Sect and the Su Family had joined forces to hunt him, but Xu Yan had seemingly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>No news had come since then.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect and the Su Family were heavy-hearted, they even contacted Spiritual Sects outside the Jade State, asking them to help locate Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Many wandering cultivators wanted to seize this opportunity to soar and shed their identity as wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the type to swallow his pride, how could he let this go?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeking to trace Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Haizhou, after waiting for a while without leaking the news that he had provided intelligence to Xu Yan, he once again emerged from the clan territory to wander.</p><p></p><p>However, for the sake of caution, he only wandered within the domain controlled by the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the large city where he had made an appointment with Xu Yan, he remained there until now.</p><p></p><p>Recently, there was news that someone had discovered Xu Yan's trail, and two Refining Immortal experts from the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family went to apprehend him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, these two Refining Immortal experts from the two factions disappeared and never returned. It can be almost certain that they were killed! This immediately made the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family restless.</p><p></p><p>These were Refining Immortal experts, the foundation of the Spiritual Sects and the great families, and the threat that Xu Yan posed to them had reached its peak, as if a hand was grasping the throats of the two major powers.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family once again raised the bounty, and the generous bounty even attracted some Refining Immortal Celestials among the unaffiliated cultivators to be tempted.</p><p></p><p>This also shows the determination of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family. The conflict between the two major powers and Xu Yan had reached the point of "either you die or I perish."</p><p></p><p>They even began to persuade the other Spiritual Sects and great families in the Jade State to participate and jointly eliminate Xu Yan, nipping this potential threat in the bud.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family was also on the invitation list.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shen family was one of the top five great families, with strength not inferior to the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's view on this was: "If we fail to kill him, the Shen family will be dragged down, but by sitting on the sidelines, we might have a chance to strengthen ourselves and swallow the resources of the Jade Spirit Sect and even the Su family."</p><p></p><p>With these words, he convinced his father Shen Wang, his grandfather Shen Tai, and the other clan elders, and thus politely declined the invitations from the Su family and the Jade Spirit Sect, even though they offered substantial benefits.</p><p></p><p>The second and third-tier Spiritual Sects and great families in the Jade State were naturally not lacking in those who wanted to curry favor with the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family by participating, so the number of forces involved gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu's situation is worrying!" Shen Haizhou sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, he believed that Xu Yan had already fled the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Worlds Alliance was also searching for Xu Yan's whereabouts, and the courageous Weng Yong, who had escaped the Jade State, conveyed a message to the Jade State's Alliance Master, solemnly introducing this talented unaffiliated cultivator, Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The prosperous city under the Shen family's control, Wangcheng.</p><p></p><p>In front of a small shop, a beautiful young lady, listening to the chubby young man's words of praise, had her jade-like face flushed red, and she shyly said, "This young master, I'm not as good as you say."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's chubby face was full of smiles as he said, "The lady's beauty is beyond words to describe... Why don't I invite the young master in to have a look at the beautiful scenery? I'm sure the lady won't disappoint."</p><p></p><p>Slap! A hand landed on his shoulder, and Shen Haizhou immediately became angry, turning back and saying, "Can't you see that the young master is..."</p><p></p><p>But what met his eyes was a handsome young man, whose face seemed somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>And beside the young man was a bald, burly man, with a fierce and powerful aura, looking extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>It scared him, and his heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen!" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was taken aback, "Brother Xu?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"He is?" Shen Haizhou swallowed a mouthful of saliva, looking at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple brother, Meng Chong!" Xu Yan introduced.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou heaved a sigh of relief, so it was Xu Yan's disciple brother. But why was his disciple brother so fierce? "This is not the place to talk, Brother Xu, follow me."</p><p></p><p>No wonder he found the face familiar, it was Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Under Shen Haizhou's guidance, Xu Yan and Meng Chong followed him into a secluded small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, I've come to inquire about the situation of the Dai family. I'm planning to erase the Dai family, this great family, from the Jade State!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said: Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou swallowed a mouthful of saliva, with a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>He had just wiped out a Refining Immortal Celestial from the Dai family, and now he was planning to directly destroy the Dai family? While Xu Yan and Meng Chong were contemplating going to destroy the Dai family, their teacher, Li Xuan, had already entered the capital city of the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's the Spiritual Domain." Looking at the vast city, the prosperous scene, far exceeding the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The people coming and going were all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Patriarchs could be seen everywhere, and Grand Patriarchs belonged to the middle-tier cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators below the First Rank were all at the bottom-tier.</p><p></p><p>Shops lined the streets, selling spiritual herbs, elixirs, weapons, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The transactions were conducted using spiritual crystals or the spiritual notes of a few major Spiritual Sects, but the spiritual notes were too scarce for the bottom-tier unaffiliated cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This must be the so-called slum, huh?" Li Xuan came to the West District Market, looking at the messy and noisy streets, where even Patriarch cultivators could show off a little, and Grand Patriarchs finally found a bit of lofty glory.</p><p></p><p>More were the cultivators below the First Rank, the unaffiliated ones.</p><p></p><p>"How much for forging a high-grade spiritual weapon?"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator standing in front of a blacksmith's shop asked.</p><p></p><p>The man wearing a short-sleeved beast-hide shirt raised one finger and said, "Ten thousand spiritual crystals!"</p><p></p><p>"A little cheaper, I'll provide some of the materials myself."</p><p></p><p>"Eight thousand, can't go any lower!"</p><p></p><p>"Too expensive."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator who wanted to forge a weapon had a pained expression on his face and was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Six thousand, we're all having a hard time, and the shop rent here is not cheap. In the entire West District Market, there are few who can match my forging skills, and this is the lowest price I can offer."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, six thousand!" The cultivator gritted his teeth, with a pained expression, and pulled out a spiritual note.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched this scene, gaining a deeper understanding of the plight of the bottom-tier cultivators in the Spiritual Domain.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate the Esoteric Martial Arts, the talent for forging weapons and formations is indispensable, and the comprehension ability must also be high. It's best to have some unique insights."</p><p></p><p>"Those who are mediocre and follow the conventional path, without any unique insights or daring innovations, will find it difficult to possess the talent for the Esoteric Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked through the West District Market, looking at the various weapon forging shops, and couldn't help but ponder how to find the fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The Esoteric Martial Arts belong to the unconventional path. Those who are too conventional and average will not have the talent to cultivate them. Finding the right person is not easy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Domain was so vast, surely there must be such talented individuals, he hoped to encounter them.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to spread the formation diagrams, whoever can comprehend them would gain an opportunity. But would it attract the attention of the Spiritual Sects and great families, bringing unnecessary trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on his own search would be too difficult, this was truly a matter of fate in finding disciples.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the West District Market, he wandered to the South District Market.</p><p></p><p>The South District Market was mainly for selling spiritual herbs and spiritual beasts, and the spiritual beasts sold were mostly low-priced ones, either to be slaughtered and eaten, or to be refined into elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Or they were kept as pets.</p><p></p><p>Walking through the bustling South District Market street, he reached the quiet end of the market district, and in a simple shop there, a slightly chubby young man came out. Seeing Li Xuan, he revealed a mysterious and lecherous smile.</p><p></p><p>Furtively leaning in, he whispered, "Big brother, come, come, I have a treasure here, would you like to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked around cautiously and said in a low voice, "This is a treasure highly praised by the young master of the Shen family!"</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

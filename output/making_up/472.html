        <h1>Chapter 472</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, pointing at Tianzi, then at the sky, then at the ground, and said with a smile: "You are a spirit of heaven and earth, transformed from purple light!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Tianzi was shocked, but at the same time no longer doubted Li Xuan's power. In fact, he even felt relieved. </p><p></p><p>Since Li Xuan knew his identity but hadn't done anything, it was clear he had no ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>Only a handful of people knew Tianzi's identity as a spirit of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And even fewer knew he was transformed from purple light.</p><p></p><p>"So you really did know, senior. I was overthinking things," Tianzi said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to have quite a story, young friend. Why don't you tell me about it?" Li Xuan took the opportunity to ask with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was silent for a moment, then raised his hand to point at the sky and said: "Beyond heaven and earth is a place of primordial chaos that has not yet taken form. Senior, do you call it 'hundun' (chaos)?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and nodded, then shook his head. "Yes, and no!"</p><p></p><p>Beyond heaven and earth was indeed a state of primordial chaos, filled with unformed qi. Li Xuan's first thought was to call it "hundun", which is why he had used that term.</p><p></p><p>However, the fact that Tianzi asked this question meant they clearly didn't call it "hundun".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally didn't want to completely contradict what he had said before, but he also didn't want to entirely negate Tianzi's terminology. So he gave an answer that seemed to contain hidden meaning.</p><p></p><p>Some things shouldn't be stated too definitively, or there would be no room for maneuver. Li Xuan was already very skilled at this.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi didn't ask why it was both yes and no. Instead, his expression became more serious as he said in a complex tone tinged with reminiscence: "The primordial chaos beyond the heavens, Tai Cang and the others call it the 'Unformed Realm', or the 'Realm of Primordial Chaos'. In the past, the powerful beings within heaven and earth all called it the 'Outer Unformed Realm'...</p><p></p><p>"The Unformed Realm seems to exist eternally, inhabited by primal spirits. But they are like beasts - although they have great abilities and even innate talents, they use them crudely, without knowledge of cultivation, relying only on their own growth.</p><p></p><p>"No one knows when the beings of the Unformed Realm first came into existence, or how long they have existed. Even one as powerful as Tai Cang cannot trace back to see the ultimate origin.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, senior must know. If it were the past me, I would have curiously pestered you to explain everything clearly. But now, I no longer have such curiosity."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Tianzi's expression became somewhat melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently, also feeling some emotion. The primordial chaos before heaven and earth was not too different from the "hundun" he knew.</p><p></p><p>He poured a cup of tea for Tianzi, acting as a listener.</p><p></p><p>As expected, once Tianzi started talking about these past events, he couldn't stop. He would continue on, telling the whole story.</p><p></p><p>Just as anticipated, after taking a sip of tea, Tianzi continued:</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang was born in the Unformed Realm. According to Tai Cang, he doesn't know how he came into being, or what kind of being he was. At first he was in a daze, like those primal spirits of the Unformed Realm, his intelligence not yet awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, at that time in the Unformed Realm, primal spirits were numerous. It was survival of the fittest - weak spirits were in constant danger of being eaten.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang said he witnessed the brutal slaughter of primal spirits. For some unknown reason, his intelligence gradually awakened and he slowly became clever. Moreover, his physical form gradually changed into the human-like shape he has now.</p><p></p><p>"By observing the battles between various primal spirits, both strong and weak, he gradually figured out how to hide, how to dodge, how to efficiently hunt primal spirits..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was slowly narrating the story.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist of this story was called Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>From Tianzi's narration, it was clear he had an extremely close relationship with Tai Cang. Obviously, these events were not personally experienced by Tianzi, but were told to him by Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of Tianzi's origins - a spirit of Tai Cang's heaven and earth, transformed from the purple light of creation. Clearly, his birth was related to Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Tai Cang had likely created him.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang said he didn't know how large the Unformed Realm was. He had no fixed abode, wandering the Unformed Realm. He also encountered dangers. At that time, he had no concept of the passage of time or sense of time. He just drifted along, and because he had intelligence, he felt proud when facing other primal spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Later on, Tai Cang even stopped viewing himself as the same kind of being as those primal spirits, feeling he was a unique existence.</p><p></p><p>"After wandering for who knows how long, Tai Cang saw an immensely powerful primal spirit. But this spirit was already old, seemingly near death.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang observed this spirit until it died of old age, its corpse discovered and completely devoured by other primal spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang said that scene shocked him greatly. It turned out that even if not killed, beings would still die of old age. Although he didn't know how long that spirit had lived, it had ultimately died.</p><p></p><p>"From that moment on, Tai Cang felt he should have some pursuit..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Tianzi paused and looked at Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you know what Tai Cang's pursuit was?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded slightly. He had already guessed some of it.</p><p></p><p>"You said Tai Cang was a very gifted young one. Tai Cang's talent is unmatched by anyone I know."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi let out a breath and said solemnly: "Tai Cang was the first cultivator in the Unformed Realm. His talent was extraordinary, and he pioneered the way of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang cultivated in the Unformed Realm, absorbing the violent spiritual energy to practice, constantly exploring and improving.</p><p></p><p>"Just like that, after who knows how many years, Tai Cang became powerful. Those once-formidable primal spirits he couldn't match before, he could now easily hunt.</p><p></p><p>"As his cultivation deepened and he grew stronger, the range Tai Cang could traverse in the Unformed Realm also expanded. He could hunt increasingly powerful primal spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Until one day, he encountered primal spirits that also possessed intelligence..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was narrating Tai Cang's story, from his birth to his rise to power. Naturally, all these events had been told to Tianzi by Tai Cang himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently, feeling more and more amazed. Tai Cang was truly legendary.</p><p></p><p>From the time Tai Cang encountered the first intelligent primal spirit, the entire Unformed Realm began to change. Intelligent beings started appearing more and more frequently.</p><p></p><p>These intelligent beings were constantly growing stronger. They were all influenced by Tai Cang, such as preferring to take human form.</p><p></p><p>For instance, they also figured out their own cultivation methods from Tai Cang's way of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If one were to trace the origin of cultivation methods among the beings of the Unformed Realm, it seemed to start with Tai Cang. They were all influenced by him.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cang guided many beings in cultivation, and because of this, he gathered a group of followers around him.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, when Tai Cang and the others were not the strongest in the Unformed Realm, to gradually reaching the pinnacle, there were very, very few primal spirits that could contend with them.</p><p></p><p>And besides Tai Cang, other extraordinarily gifted beings also appeared in the Unformed Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Unformed Realm was chaotic, without heaven and earth. There wasn't even the concept of heaven and earth. Tai Cang and the others all lived in the Unformed Realm, wandering through it.</p><p></p><p>"After who knows how many years, Tai Cang grew tired of aimless wandering and having no fixed abode. So in the Un-</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He settled down and made a home there. Most of the time, he pondered cultivation techniques, occasionally venturing out to collect materials for research.</p><p></p><p>The other sentient beings mostly did the same - finding a place to settle, occasionally traveling around, coexisting peacefully with each other. </p><p></p><p>After all, in the entire Unformed Realm, only they possessed intelligence. Even if conflicts arose, they would restrain themselves. Sometimes, a more powerful and respected figure would step in to resolve disputes.</p><p></p><p>For example, Taicang would preside over justice impartially and resolve some conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi sighed and said, "Originally, if this way of life had continued, it may not have been bad. But how could things in the world go so smoothly?</p><p></p><p>In the murky, unformed chaos, with the emergence of intelligent beings, they naturally wanted to pursue more and change their living environment.</p><p></p><p>So Taicang collected materials and forged some treasures that emitted light. Thus, light appeared in the Unformed Realm, even lights of various colors.</p><p></p><p>A group of people pursued the beauty within, which sparked conflicts. Gradually, several small groups formed, but these did not affect Taicang.</p><p></p><p>Taicang was proud and the strongest. Naturally, he had the most followers. Although other small groups had their own factions, they still respected Taicang.</p><p></p><p>If major conflicts erupted, they would still ask Taicang to preside over justice and mediate..."</p><p></p><p>As Tianzi narrated, Li Xuan couldn't help but marvel at how remarkable Taicang truly was.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, there was still no mention of Heaven and Earth, nor any changes to Heaven and Earth. This meant that although Taicang had forged luminous treasures, allowing them to see brilliant colors in the Unformed Realm, Heaven and Earth still did not exist.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi continued narrating, sometimes long-winded and rambling. Much of it was about Taicang's daily life, occasionally mediating conflicts or even suppressing strong challengers.</p><p></p><p>At times, Tianzi would reveal a lonely expression, even mocking Taicang for being too self-important.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan could see that Tianzi's feelings for Taicang were extremely deep.</p><p></p><p>After all, in a sense, Taicang had created him.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang grew stronger and stronger. Throughout the Unformed Realm, no other powerful spirit could match him. At that time, Taicang could be said to be the strongest in the Unformed Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, besides Taicang, there were six others who were also extremely powerful, far surpassing other beings.</p><p></p><p>However, they were still considerably weaker than Taicang. Due to differences in their natures and cultivation methods, they formed their own factions.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, small conflicts would erupt, but these were just minor issues."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Tianzi paused.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't urge him on, continuing to drink tea silently, completely assuming the role of a listener.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you should know how Heaven and Earth came to be, right?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Heaven and Earth was related to his birth.</p><p></p><p>"In the Unformed Realm, only in the areas where Taicang and others gathered was there color and light. This naturally attracted some unformed spirits. Some spirits were hunted, while others were domesticated and tamed to become mounts.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, a purple light appeared at the edge of the Unformed Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether the purple light truly appeared from the edge of the Unformed Realm is now impossible to verify, but at the time, Taicang and others felt that the purple light seemed to appear from the edge.</p><p></p><p>The purple light illuminated the chaos, as if splitting the Unformed Realm in two, stretching across the entire realm. This was the first time the Unformed Realm was illuminated by light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the first time Taicang and others had seen it. As for whether it had appeared before their birth, that is unknown.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the purple light made Taicang and others realize this was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Spirits without awakened intelligence were frightened by the purple light, roaring and fleeing outside its illumination, while Taicang and the others rushed towards the purple light..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart began to race with excitement as he listened.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the purple light also meant that Heaven and Earth were about to be born.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone was competing for the purple light. Taicang, being the strongest, naturally obtained the most purple light, including the most brilliant part.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gained opportunities from the purple light, but how to use it was unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, Taicang used the purple light to carve out a vast realm of Heaven and Earth within the Unformed Realm, further enhancing himself in the process.</p><p></p><p>The other six followed Taicang's example, using purple light to create their own realms of Heaven and Earth. As for the rest, they became followers of Taicang and the other six, carving out their own positions within these realms.</p><p></p><p>I am a part of the purple light. When Taicang was creating his realm, he ultimately retained a portion of the purple light. He placed this portion within the realm to nurture it, and thus I was born.</p><p></p><p>Seven great realms of Heaven and Earth, with Taicang's being supreme - the most perfect and vast realm."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Tianzi's eyes had turned red, as if tears might fall at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked. Seven great realms of Heaven and Earth, with Taicang's being supreme!</p><p></p><p>There were seven realms of Heaven and Earth, and Taicang's realm was the strongest and most vast.</p><p></p><p>Besides Taicang's realm, there were six other realms.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of the Netherworld, the Demon Realm... These were likely two of the other six realms.</p><p></p><p>"Senior said that Taicang's realm was lacking something, that it was too weak. In fact, Taicang's realm was the strongest and most perfect.</p><p></p><p>The laws of Heaven and Earth operated smoothly, the rules were complete, the spiritual energy was gentle, the spiritual mechanisms were active, mountains, rivers, and lakes were all present - it was incomparable to the other six realms.</p><p></p><p>Taicang's strength was undoubtedly first, he had always been the leader.</p><p></p><p>After the realms were created, they initially went through a growth stage. After a long period of growth, they finally reached their peak, and the realms of Heaven and Earth were fully formed.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirits from outside the realms entered and gradually developed intelligence. Thus, spirits were divided into those of Heaven and Earth, and those of the Unformed Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after the birth of Heaven and Earth, the term 'spirit' specifically referred to those with intelligence. 'Unformed spirits' referred to those without intelligence, meaning spirits that had not yet been enlightened.</p><p></p><p>The human race was also born at this time. All beings liked to exist in human form, which was influenced by Taicang.</p><p></p><p>Taicang taught the martial way, and cultivators appeared in the realms. The seven great realms interacted and learned from each other, with each realm seeking suitable places for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Everything was harmonious and thriving. Taicang and the other six were the rulers of the seven great realms, with Taicang being supreme, worshipped by all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The realms now had time, a record of years. I can't remember how many years passed since the creation of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, Taicang and the other six gathered together, looking into the depths of the Unformed Realm, as if they had discovered something..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the might of a supreme expert, Huang Liang came stirring up the winds and clouds of the heavens and earth, his domineering aura unparalleled, yet he ended up dying like an ant! The stark contrast left Zheng Huang and the others dazed and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a thought they had never had before arose in their minds: Even the supreme experts of the Transcendent Spirit Sect are no more than this! The towering, god-like figure that stood tall in the heavens and earth was deeply imprinted in their souls, something they could never forget for the rest of their lives, and even the mere thought of it would make their souls tremble.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, Xu Yan excitedly asked, "Master, what martial art did you just display?"</p><p></p><p>It was so powerful, so overwhelming, as if it could prop up the heavens and earth, ready to split them open.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability!" replied Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was currently examining Huang Liang's storage bag, which he had left behind. After all, he was a supreme expert of the Transcendent Spirit Sect, so the storage bag might contain something valuable.</p><p></p><p>However, he was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Inside the storage bag, there were only a few divine spirit herbs and three medicinal pills. Apart from that, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>The items he carried were likely all useful to Huang Liang.</p><p></p><p>The core treasures and cultivation techniques of the Thousand Martial Hall were obviously not carried on his person.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Divine Ability!" Xu Yan was still in awe, it was just too powerful.</p><p></p><p>His blood was boiling, wishing he could break through to the Divine Ability realm immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my Divine Ability can manipulate the heavens and earth," Li Xuan said calmly, his expression unruffled. Inwardly, however, he was feeling extremely comfortable and relaxed. "Just now, I had already suppressed my Divine Ability to the lowest level, less than one-billionth-billionth-billionth of its full power. As for the heavens and earth, it's better not to speak of it."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Li Xuan shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shaken, his eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, Master's strength is too great. If you were to unleash even a fraction of your true power, the heavens and earth might not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's why Master is unwilling to overwhelm others with your cultivation. Whenever you act, you have to suppress your realm and strength.</p><p></p><p>"The reason is that you're worried that even the slightest leakage of your true power would cause upheaval in the heavens and earth, bringing calamity to all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood. His master had already reached such a terrifying level of power.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's wrong with the heavens and earth?" Meng Chong scratched his head, his heart itching with curiosity as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"You'll know when the time comes. For now, focus on cultivating and improving your strength," Li Xuan waved his hand, unwilling to discuss it further.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the formation reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the ant Huang Liang is dead, let's get back to what we were doing."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out the Taicangshu and prepared to continue his research into the laws of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>With him taking action once, his disciples would be eager to cultivate like crazy again.</p><p></p><p>He looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"The realms above the Divine Ability are basically complete, but I should ponder the realms that come after as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their master engrossed in his book, Xu Yan and the others did not disturb him further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Long Ming was completely dumbfounded. The way this powerful figure spoke was so profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He also had an itch in his heart, wondering what was wrong with the heavens and earth. Little Yue was even more curious, as her curiosity was greater than most.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, do you know what's wrong with the heavens and earth?" Suli Xiu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>As the eldest disciple, he would know the most about their master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Fang Hao, Zhou Ying, Shi Er, Meng Shu, and the three pet cats, Chihu, also gathered around.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming also couldn't help but join them.</p><p></p><p>Little Yue kept blinking her eyes, staring at Xu Yan, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment before solemnly saying, "You should remember this in your hearts. Master's intention is that the heavens and earth are very fragile. If he were to even slightly reveal his true strength or true aura, it would cause upheaval in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Even the slightest display of his true power could make the heavens and earth collapse.</p><p></p><p>"That's why Master always suppresses his realm and strength when he acts, and tries to avoid acting if possible.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because he's worried about causing a calamity to the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Master usually doesn't act, and when he does, he always suppresses his realm and strength. Now it makes sense!" Meng Chong exclaimed in realization.</p><p></p><p>Chihu's back straightened, the entire tiger becoming more majestic. So the master was this powerful! Hearing Xu Yan's explanation, Meng Chong and the others were not only shocked, but also greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>As for Long Ming, he was dumbfounded and filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even the slightest display of true power, or the leakage of a trace of true aura, could cause a calamity to the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying existence! How could such a powerful being exist in this world?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look back at the seated Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>When he did, his body trembled. At that moment, he saw a figure as grand and majestic as the heavens and earth, mysterious and transcendent, as if it had already surpassed the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he even unconsciously rubbed his eyes, and when he looked again, Li Xuan appeared as ordinary as before.</p><p></p><p>However, every time his mind wandered, he would be shocked again when he looked back. It made him realize how unfathomable Xu Yan's master truly was.</p><p></p><p>"Could what Xu Yan said be true? Does such a terrifying existence really exist in this world?" Long Ming was dazed.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he didn't even consider the Transcendent Spirit Sect as worthy, treating them as mere ants.</p><p></p><p>This was not arrogance, but based on true power!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's master is actually so powerful!" Little Yue exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he sighed inwardly, impressed by Xu Yan's imagination. He had only wanted to act a bit mysterious, but Xu Yan had already imagined him to be so powerful that even the leakage of his true aura could cause a calamity to the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"With such powerful strength, I should have the hope of achieving what they've described. I need to make the later martial arts even more formidable, to truly transcend the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"My disciples, can I truly become as powerful as you've described?" Li Xuan felt inspired.</p><p></p><p>He set a small goal for himself: to transcend the heavens and earth and become the kind of powerful existence his disciples had described.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, the group of cultivators from the Refined Spirit Sect who had been kneeling on the ground finally breathed a sigh of relief as the manor disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, they still reverently kowtowed three times before carefully backing away and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang was dead!</p><p></p><p>The fall of the Thousand Martial Hall's supreme expert would undoubtedly stir up waves. The Spirit Realm was likely to become unsettled, and the Transcendent Spirit Sect would probably face another challenge.</p><p></p><p>This time, the opponent was an existence like a god or demon.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang had died like an ant, so whether the Transcendent Spirit Sect's other supreme experts had the power to contend with this new threat was questionable.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying expert existed in this world.</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying!" Zheng Huang and the other experts were filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Back in the imperial palace, Zheng Huang took a deep breath, pondering for a long time before beginning to write a secret letter to be sent to the Thousand Martial Hall. Whether they would believe it or not was not something he could control.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the mysterious manor, so close to the capital city, sent a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was as if a terrifying demonic deity resided outside the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Shen Tai clan and other prominent families remained silent, not spreading the news of Huang Liang's death, as this was not something they could disclose.</p><p></p><p>In Yu Zhou, many martial artists were still waiting for news of the strongest of the Thousand Martial Hall, wondering if Xu Yan had been killed.</p><p></p><p>However, suddenly, no more news came.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhou was calm and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>This left many martial artists puzzled, and the perceptive ones had already sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>In Luo Zhou, the great battle was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>The elimination of the scattered disciples of the Wanshi Alliance was almost complete, with the Luo Zhou Alliance being nearly destroyed, the powerful cultivators suffering heavy casualties. The Chimeng Sect still led the second and third-tier sects of the Luo Zhou Alliance, continuing to purge the remaining forces.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure stepped into Luo Zhou, heading towards the Chimeng Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was just like Huang Liang, not concealing his presence at all, stirring up the winds of heaven and earth with his imposing aura, his target clear - to destroy the Chimeng Sect! "Huang Liang, come and meet your demise!"</p><p></p><p>"The Chimeng Sect has annihilated the Luo Zhou branch of my Wanshi Alliance, and today I shall destroy the Chimeng Sect, and see how the prominent sects will remain superior," the deep voice of Chang Da Niu thundered.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhou's sects were shaken!</p><p></p><p>An Apex Cultivator! And not from a transcendent sect, but from the Wanshi Alliance! The scattered disciples actually had such a powerful expert among them? The Chimeng Sect was greatly alarmed and hastily sent out a call for help, and the Qingyan Empire immediately ceased the pursuit of the Wanshi Alliance's scattered disciples, withdrawing their forces.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyan Imperial Palace reported the situation to the Transcendent Sect, the Leiyu Mountain Sect, without delay.</p><p></p><p>An Apex Cultivator had arrived in Luo Zhou!</p><p></p><p>Above the Chimeng Sect, the winds and clouds were stirred up, and a terrifying aura pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Chang Da Niu, holding a pair of massive hammers, looked coldly at the gates of the Chimeng Sect and said in a frigid tone, "I, Chang Da Niu, will destroy the Chimeng Sect and challenge the Thousand Martial Hall's Huang Liang to come and meet his death!"</p><p></p><p>He raised the hammers high and brought them down with a thunderous crash! In mid-air, a hammer the size of a mountain fell upon the Chimeng Sect's cultivators and disciples, who watched in horror.</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth was concentrated in the hammer, devastating and shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Even with all the Chimeng Sect's Refined Spirit Cultivators using their martial arts secrets to the fullest, they were still unable to withstand this terrifying strike.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the might of the heavens and earth was focused in that one hammer! The Chimeng Sect was dented inward, and then hammer blow after hammer blow, the Chimeng Sect was completely destroyed, reduced to ruins, and even a massive crater was formed.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhou was shaken!</p><p></p><p>Many prominent sects trembled in fear, especially those who had participated in the suppression of the Wanshi Alliance. They could only pray that the Apex Cultivator of the Thousand Martial Hall, Huang Liang, would return quickly.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sect Master of the Sword Pavilion, who had been in Luo Zhou, now avoided the spotlight and dared not show himself.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked, wondering how the Wanshi Alliance could have such a powerful expert! "Brothers of the Luo Zhou Alliance, whoever went out, come back immediately!" Chang Da Niu called out.</p><p></p><p>The scattered disciples of the Luo Zhou Alliance who had participated were now filled with tears of joy, as the powerful aid of their alliance had finally arrived, destroying the top-tier sect, the Chimeng Sect! "Huang Liang, I will destroy one sect after another until you come to meet your death!"</p><p></p><p>Chang Da Niu snorted coldly and struck again, crushing another sect.</p><p></p><p>And his next target was the Qingyan Empire! Luo Zhou was once again in turmoil due to Chang Da Niu's arrival, with one sect after another being destroyed, and the Qingyan Empire also trembling in fear, with many powerful cultivators gathering to resist the formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>Some of the older Refined Spirit Cultivators had ashen faces, as this was another great calamity for the sects, following the Blood Demon's disaster.</p><p></p><p>They could only hope that the Apex Cultivators of the Transcendent Sects would arrive quickly to block the powerful foe.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you! So, it's the Wanshi Alliance, daring to defy us? You shall be destroyed!" a cold voice came from Leiyu State, the Leiyu Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Demon's incident, the scattered disciples had the audacity to challenge the sects' dominance again.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A powerful figure emerged from the vast mountains, walking out from the Leiyu Mountain Sect, with lightning and fire swirling around him as he moved.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying aura shook the surroundings, and an Apex Cultivator had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The affairs in Luo Zhou are none of Leiyu State's business, focus on your own domain," a light laugh echoed.</p><p></p><p>A blade stood upright in the air, and a figure surrounded by the blade's light approached, blocking the Leiyu Mountain Sect's expert.</p><p></p><p>"Remnants of the Wanstar!"</p><p></p><p>The battle of the Apex Cultivators had begun.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>One powerful figure after another emerged from the Leiyu Mountain Sect, all of them Apex Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>On the Wanshi Alliance's side, their own experts also appeared to block the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a slender, veiled figure with colorful lights and surging waves around her appeared, blocking one of the Leiyu Mountain Sect's Apex Cultivators, much to the latter's fury.</p><p></p><p>"Sea Spiritual Tribe, you dare to ally with the Wanshi Alliance instead of staying in the Azure Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we've had enough fun in the sea, now we're coming to play in the Eighteen States. Why are you so angry?"</p><p></p><p>The Leiyu Mountain Sect expert was enraged, "The Wanshi Alliance, you've colluded with the Sea Spiritual Tribe, an unforgivable crime!"</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the dramatics, we Sea Spirituals live in the Azure Sea and have no intention of coming to the Eighteen States to live. We're just here to play with our friends, that's all."</p><p></p><p>With the aid of the Sea Spiritual Tribe expert, the Wanshi Alliance was able to withstand the attacks from the Leiyu Mountain Sect, and the battle remained deadlocked for the time being.</p><p></p><p>In Qian Wu State, the domain of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A figure soared into the air, letting out a furious roar: "To kill those of my Thousand Martial Hall is an unforgivable crime!"</p><p></p><p>"Huang Liang is dead?" a surprised voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>A massive fist struck towards the Thousand Martial Hall expert.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Chang Da Niu was able to kill Huang Liang?"</p><p></p><p>The one who had attacked was clearly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Apex Cultivators of the Thousand Martial Hall rushed to join the battle, and as the battle between the Wanshi Alliance and the Transcendent Sects' Apex Cultivators raged on, the other Refined Spirit Cultivators also joined the fray.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Wanshi Alliance had revealed its formidable strength, challenging the sects' dominance.</p><p></p><p>In Sheng State, the heartland of the Great Zhou Empire.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the sects, the Great Zhou Empire was a royal dynasty, the only one not under the sects' rule, with strength rivaling the Transcendent Sects.</p><p></p><p>The scattered disciples in the Great Zhou Empire, as citizens of the Great Zhou, had some avenues for advancement, as long as they possessed sufficient talent, despite the presence of many prominent families.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the lower-level martial artists in the Great Zhou Empire had a slightly better standing compared to other regions.</p><p></p><p>A man with a stern expression, wearing a purple robe and a purple crown, stepped out of the Great Zhou capital, facing a figure from outside the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to provoke my Great Zhou?" the Great Zhou Emperor spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"No, Great Zhou Emperor, I have come on behalf of the Wanshi Alliance to negotiate," the visitor said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Speak," the Great Zhou Emperor commanded coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanshi Alliance wishes to secure a place for the scattered cultivators under the heavens, to stand on equal footing with the sects.</p><p></p><p>We hope that the Great Zhou Empire will not interfere, and in return, the Wanshi Alliance will not encroach upon the Great Zhou's domain."</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance expert spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"To negotiate terms, one must have the qualifications," the Great Zhou Emperor said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Great Zhou Emperor, please witness if we have the qualifications or not!" The Wanshi Alliance expert raised his fist and struck towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

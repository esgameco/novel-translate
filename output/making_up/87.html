            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 87: Jade Bones Depict the Rivers and Mountains, Xu Yan Enters the Primordial (Seeking Monthly Votes)</p><p></p><p>"It's different. Without you accompanying me in practice, I wouldn't have been able to suddenly awaken, to realize that every word and action of the master has already laid the foundation for me to comprehend the sword intent," Xu Yan shook his head and spoke the truth.</p><p></p><p>Without Xie Lingfeng's questioning and accompanying practice, he wouldn't have been able to trigger his comprehension, so Xie Lingfeng deserves some credit for his quick understanding of the sword intent of rivers and mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, may I see the senior?" Xie Lingfeng said with an admiring look.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to ask my master first," Xu Yan said after thinking it over.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu," Xie Lingfeng expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he sighed, "I, Xie Lingfeng, thought I had outstanding talent in the Dao of the Sword, but I never imagined that I haven't even entered the gates of the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, how can I attain sword-heart clarity?" Entering the Dao of the Sword is based on attaining sword-heart clarity. Xie Lingfeng also wanted to comprehend sword-heart clarity, and the realms beyond that were too distant for him.</p><p></p><p>Being able to attain sword-heart clarity and enter the Dao of the Sword in this life would be a great honor.</p><p></p><p>How to attain sword-heart clarity? Xu Yan paused, not knowing how to teach Xie Lingfeng, as their cultivation methods were different.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Xu Yan felt that before attaining sword-heart clarity, the priority was to elevate one's state of mind and make it clear.</p><p></p><p>"Master said, 'With no woman in the heart, cultivation is as if guided by a deity.' This realm is too profound. By breaking through the shackles of one's own state of mind, I was able to solidify the foundation and then attain sword-heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>"So, to attain sword-heart clarity, one must first reach the state of 'no woman in the heart,' a state of mind unperturbed by external things, clear and self-possessed, only then can one enter the realm of sword-heart clarity."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Xu Yan asked, "Brother Xie, do you think about women?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, although older, was still in the prime of his youth, the stage most easily attracted by female beauty. If he could avoid being tempted by female charm and act freely according to his heart, he would have the foundation to comprehend sword-heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>I asked about the Dao of the Sword, and you talked about women? This leap in thinking is too extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... a little... I might think about them sometimes?" Xie Lingfeng didn't know how to answer for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, the foundation for sword-heart clarity lies in a clear state of mind, being able to control oneself and not be disturbed by external things. </p><p></p><p>"The prerequisite to enter the Dao of the Sword is 'no woman in the heart,' only then is there hope." Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng continued to be perplexed, his eyes somewhat blank, and said, "No woman in the heart? Does that mean I have to..."</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the area below his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, you've misunderstood. 'No woman in the heart' does not mean to renounce women, it is a realm, a state of mind... To put it bluntly, if I'm not emotionally moved, then female charm would not be enough to stir my heart...</p><p></p><p>"It is a state of mind that controls oneself, a clear and self-possessed heart." Xu Yan hurriedly explained, lest Xie Lingfeng misunderstand and directly cut off his own brother.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's eyes were blank, this state of mind? How to comprehend it?</p><p></p><p>It's so profound.</p><p></p><p>No woman in the heart, yet not to renounce women, and also to control oneself...</p><p></p><p>"Am I not suited for cultivating the Dao of the Sword?" Xie Lingfeng fell into self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he took a deep breath and said, "I don't know, Brother Xu, how can I achieve the state of 'no woman in the heart' that you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, recalling that he had gone to the Qi Emperor's harem to temper his state of mind, which led to a great improvement.</p><p></p><p>So he said directly, "I went to the Qi Emperor's harem before, watching his beautiful concubines dance gracefully, using this to temper my state of mind, and eventually achieved some success."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the guidance, Brother Xu!" Xie Lingfeng's eyes lit up as he expressed his gratitude sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, Brother Xie." Xu Yan felt that since Xie Lingfeng had helped him comprehend the sword intent earlier, it was only right for him to guide Xie Lingfeng a bit on how to cultivate and elevate his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>For Xie Lingfeng, this day was like opening a skylight, catching a glimpse of the true heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the Dao of the Sword, he had glimpsed a bit, but was still far from grasping it.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent, it was so profound.</p><p></p><p>Without comprehending the sword intent, how could one be considered to have entered the gates of the Dao of the Sword?</p><p></p><p>Leaving Xu Yan's residence and returning to the imperial palace courtyard where he lived, Xie Lingfeng saw Hu Shan, who still seemed a bit depressed, so he said, "Hu Shan, you should be happy, for you have learned the truth of the Martial Dao, so pursue the true Martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan gave a bitter smile and said, "Young Master, it's easy to say, but I still can't quite accept it."</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing unacceptable about it." Xie Lingfeng's gaze was firm as he said, "I want to cultivate the true Martial Dao, I want to truly enter the gates of the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was taken aback, as if he saw the young master again, pursuing the Dao of the Sword on Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what's wrong with you?" </p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, do you know what sword intent is? Today, I finally know what the true Dao of the Sword is."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent?" Hu Shan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng then told the story of how Xu Yan had comprehended the sword intent today, and finally said, "The sword intent of rivers and mountains is truly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally comprehended the sword intent, and he decided to return to Cloud Mountain County to break through to the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he guided Guo Rongshan and the others in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Xie Lingfeng saw Xu Yan off with Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, if my master is willing to see you all, I will convey a message to my uncle to notify you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng expressed his gratitude. He wanted to visit Xu Yan's master, that mysterious reclusive expert.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>He must seize it!</p><p></p><p>"I take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was contemplating the Bagua, the more he contemplated, the more profound it seemed. He felt like he was on the verge of a breakthrough, yet still couldn't grasp the key point.</p><p></p><p>"Can't be too impatient." Meng Chong took a deep breath, calming his restless heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been observing Meng Chong for a few days, but then stopped, knowing that with Meng Chong's talent, he would surely have some realization.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the feedback from the Golden Finger appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the sword intent of rivers and mountains, your sword intent of rivers and mountains has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent appeared in his mind, as if it had always been there, he now possessed the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of rivers and mountains!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, "What a good disciple! He hasn't even broken through to the Primordial Realm yet, and he has already comprehended the sword intent. He truly has the bearing of a Sword Deity!"</p><p></p><p>The great cause of the Martial Dao had taken another big step forward.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a mysterious aura enveloped the small courtyard, as if the rivers and mountains were contained within, with an endless, lingering presence, yet also hidden within a ruthless and merciless power.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, who was cultivating in the courtyard, suddenly felt as if he had entered a world of rivers and mountains. </p><p></p><p>He was so insignificant.</p><p></p><p>The rivers and mountains seemed indifferent, as if they could bury all living beings, and he was being buried by the rivers and mountains.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" Shi Er was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"I must break free!"</p><p></p><p>He tried to struggle, but was utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao could not be moved, but in the end, he gritted his teeth and continued to operate the cultivation method, tempering his bones.</p><p></p><p>"I want to become stronger, the faster I become stronger, the faster I can get out of here!" </p><p></p><p>With this belief in his heart, Shi Er frantically cultivated his bones.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he felt that he was being eroded by the mountains and rivers, but due to his tenacious resistance, the speed of bone tempering had greatly increased, and the speed of the mountains and rivers devouring him was constantly weakening.</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed, his cultivation became even more arduous.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Shi Er silently. He had just exerted the sword intent of the mountains and rivers, slightly suppressing him, which had greatly increased Shi Er's bone tempering speed.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent can temper one's own body, from the flesh to the spirit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan returns, he will remind him to continue to develop the wonderful uses of the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er emerged from the state of being enveloped by the mountains and rivers. He was shocked to find that he had actually tempered his bones into copper!</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had completed the tempering of iron bones in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he understood a little.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>He respectfully bowed to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, cultivate well, and enter the door soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had returned.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! My disciple, you were able to comprehend the sword intent before the breakthrough, it was not in vain that I put in so much effort!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed! From the very beginning, Master has been teaching me through words and deeds, laying the foundation for me to comprehend the sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, the sword intent is profound, it can temper one's own body, not just for defeating enemies. You must ponder it more."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, the profundity of the sword intent, he had not yet fully grasped the essence.</p><p></p><p>Master was reminding him that the sword intent was not just for fighting enemies!</p><p></p><p>"You should also break through to the Xiantian realm soon."</p><p></p><p>"I can break through in the next few days."</p><p></p><p>"Go, settle down, break through to the Xiantian realm. Only by breaking through to the Xiantian realm can you truly transcend the mundane world, and truly set foot on the path of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Qixue realm can only be considered as just opening the door to the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Outside Cloud Mountain County, Meng Chong was still walking the Bagua, pondering the profundity of the Bagua, and cultivating his body techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure appeared, looking at Meng Chong walking the Bagua, he was puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother's comprehension of the Bagua seems to be a bit different from mine? Could it be that my junior brother has misunderstood?"</p><p></p><p>"No! If my junior brother had misunderstood, how could the Master not correct him?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"The profundity of the Bagua, each person's comprehension is different, perhaps we can verify each other, and there will be more insights."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stopped his steps and joyfully said, "Elder brother, you're back."</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, are you cultivating body techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but junior brother is stupid and hasn't quite understood it yet!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his bald head, looking a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be in a hurry to cultivate the techniques, the profundity of the Bagua, the comprehension is different for everyone. After I break through to the Xiantian realm, we can discuss and exchange our insights, and I'm sure we'll gain different harvests."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Meng Chong's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Meng Chong, Xu Yan left the mountain forest and came to the hillside not far away.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged and settled his body.</p><p></p><p>To prepare for the breakthrough to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>He had already comprehended the cultivation method for the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and began to circulate his qi and blood, constantly refining them. As the qi and blood were refined, his jade-like bones shone brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the qi and blood into the Xiantian true qi, connecting the heavenly and earthly bridge, absorbing and exhaling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, opening up the sea of qi in the dantian..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan activated the qi and blood, refining them while connecting the heavenly and earthly bridge. Thunderous sounds resounded within his body.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious feeling floated into his mind.</p><p></p><p>His intuition told him that if he could connect the heavenly and earthly bridge, he would be able to sense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly bridge was gradually connecting under the impact of the qi and blood, and it seemed that a great dao emitting dazzling light was forming in his body.</p><p></p><p>"This is the heavenly and earthly bridge? A bridge that connects heaven and earth with one's own body."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood continued to impact, and the heavenly and earthly bridge was gradually opening up, but the speed was not fast. As the heavenly and earthly bridge began to connect, the qi and blood continued to refine, and began to show signs of transformation.</p><p></p><p>His whole body's jade-like bones were now emitting a brilliant glow.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that the sword intent can temper one's own body, not just for fighting enemies..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly remembered his master's words.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the sword intent emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Infusing the sword intent into the qi and blood, connecting the heavenly and earthly bridge, merging into the jade-like bones..."</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's body, the sword intent of the mountains and rivers flowed, and as the sword intent entered the qi and blood, in an instant, it seemed to undergo a kind of transformation.</p><p></p><p>On the flawless jade-like bones, mysterious patterns gradually appeared, fine and flawless, as if depicting the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, immersed in the breakthrough, circulated the sword intent, refined the qi and blood, and connected the heavenly and earthly bridge, unaware of the transformation happening to his own body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>After the sword intent merged into the qi and blood, the speed of connecting the heavenly and earthly bridge gradually accelerated.</p><p></p><p>And on the heavenly and earthly bridge, it seemed to reveal the illusory image of a sword.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Yan had a flash of insight: "If the sword intent is infused into the qi and blood, then if I refine the Descending Dragon Palm with the qi and blood and use it to connect the heavenly and earthly bridge, won't it be even faster?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking and doing it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood suddenly transformed into a giant dragon, roaring and constantly impacting the heavenly and earthly bridge. As the giant dragon connected the heavenly and earthly bridge, a dragon-like form gradually appeared on the heavenly and earthly bridge.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a giant dragon was coiled on the heavenly and earthly bridge!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent infused into the qi and blood, the qi and blood transformed into a giant dragon, at this moment, the Descending Dragon Palm seemed to have undergone some kind of change.</p><p></p><p>Some enlightenment emerged in Xu Yan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly bridge continued to connect, and it became larger and wider.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood gradually presented the form of the Xiantian true qi, pure and containing a great might, like the might of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>It also contained a keen sharpness, and it was endless, like the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like bones shone, the mountains and rivers were depicted on the flawless jade-like bones, presenting the appearance of flawless mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a dragon's roar seemed to resound in his body, and the giant dragon circled around him and disappeared into the jade-like bones, as if the true dragon was hidden in the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly bridge was also connected at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood suddenly transformed, becoming the Xiantian true qi.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Xu Yan only felt that his senses had transformed, as if the heavens and earth had become clearer.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have merged into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth sensed him.</p><p></p><p>The violent spiritual energy, under his inhalation and exhalation, rolled in and poured into the sea of qi in the dantian through the heavenly and earthly bridge.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The dantian trembled, as if opening the heavens and earth, under the impact of the spiritual energy, the embryonic form of the sea of qi in the dantian appeared.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

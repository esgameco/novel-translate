        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fist print soared into the sky, as if it was about to shatter the heavens. A powerful, almost law-like force surged in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Zhou frowned, "A wandering cultivator, how could they possess such strength? How did they obtain this cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>"Why wouldn't a wandering cultivator be able to possess such strength?" </p><p></p><p>The powerful expert of the Myriad Worlds Alliance smiled and said, "Great Zhou Emperor, how about it, do you qualify?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor laughed and said, "Fine, as long as your Myriad Worlds Alliance does not encroach on the territory of the Great Zhou, the Great Zhou will not make a move."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned and left, but then suddenly stopped and said, "The strength of the Myriad Worlds Alliance is indeed impressive, but to challenge the Spiritual Sects, it is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the Transcendent Spiritual Sects are so transcendent is not as simple as it appears on the surface."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he stepped away.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the advice, Great Zhou Emperor!" </p><p></p><p>The powerful expert of the Myriad Worlds Alliance cupped his hands in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure State Imperial Spiritual Abode, one powerful expert after another appeared, battling the powerful experts from the Spiritual Beast Clan who had come from the Heavenly Mound State.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Worlds Alliance has colluded with the Spiritual Beasts, they must be executed!"</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Spiritual Abode can ally with the Spiritual Beasts, why can't the Myriad Worlds Alliance? Just stay obediently in the Azure State."</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert of the Myriad Worlds Alliance sneered.</p><p></p><p>In the Morning State, the headquarters of the Myriad Worlds Alliance appeared with formidable strength, suppressing the Spiritual Sects of the Morning State, and the Myriad Worlds Alliance took their place! The wandering cultivators of the Morning State were inspired and joined the battle against the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>A great battle that swept across the Spiritual Realm, challenging the rule of the Spiritual Sects, suddenly erupted in various states. Many Spiritual Sects were caught off guard and immediately fell into a disadvantageous position.</p><p></p><p>The weaker Spiritual Sects were even destroyed by the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As the momentum of the Myriad Worlds Alliance grew stronger, the wandering cultivators also joined one after another, whether it was for the interests of the Spiritual Sects or to vent their anger. These wandering cultivators acted in accordance with the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, the position of the Spiritual Sects that ruled the Spiritual Realm was shaken, as if they were on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Transcendent Spiritual Sects were actually unable to spare the time to rescue the Spiritual Sect families in the various states.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Mountain State, where the Taimai Sect was located.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Transcendent Spiritual Sects such as the Thunder Cloud Villa, the Thousand Martial Hall, and the Imperial Spiritual Abode, the Taimai Sect truly had a sense of being aloof from the world.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to just cultivate quietly, recruit disciples with exceptional talents, and pass down the legacy, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Ruling the Cloud Mountain State seemed to be just for the purpose of obtaining the resources needed to cultivate their disciples.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to underestimate the Taimai Sect.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin, the leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, personally came to the outskirts of the Taimai Sect.</p><p></p><p>This showed how much importance he placed on the Taimai Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Mountain State must not be disturbed, do not encroach on the Cloud Mountain State, or else death!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from the Taimai Sect.</p><p></p><p>Along with the voice came dreamlike flowers, floating and ethereal, both beautiful and containing terrifying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin's expression became extremely grave, and with a stroke of his pen, stars appeared as if emerging from the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The dreamlike flowers and the stellar force collided.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The stars were extinguished, and Tan Wenlin retreated a few steps.</p><p></p><p>The dreamlike flowers also burst and disappeared, the ethereal force becoming illusory, like a bubble that could vanish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Good, the Myriad Worlds Alliance will not enter the Cloud Mountain State!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin's expression was extremely grave as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Taimai Sect did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin turned and left, his hand holding the pen slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"So, Taimai Xin Mengrou has taken this step!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin was shocked in his heart, but also relieved. If Xin Mengrou had intervened, he might not have been able to resist.</p><p></p><p>On that day, all the powerful experts of the Myriad Worlds Alliance withdrew from the Cloud Mountain State.</p><p></p><p>In the Luo State, Changdaniu did not wait for Huang Liang, but instead received the news that Huang Liang had been killed in the Yu State. </p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked. Who had killed Huang Liang? Was it an old friend?</p><p></p><p>He was about to head to the Yu State, but a powerful figure blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>This expert came from the Thunder Cloud Villa.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the Myriad Worlds Alliance shook the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Only the Yu State remained peaceful, and the Refining Deity Cultivators who had fled from the Luo State were now returning to rebuild the Luo State branch.</p><p></p><p>As for Yu, Gao, and the others, they did not receive the order from the main alliance to emerge, but were instead told to continue hiding.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Myriad Worlds Alliance to have such strength!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message to Yu, instructing him to continue as usual.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Yu Spiritual Sect and the Shu family's territory remained under the covert control of the Yu State branch, while outwardly it was still under the Shen family's control.</p><p></p><p>"Is the rule of the Spiritual Sects about to end?" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er was excited.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that easy." </p><p></p><p>Yue Changming shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Worlds Alliance had displayed formidable power and a grand momentum that seemed to suppress the Spiritual Sects, this was only the beginning.</p><p></p><p>However, he was also surprised at where the Myriad Worlds Alliance had obtained so many powerful experts. "Could it be that the research done at the Martial Academy in the past has succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was thinking to himself as he was recovering his spiritual body, having taken the elixir concocted by Su Lingxiu. His originally collapsed and depleted spiritual foundation was actually gathering and recovering.</p><p></p><p>But to fully recover, it would take some time, and he would need to take powerful nourishing elixirs every day.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, I will find a way to make up for the spiritual herbs needed for the healing."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes flickered as she said, "Your strength is not bad either. Coincidentally, my junior brother's Myriad Worlds Alliance is lacking a powerful expert. Why don't you go and take charge of my junior brother's Myriad Worlds Alliance? </p><p></p><p>"Consider it as payment for the healing treatment."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming nodded, "Okay, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>While the outside world was in turmoil with battles erupting, the manor remained peaceful and undisturbed, not affected by the great war, nor had any experts from the Thousand Martial Hall come seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>But whether it was Xu Yan, Meng Chong, or Fang Hao, they were all a bit restless, wanting to enter that turbulent world, temper themselves, and reach the peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment. Fang Hao's Myriad Worlds Alliance ultimately lacked a powerful expert to take charge.</p><p></p><p>He himself could not go and lead the Myriad Worlds Alliance, but Yue Changming would be a good candidate, if not for the fact that his strength was too weak, unable to even defeat Huang Liang.</p><p></p><p>To lead the Myriad Worlds Alliance, one must have the strength to resist the powerful experts of the Transcendent Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into one's spiritual soul is not difficult, and even refining a strand of the power of the laws of heaven and earth is not too hard, it just requires some time."</p><p></p><p>No one understood the laws of heaven and earth better than him in this Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to guide Yue Changming a little, also considering it the opportunity Yue Changming deserved to encounter a supreme expert like himself. If a meeting with a high-level expert did not lead to any improvement in strength, wouldn't that make the expert seem less impressive?</p><p></p><p>"Yue Changming, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said while sipping his spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming replied respectfully, his heart filled with anticipation and excitement. Perhaps the opportunity to change his fate was at this very moment.</p><p></p><p>"Can you refine the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into your spiritual soul?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I can do it a little, but my spiritual body has not fully recovered, so I cannot refine the spiritual mechanisms."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine mechanism of the earth entered his spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, Yue Changming was secretly excited as he said.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicangs Martial Dao is closely related to the divine mechanism of heaven and earth, but refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth is not related to whether one has a spiritual body or not."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and grabbed, and a wisp of spiritual rhythm appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The divine mechanism of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming's heart trembled, and he secretly recorded the four words "Taicangs Martial Dao", feeling a kind of excitement and thrill as if he had grasped a little bit of the secret of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the divine mechanism of heaven and earth in Li Xuan's hand, he couldn't help but sigh, "No wonder you are an unparalleled sage, with just a casual gesture, you have captured the divine mechanism of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"As for the martial dao of you all, after refining the spirit, it is nothing more than refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth into the spirit and soul, and then using the divine mechanism of heaven and earth to comprehend the laws of heaven and earth, and refine the power of the laws into the body...</p><p></p><p>"You have reached the peak of spirit refinement, and the subsequent cultivation is nothing more than refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth into the spirit and soul, and then comprehending the laws of heaven and earth, and refining the laws of heaven and earth into the body.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have the chance to come here, let me teach you the method of refining."</p><p></p><p>That wisp of divine mechanism of heaven and earth was jumping on Li Xuan's fingertips, moving with his will.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was excited and thrilled, and respectfully said, "Yue Changming, thank you, senior, for bestowing the method!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, and creating a method of refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth was not at all difficult for him, nor was creating a method of refining the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength and understanding of the laws of heaven and earth, he could easily create them, and he was sure that they would be stronger than the methods mastered by the Superb Spiritual Sect, easier to refine, and with less difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"This divine mechanism of heaven and earth, I'll give it to you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flicked his finger, and that wisp of divine mechanism of heaven and earth instantly disappeared into Yue Changming's spirit and soul, and with it came the method he had created for refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a wave of his hand, several patterns emerged, intertwined with each other, profoundly mysterious, as if containing some supreme truth of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A piece of paper appeared on the table, with the patterns printed on it, and the paper with the printed patterns flew in front of Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"These are a few laws of heaven and earth, you can ponder them yourself."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yue Changming was greatly shocked. The senior was truly an unparalleled sage, and the method he had passed down was so mysterious and incredible.</p><p></p><p>Refining the divine mechanism of heaven and earth could actually be so simple and easy? Holding the paper with the few patterns printed on it, he was even more excited. These were a few laws of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Even the laws of heaven and earth were printed on paper and given to him to ponder, and he was completely convinced that if the senior were to slightly reveal his aura, it would be enough to trigger a calamity of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for bestowing the method!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming respectfully knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was filled with excitement and began to cultivate, his heart burning with passion.</p><p></p><p>"I, Yue Changming, will once again reach the peak, and I will subdue my former opponents again!"</p><p></p><p>After pointing out the way for Yue Changming, Li Xuan continued to immerse himself in compiling the divine technique manual, and at the same time, pondered the subsequent martial dao realms.</p><p></p><p>The divine techniques have been formed, and the subsequent martial dao cultivation direction and realms should also be put on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was cultivating on one hand and refining the Qimen Treasure Chest that could be absorbed into the body, while at the same time, letting Yu Gao pay attention to the news from the outside world, the result of the battle between the Wanshi Alliance and the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>The great battle was still ongoing, and the strength displayed by the Wanshi Alliance exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was surprising that the Great Zhou Empire did not intervene against the Wanshi Alliance, but it could be understood, after all, the Great Zhou Empire was not exactly the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was a dynastic empire.</p><p></p><p>Although its foundation and strength were comparable to the Superb Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>And the other Superb Spiritual Sect, the Taixi Sect, also remained inactive, but the Wanshi Alliance did not cause any trouble in the Yunshan Prefecture under the Taixi Sect's jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the two sides had reached some kind of agreement.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Wanshi Alliance became, the more it could hold its own against the Spiritual Sect, instantly igniting the passion of countless wandering cultivators to join the Wanshi Alliance and confront the Spiritual Sect, and the momentum of the Wanshi Alliance continued to grow.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some wandering cultivators who took advantage of this opportunity to target the Wanshi Alliance, trying to curry favor with the Spiritual Sect and seize the opportunity to become a Spiritual Sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The major Spiritual Sect families in Yuzhou were also anxious and closely watching the great battle between the Wanshi Alliance and the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family, however, was calm and composed, not panicking at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had long been secretly colluding with the Wanshi Alliance, and this was the highest-level secret, with only a handful of people in the entire Shen family knowing about it.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou came to the manor, and after obtaining the medicinal pills, he had already broken through to the Great Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Xuan was that the great battle between the Wanshi Alliance and the Spiritual Sect had been going on for a month without a decisive victory.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanshi Alliance is so strong?" He couldn't help but be puzzled, the Spiritual Sect that ruled the Spiritual Realm should not be this weak.</p><p></p><p>More information also gradually came in, and Wen Yong was reporting the battle reports of the Wanshi Alliance to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>One, among the strongest members of the Wanshi Alliance, there were remnants of the past prodigies of the Wanxing Martial Institute.</p><p></p><p>Two, among the strongest members of the Wanshi Alliance, there were powerful cultivators from the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Three, the Tianliang Prefecture's Spiritual Beast Clan also had the strongest spiritual beasts participating.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Wanshi Alliance could still hold its own against the Spiritual Sect after such a long battle.</p><p></p><p>"The pattern of the Spiritual Realm is going to change a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the foundation of the Superb Spiritual Sect was not just this, otherwise it would not be able to rule the Spiritual Realm, and there must be other factors behind it that led to the current situation.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Xu Yan and Meng Chong, his two disciples who were diligently cultivating, itching to go out and roam.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Spiritual Sense Realm Perfection, and your divine soul has doubled in strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, the divine soul had doubled in strength, his strength had risen again.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had already broken through, it was about time for him to go out and roam, accumulate his own foundation, and prepare for the breakthrough to the Divine Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>A few days after Xu Yan's breakthrough, Meng Chong also broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body First Realm Completion, and your Indestructible Golden Body has reached the Second Realm Small Success."</p><p></p><p>A few more days later, Su Lingxiu also broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Spiritual Sense Realm Perfection, and your Elixir Martial Dao Divine Origin Realm has reached Small Success."</p><p></p><p>The three disciples had broken through one after another, and their strength had further increased.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Hao's refining of the Qimen Treasure Chest, it was also in the final stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned his head to look at the little girl Moon'er, who was breaking through to the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>"At this age, to reach the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm, is already a top-tier prodigy in the Spiritual Realm, her spiritual body talent is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Moon'er's rapid breakthrough was also due to the medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Now she and Su Lingxiu had become good friends.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came over and respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, are you itching to go out and roam?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to temper myself through combat, using medicinal pills and spiritual treasures as auxiliary, to settle my foundation and accumulate strength, so as to break through to the Divine Origin Realm and transform myself..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and expressed his idea.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to fight, to hone himself in battle, to break through his limits in battle, to accumulate strength in battle, rather than just relying on spiritual treasures to nourish and refine himself to accumulate strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled, a bit surprised that Xu Yan wanted to accumulate strength in this way!

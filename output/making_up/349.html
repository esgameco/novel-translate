            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Devouring Soul Enchantress!" </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable gritted his teeth and spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the great prey actually knows me, it seems you are a knowledgeable person!" </p><p></p><p>The Enchantress covered her mouth and laughed, extending a tender white leg forward, full of seductive posture.</p><p></p><p>"Your Enchantress clan deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable was furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall slay you!"</p><p></p><p>The long spear trembled as it struck forward.</p><p></p><p>"Enchantress clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress was obviously taken aback for a moment, but then her smile became radiant again.</p><p></p><p>"Ignorant great prey!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Pink light surged, as the tender white hands waved, a zither appeared, and the ringing sound of the strings gave rise to a series of attacks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Enchantress seemed to be immersed in playing the zither.</p><p></p><p>The pink glow illuminated the heavens and earth, colliding with the powerful aura of the Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace and Fu Tianhai finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fierce battle in front of them, they were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>To be able to contend with the Celestial Venerable, what kind of enemy is this? "It's the Celestial Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thunder Cloud Manor spoke in a deep voice, explaining: "The location of the Tranquil Snow Palace has turned into a Celestial Abyss, and a strange woman called the Enchantress has appeared, able to devour and absorb divine souls, with immense strength..."</p><p></p><p>Devouring Soul Enchantress! </p><p></p><p>This is what the Celestial Venerable had said.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the Celestial Venerable's fragmentary words, it can be known that the Celestial Abyss is a place of danger, where powerful enemies will appear.</p><p></p><p>As for how the Celestial Abyss appeared and why such a strange enemy exists, it is unknown.</p><p></p><p>And the Enchantress seems to be a race?</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the Celestial Venerable arrived in time, otherwise we would have been doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>"But the Enchantress is so powerful, can the Celestial Venerable defeat her?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai said with some worry.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace sneered contemptuously, "Fu Tianhai, that is the Celestial Venerable, summoned by our Thousand Martial Palace. What Enchantress, however powerful, can be a match for the Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Once the Celestial Venerable suppresses the enemy of the Celestial Abyss, the pattern of the Spiritual Realm should be redefined!</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thunder Cloud Manor and the Sovereign of the Spiritual Realm nodded and said, "If even the Celestial Venerable cannot defeat her, the Spiritual Realm will truly be in danger, with no one able to match the Enchantress!"</p><p></p><p>"I think we should prepare for the worst."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Great Zhou Emperor, how dare you question the might of the Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace, relying on the Celestial Venerable's backing, became arrogant, glancing coldly at the Great Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor's face darkened, "I'm not slandering you, the might of the Celestial Venerable is not something I can question."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you mean by preparing for the worst?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace was unwilling to let it go.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the opening of the Spiritual Bridge requires time. If unexpected events occur, such as the appearance of another powerful enemy in the Celestial Abyss, how should we deal with it? I think we should request the Venerable's presence again to ensure complete safety."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor said with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>"Then you, Great Zhou, go and open the Ethereal Bridge to summon the Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace sneered.</p><p></p><p>"The last time my Great Zhou opened the Ethereal Bridge was nine years ago, to send two Spiritual Prodigies away. It has not yet reached the time to open the Ethereal Bridge again!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor glared angrily at the Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Ethereal Bridge can only be opened once every ten years. Great Zhou had opened it nine years ago to send the Spiritual Prodigies away, so it had already been used once.</p><p></p><p>The name Rainbowstate is also related to the opening of the Ethereal Bridge, with the rainbow light illuminating the heavens and earth, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>Only the uninformed think it is just an ordinary rainbow, not knowing that it is a bridge used to send Spiritual Prodigies away.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Zhou Emperor's words make sense, we must take some precautions!"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Spiritual Realm nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Venerable was summoned by the Thousand Martial Palace, belonging to the powerful backing behind the Thousand Martial Palace. Although each faction has its own backing, when facing a Celestial Venerable that is not from their own backing, they feel somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Thousand Martial Palace has always been rather unscrupulous.</p><p></p><p>What if the backing behind them is also rather unscrupulous? Wouldn't that be disastrous?</p><p></p><p>For example, their own Spiritual Prodigies being forcibly taken away...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace sneered arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>The other Transcendent Spiritual Sects wanting to open the Ethereal Bridge have run out of time.</p><p></p><p>The battle will soon be over, the Celestial Venerable's might sweeping across the Spiritual Realm, they can only obey orders. With the Celestial Venerable backing the Thousand Martial Palace, they can do many things.</p><p></p><p>The pattern of the Spiritual Realm is not something anyone can break.</p><p></p><p>He cast a cold gaze at Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan didn't even pay attention to the Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace, currently focused on intently watching the battle between the Celestial Venerable and the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>He is not too far from reaching the Condensed Dao Celestial Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>But this final step is a huge leap.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly only a small step away, yet it is as different as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Condensed Dao Celestial Venerable, the one the senior mentioned, refining the Heavenly and Earthly Principles... The Spiritual Realm's spiritual energy is insufficient to refine the Heavenly and Earthly Principles, so breakthrough is impossible."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was also staring at the battle, as she is only half a step away from Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Condensed Dao Celestial Venerable is here, it is a chance to glimpse the power of Condensation.</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Wu Tiannan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel that the Celestial Venerable seemed to be at a disadvantage, unable to defeat the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards Xin Mengrou, and Xin Mengrou also looked at him, both of them feeling a sense of dread - the Celestial Venerable is unable to defeat the Enchantress!</p><p></p><p>The oblivious Lord of the Thousand Martial Palace was still arrogantly looking at Wu Tiannan, as if the great enemy would soon be suppressed by the Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Spiritual Realm and the Lord of the Thunder Cloud Manor had already considered opening the Ethereal Bridge to summon the Venerable. However, opening the Ethereal Bridge is not something that can be done overnight. It requires a certain amount of preparation time.</p><p></p><p>And now the Celestial Venerable is engaged in battle, and has ordered the sealing of the Ice State. If they rashly depart, they may offend this Celestial Venerable, and their own backing has not yet arrived to support them. That would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor suddenly frowned.</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou, seeing their grave expressions and the hint of retreat in their eyes, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Fu Tianhai, and at this moment, Fu Tianhai also noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable still seemed incredibly powerful, each attack containing the might of heaven and earth, as if he would suppress the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>But faintly, the pink light seemed to have already invaded the Celestial Venerable's defenses.</p><p></p><p>Clusters of pink lotus flowers surrounded the Celestial Venerable's attacks, constantly invading and blocking, restricting the Celestial Venerable's retreat, preventing him from escaping.</p><p></p><p>"Great prey, by devouring you, my strength will rise again."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress' coquettish laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Celestial Venerable's great spear struck, his figure instantly expanding, the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles pouring out, the battlefield filled with swirling clouds and wind, a huge spear piercing through the sky towards the layers of pink light.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Clusters of pink lotus flowers surrounded and coiled around the great spear like chains, trying to lock it down, while the Enchantress' delicate figure also approached step by step.</p><p></p><p>Her tender white hands reached back into the Celestial Abyss, extracting a pink trident.</p><p></p><p>The trident suddenly broke through the layers of defense, stabbing towards the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The black armor on the Heavenly Sovereign's body began to crack.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, flee! Open the divine bridge and summon the True King to descend upon the Spiritual Realm and subdue the Bewitching Sorceress' Celestial Cave!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Sovereign roared.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign was no match for the Bewitching Sorceress?</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and flee!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master was the first to turn and flee, his body covered in cold sweat. The Heavenly Sovereign was actually defeated? How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is doomed!"</p><p>"Quickly go to Rainbow State, the Illusory Bridge has not yet closed, hurry and seek aid!"</p><p>"It's too late, based on the time calculation, the Illusory Bridge has already closed!"</p><p>"The Imperial Spirit Residence and the Thunder Cloud Mountain Villa, quickly open the Illusory Bridge and summon the Honored Ones to descend!"</p><p>"It's too late, it's not something that can be opened in a day or two!"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"The prey cannot escape from my Bewitching Sorceress' hunting ground."</p><p></p><p>The Bewitching Sorceress' voice echoed from afar.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, all the powerful experts were drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do? What do we do? The Spiritual Realm is doomed, we can only wait for the divine bridge to open and for the Heavenly Sovereigns to descend to resolve this crisis!"</p><p>"By the time the divine bridge opens, we'll all be dead!"</p><p>"Go to the Inner Realm!"</p><p>"Yes, go to the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Some powerful experts suggested in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm... we can't go there anymore, the gate to the Spiritual Realm has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts were all shocked, the gate to the Spiritual Realm had disappeared, was it related to the appearance of the Celestial Cave?</p><p></p><p>"Flee for as long as we can."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't panic, our Spiritual Realm has a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan suddenly spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful expert?"</p><p>"Where is this powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>The others were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a peerless expert, our Spiritual Realm has a reclusive powerful expert. With such a great calamity descending, only by summoning this powerful expert can we save our Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's eyes also lit up.</p><p></p><p>How could they have forgotten about that senior?</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor and the others were reassured. Since Xin Mengrou said so, that powerful expert must be incredibly strong, right?</p><p></p><p>But they still had some lack of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Can this powerful expert compare to the Heavenly Sovereign? The Heavenly Sovereign has already fallen, and after the Bewitching Sorceress has devoured the Heavenly Sovereign, her strength will be even greater!" </p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master said with insufficient confidence.</p><p></p><p>"That is a true peerless expert, how can the Heavenly Sovereign compare? "</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>That senior is an existence that transcends heaven and earth, can the Heavenly Sovereign transcend heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"Where is this powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Residence Master hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou said in unison.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship had already arrived at Cloud State, and when looking down from above, the vast Cloud State had only high mountains protruding from the water, the cities had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"There's something strange about this water."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu frowned.</p><p></p><p>"A special kind of corrosive energy, as long as the source is cut off, it will recover."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>The source is in the Icy State Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was holding the Taicangshu, he had already reached the 13th page.</p><p></p><p>With the improvement of his cultivation, the speed of memorizing the Dao principles was also getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Martial Classic opened, and a golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wasteland Martial Cultivator has broken through a million, you have obtained the Great Wasteland Divine Appearance!"</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivators in the Inner Realm who cultivated the Great Wasteland Martial Dao had broken through a million! This speed was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>And as the number of Great Wasteland Martial Cultivators increased, the subsequent increase in their numbers would become faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Wasteland Divine Appearance is quite powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, the Great Wasteland Divine Appearance would become increasingly powerful and mysterious as the number of Great Wasteland Martial Cultivators increased.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wasteland is the primordial image of heaven and earth, the initial opening of chaos..."</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Wasteland Divine Appearance was unleashed, the image of the peerless expert would become even more shocking and awe-inspiring, making people feel a deep sense of mystery.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, combined with the mysterious aura, even if the opponent is stronger than me, they will tremble in fear."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Divine Appearance + Mysterious Aura, even if the opponent is stronger than him, they would be too scared to act recklessly!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what's going on in the Icy State Celestial Cave, will I need to personally intervene and suppress everything?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Icy State and pondered.</p><p></p><p>"That Heavenly Sovereign has already gone to the Icy State, I don't know how the situation is now, whether he can resolve the problem."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator summoned by the Thousand Martial Hall was still quite powerful, with the might of heaven and earth, he should be able to subdue the Celestial Cave, right?</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship continued towards the Icy State, the speed was not too fast.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two figures rushed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, what's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is dire!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a grave expression: "A huge cave has appeared in the Icy State, and this cave is somewhat strange, as if it is a hole between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"There is a powerful woman called the Bewitching Sorceress in the cave, and she can devour spiritual souls, it seems she feeds on the spiritual souls of martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Her strength is extremely powerful, even Senior Wu and the others working together could not defeat her. I used a great formation to catch her by surprise for a moment, but she soon broke free and came chasing after me.</p><p></p><p>"However, that Heavenly Sovereign is currently battling the Bewitching Sorceress, but I'm not sure of the outcome."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao recounted the events in detail.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Devouring spiritual souls? "What kind of demonic woman is this? The Spiritual Realm has actually produced such a bizarre person."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He then eagerly said: "Let me go meet her!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao shook his head gravely: "Big Brother, even if we brothers join forces, we would not be her match. I have a premonition that the Heavenly Sovereign may be defeated!</p><p></p><p>"And once she devours the Heavenly Sovereign, her strength will likely grow even stronger!</p><p></p><p>"That Celestial Cave is very special, I don't know what the appearance of the cave truly signifies."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards their master, Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still calm and composed, reading the Taicangshu, as if he was not at all concerned about the Icy State Celestial Cave or the mysterious Bewitching Sorceress.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was also somewhat surprised: "Devouring spiritual souls? Even that Heavenly Sovereign is no match? If he is defeated, who in the Spiritual Realm can be her opponent?"</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, he will have to intervene, right? What if the Bewitching Sorceress' strength exceeds his expectations, wouldn't that be a bit dangerous?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan re-evaluated his own strength again: "With my Divine Appearance Realm cultivation, the Unextinguishable Great Sun Body, various divine abilities, the Great Wasteland Divine Appearance, the Demonic Ancestor True Body... as a single person, I can easily handle a hundred of that Heavenly Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, since the Heavenly Sovereign can battle her for a time, even if he is devoured and the Bewitching Sorceress' strength increases, I should still be able to suppress her.</p><p></p><p>"But the Celestial Cave, is there an even stronger enemy within?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a bit helpless, he had originally wanted to just lay low and avoid acting if possible, but now it seems he will have to take action again!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his strength is powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Soul-devouring Enchantress!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord gnashed his teeth and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the big prey actually knows me, it seems you're quite knowledgeable!" </p><p></p><p>The Enchantress covered her mouth and laughed, stretching out a delicate white leg in an alluring manner.</p><p></p><p>"Your Enchantress clan truly deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord was furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall slay you!"</p><p></p><p>His long spear trembled as he charged to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Enchantress clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress was clearly stunned for a moment, but then smiled brightly again.</p><p></p><p>"What an ignorant big prey!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Pink light surged forth. With a wave of her delicate white hand, a zither appeared. As the clear notes rang out, attacks emerged with each sound.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Enchantress seemed immersed in playing the zither.</p><p></p><p>Pink radiance illuminated the heavens and earth, clashing with the Celestial Lord's mighty aura.</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace and Fu Tianhai finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the great battle ahead, they were shocked beyond measure. </p><p></p><p>"To be able to fight the Celestial Lord, what kind of enemy is this?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a Celestial Abyss!" </p><p></p><p>The Master of Thunder Cloud Manor spoke gravely, explaining: "Where the Snow Palace was located has turned into a Celestial Abyss. A strange woman called the Enchantress appeared, able to devour souls, with incredibly powerful strength..."</p><p></p><p>Soul-devouring Enchantress!</p><p></p><p>This was what the Celestial Lord had said.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the Celestial Lord's words, it was clear that Celestial Abysses were dangerous, with powerful enemies appearing.</p><p></p><p>As for how the Celestial Abyss appeared and why such a strange enemy emerged, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Enchantress seemed to be a race?</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately the Celestial Lord arrived in time, otherwise we would have been doomed!" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou sighed.</p><p></p><p>"That Enchantress is so powerful, can the Celestial Lord defeat her?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace sneered, "Fu Tianhai, that's the Celestial Lord, invited by my Thousand Martial Palace. No matter how powerful that Enchantress is, how could she be a match for the Celestial Lord? Once the Celestial Lord suppresses this enemy from the Celestial Abyss, the balance of power in the Spirit Realm will need to be reestablished!"</p><p></p><p>The Masters of Thunder Cloud Manor and Imperial Spirit Mansion nodded, saying: "If even the Celestial Lord can't defeat her, our Spirit Realm will truly be in danger. No one would be able to match the Enchantress!"</p><p></p><p>"I think we should prepare for the worst." </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor of Great Zhou, you dare question the might of the Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace, relying on the Celestial Lord's backing, had become arrogant. He glanced coldly at the Emperor of Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou's face darkened. "Don't slander me. How could I question the might of the Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you mean by preparing for the worst?"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace seemed unwilling to let it go.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it still takes time to open the Divine Bridge. If something unexpected happens, like more powerful enemies emerging from the Celestial Abyss, what then? I think we should invite another Celestial Lord to descend, to ensure absolute safety."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou said with a black face.</p><p></p><p>"Then your Great Zhou can go open the Void Bridge and invite a Celestial Lord to descend."</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace sneered.</p><p></p><p>"My Great Zhou last opened the Void Bridge nine years ago, to send two spirit body geniuses away. It's not yet time for us to open the Void Bridge again!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou glared angrily at the Master of Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Void Bridge could only be opened once every ten years. Great Zhou had already opened it once nine years ago to send spirit body geniuses away.</p><p></p><p>The name "Rainbow Province" was also related to opening the Void Bridge. Rainbow light illuminated the heavens and earth, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>However, those unaware of the secret thought it was just an ordinary rainbow, a unique sight in Rainbow Province, not knowing it was actually a bridge for sending spirit body geniuses away.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor of Great Zhou has a point. We must make some preparations!"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Imperial Spirit Mansion nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Lord was invited by the Thousand Martial Palace, from their patron power's Celestial Lords. Although each faction had their own patrons, facing a Celestial Lord not from their own patron made them somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Thousand Martial Palace had always been rather unscrupulous.</p><p></p><p>What if their patron power was also unscrupulous? Wouldn't that spell trouble?</p><p></p><p>For example, if their spirit body geniuses were forcibly taken away...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace laughed arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>The other transcendent spirit sects didn't have time to open the Void Bridge now.</p><p></p><p>The battle would end soon, with the Celestial Lord's might sweeping across the Spirit Realm. They could only obey orders. With a Celestial Lord backing them, the Thousand Martial Palace could do many things.</p><p></p><p>The balance of power in the Spirit Realm was not something anyone could easily break.</p><p></p><p>He cast a cold glance at Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan didn't pay any attention to the Master of Thousand Martial Palace. He was intently focused on the battle between the Celestial Lord and the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from becoming a Law Condensation Celestial Lord himself.</p><p></p><p>But this half step was an enormous leap.</p><p></p><p>It seemed only half a step away, but this half step was like the difference between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a Law Condensation Celestial Lord, what the senior called condensing the laws of heaven and earth... The Spirit Realm lacks sufficient spirit energy to condense the laws of heaven and earth, so breakthrough is impossible."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was also staring at the battle. After all, she was only half a step away from Law Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a Law Condensation Celestial Lord before them, it was a chance to glimpse the power of Law Condensation.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Wu Tiannan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if it was his imagination, but the Celestial Lord seemed to be at a disadvantage, appearing somewhat unable to match the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help looking at Xin Mengrou, who was also looking at him. Their hearts sank as they realized something was very wrong! The Celestial Lord was no match for the Enchantress!</p><p></p><p>Completely unaware of this, the Master of Thousand Martial Palace remained arrogant, secretly watching Wu Tiannan, as if this great enemy would soon be suppressed by the Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>The Masters of Imperial Spirit Mansion and Thunder Cloud Manor were already considering opening the Void Bridge to invite a Celestial Lord to descend. However, opening the Void Bridge couldn't be done overnight.</p><p></p><p>It required some time to prepare. Moreover, with the Celestial Lord currently battling the enemy and having ordered Rainbow Province sealed off, if they left abruptly and offended this Celestial Lord while their own patron's Celestial Lord had not yet descended to support them, the situation could become dire.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou suddenly frowned.</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou, seeing their grave expressions and apparent intention to retreat. His heart sank.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Fu Tianhai, who had also noticed something was amiss by now.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord still seemed incredibly powerful, each strike containing the might of heaven and earth, as if about to suppress the Enchantress.</p><p></p><p>But one could faintly see that the pink light seemed to have already invaded the Celestial Lord's defenses.</p><p></p><p>Pink lotus flowers surrounded the Celestial Lord's attacks, constantly invading and sealing, limiting the Celestial Lord's escape routes.</p><p></p><p>"Big prey, after devouring you, this servant's power will increase again."</p><p></p><p>The Enchantress's coquettish laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Celestial Lord's great spear struck out as his form instantly swelled. The power of heaven and earth's laws poured forth. Wind and clouds surged on the battlefield as a great spear stretched across the sky, thrusting towards the layers of pink light.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Pink lotus flowers swirled out, coiling along the great spear like chains, seeking to seal it. The Enchantress's delicate body was also approaching step by step.</p><p></p><p>Her delicate white hands reached back into the Celestial Abyss, pulling out a pink trident.</p><p></p><p>The trident suddenly broke through layer after layer of defenses, stabbing towards</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cracks began to appear in the black armor on the Celestial Venerable's body.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly flee! Open the divine bridge and request the True Kings to descend to the Spirit Realm to suppress the Charming Witch's Heavenly Cave!" the Celestial Venerable roared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Thousand Martial Hall and others were stunned. </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable was no match for the Charming Witch?</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and escape!"</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Thousand Martial Hall was the first to turn and flee, cold sweat pouring down his face. The Celestial Venerable was actually no match! How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is doomed."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go to Hong Province, the virtual bridge hasn't closed yet, hurry and request aid!"</p><p></p><p>"It's too late, based on the timing, the virtual bridge has already closed!"</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Control Manor and Thunder Cloud Manor, quickly open the virtual bridge and request the Venerables to descend!"</p><p></p><p>"It's too late, it can't be opened in such a short time!"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts were extremely anxious as they fled in panic.</p><p></p><p>"Prey cannot escape my Charming Witch's hunting grounds."</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch's voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, cold sweat poured down the faces of all the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do? What do we do? The Spirit Realm is likely finished. We can only wait for the divine bridge to open and for the Celestial Venerables to descend to resolve this crisis!"</p><p></p><p>"By the time the divine bridge opens, we'll all be dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, go to the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Some experts anxiously suggested.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm... we can't go there, the Spirit Realm Gate has disappeared!" the Master of the Thousand Martial Hall said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>All the experts were greatly shocked. The Spirit Realm Gate had actually disappeared? Could it be related to the appearance of the Heavenly Cave?</p><p></p><p>"Let's flee as long as we can," the Great Zhou Emperor said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone don't panic, our Spirit Realm has a great expert!" Wu Tiannan suddenly said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"A great expert?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is this great expert?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a great expert, a peerless great expert. Our Spirit Realm has a great expert in seclusion. With such a great calamity descending, only by requesting this great expert to take action can we protect our Spirit Realm," Xin Mengrou said, her eyes brightening.</p><p></p><p>How could they have forgotten about that senior?</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor and others felt more assured. If even Xin Mengrou said so, then it must be an incredibly powerful expert, right? </p><p></p><p>But they still felt somewhat unconfident in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Can this great expert compare to a Celestial Venerable? Even a Celestial Venerable has fallen, and after the Charming Witch devours the Celestial Venerable, her power will be even stronger!" the Master of the Thousand Martial Hall said with a lack of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"That is a truly peerless great expert, how can a Celestial Venerable compare?" Wu Tiannan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>That senior is an existence that has transcended heaven and earth. Can a Celestial Venerable transcend heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"Where is this great expert?" the Master of Spirit Control Manor hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Changqing Pavilion!" Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou said in unison.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship had already arrived at Cloud Province. Looking down from above, only the mountain peaks of the vast Cloud Province remained above water, the cities had long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"There's something strange about this water," Su Lingxiu said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"It's the erosion of a special energy. As long as the source is cut off, it will recover," Xu Yan said after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The source was in the Heavenly Cave in Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held the Taicang Book in his hands. He had already read to the thirteenth page.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation increased, the speed at which he could memorize the Dao principles also became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"The number of Great Wilderness martial artists has broken through one million. You have obtained the Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The number of martial artists cultivating the Great Wilderness martial arts in the Inner Realm had broken through one million! This speed was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the number of Great Wilderness martial artists increased, the subsequent increase in their numbers would become faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness is quite powerful!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted. The Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness would continuously strengthen and become more vast and mysterious as the number of Great Wilderness martial artists increased.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness is like the beginning of heaven and earth, the image of primordial chaos..."</p><p></p><p>Once the Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness was deployed, the image of a peerless great expert would be even more shocking, more awe-inspiring and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Combined with a mysterious aura, even martial artists stronger than me would have their legs go weak upon seeing it," Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness + mysterious aura could scare even martial artists stronger than himself into not daring to act recklessly!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what's going on with the Heavenly Cave in Ice Province. I hope I won't need to take action to suppress everything," Li Xuan pondered as he looked towards Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>"That Celestial Venerable has already gone to Ice Province. I wonder how things are now, and if he can resolve the problem."</p><p></p><p>The martial artist that the Thousand Martial Hall had requested to descend was quite powerful. With the power of heaven and earth, he should be able to suppress the Heavenly Cave, right?</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship continued towards Ice Province, not moving too quickly.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Two figures hurriedly approached from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how are things?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is dire!" Fang Hao said with a grave expression. "A huge cave has appeared in Ice Province, and this cave is somewhat strange, as if it's a hole that has appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"There's a powerful woman in the Heavenly Cave called the Charming Witch. She can actually devour souls, and seems to feed on the souls of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"She is extremely powerful. Senior Wu and the others joined forces but were no match for her. I caught her off guard with a great formation, but only managed to trap her for an instant before she quickly broke free and gave chase.</p><p></p><p>"However, now that Celestial Venerable is battling the Charming Witch. I'm not sure of the outcome."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao recounted the events in detail.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Feeding on souls? "What kind of demon woman is this? To think such a bizarre person would appear in the Spirit Realm." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He then said eagerly, "Let me go meet her!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao shook his head gravely and said, "Senior brother, even if we brothers joined forces, we would be no match for her. I have a feeling that even that Celestial Venerable may not be her opponent!</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, once she devours the Celestial Venerable, her power will likely become even stronger!</p><p></p><p>"That Heavenly Cave is very special. I don't know what the appearance of the Heavenly Cave signifies."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but look towards their master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm as ever, looking at the Taicang Book in his hands, as if he didn't care at all about the Heavenly Cave in Ice Province or that mysterious Charming Witch.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was also somewhat shocked: "Devouring souls? Even that Celestial Venerable is no match? If he's no match, who in the entire Spirit Realm could be her opponent?"</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I'll probably have to take action. What if the Charming Witch's power is beyond imagination? Wouldn't that be somewhat dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but reassess his own strength again, wondering how many of that Celestial Venerable he could fight by himself.</p><p></p><p>"With my Divine Appearance realm cultivation, Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, various divine abilities, Divine Appearance of the Great Wilderness, True Form of the Demon Ancestor... fighting a hundred of that Celestial Venerable by myself shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"That being the case, since the Celestial Venerable can battle her for a while, even if he's devoured, causing the Charming Witch's power to increase, I should still be able to suppress her.</p><p></p><p>"However, does an even stronger enemy exist in the Heavenly Cave?</p><p></p><p>"I must be cautious, lest I stumble in an unexpected place."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt somewhat helpless. He had wanted to lay low, to avoid taking action as much as possible, but now it seemed he would have to take action again!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his power was strong enough.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful masters like the Peerless Grand Master all became solemn in expression.</p><p></p><p>They reckoned that facing the attack from the three powerful experts, facing such a terrifying offensive, even if they did not die, they would still suffer heavy injuries, and it would be difficult to flee.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai's expression was grave as he stood up, and the long sword in the black scabbard beside him trembled, as if ready to be drawn at any moment.</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar sounded, and the golden dragon roared and charged into the rolling blades of light.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts only felt a momentary daze, as if they saw on the battlefield the mountains and rivers appearing and covering everything, the golden dragon soaring with majestic might.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword slashed out, the momentum surging, the innate true qi circulating, a dazzling light appearing on his body, and a vague dragon shadow could even be seen, coiling around the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will slay the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign on Canglan Island!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>A sword slash was unleashed, attacking the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>With a slap of his left hand, eighteen golden dragons roared and charged towards Yinxue and the other black-robed person.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly turned blood-red, and a layer of viscous blood qi appeared around him, as if his blood essence was covering him, the hissing sound becoming more and more dense.</p><p></p><p>The icy aura permeated, the blood and fire raged, as if he was burning himself.</p><p></p><p>The bloodthirsty and violent aura surged from the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign, his momentum increasing, his hooked claws becoming even more crimson.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign roared furiously, as if he had lost his sanity, unleashing his attacks frantically.</p><p></p><p>"This sword will slay the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained indifferent as he brought down the sword.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers rolled back, as if burying all living beings.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks were extinguished in the mountains and rivers, the mountains and rivers constantly shattering, as if they were about to be destroyed, when suddenly, a thunderous sound shook the four directions, and a bolt of lightning seemed to appear from the void.</p><p></p><p>It transformed into a sword, like the might of heaven, like the punishment of heaven, shaking the four directions, and suddenly descended! The Thunderous Sword of the Mountains and Rivers!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Yinxue's expression was horrified, his aura erupting, merging with the protective guardian in an instant, unleashing a powerful offensive to break through the eighteen golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>The sickle sword swept across the sky, trying to rescue the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a thunderous sound, and a water column shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>A black-robed figure surged out from the water, with a powerful momentum, about to attack Xu Yan to rescue the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Thunderous Sword, like the punishment of heaven, descended.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had black-robed people attacking him from the left, right, and behind, wanting to strike him.</p><p></p><p>Either he would slay the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign and suffer heavy injuries, or he would have to defend against the encirclement, but in that case, he would be completely trapped.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts watching the battle were all horrified by that Thunderous Sword, terrifying like the punishment of heaven, and seemed to be the nemesis of evil and darkness, sweeping away everything.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was delivering divine retribution to the enemy!</p><p></p><p>The Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign cultivated a murderous technique, inherently belonging to the evil and dark, and was precisely the weakness targeted by the Thunderous Sword.</p><p></p><p>With this sword strike, the notorious Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign seemed destined to perish!</p><p></p><p>However, besides the two black-robed people who had already acted, there was another one, hidden in the water, who also struck at this moment.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan's sword strike were to slay the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign, he would surely suffer a triple attack, and even if he did not die, he would be severely injured! The changes on the battlefield happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden figure dashed out from the water, the terrifying blade light attacking the black-robed person who had just emerged from the water.</p><p></p><p>"Your opponent is me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned as he charged forward.</p><p></p><p>This strike, if the opponent did not block and defend, would be certain death! The black-robed person's expression changed drastically, hastily parrying the attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body had even grown larger, his loose clothes bursting open, as he sheathed the sword and unleashed the power of wind and thunder with his fists, charging towards the black-robed person with savage ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's have a thrilling and exhilarating battle!"</p><p></p><p>His fists pounded, his body enveloped in golden light, the might of the Great Sun Golden Body fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person was horrified, retreating under Meng Chong's relentless attacks, quickly leaving the battlefield, the two of them engaging in combat elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's fists pounded out, the wind and thunder raging, his robust physique exuding a powerful pressure, each punch like a sudden gale and thunder, his figure constantly advancing towards the black-robed person.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the black-robed person's attacks, he only defended against three or four tenths of the force, allowing the remaining attack force to strike his body without any resistance, relying on his formidable flesh and blood to endure.</p><p></p><p>His savage attacks, like blows to the flesh, were extremely violent, like a human-shaped fierce beast, attacking the black-robed person into a fluster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black-robed person was horrified.</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster is this, with flesh and blood, why is it so terrifying, almost comparable to a treasure?</p><p></p><p>Each of his attacks, the opponent only simply defended, slightly weakening his attack force, but the remaining attack force, he did not care at all, allowing it to pound on his body.</p><p></p><p>What terrified him was that even the weakened attacks, if they were to hit any peak grand master, they would either kill or severely injure them.</p><p></p><p>No peak grand master would dare to ignore such attacks.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful attacks, the bald youth did not care at all, and what shocked him even more was that the attacks hitting the opponent only left shallow marks.</p><p></p><p>Momentarily, the black-robed person's mind was in disarray, the sickle sword constantly slashing out terrifying sword beams, while frantically retreating, trying to escape Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how frantically he retreated and evaded, Meng Chong always followed closely, punch after punch, with savage ferocity, like a human-shaped raging dragon, extremely ruthless.</p><p></p><p>On the Cangjiang River, all the powerful experts were horrified.</p><p></p><p>That bald youth, the strength of his flesh and blood, was actually so terrifying, almost comparable to a treasure!</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a person with such formidable flesh and blood in this world?</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood, actually comparable to a treasure? How did he cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>While the crowd was shocked by Meng Chong's savagery and flesh and blood comparable to a treasure, the Thunderous Sword had descended like divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>All the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign's attacks, the viscous blood waves, were extinguished under this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The sword fell, sweeping away all darkness and evil.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>A short, disbelieving voice rang out, the Fire Devouring Demon Sovereign's body turning into charred black and dissipating into ashes under the sword strike.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yinxue and the protective guardian's attacks were also targeting Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>However, in an instant, Xu Yan's figure disappeared from the original spot, appearing beside the protective guardian.</p><p></p><p>Teleportation!</p><p></p><p>A sword strike descended.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The mountains and rivers dragon's roar!</p><p></p><p>The protective guardian only felt a momentary daze, as if he had entered a world of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>He was horrified in his heart, what kind of sword technique was this, that could interfere with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blade light emanated icy qi, he spat out a mouthful of essence blood, directly unleashing a secret martial art.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck again with the Sword of the Mountains, Rivers, and All Living Beings. The protective guardian had just escaped the mountains and rivers when he seemed to see the mountains and rivers shattering, the living beings wielding the sword to strike.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The sword strike landed, his body fragmenting and dissipating into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue had already rushed over, wanting to provide aid, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, he killed the Demonic Patriarch of the Fire Sect, and with two sword strikes, he killed the Guardian. The battle was over in an instant, and life and death had already been decided.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying power this was!</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue's expression was horrified, and his gaze even revealed a look of fear. If this young man continued to grow stronger, Yin Jue could not even imagine how powerful he would become.</p><p></p><p>To stand at the pinnacle of the inner domain's martial arts? Flee! He must flee! Only the Sect Master could possibly kill Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue assessed his own strength, finding that it was slightly superior to the Demonic Patriarch of the Fire Sect, but his abilities were limited. In a true life-and-death battle, although he could kill the Demonic Patriarch, he would also sustain heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Patriarch of the Fire Sect was likely suppressed by the thunderous sword strike, which was like divine retribution, and thus could not even withstand a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue reckoned that even if he could withstand the first strike, what about the second, third, or more? Xu Yan seemed relaxed and effortless, clearly possessing more than just a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Jue who had originally charged towards Xu Yan twisted his figure and frantically retreated, intending to flee.</p><p></p><p>"There is no enemy who can escape from my sight!" Xu Yan coldly snorted, his figure disappearing from the original spot, and in an instant, he had caught up to Yin Jue.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike fell! Mountains and rivers were shattered, the thunderous sword strike descending like divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue was horrified.</p><p></p><p>When truly facing this sword strike, he realized its terrifying nature.</p><p></p><p>The crisis of death enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the mountains and rivers were destroyed, the gathered majestic might like divine retribution, wanting to completely annihilate him!</p><p></p><p>The curved saber shattered, turning into a bone-chilling cold.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue's body instantly withered, and an extremely powerful sword light burst forth from his body.</p><p></p><p>He did not try to resist the thunderous sword strike like divine retribution. Instead, that sword light struck towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan coldly snorted, striking out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon roared, its dragon might surging, its dragon eyes shining brilliantly, an earth-shaking and heaven-shaking fury erupting from the golden giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled and fierce golden giant dragon thundered towards that sword light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue's final attack, although it shattered half of the golden giant dragon, could only achieve this much, being blocked by a single palm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at it in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>A palm striking out the giant dragon had completely blocked his final attack before death? Just how strong was Xu Yan? Pu! Yin Jue's blackened body turned to ash and dissipated!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood holding his sword, looking down arrogantly at the surroundings, and all the powerful experts were horrified!</p><p></p><p>The young man was like a dragon, shaking the world! Boom!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the battle was even more savage.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the powerful experts, Meng Chong's figure had already approached the black-robed person, and in the latter's horrified gaze, he grinned as he wrapped his arms around him, embracing him to his chest.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The powerful experts swallowed their saliva, their faces filled with shock. This was truly a human-shaped fierce dragon!</p><p></p><p>Fierce and savage, unmatched by anyone! Meng Chong's arms closed, embracing the black-robed person, suddenly tightening, and the terrifying physical strength directly crushed the black-robed person into fragments.</p><p></p><p>The sound of cracking echoed from afar.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person's body shattered, turning into fragments, and then dissipating into ash.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>What fierce and savage power this was, truly a human-shaped fierce dragon, directly embracing and crushing the person to death in his arms, grinding him into fragments. That terrifying scorching aura, the enemy didn't even splatter any blood before turning into fragments and ash!</p><p></p><p>Too violent, too fierce.</p><p></p><p>"This is too intense!" Hu Shan muttered in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed, saying that to be accepted as a disciple by the senior, this youth must have extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's ferocity was undoubtedly revealed this time.</p><p></p><p>He directly used his powerful physique to crush and kill a peak Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Probably, this was the first time in history that a peak Grandmaster had been killed in such a way.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Meng Chong's quick victory was also related to the fact that Xu Yan had already slain three peak Grandmasters, and that black-robed person's mind was in disarray, terrified and not focused on the battle, exposing weaknesses that Meng Chong seized.</p><p></p><p>But Meng Chong's strength was already sufficient to contend with peak Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai was dumbfounded, where did this prodigy come from? These young people were too outrageous in their strength.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, his gaze was strange. Such a powerful young man, he was far from being their opponent, so where was the need for him to intervene?</p><p></p><p>On the Cangjiang River, there was silence.</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yunian stared at Meng Chong, wondering where this bald youth came from? "The junior disciple of Master Xu is also so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Caicai exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>And on a small boat, a charming woman looked at Meng Chong, her eyes filled with infatuation.</p><p></p><p>"This is a real man! How can those pretty boys compare? Those who like pretty boys are all trash. Too violent, too fierce, ah, I love it so much!"</p><p></p><p>The woman covered her chest, her eyes filled with that towering and burly figure...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood on the Cangjiang River, looking around arrogantly, "I am the Sword God Xu Yan. Who else is not satisfied? Who else covets this Canglan Island and wants to kill me? Come out!"</p><p></p><p>On the Cangjiang River, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>There were even some small boats that, because they were closer to Xu Yan than the others, were frantically retreating, fearing they would be misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>At this time, to stand out would be suicide. "If no one dares to stand out alone, you can find people to join forces, ten or eight of you, and I, Xu Yan, will take you all on!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ten or eight? How many sword strikes could they withstand?</p><p></p><p>The group of Grandmasters muttered to themselves, retreating their boats even further, afraid of catching Xu Yan's eye and being struck down by an unwanted sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Since no one dares to stand out, from today onwards, without my permission, no one is allowed to set foot on Canglan Island, or it will be considered a provocation!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to say a word of objection!</p><p></p><p>The Second Prince of the Great Yue Kingdom spoke in a low voice to the person beside him, "The relationship between Yin Hong and me must not be revealed. Those who know of this matter, make sure to handle it cleanly!"</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan were to find out that Yin Hong was his person, and in a fit of rage came to seek him out, that would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>If he provoked such a powerful enemy, his father the Emperor would undoubtedly abandon him and expel him from the royal family. That was the harsh reality!</p><p></p><p>"So it's just two or three sword strikes, huh?" The Matchless Grandmaster muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Yun Caicai hummed and said, "Master, I told you it was for your own good, but you wouldn't believe me. If I hadn't pleaded for you, you would have been killed by Master Xu in just two or three sword strikes!"</p><p></p><p>The Matchless Grandmaster glared at his disciple, feeling extremely exasperated. She was truly an unfilial disciple, only having eyes for Xu Yan and no regard for her own master.</p><p></p><p>"This battle was truly enjoyable," Meng Chong said, walking over and rubbing his head.</p><p></p><p>This battle had fully displayed the essence and ferocity of the Martial Dao of the Physical Body.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, your physical body is so powerful that ordinary Grandmasters can no longer harm you," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao of the Physical Body was truly savage and fierce, like a human-shaped fierce beast.</p><p></p><p>On the last day of September, please vote for monthly tickets, my family. Your votes would be greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 433</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The evil eyes of the Tuowu demon glowed with an eerie light, enveloping Xu Yan in their sinister radiance.</p><p></p><p>The group of martial artists following far behind Xu Yan frantically retreated, terrified of being touched by the Tuowu demon's gaze. Even a single glance from those evil eyes would be enough to make them lazy to the point of death, given their level of strength.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Yan done for?"</p><p></p><p>"He was too careless. That's a Tuowu demon after all."</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords guarding the Tuowu Celestial Cave were alerted and came over.</p><p></p><p>"Should we intervene?"</p><p></p><p>"It's too late!"</p><p></p><p>They had both experienced the power of the Tuowu demon's evil eyes before. Even facing the Tuowu alone posed a risk of being corrupted.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan, who was now engulfed in the light of the evil eyes, remained calm and unaffected. The sword intent of the Xun Wind surrounded him like a gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>"...Seven, eight...twenty, twenty-one..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued counting the Tuowu's eyes with interest.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu's expression changed, revealing shock. How could someone of a lower realm ignore the power of its evil eyes?</p><p></p><p>And what was that power surrounding him?</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" the Tuowu asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Tuowu's hundred eyes began to close, and the eerie light dissipated. </p><p></p><p>Continuing to shine its gaze would be futile.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes revealed a hint of wariness, as well as intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>If this youth were to grow up unafraid of its evil eyes that intimidated so many powerful beings, he would surely become a huge threat!</p><p></p><p>He must be killed in the cradle before he could grow up!</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan, remember it. I am Sword God Xu Yan, supreme in the world's sword dao!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Sword God? Such arrogant words. Then let this seat test your sword dao."</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu waved its hand, unleashing a dark and sinister force that seemed capable of corroding everything, even eroding and extinguishing spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained fearless. His Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword flourished endlessly, manifesting myriad mountains and rivers as he directly engaged the Tuowu in battle.</p><p></p><p>Although the Tuowu was very powerful, even stronger than an Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend, it was unable to defeat Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After fighting for a moment, Xu Yan's form suddenly vanished from its original spot. The next instant, he had left the battlefield and charged into a group of puppet witches nearby.</p><p></p><p>Sword light flashed, and in an instant, he had slain over a dozen puppet witches.</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu was furious and hastily pursued to attack, but after exchanging blows with Xu Yan for a moment, he once again changed positions and went to slay more puppet witches.</p><p></p><p>"The Tuowu has met a formidable enemy!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! Let's see if the Tuowu is still so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords guarding the Tuowu Celestial Cave were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength may not have surpassed the Tuowu's, but his movement techniques and speed were unexpectedly powerful, leaving even the Tuowu helpless against them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Tuowu's strongest evil eye light had lost its effect on Xu Yan, rendering the Tuowu somewhat at a loss when facing Xu Yan's evasive movements!</p><p></p><p>"Tuowu, do you have any Seven Wonders Divine Flowers? Give me one Seven Wonders Divine Flower, or a similar or even higher-grade treasure, and I'll leave right away!" Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, you've angered me!" The Tuowu's eyes flashed coldly, emanating killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Puff puff puff! Just as Xu Yan was about to slay more puppet witches, suddenly one after another they exploded, transforming into an evil force that returned to the Tuowu's body.</p><p></p><p>"Recalling the puppet witches?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow but didn't continue slaying them. Instead, he turned back and launched a series of sword strikes, unleashing six Heaven-Defying Sword techniques in succession. The all-annihilating sword light forced even the Tuowu to respond cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Tuowu, I'm serious. As long as you give me one Seven Wonders Divine Flower or a similar heavenly treasure, I'll leave immediately and won't bother you again!" Xu Yan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu remained silent. Its form became ethereal, and its speed suddenly increased dramatically. Even its left and right shoulders opened huge eyes.</p><p></p><p>The two eyes on its shoulders suddenly shot out strange threads of light, like a spider's web, weaving towards all directions to trap Xu Yan within.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and changed his form, taking the opportunity to escape before the strange threads could fully interweave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Tuowu looked extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Eyes opened on its forehead and cheeks, blinking in a way that chilled one's heart to see.</p><p></p><p>A huge eye appeared on each shoulder, one with a blank stare and one with a cold gaze. Fine, strange threads floated out from their pupils.</p><p></p><p>The fine threads floated in midair, dense and eerie.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly shocked - was this the Tuowu's true form? It was too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>"Tuowu, let's end it here for today. I'll come back tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan retreated swiftly, instantly disappearing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can come and go as you please?" </p><p></p><p>The Tuowu said coldly. With a boom, a strange light surged from its body. The threads from the eyes on its shoulders seemed to extend infinitely, rapidly spreading towards the entrance of the celestial cave, trying to seal off the exit!</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists watching the battle were terrified and frantically fled towards the outside of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Take action!"</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords guarding this place changed expression and hurriedly moved to resist the spreading threads.</p><p></p><p>Since the Tuowu had appeared in this celestial cave, they had never seen it so angry as today, and they were also seeing the Tuowu in this state for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The celestial cave began to shake, and the power of heaven and earth's laws rippled like waves.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, what kind of strange thing is this?"</p><p></p><p>To the horror of the two Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords, the threads extending from the Tuowu's eyes were impervious to attacks. No matter how they attacked, they couldn't destroy these threads!</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, leave quickly!" One of the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords hurriedly warned.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained calm as ever, arriving at the cave exit in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several threads had already stretched across the cave exit like spider silk, and were continuing to form a web.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and swung his sword to cut. With a puff, he severed the threads, annihilating a portion of them.</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords were shocked to see this.</p><p></p><p>"Tuowu, I'm serious. Unless you give me the treasure I need, I won't give up," Xu Yan said with a smile, looking back at the Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>He stepped out of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu watched Xu Yan leave, its face extremely gloomy, eyes full of killing intent and growing wariness.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword dao is that, able to destroy my Tuo threads!"</p><p></p><p>Not only was he unafraid of its evil eye light, he could even cut its Tuo threads. Once he grew up, he would surely become a great threat.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that its Tuo threads were a special substance that ordinary martial arts power couldn't harm. Only soul power could affect them, but once soul power touched the Tuo threads, it would be corroded by the Tuo force, making one's soul and will become lazy.</p><p></p><p>This was why powerful beings were very wary when faced with its Tuo thread attacks.</p><p></p><p>Except for those with exceptionally strong souls who had mastered powerful soul techniques, any powerful being encountering its Tuo threads would deal with them very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Yan had severed the Tuo threads with a wave of his hand. This meant his sword dao power was incredibly strong, even able to counter its Tuo power.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Silk!</p><p></p><p>This child absolutely cannot be allowed to live! Luo Wu's gaze was cold and fierce. "To think that such a prodigy has appeared in the Tai Cang realm. Could Tai Cang be producing a second ruler?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the celestial cave here, he felt somewhat helpless. Restricted by this celestial cave, the power he could manifest was limited.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xu Yan came to Luo Wu's celestial cave again. Without a word, he immediately started slaughtering a batch of puppet witches.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu angrily appeared, even wanting to launch a sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>After a bout of fighting, Xu Yan retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Wu, without the Seven Wonders Divine Flower or a similar treasure, I won't give up. I'll be back tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coolly left the celestial cave again.</p><p></p><p>His goal was simple - to keep emphasizing the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, giving Luo Wu the impression that he desperately wanted a treasure like it.</p><p></p><p>And to keep provoking Luo Wu's anger, deepening his killing intent. Over time, if Luo Wu knew Mei Wu, this matter would surely reach Mei Wu's ears.</p><p></p><p>Given Mei Wu's anger towards him, she would certainly try to set up a trap to lure him in.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, Xu Yan entered the celestial cave every day. Eventually, there were no more puppet witches left in the cave. Luo Wu had recalled all the puppet witches.</p><p></p><p>In the entire celestial cave, only Luo Wu remained.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you go too far!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu roared and charged over in a frenzy, attacking all the way to the cave entrance, frightening the Immortal Celestial Lord on guard into hastily intervening to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>Standing outside the celestial cave, Xu Yan smiled brightly at the furiously roaring Luo Wu inside. "Luo Wu, give me the treasure I need, and I'll leave immediately, no longer bothering you!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu coldly snorted and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Celestial Lords had shocked expressions. Was Xu Yan extorting Luo Wu? This was too crazy! Moreover, they suddenly realized that Luo Wu seemed unable to leave the celestial cave?</p><p></p><p>If that was true, then the two of them would no longer need to guard here day and night. After all, if Luo Wu couldn't leave the celestial cave, it meant he couldn't cause harm to the Chang Yun realm.</p><p></p><p>"Both Luo Wu and Mei Wu can't come out of the celestial caves. What restrictions are they under? Is it because only their power avatars entered?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Entering the celestial cave once more, this time Xu Yan was more cautious, guarding against any tricks from Luo Wu. After all, such a powerful being had many methods and couldn't be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, there was no sign of Luo Wu in the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Wu, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>Standing in the core area of the celestial cave, looking up towards the outside, Xu Yan called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>"What a waste!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt somewhat helpless. Had Luo Wu actually run away?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan come out, the two Immortal Celestial Lords immediately raised their guard, staring intently into the celestial cave, ready to defend against any attack from Luo Wu at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be tense. Luo Wu ran away, he's not in the celestial cave."</p><p></p><p>"Ran away?"</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Celestial Lords were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Xu Yan entered Luo Wu's celestial cave every day, but never saw any sign of Luo Wu. It seemed Luo Wu had grown impatient and simply abandoned this celestial cave, no longer returning.</p><p></p><p>"This Luo Wu can't take a joke at all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was helpless. His plan had failed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll come one more time tomorrow. If I still don't see Luo Wu, I'll leave the Chang Yun realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xu Yan entered the celestial cave again. To his surprise, Luo Wu actually appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Wu, you dare to come back?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held his sword, ready to attack at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu coldly looked at him and said: "I don't have the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, but I'll give you this treasure map. Don't come bother me again in the future!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and tossed over a scroll.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and caught the scroll. "A treasure map? How could I fall for such an obvious trick?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu's expression remained cold. "This leads to a secret cave in your realm. Not only does it have the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, but also a Jade Bamboo, said to be a treasure of heaven and earth. I obtained it by chance tens of thousands of years ago. If not for this celestial cave secret realm preventing entry from outside, how could you be so lucky?"</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"I never deceive people. I've given you the item, don't come bother me again."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Luo Wu ignored Xu Yan, sitting cross-legged in the core area of the celestial cave and closing his eyes to meditate.</p><p></p><p>"I'll trust you this once!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>He opened the scroll and took a look, revealing a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, is this your arrangement?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly excited. The plan had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>However, this celestial cave secret realm was surely extremely dangerous. It was likely that not just Mei Wu, but Luo Wu as well would be lying in ambush within.</p><p></p><p>"I'll always appear with strength beyond your expectations!"</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before he broke through to the peak of the Divine Phase realm. Moreover, the celestial cave limited the strength of those who could enter.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through to the peak of Divine Phase, he would not fear even top Immortal Celestial Lords, and could even defeat them.</p><p></p><p>And with his many martial techniques, dealing with potential crises should not be a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, don't disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left contentedly.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wu opened his eyes and looked at Xu Yan's departing figure, his eyes revealing undisguised killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, since you crave heavenly treasures so much, let them be your burial goods. It's worth using some heavenly treasures to bury a Tai Cang prodigy."</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan didn't die, he would be uneasy.</p><p></p><p>A Tai Cang martial artist who was unafraid of his evil eye light and could easily destroy his Luo silk was surely a huge hidden danger, even if the other's current strength was still far from his own.</p><p></p><p>But, it was ultimately a potential threat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came out of the celestial cave and opened the scroll to examine it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Guang You realm?"</p><p></p><p>The celestial cave secret realm recorded on the treasure map was located in the Guang You realm, beneath a deep swamp, very hidden.</p><p></p><p>"The Guang You realm is quite far from the Chang Yun realm. On the way there, I should try to accumulate some treasures. I can reach the Guang You realm in two to three years. Let Mei Wu wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan estimated that traveling there while training and accumulating treasures along the way would take two to three years to reach the Guang You realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he went directly to the Guang You realm, crossing just a few realms, it would be much faster. But that didn't fit Xu Yan's training purpose.</p><p></p><p>In each realm he passed through, he would surely train in the celestial caves and collect treasures unique to that realm.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the treasure map, Xu Yan was about to go find Luo Zhan to get information on the Tian Sha Di Ying branch, when Luo Zhan came to find him first.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, here is what you need - a list of the hidden Di Ying members. So far only these six have been confirmed, the rest are dead."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan handed a list to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Six is enough."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the list. It was time to start retaliating against Tian Sha Di Ying, controlling these six Di Ying members and using that as a foundation to continuously expand control over more people.</p><p></p><p>It was simply using the same method he had used in Da Gai Mountain of the Jiu Shan realm again. Xu Yan was already very skilled at this.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan had just opened his mouth when his expression suddenly changed drastically. His aura erupted as he gripped his wolf tooth club, abruptly raising his head to look at the sky! Two figures descended, their auras dark and ominous, giving Luo Zhan a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The newcomers wore fierce masks on their faces, and on the masks were engraved nine slender leaves!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

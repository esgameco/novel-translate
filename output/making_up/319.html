        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, that person's strength is not weak, it won't be easy to capture him," said the spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Crimson Cat looked at the group of Sixth-Rank spiritual beasts and said in a deep voice, "Who will go and bring the person here?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I will go!" The Snow Wolf immediately jumped up, not giving the other demons a chance, and swiftly took the spiritual beast with him, rushing out of the main hall to lead the way and capture the person.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Tian Ling State, Zhu Xing was once again trying to deceive the spiritual beasts, but he felt a bit puzzled - these spiritual beasts were somewhat different from before. In the past, entering the Tian Ling State, deceiving the spiritual beasts, and ultimately controlling them, was not too difficult, but now it had become a bit challenging.</p><p></p><p>These spiritual beasts no longer seemed to be easily deceived, directly covering their ears and refusing to listen.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, I haven't revealed my skill of deceiving spiritual beasts, so why are these spiritual beasts so wary of being tricked by my eloquent words?" Zhu Xing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed - a Sixth-Rank spiritual beast! He then calmed down, thinking, "It's just a Sixth-Rank spiritual beast, it's not like I can't deceive it." Now that he had reached the peak of the Refining Spirit Celestial realm, he should be able to deceive a Sixth-Rank spiritual beast as well.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, I am Zhu Xing, the envoy of the Myriad Worlds Alliance. I pay my respects to the Spiritual Beast King!" No matter whether the other party was the Spiritual Beast King or not, as long as it was a Sixth-Rank spiritual beast, it was always a good idea to flatter it first.</p><p></p><p>"So you're the one who's been deceiving my demonic tribe? Come here!" The Snow Wolf immediately pounced on Zhu Xing without any further ado.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing was dumbfounded. Demonic tribe? And the other party was ready to attack him without any discussion.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to resist, but the other party's strength was far beyond his, and if he resisted, he would completely lose any chance of reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence the Beast King, let's talk it out, I have no ill intentions... I have..." Zhu Xing was about to take out a medicinal pill and try to deceive the Sixth-Rank spiritual beast using the name of the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you calling a beast? I am the Great Elder of the Demonic Tribe, you fool!" the Snow Wolf scolded.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing was completely dumbfounded. I addressed you as the Beast King, how did that become an insult? And the Great Elder of the Demonic Tribe? The Spiritual Realm has never had a Demonic Tribe before, this is just a Sixth-Rank spiritual beast, right?</p><p></p><p>"By the command of the mighty and awe-inspiring Demonic King, I have come to capture you, you scoundrel!" The Snow Wolf said, and with a swipe of his paw, he seized Zhu Xing.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the Crimson Cat sat on the throne, looking down at the scene below. On both sides of the main hall, a group of Sixth-Rank spiritual beasts stood solemnly, watching as the Snow Wolf brought Zhu Xing in.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhu Xing felt a sense of panic, finally realizing that the situation was not good. Slap! The Snow Wolf threw Zhu Xing to the ground and respectfully said, "The mighty and awe-inspiring Demonic King, the Snow Wolf has captured this person as commanded."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Crimson Cat nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing's face turned green at this moment. The entire main hall was filled with Sixth-Rank spiritual beasts, and even more terrifying, the spiritual beast tribe had a true king who ruled over the entire tribe!</p><p></p><p>He looked up and saw three thrones, on which sat a spotted fierce tiger with a large gold chain around its neck, exuding the aura of a wealthy and powerful individual. On the left was a jade dragon, and on the right was... the Swallowing Mountain Toad?</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful Swallowing Mountain Toad?</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Demonic King, I am Zhu Xing, an envoy of the Myriad Worlds Alliance. I have come to the Tian Ling State to discuss the establishment of an alliance between the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the spiritual beast tribe..." Zhu Xing, feeling the overwhelming pressure, hurriedly spoke with great respect.</p><p></p><p>He immediately brought up the Myriad Worlds Alliance, representing himself as their envoy, so that the Demonic King would not kill him, as one does not kill an envoy.</p><p></p><p>"To demonstrate the sincerity of our Myriad Worlds Alliance, I have prepared a rare and precious medicinal pill, which I humbly offer to the Demonic King." Zhu Xing quickly took out a bottle of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Due to his good relationship with the Green Lotus Sect, and the fact that the Junior Alliance Master Fang Hao was the disciple of the Green Lotus Sect's Sect Master Su Ling Xiu, he had acquired many medicinal pills. His rapid increase in strength was also related to the assistance of these medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, over the years, he had also used these medicinal pills to deceive and lure many spiritual beasts to leave the Tian Ling State...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing believed that as long as he brought up the Myriad Worlds Alliance and offered the medicinal pills respectfully, this trip would be safe and without incident.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat looked at the medicinal pills in Zhu Xing's hand and fell into deep thought. These medicinal pills could only be found at the Green Lotus Sect, and only Su Ling Xiu, the Saintly Mother of the Demonic Tribe, could refine them. If Zhu Xing was acquainted with the Green Lotus Sect, he could not be killed, but the Crimson Cat was not sure about the current situation of the Green Lotus Sect - whether they had started selling medicinal pills externally or not.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his paw, the medicinal pills flew over to him, and after inspecting them, he confirmed that they were indeed refined by Su Ling Xiu. He then took them and kept them.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over your storage bag!" The Crimson Cat raised a sharp claw and gestured for Zhu Xing to hand it over.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Zhu Xing inwardly cursed, but could only obediently hand over the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I obtained a storage ring from the Junior Alliance Master, otherwise I would have been completely stripped bare."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing was secretly relieved, as his precious belongings were all stored in the storage ring. The storage bag, being an outdated item in the Spiritual Realm, only contained a small portion of his treasures, just to avoid being completely looted one day.</p><p></p><p>"That ring as well, hand it over."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat's sharp claw gestured again.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Mighty Demonic King, this ring was a token of love given to me by my beloved, who has now departed from me. It is the only memento she left me. I beg Your Majesty to have mercy and allow me to keep this..." Zhu Xing immediately started weaving a story, his eyes even reddening as if he was about to cry, trying to evoke sympathy from the Demonic King.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding spiritual beasts, seeing Zhu Xing's emotional display, couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Give it here. This king does not want your ring." The Crimson Cat said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing inwardly cursed, this fat tiger had no sympathy at all. Feeling the piercing gaze, he swallowed his saliva and handed over the ring.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, the ring was forged by the Junior Alliance Master, and I've left a mark on it, so others won't be able to discover the spatial storage inside." Zhu Xing calmed down a bit. "Esteemed Mighty Demonic King, I beg you to return my token of love, without it, I don't know how I will go on living..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll return it to you." The Crimson Cat nodded, and to Zhu Xing's astonishment, he broke the mark Zhu Xing had left, transferred all the items from the storage ring into the storage bag, and then tossed the ring back to Zhu Xing.</p><p></p><p>"Here you go!" The Crimson Cat said.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing wanted to cry, feeling a deep pain in his heart, but could only show a grateful expression, "Thank you, Demonic King!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." The Crimson Cat nodded.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he sneered, thinking that such simple tricks couldn't deceive him. He then stood up from his throne and approached Zhu Xing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He stood up and went to Zhu Xingzheng's side, hooking his big paw to lift Zhu Xingzheng up, startling him and making his face turn pale.</p><p></p><p>"How much did you pay for the medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat glared at him and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"I know much more than you do, hurry and tell me!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat said in a domineering tone.</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal pills are expensive..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng originally wanted to exaggerate the price of the medicinal pills, but a thought crossed his mind, and his intuition told him that if he inflated the price, it might cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>So he changed his words and said, "Although the medicinal pills are expensive, I do have some connections, and they are buy one get one free. If Your Majesty needs them, I'm willing to help you purchase them!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat understood, the buy one get one free meant this guy had some connections with the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"All of you leave, quickly convey my orders. The demonic tribe has just been established, and there are many things to be done. Snow Wolf, you and the others formulate a set of regulations and submit them to me."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat waved his claws and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The group of spiritual beasts left one by one to arrange various matters, as the demonic tribe had just been established, and things would be quite busy in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat put his arm around Zhu Xingzheng's shoulder, as if embracing a little chick, and said, "Come, let's have a good chat..."</p><p></p><p>Yuxiaolongand Xiaoha also came over.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Swamp State, on the Changqing Pavilion's flying boat on the Golden Lotus Lake, Su Lingxiu and Yue'er were discussing where to go next.</p><p></p><p>"How about we go to Sheng State?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Zhou Empire?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pondered for a while and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Sheng State, the ruling state of the Great Zhou Empire, was the only region in the Spiritual Domain that was not under the control of the Spiritual Sect, and it was comparable to a super Spiritual Sect. Among the eighteen states of the Spiritual Domain, Sheng State was currently the only place that still had a Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Academy of the Great Zhou was established to select geniuses and cultivate powerful experts for the Great Zhou Empire. </p><p></p><p>The Imperial Martial Arts Academy in the capital of the Great Zhou had students who were all exceptionally talented. Even the offspring of the Great Zhou's important ministers and those with superior talents were studying there.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the Great Zhou. It's a good opportunity to visit an old friend."</p><p></p><p>The jade token Ziyun possessed was from the Great Zhou royal family, but it was unknown how she was doing in the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"After going to the Great Zhou, let's go to the Yunshan State next."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Caicai had been in the Taixuan Sect for a long time since entering the Spiritual Domain. It was time for them to gather, after all, they were both from the Inner Domain and had a good relationship.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stay for three more days, and then we'll leave."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu made the decision.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, Li Xuan exhaled. He had finally completely memorized the Dao Pattern on the eleventh page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>"The twelfth page will be even more profound and difficult to memorize."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Book of the Dao opened, and a golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>"Your pet Red Cat has established the Demonic Tribe and proclaimed you as the Demonic Ancestor. You have obtained the True Body of the Demonic Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribe?</p><p></p><p>"This Red Cat is really something!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but exclaim inwardly, and then he became delighted. It was not in vain that he had cultivated the Red Cat so diligently. Obtaining the True Body of the Demonic Ancestor, unlike the Divine Warrior True Body which was similar to a clone and could not match the original, the Demonic Ancestor True Body was on par with his own cultivation level. The stronger the Demonic Tribe, the more powerful the Demonic Ancestor True Body would be, and it could even gather the power of the Demonic Tribe to temporarily boost its own strength.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one limitation - the Demonic Ancestor True Body could only use Demonic Tribe techniques, even its divine abilities would be Demonic Tribe divine abilities. This was a fixed rule.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Demonic Ancestor True Body did not have a constant form, it could be human-shaped or transform into various powerful demonic forms.</p><p></p><p>Any Demonic Tribe technique, the Demonic Ancestor clone would surely master, and its power would be doubled.</p><p></p><p>It also had a unique ability - the Demonic Ancestor True Body could convey its will to all the Demonic Tribe members and even impart guidance and inheritance to its Demonic descendants through a dream-like method.</p><p></p><p>"This Demonic Martial Dao needs to be emphasized. The Red Cat's strength is still not enough, and it lacks the concept of Demonic Divine Abilities. I must pass on more Demonic Techniques and Demonic Divine Abilities to it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, it was time to delve deeper into the Demonic Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>With the Demonic Ancestor True Body, he could now pass on some Demonic Divine Abilities to the Red Cat, allowing it to continue contemplating and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that the big cat I casually caught would have such talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He found that since the Red Cat started learning to read with Xu Mother, its perceptiveness and intelligence had been constantly improving. It was truly a cultured tiger.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation direction of the Demonic Martial Dao has been determined, so I don't need to worry about it. However, I still don't have the Demonic Divine Abilities and such, so I should enrich the Demonic Martial Dao techniques and guide the Red Cat more."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited. If one day he encountered a powerful enemy and suddenly used the Demonic Ancestor True Body, fighting two-on-one, he could easily crush the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made him thrilled!</p><p></p><p>So, Li Xuan temporarily put aside his research on the twelfth page of the Taicangshu and focused on enriching the Demonic Martial Dao, especially the concepts of Demonic Tribe divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the Changqing Pavilion's flying boat rose into the clouds, heading towards the Great Zhou Empire.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds, a dazzling flying boat was flying at a speed comparable to that of Refining Spirit Cultivators, without any urgency.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time, I hope the Red Cat won't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had finally enriched the Demonic Tribe divine abilities and the like, mainly in the form of formation diagrams, as the Red Cat's Demonic Techniques were all derived from these formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>These formation diagrams, Li Xuan had incorporated the laws of Heaven and Earth, and even the last few diagrams had integrated some of the Dao Patterns from the tenth page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Demonic Ancestor True Body, I'll give the Red Cat a dream-like connection to let this big cat witness my abilities."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Xuan was about to use the Demonic Ancestor True Body's power to give the Red Cat a dream-like connection, the Golden Book of the Dao suddenly opened again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Divine Appearance Realm's martial arts, and you have broken through the Divine Appearance Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, his strength surged greatly, as if with a single thought, he could now control the laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through the Divine Appearance Realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, he had finally broken through again.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Appearance Realm, the true ability to control the laws of Heaven and Earth! With his current understanding of the laws of Heaven and Earth, after breaking through the Divine Appearance Realm, he could almost freely manipulate the laws of Heaven and Earth at will.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the breakthrough to the Divine Appearance Realm, he had also gained the ability to comprehend the Dao Patterns above the laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The laws of Heaven and Earth were now clearly visible to Li Xuan, and with a single thought, he could control the laws of Heaven and Earth, transforming them into Divine Appearance martial arts for his own use.</p><p></p><p>And above the laws of Heaven and Earth, he could vaguely sense the more profound Dao Patterns.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, it seemed as if he could see the Dao Patterns corresponding to the tenth page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

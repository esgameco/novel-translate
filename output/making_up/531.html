        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Demon race?</p><p></p><p>This was a contingency left by Tai Cang, specifically targeting him.</p><p></p><p>The so-called might of the demon race actually intimidated the true spirits, causing the true spirits he controlled to gradually break free from his control and show signs of submission to the demon race.</p><p></p><p>This tiger must not be allowed to live! He couldn't help but recall that battle from before, when a similarly striped giant tiger had roared and charged at him, using its powerful Heavenly Tiger might to intimidate the true spirits under his control.</p><p></p><p>Although he had ultimately won that battle, he had also suffered significant losses.</p><p></p><p>"You... must die!" Mu Yao spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to kill Chi Mao, but was entangled by Tian Zi, who was now overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Chi Mao, well done! These untransformed true spirits are definitely a great tonic for your demon race. Quickly subdue them and take them back to be raised, to strengthen the demon race!"</p><p></p><p>Chi Mao raised its head proudly and said, "Haha, this is food sent to my demon race, of course I'll accept it!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The demon might surged. Although it couldn't intimidate and subdue true spirits at the Supreme level, the Divine Lord level true spirits trembled under its demon might, unable to exert their full power, making them easy prey.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Chi Mao raised a tiger paw, demon light blooming as a giant demon seal emerged, projecting beams of demon seals that entered the heads of the true spirits one by one.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The true spirits hit by the demon seals all prostrated themselves, seemingly subdued.</p><p></p><p>Chi Mao was ecstatic at this unexpected windfall.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it sensed an intense killing intent and looked up to see Mu Yao's pair of eyes, dark green and terrifying, with the bone spikes on his head gleaming coldly.</p><p></p><p>That horrifying killing intent was like countless steel needles aimed at him.</p><p></p><p>Chi Mao instinctively shrank its head, after all Mu Yao had the power of a Lord of Heaven and Earth and could kill it as easily as squashing an ant.</p><p></p><p>But then it straightened its tiger back, even glaring back fiercely, its saber pointing arrogantly at Mu Yao as it said contemptuously, "What are you staring at, you piece of trash? You're already ugly and disgusting looking, how dare you glare at me?"</p><p></p><p>He was the great tiger raised by the Dao Ancestor, what was a mere Mu Yao? Mu Yao was so angry his eyes turned even greener, killing intent surging, but Tian Zi gave him no opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Chi Mao, well done, keep going!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Zi was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Chi Mao was enthusiastic as it continued projecting demon seals, while Yu Xiaolong and Little Ha sealed up the prostrated true spirits one by one and threw them into the realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Chi Mao had subdued some true spirits, the number of untransformed true spirits driven by Mu Yao was simply too great, and the Great Wilderness Realm side was still at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, true spirits would charge at the realm barrier, triggering strikes from the Heavenly Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>"Transforming true spirits into demons? Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched the changes outside the realm with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought the demon race could subdue true spirits so easily? This was an unexpected boon.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've taken action. Since it's so lively outside the realm, I'll go join in the fun. It's a good opportunity to hone my martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and headed straight for outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go join in the fun too!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping raised his spear and also rushed towards the battlefield outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother and Fifth Junior Brother have gone too, so I'll go join in as well. I'll just treat the injuries of those martial artists and help them recover."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited as she led Yue'er and Zhou Ying to head out as well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she wasn't going to participate in the battle.</p><p></p><p>She was going to treat injuries and save people, helping martial artists recover their strength. It was time to let the realm's powerful figures witness the wonders of alchemical medical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After a round of intense fighting, many martial artists had been seriously injured, including those at the Supreme realm, and were recuperating inside the realm barrier, unable to continue fighting.</p><p></p><p>Even some Realm Lords had been injured and expended a great deal of energy, but could only grit their teeth and persevere.</p><p></p><p>After all, if a Realm Lord retreated, the unrestrained Realm Lord level true spirits would cause a huge impact and could potentially cause the battle situation to instantly deteriorate.</p><p></p><p>The powerful fighters in the midst of battle suddenly saw a god-like figure walk out from within the realm.</p><p></p><p>A giant hundreds of zhang tall, his whole body shining with golden light, as if clad in armor, or as if surrounded by surging golden waves.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Heavenly God Meng Chong, he's already become so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's appearance immediately caused exclamations.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao's expression changed again as he looked at Meng Chong with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial arts is this? Did Tai Cang leave behind such powerful martial arts within the realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat shocked, "If Tai Cang hadn't died and lived until now, how strong would his power be?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Mu Yao couldn't help but admire Tai Cang. If Tai Cang hadn't died, even the Untransformed Divine Palace probably wouldn't be able to deal with him now.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong threw out a punch, directly blasting apart a true spirit! Seeing such a domineering and fierce scene, Mu Yao was even more shocked - this physical body was even more terrifying than untransformed true spirits! Meng Chong charged straight into the group of true spirits. Divine Lord level true spirits simply couldn't withstand a single punch from him. At this moment he was exerting his full power, freely displaying the might of his physical body martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong took action, all the martial artists, even the Realm Lords in the midst of battle, were deeply shocked. This physical body, this savage power, was truly terrifying to the extreme! If they were at the same level, could they even withstand one of his savage punches?</p><p></p><p>Hum! At this moment, another figure appeared, holding a sharp spear. As this spear emerged, many Divine Lord realm martial artists suddenly felt their souls tremble.</p><p></p><p>Even though this spear was not aimed at them, just looking at it made their souls uncomfortable!</p><p></p><p>"This is... martial arts targeting the soul and consciousness?" </p><p></p><p>Mu Yao was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as he looked towards the Great Wilderness Realm, a trace of wariness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The changes in this realm had exceeded expectations!</p><p></p><p>As soon as Jiang Buping made his move, although not as savagely fierce as Meng Chong, spear light bloomed with each step he took, instantly annihilating the consciousness of untransformed true spirits one after another, leaving only their physical bodies behind.</p><p></p><p>"Let me help you recover a bit!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, green light bloomed as a beautiful young woman stepped forward, seeming to leave behind endless vitality wherever she passed.</p><p></p><p>Her delicate fingers pointed, green needle light appearing and piercing into the body of an injured martial artist. In an instant, that martial artist's injuries were healed and even their expended energy was recovered.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, pills scattered out one after another.</p><p></p><p>Following that, several more green needle lights and pills landed on a Realm Lord who had expended a great deal of energy. In just a moment, that Realm Lord's energy was recovered and they were revitalized, beating back that true spirit.</p><p></p><p>What shocked the martial artists even more was that wherever the young woman passed, the vitality of true spirits was extinguished, as if their vitality had been transferred to the injured, instantly healing them.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the young woman condensed an alchemy furnace in mid-air, extracting the vitality and essence blood of true spirits to refine into pills.</p><p></p><p>The originally injured martial artists who had no fighting strength were now shouting excitedly as they enthusiastically rejoined the battle, not sparing themselves at all, completely unafraid of being injured.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a severed arm</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Minor injury!" A warrior's arm was severed, but the young woman waved her hand and a pill fell into his mouth, transferring the vitality of a spirit and injecting it into the warrior's body.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, the warrior with the severed arm actually grew a new arm.</p><p></p><p>Such a miraculous scene left the crowd of warriors shocked. Even Old Xiao, Tai Miao, and Yu Yao were greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>They knew Su Lingxiu was extraordinary, with marvelous skills in alchemy, but they never imagined she could reach such an incredible level.</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being the Dao Ancestor's true disciple!" Old Xiao sighed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think back to that battle long ago. If Su Lingxiu had been there then, if her strength had been comparable to a World Lord's, the outcome might have been different.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao wasn't the only one thinking this. Tai Miao, Tai He, Tai Kun, Mei Wu and others also thought that if an alchemist as powerful as Su Lingxiu had been present in that battle back then, the result may have been different.</p><p></p><p>Among the World Lords back then, the Qing Ling World Lord's true form was the Qing Ling Jade Bamboo. Although she had the ability to help the wounded recover, she couldn't do what Su Lingxiu could, and there were some limitations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Qing Ling World Lord also had to face powerful enemies herself and couldn't refine pills. She relied on her own abilities to treat others and restore their energy, which caused considerable drain on herself.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was different. Her pills were mystical. She could refine pills on the battlefield or prepare them in advance, allowing people to use pills for treatment and replenishment during major battles.</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking was Su Lingxiu's ability to deprive vitality and reverse life and death.</p><p></p><p>Directly reversing and transferring the vitality of unconverted spirits to help the wounded recover - this kind of technique was beyond everyone's understanding.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Red Cat made Mu Yao's killing intent surge, sensing the potential threat. But Su Lingxiu's appearance made his heart sink even more.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Red Cat, Su Lingxiu was clearly an even greater threat, a major problem!</p><p></p><p>"This woman must die!" Mu Yao thought with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"What backup plans has Tai Cang prepared? If given more time to grow, once new World Lords appear, it will be even harder to swallow up the Tai Cang World."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao remained expressionless as he continued to fight with Tian Zi.</p><p></p><p>The bone spikes on his head emitted a faint glow, as if calling out to something, or transmitting some kind of message.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao knew clearly that he couldn't break away from Tian Zi to kill Su Lingxiu, so he could only use a hidden trump card.</p><p></p><p>If Su Lingxiu didn't die, he wouldn't be at ease!</p><p></p><p>Originally the momentum had diminished, with injured warriors losing their fighting ability. But with Su Lingxiu's appearance, the momentum suddenly surged. Injured warriors who had retreated from the battlefield regained their fighting strength and rejoined the battle against the spirits.</p><p></p><p>Especially those few Realm Lords - they had already exhausted themselves greatly and couldn't hold on much longer. But under Su Lingxiu's treatment, their exhaustion was recovering. They became energized again, forcing back the spirits they were fighting.</p><p></p><p>As one side waxed and the other waned, the unconverted spirits that had been driven here no longer possessed their initial fierce attacking power.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao looked towards Meng Chong and Jiang Buping. These two were also extremely talented. Though their strength didn't seem great, their attacks carried overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>"They all must die!" Mu Yao thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This probing attack against the Tai Cang World was a very wise decision, allowing us to learn about some of Tai Cang's arrangements and backup plans in advance."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>The bone spikes on his head continued to glow, with invisible waves vibrating.</p><p></p><p>"Exhilarating!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shouted as he smashed a spirit to pieces with one punch, his blood boiling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>This was the true fighting spirit of the physical body martial way.</p><p></p><p>He had never experienced such an intense and satisfying battle. This time he fully displayed the ferocity and dominance of the physical body martial way.</p><p></p><p>Although the spirits were numerous, Meng Chong wasn't afraid of being surrounded at all. With every move, he killed spirit after spirit, even completely ignoring their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Spirits pounced on his body but couldn't inflict any injuries. Instead, they were directly smashed to pieces by him.</p><p></p><p>A spirit comparable to the Supreme level lunged at him.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" A Supreme level warrior exclaimed with a change of expression.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a low roar. A giant image appeared above him, as if he had instantly transformed into a towering giant. He grabbed the sky with both hands and smashed it down violently.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Sky-Holding Earth-Destroying!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Such a shocking and violent scene once again astounded the many warriors.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of fierce martial way is this?!"</p><p></p><p>With one strike, that spirit was instantly smashed to death!</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao's pupils contracted as he stared at Meng Chong in shock. Although Meng Chong's current strength was far inferior to his own, that strike just now was extremely terrifying. Even he could sense the powerful killing force contained within it.</p><p></p><p>"If he were at the same level as me, that strike would be enough to completely annihilate me!" Mu Yao thought in horror.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong's strength were close to his own, Mu Yao knew he wouldn't be able to block such a violent strike. He would be directly smashed to ashes!</p><p></p><p>"This youth also cannot be allowed to live!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao couldn't help but look towards the Tai Cang World again. To think it had produced one prodigy after another. If Tai Cang didn't die, how terrifying would this world's strength become?</p><p></p><p>"Are these the powerful techniques Tai Cang researched before dying?" Mu Yao's heart grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>If Tai Cang hadn't died back then, its strength now would likely have surpassed that figure from the Immutable Divine Palace!</p><p></p><p>"We can't continue to give the Tai Cang World more time to grow."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao felt they had to speed up their plans. What if there were other hidden prodigies in the world who hadn't made a move yet? If these prodigies broke through to the World Lord level, it would definitely pose a huge challenge and threat to the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Just based on Meng Chong's strike earlier, if he were already a World Lord, the power he could unleash - apart from that one person in the Immutable Divine Palace, the other experts of the same level in the Immutable Divine Palace probably couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, we came to probe this time. Now that these geniuses have come out, they shouldn't think about returning to their world. They must be killed here."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Mu Yao felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>He continuously swung the whip in his hand, making cracking sounds. Those unconverted spirits seemed to be driven by it, becoming even more agitated and vicious. They let out roars as their momentum for attacking the world suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>From the Immutable Land, unconverted spirits continued to arrive endlessly, joining the ranks attacking the world. Besides the spirits driven by Mu Yao, there were also some that originally wanted to enter the world. Sensing an opportunity now, they joined in as well.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many of these unconverted spirits. How long do we have to keep killing them?" Su Lingxiu said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many spirits he drives here, there's a limit. We'll just keep killing them. I don't believe the spirits he's driving can truly be endless and unkillable!" Meng Chong said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

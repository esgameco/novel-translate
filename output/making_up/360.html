        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Due to Xu Yan's return, Da Huang's strength would inevitably reach a new level, and the path ahead was broad. In a few years, Da Huang's power would certainly not be inferior to the Spirit Realm's.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts were confident and filled with determination. </p><p></p><p>When Da Huang became strong, they would make the Spirit Realm martial artists know that Da Huang could not be insulted!</p><p></p><p>At Duke Du's mansion, Du Yuying returned with Cuier.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was her home, and her father and grandfather doted on her very much.</p><p></p><p>Duke Du was overjoyed. Although he held a prominent position in Da Huang, his strength was ultimately not top-tier, and he relied entirely on Du Yuying's connections.</p><p></p><p>Now that Du Yuying had returned, bringing back treasures and the cultivation path pointed out by Xu Yan, it meant that Duke Du's mansion's status would be completely secured.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that basically all the powerful experts in Da Huang knew about the relationship between Du Yuying and Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother directly treated her as a daughter-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was busy, even Yuer and Cai Linger were curiously walking around various parts of Da Huang, looking at the different customs and local conditions of the inner domain compared to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Xuan was walking in the clouds above Da Huang. Wherever he went, he would stir the laws of heaven and earth, and even mobilize the power of the Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>He enhanced the spiritual energy of Da Huang's heaven and earth, and made the power of the laws of heaven and earth more active.</p><p></p><p>Thus changing the current situation of Da Huang's sparse spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In order not to cause some fluctuations, these changes were all happening slowly. The spiritual energy would not increase instantly, but would increase gradually. After years of accumulation, the concentration of spiritual energy would not be inferior to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What hard work this is!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Even with his strength, doing this kind of thing was very tiring.</p><p></p><p>"With Da Huang's spiritual energy increased, the speed of cultivating to the Divine Power realm will increase. I wonder what divine powers the Da Huang martial artists will develop.</p><p></p><p>"When there are more Divine Power realm martial artists in Da Huang, what feedback will that bring."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given Da Huang's current development momentum, the first Divine Power realm martial artist would probably be Xu Junhe, followed possibly by Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>Other non-orthodox Da Huang martial artists might not be able to develop divine powers, and even if they did, it would likely be pseudo-divine powers. He directly excluded them.</p><p></p><p>"Da Huang still has some geniuses, and their potential is not bad. With increased spiritual energy, the chances of producing geniuses in the future will also increase."</p><p></p><p>From south to north, then from north to east, Li Xuan completed his deployment and sighed in his heart, "This kind of hard work, once is enough."</p><p></p><p>Difficult tasks were always delegated to disciples, but unfortunately his disciple's strength was not enough, so he had to do it himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the border wilderness, in the Wu Kingdom's royal palace.</p><p></p><p>In that palace, in that stone house, suddenly there came the sound of muttering.</p><p></p><p>"Who is changing the situation of heaven and earth? Who is stirring the laws of heaven and earth, who is mobilizing the power of the Dao principles?"</p><p></p><p>"Who would come here near this border wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, could it be enemies? Are they coming for me?"</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to hide, yes, hide, I can't let anyone discover me, absolutely can't let anyone discover me. Play dead, yes, play dead!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I play dead, no one can discover me. That's what I'll do!"</p><p></p><p>The muttering voice disappeared, then returned to silence.</p><p></p><p>In the Wu Kingdom's royal palace, the Wu Emperor, one of the two emperors of Da Huang, rarely returned.</p><p></p><p>Although he only possessed nominal symbolic power and did not have real authority in Da Huang, he was after all one of the two emperors of Da Huang. His status was revered, and the Da Huang cabinet also needed to respect him as one of the two emperors under the rules.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan, who controlled the cabinet, never overstepped etiquette towards the Wu Emperor and Qi Emperor. This also meant that no one dared to propose abolishing the two emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor had a very good impression of Guo Rongshan in his heart. With such a revered status, almost having the final say in Da Huang, no one would or dared to defy him.</p><p></p><p>Those powerful experts, especially the Da Huang honorary powerful experts, all only obeyed Guo Rongshan's orders.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Guo Rongshan still maintained a respectful attitude towards him and the Qi Emperor, neither arrogant nor impatient, quite having the demeanor of a great virtuous sage.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Guo Rongshan was doing this to achieve the name of great virtue or for some other reason, the Wu Emperor was very satisfied with this in any case.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he and the Qi Emperor would never really put on airs as the two emperors of Da Huang in front of Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Most of their time was devoted to martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The current Wu Emperor had just barely broken through to the Profound Connection realm. After stabilizing his strength, he returned to his old home in the Wu Kingdom for a visit.</p><p></p><p>Walking with leisurely steps, head held high, the smug Wu Emperor entered this palace and went into this stone house.</p><p></p><p>"I have become a martial artist, surprising, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor laughed arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"You've always been unwilling to pass on martial arts, making various excuses to avoid it. Now that I've become a martial artist with very strong power, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The stone house was quiet, and that mysterious voice did not appear.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor frowned and said in a deep voice, "Come out, are you dead?"</p><p></p><p>But there was no response from the stone house for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor felt a bit depressed. He had come to show off and provoke that mysterious voice, but it was gone?</p><p></p><p>"This isn't right, this mysterious voice has always existed, how could it suddenly disappear? Could it really be dead?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The small stone house and that mysterious voice were the most confidential matters of the Wu Kingdom's royal family, known only to the current Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Do you find it unbelievable and are afraid of being mocked by me, so you're not speaking? Come out, don't you want to know how I became a martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was unwilling to give up and continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what he said or how he tried to provoke the other party, the stone house remained quiet without any response.</p><p></p><p>"Has it really disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor walked out of the stone house with a frown, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, who knows what's going on with this thing."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, the goal of showing off not achieved, he felt some regret in his heart, but it wasn't a very urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>After staying at his old home in the Wu Kingdom for a few days, the Wu Emperor returned to Da Huang City.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned, he learned of the news of Xu Yan's return from the Spirit Realm, and that he seemed to have given those honorary experts opportunities and bestowed miraculous pills and spiritual objects.</p><p></p><p>"Although I am one of the two emperors of Da Huang with a revered status, such treasures are difficult to obtain..."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Should he open his mouth to ask Guo Rongshan for treasures needed for martial arts cultivation? What if it caused Guo Rongshan's displeasure, thinking his appetite had grown, and alienated and isolated him? Wouldn't that put him in a difficult position? The Wu Emperor was worried in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He knew that to surpass the Qi Emperor, he could only obtain precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Exchange, I can exchange!" </p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor's eyes suddenly lit up, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Then he hesitated again: "That great expert stayed in the border wilderness for some time, wouldn't he know about the mysterious voice in that small stone house?" The great expert left the border wilderness and went to the Spirit Realm, and now that voice has also disappeared, could it be related to this?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor became conflicted.</p><p></p><p>He believed that the valuable item he had for exchange was that mysterious stone house.</p><p></p><p>But what if the great expert already knew about the existence of the stone house?</p><p></p><p>For a time, the Wu Emperor was conflicted and couldn't make a decision. He became agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Little Wu, come fight a battle!"</p><p></p><p>The arrogant voice of the Qi Emperor came.</p><p></p><p>The two emperors of Da Huang had to determine who was stronger and who was weaker. When they had nothing to do, they would start</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were competing with each other, but neither could gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"No time!" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was in a bad mood and refused immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid? I'm stronger than you now. Come let me beat you up for fun!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi persisted.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, old Qi, if it weren't for Minister Guo remembering your past relationship and giving you special treatment, how could you fight me to a draw?" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu sneered. Since Emperor Qi insisted on a fight, they might as well have one. It would be a good way to vent his frustrations.</p><p></p><p>"I earned that through my own abilities!" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The two emperors of Dahuang began their duel in the palace square. For the palace guards, this was already a common sight.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after a round of fighting, Emperor Wu lost!</p><p></p><p>His face was bruised and swollen, with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qi, you... how is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu's face was full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi was smug, raising his head and saying: "I have a close relationship with Xu Yan. This time I received guidance from Xu Yan and was gifted treasures. How could you be a match for me?</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am the leader of the two emperors of Dahuang!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi was very pleased. He felt the smartest thing he ever did was letting Xu Yan enter the harem to view the beauties back then.</p><p></p><p>Supposedly, Xu Yan was tempering his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>As for why he needed to temper his mind in the harem, one can only say that the ways of geniuses are always different from others.</p><p></p><p>It was because of this connection that when Xu Yan returned this time, Emperor Qi shamelessly sought an audience, reminiscing about how Xu Yan had maintained a pure state of mind in his harem back then, unmoved by beauty.</p><p></p><p>His purpose was to seek benefits.</p><p></p><p>After receiving guidance and benefits from Xu Yan, his strength increased, so Emperor Qi came to beat up Emperor Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I am the number one emperor of Dahuang, how can you compare to me?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi left triumphantly. </p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was in a terrible state. Finally gritting his teeth, he decided to seek out a master to gain benefits! He had to get his revenge!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been busy for half a month before finally returning to Canglan Island. He sat in a chair and continued working on his grand martial arts project.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ability Martial Canon was still being compiled.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent martial arts cultivation was also being continuously improved.</p><p></p><p>The time for the Divine Bridge to open was getting closer, which meant the time to leave was also approaching.</p><p></p><p>This departure, who knows when he would return to Dahuang again.</p><p></p><p>Everything had been arranged properly. Dahuang's development was on the right track, and there would be no safety issues. Xu Yan could explore with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er and Yue'er had also returned.</p><p></p><p>"We'll be returning to the Spirit Realm soon."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao looked at the plants and trees on Canglan Island with a somewhat reluctant expression.</p><p></p><p>The red cat was lying next to Xu's mother in the spirit fruit forest, watching her fiddle with formation diagrams while continuing to teach him knowledge like recognizing characters.</p><p></p><p>This parting, who knows how many years it would be before they return.</p><p></p><p>On this day, unexpectedly, an unexpected person came seeking an audience.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu!</p><p></p><p>He didn't come to see Xu Yan, nor to see Meng Chong and the others, but to seek an audience with Li Xuan, the master.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, shall I refuse his request for an audience?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let him come."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and decided to let Emperor Wu come over to see what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>The reason for seeing Emperor Wu was that Li Xuan thought of the Taicang Book, which was discovered in Emperor Wu's royal treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a kind of fate.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu nervously and excitedly followed behind Xu Junhe, step by step, coming before the master.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, he prostrated himself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu respectfully prostrated.</p><p></p><p>"Rise. What brings you to seek an audience with me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu raised his head, glanced at Xu Junhe beside him, and seemed hesitant.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Xu Junhe's mouth twitched. Was this Emperor Wu coming to tattle? He was even afraid of him hearing? Xu Junhe bowed to Li Xuan and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "Speak. What matter is so secret?"</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Master, there is a secret place in my Wu Kingdom palace, a small stone house, which is very peculiar. There are mysterious voices inside..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu didn't hesitate and revealed the secret of the small stone house.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was initially unconcerned, listening with a smile the whole time, seeming uninterested in this secret, or as if he already knew about it.</p><p></p><p>In reality, his heart was not calm.</p><p></p><p>A small stone house with mysterious voices?</p><p></p><p>To think the borderlands concealed such a mysterious place, it likely involved the secrets of Taicang! "The Taicang Book appeared in Wu Kingdom's treasures, could it be related to this mysterious voice? Could it be the owner of the Taicang Book?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Taicang Book's owner must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>But from what Emperor Wu described, that mysterious voice seemed unable to leave the stone house and didn't possess attacking power.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be restrained, or even in a sealed state.</p><p></p><p>"...However, recently that voice seems to have disappeared. No matter how I call, there's no response."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu finished nervously, while secretly observing the master's expression.</p><p></p><p>The master sat there, his expression calm, always smiling, without surprise or astonishment, as if he had known all along.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed! The master knows. How could the secrets of the borderlands escape the master's knowledge?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu felt somewhat dejected in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's your Wu Kingdom's secret, then keep it well guarded. There's no need to speak of it to others."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waited for him to finish, then said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. This junior understands!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was utterly dejected in his heart. The master indeed knew about these so-called secrets. He was telling him that since it was an ancestral secret, he shouldn't spread it around.</p><p></p><p>He also saw through him, that revealing the secret was for gaining benefits.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Emperor Wu felt somewhat ashamed, and also regretted this decision, leaving a bad impression on the master!</p><p></p><p>"Take these and cultivate well!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and a small booklet and a bottle of pills fell in front of Emperor Wu.</p><p></p><p>The small booklet was naturally a martial arts method, a very simple martial arts method, but for martial artists like Emperor Wu, it was extremely powerful. Once successfully cultivated, one's strength would surely surge among those of the same level.</p><p></p><p>The pills were also to aid cultivation, not low in grade, sufficient for Emperor Wu's cultivation needs.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu's aptitude couldn't be said to be poor, but it also wasn't particularly good, not as good as Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi. With this martial arts method and pills, he still wouldn't be able to catch up to Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master! Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes even became moist. The master was indeed a master, with a heart as vast as heaven and earth, not minding his little schemes, and instead satisfying his small desires.</p><p></p><p>Accepting the small booklet and pills, Emperor Wu respectfully kowtowed and said: "This junior will certainly remember the master's teachings, guard the secret with my life, and absolutely not reveal even a bit!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, expressing satisfaction with his attitude.</p><p></p><p>After this matter, Li Xuan believed Emperor Wu would not mention the mysterious stone house to others again.</p><p></p><p>As for silencing him, Li Xuan disdained doing such a thing for this kind of secret. Moreover, with Emperor Wu guarding it, it would be even harder for outsiders to discover the secret within the mysterious stone house.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

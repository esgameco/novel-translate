            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation, with the return of Xu Yan, will certainly take a step up in strength, and the path ahead is wide open. In a few years, the strength of the Great Desolation will certainly not be inferior to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures all have confidence in their hearts and are holding their breath.</p><p></p><p>When the Great Desolation becomes powerful, it must let the warriors of the Spirit Realm know that our Great Desolation cannot be humiliated!</p><p></p><p>The Du Mansion, Du Yuying has returned with Cui'er.</p><p></p><p>This is, after all, her home, where her father and grandfather dote on her.</p><p></p><p>Duke Du was overjoyed, although he holds a prominent position in the Great Desolation, his strength is ultimately not at the top tier, relying solely on his relationship with Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Now that Du Yuying has returned, she has also brought back treasures, and the cultivation path that Xu Yan pointed out, which means that the status of the Du Mansion will be completely consolidated.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, most of the powerful figures in the Great Desolation know the relationship between Du Yuying and Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother directly treats her as a daughter-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is busy, even Yue'er and Cai Lingr are curious and wandering around the Great Desolation, looking at the different customs and people between the Inner Domain and the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he is walking in the clouds of the Great Desolation, and wherever he goes, he will activate the laws of heaven and earth, even mobilizing the power of the Tao of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He has enhanced the spiritual mechanisms of the Great Desolation, making the power of the laws of heaven and earth more active.</p><p></p><p>In order not to cause any disturbances, these changes are slowly taking place, the spiritual energy will not increase instantly, but will slowly increase, and after years, the spiritual energy density will not be inferior to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is really a tiring job!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Even with his strength, doing this kind of thing is still very tiring.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy of the Great Desolation has increased, the speed of cultivation to the Spiritual Realm will also increase, I wonder what spiritual techniques the warriors of the Great Desolation will produce.</p><p></p><p>"With more Spiritual Realm warriors in the Great Desolation, what kind of feedback will it bring?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given the current development trend of the Great Desolation, the first Spiritual Realm warrior is most likely Xu Junhe, followed by Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>The other non-orthodox warriors of the Great Desolation may not be able to produce spiritual techniques, and what they produce may be false spiritual techniques, which he directly excludes.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Desolation still has some geniuses, and the potential is not bad either. With the increase in spiritual energy, the chance of producing geniuses in the future will also increase."</p><p></p><p>From south to north, and then from north to east, Li Xuan completed the deployment, and sighed, "It's best to do this kind of tiring work just once."</p><p></p><p>The tiring work has always been done by his disciples, but unfortunately their strength is not enough, so he can only do it himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Borderlands, in the palace of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In that palace, in that stone house, a murmuring voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Who is changing the momentum of heaven and earth? Who is activating the laws of heaven and earth, who is mobilizing the power of the Tao?"</p><p></p><p>"Who would come to this Borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, is it the enemy? Are they coming for me?"</p><p></p><p>"I have to hide, yes, hide, I can't let anyone find me, absolutely can't let anyone find me, play dead, yes, play dead!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I play dead, no one can find me, that's what I'll do!"</p><p></p><p>The murmuring voice disappeared, and then fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>In the Wu Kingdom's palace, one of the two Emperors of the Great Desolation, the Wu Emperor, has returned for a rare visit.</p><p></p><p>Although he only has nominal symbolic status and does not have real power in the Great Desolation, he is still one of the two Emperors of the Great Desolation, with a lofty status, and the Great Desolation Cabinet still needs to respect him as one of the two Emperors according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan, who manages the Cabinet, treats both the Wu Emperor and the Qi Emperor with great respect, never overstepping the etiquette, which also makes no one dare to propose the dismissal of the two Emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor has a very good impression of Guo Rongshan, whose status in the Great Desolation is almost unquestionable, and no one dares to disobey his orders. Those powerful figures, especially the powerful figures supported by the Great Desolation, all only listen to Guo Rongshan's commands.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Guo Rongshan still maintains a respectful attitude towards him and the Qi Emperor, neither arrogant nor complacent, with the bearing of a great sage.</p><p></p><p>Whether Guo Rongshan is doing this for the sake of establishing a reputation for great virtue, or for some other reason, the Wu Emperor is very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he and the Qi Emperor will never really put on airs of the two Emperors of the Great Desolation in front of Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, they are immersed in cultivating the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The current Wu Emperor has just barely broken through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm, and after stabilizing his strength, he has come back to his hometown of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Walking with a leisurely pace, holding his head high, the proud Wu Emperor entered this palace and entered this stone house.</p><p></p><p>"I, have become a warrior, isn't it surprising?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor laughed arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"You have always been unwilling to pass on the martial dao, making all kinds of excuses to avoid it. Now that I have become a warrior, my strength is strong, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The stone house was silent, and the mysterious voice did not appear.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor frowned, and spoke in a deep voice, "Come out, are you dead?"</p><p></p><p>But there was no response in the stone house for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor felt a little frustrated. He had come to show off and provoke that mysterious voice, but it was gone?</p><p></p><p>"That's not right, this mysterious voice has always existed, how could it suddenly disappear? Could it really be dead?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The small stone house and that mysterious voice were the most confidential matters of the Wu Kingdom's royal family, only the current Wu Emperor knew about this secret.</p><p></p><p>"Are you feeling unbelievable and afraid of being mocked by me, so you won't speak? Come out, don't you want to know how I became a warrior?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was unwilling, and continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what he said or how he provoked the other party, the stone house remained silent, without any response.</p><p></p><p>"Has it really disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor frowned and walked out of the stone house, with a puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I don't know what's going on with this thing."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, the purpose of his boasting was not achieved, and he felt a little regretful, but it was not a very important matter.</p><p></p><p>After staying in the hometown of the Wu Kingdom for a few days, the Wu Emperor returned to the Great Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned, he learned the news that Xu Yan had returned from the Spirit Realm, and had bestowed mysterious elixirs and spiritual treasures to those supported powers.</p><p></p><p>"Although I am one of the two Emperors of the Great Desolation, with a lofty status, such precious treasures are still difficult for me to obtain..."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Should he ask Guo Rongshan for the cultivation resources he needs? If that makes Guo Rongshan feel that his appetite has become too big and estranges and isolates him, wouldn't his situation become difficult?  The Wu Emperor was full of worries.</p><p></p><p>He knows that the only way to surpass the Qi Emperor is to obtain precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Exchange, I can exchange something!"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor suddenly had a bright look in his eyes, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>But then he hesitated again: "That senior has been in the Borderlands for some time, could he not know about the mysterious voice in that small stone house?" Since the senior left the Borderlands and went to the Spirit Realm, and now the voice has also disappeared, is there a connection?</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was conflicted.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the valuable exchange item would be that mysterious stone house.</p><p></p><p>But what if the senior already knew about the existence of the stone house?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the Wu Emperor was conflicted and couldn't make a decision, and became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Wu boy, come and fight me!"</p><p></p><p>The arrogant voice of the Qi Emperor came.</p><p></p><p>The two Emperors of the Great Desolation must determine who is stronger, and when they have nothing to do, they just start fighting.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two emperors continued to compete, but neither was able to gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"I'm busy!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor was feeling irritated and rejected the request bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid? My strength is superior to yours, come and let me beat you up to my heart's content!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Emperor was persistent and unyielding.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, old Qi, if it weren't for Lord Guo taking care of you as a fellow ruler, allowing you special treatment, how could you be an equal match for me?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor sneered. Since Qi Emperor was so insistent on fighting, then let them fight. It would be a good way to vent his irritated mood.</p><p></p><p>"It's because of my own capabilities that I've obtained this!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Emperor said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The two great emperors of the Vast Wilderness began to duel in the palace square, which was already a common sight for the palace guards.</p><p></p><p>After the fierce battle, Wu Emperor was defeated!</p><p></p><p>His face was bruised and swollen, looking completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qi, how... how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor was utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Emperor was extremely smug, holding his head high and saying, "I am intimate with Xu Yan, and this time I obtained guidance and treasures from him. How could you be my match?"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I shall be the supreme emperor of the Vast Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Emperor was very pleased, feeling that the best decision he had made was to let Xu Yan enter the palace to admire the beauties.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Xu Yan was there to cultivate his mind.</p><p></p><p>As for why he needed to cultivate his mind in the palace, one could only say that the actions of a prodigy were always different from the norm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this relationship that when Xu Yan returned, Qi Emperor shamelessly sought an audience with him, praising Xu Yan's pure mind that was not tempted by the beauties in his palace. </p><p></p><p>The purpose was to ask for benefits.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining guidance and benefits from Xu Yan, with his strength enhanced, Qi Emperor came to beat up Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I am the supreme emperor of the Vast Wilderness, how could you compare to me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Emperor left in a very smug manner.</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor was completely dejected. In the end, he gritted his teeth and decided to seek a powerful expert to obtain benefits! He must regain his position!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been busy for half a month and finally returned to Canglan Island, sitting in a chair and continuing to compile his great martial arts work.</p><p></p><p>The divine martial arts classic was still being written.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent martial arts cultivation was also continuously being perfected.</p><p></p><p>The time for the divine bridge to open was getting closer, which meant the time to leave was also approaching.</p><p></p><p>This departure, he did not know in what year or month he would return to the Vast Wilderness again.</p><p></p><p>Everything had been arranged, the development of the Vast Wilderness had been put on the right track, and the safety would not be a problem, so Xu Yan could venture out with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Cailingr and Yue'er had also returned.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time to return to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Yunmiaomiao looked at the grass and trees on Canglan Island, with a somewhat reluctant expression.</p><p></p><p>The red cat was lying in the spirit fruit grove next to Xu's mother, watching her work on the formation diagram while continuing to teach him to read and other knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This time of parting, they did not know when they would return.</p><p></p><p>On this day, an unexpected visitor came to seek an audience.</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor!</p><p></p><p>He did not come to see Xu Yan or Meng Chong, but to seek an audience with the high-level expert Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should I go refuse his request for an audience?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let him come in."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and decided to let Wu Emperor come, to see what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Xuan wanted to see Wu Emperor was that he had found the Taiyang Book in Wu Emperor's imperial treasures. It was a matter of fate, in a way.</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor, nervous and excited, followed closely behind Xu Junhe and came before the high-level expert.</p><p></p><p>He prostrated himself on the ground with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to the high-level expert!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor respectfully kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up, what is it you seek me for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor raised his head and looked at Xu Junhe beside him, seeming a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's mouth twitched, was this Wu Emperor coming to tattle? Still afraid of him hearing?</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe saluted and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "Speak, what secret matter is it?"</p><p></p><p>"To reply to the high-level expert, in my Wu Palace there is a secret place, a small stone house, very peculiar, with a mysterious voice inside..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor did not hesitate and revealed the secrets of the small stone house.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was initially indifferent, listening with a smile, as if he did not care much about this secret, or as if he already knew about it.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was becoming restless.</p><p></p><p>A small stone house, a mysterious voice? </p><p></p><p>The remote border actually hid such a mysterious place, it was likely related to the secrets of the Taiyang Book! "The Taiyang Book appeared in Wu's treasures, is it related to this mysterious voice? Could he be the owner of the Taiyang Book?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the owner of the Taiyang Book must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>But from what Wu Emperor described, the mysterious voice seemed unable to leave the stone house and did not have the ability to attack.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be constrained, even in a state of sealing.</p><p></p><p>"...But recently, that voice seems to have disappeared, no matter how I call, it does not respond."</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor finished anxiously, secretly observing the high-level expert's expression.</p><p></p><p>The high-level expert sat there, his expression calm and always smiling, without any surprise or astonishment, as if he had already known about it.</p><p></p><p>"As expected! The high-level expert knows, the secrets of the remote border, how could they be hidden from him."</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor felt a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Since it is a secret of your Wu Kingdom, then keep it well, no need to tell others."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said after he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, high-level expert, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor was very disappointed, the high-level expert indeed knew about these so-called secrets, this was telling him that since it was an ancestral secret, he should not reveal it.</p><p></p><p>He also saw through him, that he wanted to reveal the secret in order to gain benefits.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Wu Emperor felt a bit ashamed and regretted his decision, feeling that he had left a bad impression on the high-level expert!</p><p></p><p>"Take it and cultivate well!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and a small booklet and a bottle of elixir fell in front of Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The small booklet was naturally a martial arts technique, a very simple one, but for cultivators like Wu Emperor, it was extremely powerful. Once he successfully cultivated it, his strength would certainly surge in the same realm.</p><p></p><p>The elixir was also to assist his cultivation, its grade was not low, enough for Wu Emperor's cultivation needs.</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor's talent was not bad, but not particularly good either, not as good as Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi. With this martial arts technique and elixir, he would still be far behind Xu Junhe and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, high-level expert! Thank you, high-level expert!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Emperor was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were even moist, the high-level expert was truly extraordinary, with a broad mind, not caring about his little selfish thoughts, but instead fulfilling his small wishes.</p><p></p><p>Taking the booklet and elixir, Wu Emperor respectfully kowtowed and said, "I will definitely remember the high-level expert's teachings, guard the secret firmly, and absolutely not reveal a single trace of it!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, satisfied with his attitude.</p><p></p><p>After this matter, he believed Wu Emperor would no longer mention the mysterious stone house to anyone else.</p><p></p><p>As for killing to silence him, Li Xuan disdained to do such a thing just for a secret, especially since Wu Emperor was guarding it, the mysterious stone house would be even less likely to be discovered by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

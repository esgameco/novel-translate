        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The four people and the turtle left the realm and entered the Unchanging Land. Looking into the distance, it was vast and boundless, a primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the Unchanging Land was violent, permeated with unchanging qi. Only living beings at the Divine Lord realm or above could walk in the Unchanging Land and avoid being harmed by the violent spiritual energy and unchanging qi.</p><p></p><p>Because of the violent spiritual energy in the Unchanging Land, the true spirits there tended to be more irritable, with thicker skin and flesh, and were easily angered. </p><p></p><p>The violent spiritual energy contained unchanging qi, which also meant the true spirits of the Unchanging Land could not develop spiritual intelligence, only having ordinary animal consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the violent spiritual energy of the Unchanging Land, the Ancient Sea Turtle felt nostalgic for a moment. It had been a very long time since he had entered the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>He was born in the Unchanging Land, and by coincidence also developed spiritual intelligence there, and once obtained the purple light of creation.</p><p></p><p>However, with the appearance of the Unchanging Divine Palace and the arrival of the great calamity, everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, where is the great opportunity you mentioned? What kind of great opportunity is it?" Xu Yan stood on the turtle's back, gazing into the distant chaos.</p><p></p><p>"The great opportunity!" The Ancient Sea Turtle sighed, looking in a certain direction. After a moment of silence, he began moving in that direction.</p><p></p><p>"The great opportunity is a realm. Although it is now a dead realm, it is still an intact realm that has not collapsed. Wouldn't you say that's a great opportunity? Even if you're not interested in using this realm to become its master, the realm itself is a great opportunity!" the Ancient Sea Turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three were stunned. A dead but complete realm?</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a great opportunity or not was beside the point, but such a realm was indeed a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Which realm are you talking about? One of the Seven Great Realms?" Xu Yan asked curiously. "If it's a realm, why didn't you take it? Perhaps it could have helped you become a realm master?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle sighed, and a hint of fear appeared in his eyes. Even after such a long time, the memory still brought up feelings of terror that he couldn't suppress.</p><p></p><p>"I escaped from that realm, barely surviving. Even if I had wanted to, I wouldn't have had the power. Besides, I developed a mental barrier against that realm. How could I have taken it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head curiously and asked, "What exactly did you experience that left you with a mental barrier after all this time, and still makes you feel afraid?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but mutter, "You old turtle, you seem a bit cowardly."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle gave a bitter laugh. "You haven't experienced it, so you don't know that kind of fear..."</p><p></p><p>He paused, thinking that Xu Yan and the others would never experience that kind of fear, given that they had such a terrifyingly powerful master behind them.</p><p></p><p>With such a formidable teacher, how could they ever experience that kind of despair and terror?</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, tell us in detail, what exactly happened? Where is this realm, is it one of the Seven Great Realms?" Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the turtle's back, asking with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"It is one of the Seven Great Realms."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle recalled the past. "Do you know the origin of the Primordial Turtle Shell I gave you? It belonged to a close friend of mine who perished in that great calamity..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three sat on the turtle's back, listening to the Ancient Sea Turtle recount the great calamity of the past and the life-and-death crisis he had experienced.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Turtle and I were both overlords in the Hongze Realm, and had followed Hongze for a long time. Hongze was a true water spirit who cultivated the Way of Water. So in ancient times, cultivators from the other six great realms who practiced water-related secret techniques or martial arts would find opportunities to come to the Hongze Realm to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"The Hongze Realm was a water realm, with over 80% of it being vast waters. The remaining land consisted of islands in the vast wetlands. I am the Ancient Sea Turtle, and I ruled over the vast sea domain of Hongze.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of the Unchanging Divine Palace brought an unimaginable calamity. Fenyun was the first to suffer. In fact, before the Fenyun Realm was affected, the masters of the Seven Great Realms had already joined forces once and reached an agreement with the Unchanging Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the Unchanging Divine Palace would suddenly betray them, and that there were traitors among the Seven Great Realms..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle carried Xu Yan and the other three towards the direction where the Hongze Realm used to be, while recounting the events of the ancient battle of the realms.</p><p></p><p>"Someone in the Fenyun Realm had been secretly persuaded by the Unchanging Divine Palace to betray them. This is why the Fenyun Realm suddenly fell into trouble, and Taicang and the others were unable to detect it in time.</p><p></p><p>"As for how the Unchanging Divine Palace acted, why the Fenyun Realm suddenly disappeared, and how Fenyun perished, that remains unknown. It wasn't until Wumo discovered Fenyun's remains and confirmed it was the work of the Unchanging Divine Palace that Taicang decided to fight, otherwise they would have been defeated one by one.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know many more details about that battle. I suppose those who knew have already perished in the great war. Of course, Taihe and Taikun might know more."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others listened silently. They all knew the general course of the ancient battle of the realms, but since Tianzi was not a participant, his knowledge was not detailed enough, and there were some inaccuracies in certain details.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancient Sea Turtle narrated, Xu Yan and the others learned more details about the great war of the past.</p><p></p><p>After Fenyun's death, Taicang and the other five joined forces and began preparing to deal with the Unchanging Divine Palace. The six great realms began to move, drawing closer to each other to form defensive and offensive formations.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Divine Palace no longer concealed itself. Its powerful beings appeared and began preparing for the great war. There was an interval between the initial small conflicts and the final great battle.</p><p></p><p>Before the final battle, realm master-level powerhouses from the Unchanging Divine Palace had already appeared, letting Taicang and the other five know that there were beings in the Unchanging Divine Palace who had not opened their own realms but possessed realm master-level strength.</p><p></p><p>Although their strength was weaker than that of Taicang and the others, they were still at the realm master level.</p><p></p><p>The lesser realm masters of the six great realms were unable to contend with the realm master-level powerhouses of the other side on their own. The difference in strength began to gradually reveal itself.</p><p></p><p>It was through these constant conflicts and battles that they gradually learned more about the Unchanging Divine Palace. The Unchanging Divine Palace had existed for an extremely long time, always wandering in the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>They had come wandering from parts of the Unchanging Land that Taicang and the others had never set foot in. Over the long years, the Unchanging Divine Palace had gathered many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Their goal was to invade realms, devour the living beings within, and obtain the opportunities there to achieve some purpose.</p><p></p><p>It was because of this that the powerful beings of the six great realms realized that as realm masters, they would not be accepted by the Unchanging Divine Palace. Even if they surrendered, they would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>The traitors from the Fenyun Realm had already been divided up and devoured. There might have been hidden traitors in the six great realms, but after this incident, they knew that joining the Unchanging Divine Palace would also certainly lead to death.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, there were still people who joined the Unchanging Divine Palace and turned against their own realms during the great war. Of course, they might have had no way out and could only take a gamble. They were probably secretly controlled by the Unchanging Divine Palace and had no choice," the Ancient Sea Turtle sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He nodded, recalling the scene he had witnessed in the wilderness - the battle between Shanggu and the Netherworld Shaman. The Netherworld Shaman had clearly sided with or been controlled by the Immutable Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Xiao appeared just before the great war, in a battle where he commanded true spirits to assault the realms. The Tiger Spirit of the True Spirit Realm was extremely powerful, leading the tiger clan to fight against Mu Xiao. Their tiger might was overwhelming, intimidating those true spirits. But in the end, they were still defeated," the Ancient Sea Turtle recalled that scene with a sigh. "The Tiger Spirit's strength had almost reached the level of a Realm Lord, but it still fell short. And Ao Hong and the other two Realm Lords were locked in a standoff, unable to come to its aid in time..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao suddenly asked curiously, "Does Red Cat have Tiger Spirit bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head and said, "When Master caught Red Cat and brought it back, it was just an ordinary tiger... No, perhaps Master saw that Red Cat was different from ordinary tigers, that's why he caught it."</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat is a Great Demon King, right? It does indeed have Tiger Spirit bloodline, but being a Great Demon King, it feels different from the might of the Tiger Spirit," the Ancient Sea Turtle said with some confusion.  </p><p></p><p>"Red Cat cultivates the path of Great Demons. Even with Tiger Spirit bloodline, it won't be developing in the direction of becoming a Tiger Spirit," Xu Yan explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was on the path of Great Demons, not the bloodline ascension of spirit beasts that ultimately transforms into true spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, please continue," Xu Yan asked the Ancient Sea Turtle to continue recounting the great war of the realms back then.</p><p></p><p>As Mu Xiao assaulted the realms, it was ultimately Ao Hong who took action, displaying the might of a True Spirit Lord. His dragon might was overwhelming, breaking Mu Xiao's control over the true spirits' power.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Xiao was rescued and taken away. This was also the last major conflict before the great war," the Ancient Sea Turtle continued.</p><p></p><p>With the fall of the Tiger Spirit, the powerful beings of the six great realms realized that they were at a disadvantage facing the threat of the Immutable Temple. Even if the six Realm Lords each fought two Realm Lords from the Immutable Temple, they still couldn't stabilize the situation. </p><p></p><p>They would definitely need several more powerful minor Realm Lords to join forces and hold back the remaining Realm Lords. But the Realm Lords were too strong - how long could they be held back?</p><p></p><p>The initial plan of the six great realms was to keep dragging things out, avoiding an all-out war.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it now, dragging out time back then was to give Tai Cang more time to grow stronger. But the Immutable Temple didn't drag things out indefinitely," the Ancient Sea Turtle's expression grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>"That day, sixteen Realm Lords of the Immutable Temple led their powerful forces in a joint attack. The great war was imminent - sixteen Realm Lords! Even if each of the Tai Cang Six could handle two opponents, the rest were not something we minor Realm Lords could deal with. Although we could rely on the power of the realm's principles to resist Realm Lords, at that time we all resigned ourselves to certain death!"</p><p></p><p>"It was only when the war began that we realized how far Tai Cang had surpassed the other six Realm Lords. Facing the attack of sixteen Realm Lords, the Tai Cang Six emerged from their realm to meet them in battle."</p><p></p><p>"While the Shaman, Demon and the other three held back ten Realm Lords, Tai Cang made a fierce move, unleashing overwhelming power. In a very short time, he directly slew four Realm Lords!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle became somewhat excited as he spoke of this.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what confidence that scene gave us, what faith it instilled in us? We were certain of victory. Tai Cang's strength was beyond imagination."</p><p></p><p>"It was at this moment that a figure appeared from within the Immutable Temple. Tai Cang only had time to severely injure the other two Realm Lords before he had to move to block this opponent."</p><p></p><p>"The battle entered a white-hot stage. The controlled traitors also took action. Both the realms and the outer regions were engulfed in war."</p><p></p><p>"We all knew that the key to victory lay with Tai Cang and that one figure. The Shaman Demon was also extremely powerful. In the midst of battle, he also killed a Realm Lord, then immediately manipulated the Shaman Demon Realm, unleashing its power in an instant to slay the remaining Realm Lord. Wielding the power of the Shaman Demon Realm, he charged towards the Immutable Temple, intending to join forces with Tai Cang against that one figure..."</p><p></p><p>An image of that towering figure he had seen walking in the wilderness floated into Xu Yan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cang!</p><p></p><p>"The battle grew increasingly fierce. At this point, the gap between Realm Lords who had opened up realms and those who hadn't became apparent."</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ze, riding massive waves, swept through the Immutable lands, forcing two Realm Lords of the Immutable Temple into steady retreat. In the battles between Realm Lords, the advantage was on our side. At that time, we all believed victory would surely be ours."</p><p></p><p>"Even if that one from the Immutable Temple was somewhat stronger, ultimately the six joining forces would certainly be able to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that in the end, we would be the ones defeated."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's face showed unwillingness and dejection as he said this.</p><p></p><p>"How did Tai Cang die? And how were you defeated?" Xu Yan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know!" The Ancient Sea Turtle shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"To this day, we still don't know why we were defeated, or how Tai Cang fell."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle gave a bitter laugh and said: "Hong Ze, wielding the vast waters of the great marsh, swept through the Immutable lands towards the Immutable Temple. The Hong Ze Realm began to shift, and another Realm Lord appeared to attack it."</p><p></p><p>"Although this Realm Lord was relatively weak, it was still not something that I, Yuan Gui and the others could resist. We could only rely on the principles of the Hong Ze Realm to block the opponent and prevent them from entering the realm."</p><p></p><p>"During this battle, the Hong Ze Realm drifted further and further away, getting more and more distant from the main battlefield. I don't know how the situation on the battlefield changed after that."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Ancient Sea Turtle paused, fear involuntarily appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew that what followed was the great calamity of the Hong Ze Realm, which became a dead realm. The Ancient Sea Turtle had miraculously survived, but the experience left him terrified whenever he recalled it.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know how much time passed as we kept resisting that Realm Lord's attacks. The longer it went on, the more we felt the advantage was on our side. We believed Hong Ze would return soon to slay that Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>"The final victory of the great war would surely belong to us."</p><p></p><p>"But we were all wrong. We were the ones defeated. Hong Ze did return, but he was brought back with someone gripping his neck."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's voice trembled, the fear in his eyes deepening.</p><p></p><p>"It was that one from the Immutable Temple, gripping Hong Ze as he returned. He directly smashed Hong Ze into the realm, turning him into vast waters. He devoured the realm's vitality, devoured everything in the realm. Hong Ze was also devoured along with the realm."</p><p></p><p>"That scene was too terrifying. I hid deep in the mud of the ancient sea, frantically activating my innate turtle breath technique. Even so, I could feel the realm dying, countless living beings being annihilated. Hong Ze was dead. Yuan Gui also used a secret technique, but he died too."</p><p></p><p>"I felt I was about to die too, that I couldn't hold on much longer. Suddenly, that one from the Immutable Temple left. In the far distance of the realm, the sounds of great battle could be heard..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

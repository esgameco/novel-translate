        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is said that the talented scion of the Wood family has the potential to become an extraordinary supreme expert, but the secret to becoming a supreme expert can only be found in the Transcendent Spiritual Sect. Whether the Wood family can obtain it, however, remains unknown.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, the talented scion of the Wood family went off somewhere to indulge in his licentious ways. That same year, a beautiful woman accompanied by a boy around twelve or thirteen years old came to the Wood family's door.</p><p></p><p>This was the illegitimate child the talented scion had left behind, and the beautiful woman was merely a wandering cultivator. When the Wood family's rightful wife, Tang Jinyan, found out, she was furious and nearly exploded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>She kept calling the boy a bastard and wanted to kill him.</p><p></p><p>However, the elders of the Wood family saw that the boy had spiritual talent, which was a big deal! As for his origins, that was completely unimportant - as long as he had the Wood family's bloodline and extraordinary talent, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>This is the pragmatic reality of a prominent clan. The elders completely disregarded Tang Jinyan's opinions and anger, even warning her not to harbor any hostility towards the Wood family's genius.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan was so angry that she refused to stay in the Wood family any longer.</p><p></p><p>This little boy is now the Wood family's genius, Wood Feiming. The elders, fearing he would be tainted by his father's licentious ways, have been strictly disciplining him, afraid he would become another talented scion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Wood Feiming, puzzled by how the boy's brows and eyes seemed to resemble his disciple sister, Su Lingxiu, to a certain degree. "The coincidence of similar appearances is not that strange."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't think much of it, as it was not uncommon for people to have similar facial features in this world, especially just a slight resemblance in the brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>Wood Feiming looked at Xu Yan with a grave expression. Xu Yan's reputation had long since spread throughout the Luo State, with his feats of slaying Yu Changfeng and the Sect Master of the Sword Sect. Such power was far beyond Wood Feiming's ability to match.</p><p></p><p>The Cai Yunhong of the Aoshuang Dynasty had also been defeated.</p><p></p><p>Now, Wood Feiming was the only genius left in the Luo State.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew he couldn't win, he still had to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, please." Wood Feiming took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, and after defeating Wood Feiming, his next destination would be the Thousand Martial State, the territory of the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Spiritual Sect remained aloof and high above, as if waiting to make a grand entrance and suppress all the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go directly to the Thousand Martial Palace's mountain gate and challenge them, forcing their genius to appear and stepping all over the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Wood family elders were very anxious. Xu Yan's fearsome reputation had already spread throughout the Luo State, and so far, aside from Cai Yunhong, all of Xu Yan's opponents had been reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, let's stop here, let's stop here. Don't ruin the harmony, I have a few divine spirit herbs that I think would suit you well."</p><p></p><p>The Wood family elder secretly transmitted this to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan: ...</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Yan didn't respond, the Wood family elder became even more anxious. The Wood family had finally managed to cultivate an upright genius who could command the respect of the younger generation, and if he were to be defeated, the loss would be immense.</p><p></p><p>He was the top candidate to become the Wood Family's next patriarch, but the position had been vacant since the licentious scion was too troublesome and uninterested in managing the clan.</p><p></p><p>Now that a genius was about to emerge to lead the Wood Family to continued prosperity, if he were to be killed by the ruthless Xu Yan, it would be a devastating blow to the Wood Family.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, twelve divine spirit herbs, no, this is the limit of what our Wood Family can offer!"</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elder gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. Since someone was eagerly offering spirit herbs, and divine spirit herbs at that, why not accept them? Especially since he had no intention of killing Wood Feiming, as they had no enmity between them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan agree, the Wood Family elder was overjoyed, and then secretly transmitted, "Young friend Xu, how about we make a deal? Our Wood Family can offer five more divine spirit herbs if you don't defeat our genius too quickly. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan: ...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Wood Family elder, Xu Yan was speechless. Then he glanced at the resolute Wood Feiming, who was willing to fight for the honor of the Wood Family, and couldn't help but sigh. Wood Feiming was truly treasured in the Wood Family!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had also learned a bit about the Wood Family - they were adept at cultivating herbs and concocting elixirs, so their stockpile of spirit herbs was naturally astonishing.</p><p></p><p>As for the Wood Family's elixirs, they were quite renowned even in the spiritual domain of the Luo State.</p><p></p><p>However, in Xu Yan's eyes, the Wood Family's elixirs were a waste of heaven's bounty.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, agreeing to the deal. After all, divine spirit herbs were already rare treasures, and even if he had taken the treasures of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, the quantity would still not match the Wood Family's.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Xu Yan secretly transmitted, "Wood Family elder, if I were to battle your family's genius for an hour, how many divine spirit herbs could you offer?"</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elder was stunned. Battle for an hour?</p><p></p><p>If news of this spread, that the Wood Family's genius could battle the fearsome Xu Yan for an hour without being defeated, their reputation would skyrocket! If Xu Yan's fame and might grew, the Wood Family genius' reputation would also rise.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elder gritted his teeth. "Fifty divine spirit herbs, truly no more than that!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but marvel - the Wood Family was indeed a family of herb cultivators, and they must have mastered the techniques to grow divine spirit herbs, to have amassed such a large stockpile.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't believe the Wood Family elder's words and directly made a higher offer.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elder hesitated for a moment, but ultimately gritted his teeth, his face full of pain, and said, "Alright, deal!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rolled his eyes - this Wood Family elder was really good at acting!</p><p></p><p>Wood Feiming didn't know any of this, and when he fought against Xu Yan, he actually put up a good fight, much to his own surprise. Xu Yan didn't seem as overwhelmingly powerful as the rumors claimed.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, during the battle with Wood Feiming, he kept absorbing Wood Feiming's martial dao energy, and was surprised to find that Wood Feiming's martial dao energy was relatively balanced and steady.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be related to the Wood Family's cultivation methods - the explosive power was lacking, but it was persistent and resilient.</p><p></p><p>When the hour was up, Xu Yan struck out and sent Wood Feiming flying.</p><p></p><p>Wood Feiming was somewhat dazed. "I concede."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu, for your restraint," Wood Feiming politely returned the salute.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elders were very satisfied with Wood Feiming's performance.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, here are your herbs!"</p><p></p><p>In a mountain forest, the Wood Family elder handed over a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened it and saw over a hundred divine spirit herbs, nodding in satisfaction. This deal was worth it. "May I ask, where will you be challenging the geniuses next, young friend Xu?"</p><p></p><p>The Wood Family elder hesitated for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised, not hiding anything. "I'm heading to the Thousand Martial State to challenge the Thousand Martial Palace's genius."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Wood Family elder took out a small booklet from the storage bag and handed it to Xu Yan. "Young friend Xu, this contains information about the Thousand Martial State and a list of the Thousand Martial Palace's major figures and publicly known geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the booklet, puzzled by the Wood Family elder's actions, as if he had a grudge against the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Palace is the most shameless. Young friend Xu, please be careful. Although the geniuses are fierce, the Thousand Martial Palace..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rules of the Feng Sect are in place, but the fellows of the Qianwu Palace, if they can't defeat you, they will surely resort to the most despicable tactics.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Wood Clan reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you, the Wood Clan, have a feud with the Qianwu Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It's not much of a feud, if we really had a feud, the Qianwu Palace would have destroyed the Wood Clan long ago. It's just that the Qianwu Palace once demanded something from us, and in the end, the Wood Clan paid a huge price to keep it.</p><p></p><p>"So I would be very happy to see the Qianwu Palace get a setback."</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Wood Clan waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Then with a solemn and sincere expression, he said, "Young friend Xu, please never mention my Wood Clan, for providing you with this information!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put away the booklet, "Don't worry, I won't mention your Wood Clan, I'm a wandering cultivator, and others will just think this information came from the Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"That's good, I wish you success!"</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Wood Clan cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and stepped out, his figure instantly disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu State is one of the five largest states in the Spiritual Realm, and it is exclusively ruled by the Qianwu Palace, which is also one of the strongest states in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families are the powers of the Qianwu State, all of which are subordinate to the Qianwu Palace. As the supreme Spiritual Sect, the Qianwu Palace naturally does not personally manage these trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance has suddenly emerged and has shown formidable strength, but the supreme Spiritual Sect, the Qianwu Palace, has not been able to display the powerful suppression of the Wanshi Alliance, which has to some extent challenged the Qianwu Palace's rule over the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the foundation of the Qianwu Palace is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prodigy Showdown has begun, and the top-tier Spiritual Sect prodigies have started to take action, climbing the Celestial Prodigy Ranking, competing with the Wanshi Alliance prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, the Spiritual Sects have an absolute advantage in the Showdown.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace is calm and composed, not sending out a single prodigy, seemingly waiting to make a final appearance with an invincible stance to sweep away the Wanshi Alliance prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps they are observing the foundation of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Without the Wanshi Alliance's presence in the Qianwu State, they would not believe that any Wanshi Alliance prodigy would dare to come to the Qianwu State to challenge them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the prodigies of the Qianwu Palace and the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families, they only need to diligently cultivate and continuously improve their strength, and they can obtain a good ranking in the final Celestial Prodigy Showdown.</p><p></p><p>The current Celestial Prodigy Showdown is in the elimination stage, and the true prodigies will all make their appearance at the end.</p><p></p><p>So when Xu Yan, alone with his sword, directly came to the gate of the Qianwu Palace, with sword light soaring into the sky, challenging the Qianwu Palace prodigies, all the Qianwu Palace warriors were caught off guard and dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sword Immortal Xu Yan, here to challenge the Qianwu Palace prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>The thunderous voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>In the Qianwu Palace, all the powerful experts were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Where did this brave warrior come from, daring to come to the gate of the Qianwu Palace to challenge them?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the Qianwu Palace warriors were furious, their faces flushed red, and the Qianwu Palace elders had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>Has the deterrence of the Qianwu Palace fallen so low? A mere wandering cultivator dares to come and challenge them?</p><p></p><p>And he calls himself the "Sword Immortal"? Who doesn't know that the sword dao of the Qianwu Palace is the best in the Spiritual Realm?</p><p></p><p>This is directly coming to humiliate them!</p><p></p><p>"What lowly wandering cultivator dares to run amok here, this is not a place for you!"</p><p></p><p>A Qianwu Palace steward appeared with a fierce aura, furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"What, the Qianwu Palace prodigies are too afraid to fight?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, the attitude of this Qianwu Palace warrior is truly despicable.</p><p></p><p>"You lowly wandering cultivator, you are not worthy of my Qianwu Palace prodigies fighting you, get lost!"</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace steward wanted to attack directly.</p><p></p><p>But remembering the rules of the Celestial Prodigy Showdown, he could only hold back, roaring.</p><p></p><p>"Then I challenge you, do you dare to fight?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace steward was stunned, then overjoyed, this ignorant wandering cultivator actually wants to challenge him, seeking his own death, he can't be blamed for this.</p><p></p><p>"You want to die, I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the steward had already made his move, his attack fierce and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace is truly shameless, as expected!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, unleashing a sword strike, in an instant, the sword intent surged, enveloping the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>This steward is only at the Refining Spirit Realm, in Xu Yan's eyes, he is insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Mountain River Dragon Roar, Thunder Sword, Xun Extinguish Sword!</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Qianwu Palace steward was instantly slain, turning to ash and smoke!</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>A warrior from inside the Qianwu Palace gate roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>A steward being killed at the Qianwu Palace gate, when has such a thing happened in years? The last time this happened was when the Blood Demon did it.</p><p></p><p>And now this scene has appeared again, at this moment, he feels like his face has been slapped hard.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The aura of a Refining Spirit Realm peak warrior was revealed, a huge spear shot out from the palace gate.</p><p></p><p>"The Qianwu Palace, truly the most shameless Spiritual Sect in the Spiritual Realm, how dare you violate the rules of the Celestial Prodigy Showdown?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered and said.</p><p></p><p>His voice echoed far and wide.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, there were already warriors watching, all with shocked expressions, where did this fierce person come from, directly challenging the Qianwu Palace gate? Even the Blood Demon back then was not like this, right?</p><p></p><p>The spear was suspended in mid-air, the Qianwu Palace warrior who struck it, his face flushed red at the moment. Normally, he wouldn't have put the rules of the Celestial Prodigy Showdown in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, the situation is different now.</p><p></p><p>"I know you want to kill me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan showed a brilliant smile, "The Qianwu Palace prodigies are all worthless, daring not to come out and fight, you stepping in to fight for your sect's prodigies, I can understand.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I'll challenge you, come, make your move!"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace warrior raged, wanting to attack, but if he did, it would confirm that the sect's prodigies were afraid to fight, and he had to step in.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't attack, it would seem that he was too cowardly, being challenged but not daring to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and said, "What, your Qianwu Palace prodigies are worthless, and you old fellow are no good either?"</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The huge spear like a dragon, shot towards him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan unleashed a sword strike, the dragon roar resounding, stepping forward, directly engaging in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"The spear techniques of the Qianwu Palace are indeed remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had to admit, the Qianwu Palace warriors are stronger than the other Spiritual Sect families within the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already made his move, the Qianwu Palace warrior no longer hesitated, fully activating his cultivation technique, his spear techniques like a dragon, the spear beams like countless cold stars, enveloping Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Today, you will die!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, smiled calmly, unleashing the Mountain River Sword Dao, constantly counterattacking the opponent, and the opponent's attacking aura was being gradually absorbed into his body.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao momentum was growing stronger, exchanging with different martial arts, gaining different insights.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Origin Realm is not far away."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the Qinghua Realm had experienced a major invasion from the Netherworld Abyss, and the great battle had subsided with both sides returning to a state of confrontation, unrest still continued within the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>This large-scale invasion by the Netherworld Abyss had left the Qinghua Realm, especially the Great Yue Kingdom, feeling on the verge of collapse, causing some martial artists to defect to the Netherworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Netherworld Abyss had been repelled, those who had surrendered and already transformed into blood shadows were hiding everywhere, even causing chaos. They could no longer turn back.</p><p></p><p>Those who had secretly defected but had not yet transformed into blood shadows, blood slaves, or blood disciples lived in constant fear, worried that they would be exposed one day.</p><p></p><p>Some people had their weaknesses exploited by others and were being manipulated.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qinghua Realm was ruled by three major powers, there were also many other large and small factions. A reshuffling of the power structure was quietly taking place.</p><p></p><p>For the Great Yue Kingdom, Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, and Celestial Martial Gate, they did not care about the changes in those factions as long as the assigned tasks of guarding the abyss entrances in their respective areas could be completed.</p><p></p><p>In the territory governed by the Celestial Martial Gate, within the range of Iron Ridge Mountain, there was an abyss entrance that ranked above average in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>This abyss entrance was guarded by one sect and two clans. During this recent attack, the patriarch of one clan had perished, weakening their strength.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader, seeing that they could not hold on and that the Qinghua Realm was in danger of falling, secretly defected to the Netherworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Before he could complete his mission as an insider, the Great Yue Kingdom defeated the Netherworld Abyss invasion and freed up powerful experts to support various regions. Several True King Celestial Venerables descended upon this place and joined forces to suppress this abyss entrance.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his seemingly secret defection had been leaked. Someone was holding this information over him, and his authority was being stripped away step by step, leaving him helpless.</p><p></p><p>The sect was at a dangerous juncture.</p><p></p><p>The elders in the sect had all expressed dissatisfaction with him as the sect leader. He could only use the excuse that he had been secretly injured in the great battle, his strength had declined, and he had to make concessions to temporarily muddle through.</p><p></p><p>He even used the pretext of secluded cultivation to heal his injuries and no longer managed sect affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Wei, you know what to do, right?" In a secret valley somewhere on Iron Ridge Mountain, a man wearing a black robe and a mask on his face said with a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>Sect Leader Wei's expression was extremely gloomy as he said in a deep voice, "Your Shao family has defected to the Netherworld Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>The Shao family was one of the two clans of Iron Ridge, and also the faction that suffered the least damage in this Netherworld Abyss invasion.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Wei, who told you I'm from the Shao family?" The masked man said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you've been constantly seizing authority for the Shao family and expanding their sphere of influence in Iron Ridge. If you're not from the Shao family, who else could you be?" Sect Leader Wei said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Wei, I advise you not to think too much. This plan must be completed, otherwise you know the consequences," the masked man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Ridge Abyss cannot accommodate a Blood Child entering. Even if I'm willing to be an insider, a Blood Child cannot come in!" Sect Leader Wei said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm needs a Blood Child to back us up, but we don't need the Blood Child to come in. A Blood Disciple will do. Three days later, a Blood Disciple will enter the Iron Ridge Abyss. Your only task is to deceive the guardians and let the Blood Disciple enter the Qinghua Realm. Once the Blood Disciple enters the Qinghua Realm, it will be easy for them to advance to Blood Child," the masked man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Sect Leader Wei's expression changed slightly. He thought of Blood Child Tu, who had entered the Qinghua Realm as a Blood Disciple and performed a blood sacrifice on Qiyun Prefecture City to advance to Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Has Sect Leader Wei developed a sense of righteousness and is unwilling to do such a thing?" The masked man looked at the hesitating Sect Leader Wei and said in a sinister voice.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I will handle this matter properly," Sect Leader Wei said, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had no way to turn back.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I await good news from Sect Leader Wei!" After saying this, the masked man's figure moved and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"There's no turning back!" Sect Leader Wei muttered to himself before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the two had left, Xu Yan walked out from behind a large tree.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm is truly chaotic, with no shortage of traitors," he said.</p><p></p><p>Both the masked man and Sect Leader Wei were True King Celestial Venerables with considerable strength. It would be quite difficult to kill them both.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Iron Ridge Abyss. A Blood Disciple, huh? If I kill the Blood Disciple they've worked so hard to bring in, and then expose their identities as traitors..." Xu Yan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Directly confronting and killing a Blood Disciple would be quite challenging. Even though he was now at the great accomplishment stage of the Divine Ability realm, a Blood Disciple arranged to enter the Qinghua Realm and potentially repeat Blood Child Tu's feat would undoubtedly be powerful among Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't kill them in a direct confrontation, then he wouldn't confront them directly.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil at the Iron Ridge Abyss had subsided. On this day, it was the turn of Sect Leader Wei's sect to guard the Iron Ridge Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader, you've come?" The elder on guard duty said in surprise when he saw Sect Leader Wei appear.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm going to check the abyss to prevent any Blood Disciples from invading again," Sect Leader Wei nodded.</p><p></p><p>After entering the abyss and reaching its depths, where another True King Celestial Venerable was on guard, he said, "I'll seclude myself here for a few days. You can return to the sect to rest for a few days."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Leader," that True King Celestial Venerable said after a moment of surprise before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Since the great battle, the sect's strength had declined, and the Sect Leader had repeatedly made concessions to the Shao family. The arduous task of guarding the abyss had mostly fallen on their shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Their rotation time was much longer than that of the Shao family's experts.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Sect Leader had come out of guilt, to temporarily take over guard duty for a few days.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sect Leader was stronger than him, so there shouldn't be any problems with the Sect Leader guarding here.</p><p></p><p>Only Sect Leader Wei remained in the depths of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>He took out a Netherworld blood pearl and tossed it towards the blood membrane above. The blood pearl sank into the blood membrane.</p><p></p><p>"Is everything arranged?" After a while, a cold voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, everything has been arranged," Sect Leader Wei said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Blood light shimmered, and a blood-colored figure descended from the blood membrane.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Disciple had pale red skin and a slightly pale face. His long fingers were like steel claws, giving off a faint cold light.</p><p></p><p>His aura was extremely powerful. Although far from a Blood Child, he was comparable to a peak True King Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Well done!" The Blood Disciple nodded with satisfaction to Sect Leader Wei.</p><p></p><p>"It is my honor to serve you, my lord!" Sect Leader Wei said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord. However, to avoid revealing your presence, please wear this armor," Sect Leader Wei took out a set of armor he had prepared in advance and handed it to the Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple put on the armor, which covered his entire body, leaving only his eyes exposed. But this alone wouldn't be enough to deceive the other martial artists guarding the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, please wait a moment while I send the others away," Sect Leader Wei said in a low voice as they approached the exit of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the Blood Disciple responded.</p><p></p><p>Sect Leader Wei hurriedly went to the entrance of the abyss and looked at the guards...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elder said, "Someone from the Qimen Institute of the Great Yue Kingdom will come today to set up some kind of formation. You take people to welcome them 100 li away. I can guard this place."</p><p></p><p>That elder was stunned and said, "Sect Master, you should lead the team for this..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to see the ugly faces of the Shao family!"</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Wei's low voice concealed anger.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll lead the team then."</p><p></p><p>The elder had no choice. Ever since the Sect Master was humiliated by the Shao family, his temper had become irritable.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with the sect's power declining, they were temporarily unable to get revenge.</p><p></p><p>This elder led several Condensed Law Celestial Lords to leave. At the exit of the Heavenly Cave, only a few Condensed Law Celestial Lords remained on guard. Sect Master Wei glanced at them, not considering them a threat.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it's ready. Those few people at the exit will be your blood food," Sect Master Wei said with a smile as he approached the Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. I'll count this as a merit for you!" The Blood Disciple was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The few Condensed Law Celestial Lords guarding the Heavenly Cave exit suddenly changed expression and looked up at the armored figure walking towards them.</p><p></p><p>"A Blood Disciple of the Netherworld Prison!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned. Had the Sect Master betrayed them and joined the Netherworld Prison?</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Blood Disciple attacked, his ten fingers like steel claws suddenly bursting with crimson light, grabbing the few Condensed Law Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! The Sect Master has betrayed us!" </p><p></p><p>A Condensed Law Celestial Lord roared angrily, wanting to spread the news.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Sect Master Wei coldly snorted, his True King Celestial Lord power already covering the surroundings, blocking the sound within.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, not bad blood food."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple laughed coldly, his claw suddenly grabbing towards one person's chest, as if wanting to dig out their heart.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Suddenly, a black sword light slashed out from that person's hand.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike seemed able to extinguish everything, incomparably sharp, unrivaled in killing.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change made the Blood Disciple's expression change greatly. Blood light surged on his body as he swayed, about to block this sword, about to dodge this sword.</p><p></p><p>However, this sword was too fast, too unexpected.</p><p></p><p>He had never taken mere Condensed Law realm martial artists seriously, so he had no defenses at all. By the time this sword came slashing, he had no time to react.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The Heaven-Severing Sword extinguished everything! Xu Yan's fully charged sword instantly killed this Blood Disciple! Then, he raised his hand for a palm strike. The blazing red palm force, like the fire of a great sun, directly blasted the Blood Disciple's collapsing corpse into ashes without leaving a trace.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change stunned even Sect Master Wei. He felt his scalp tingle, never having seen such a sharp sword strike in his life.</p><p></p><p>If that sword had struck him, he would certainly die!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart sank. He had been exposed!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple had been killed!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, I never thought you would really betray us!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True King guardian who should have left appeared in the Heavenly Cave, his expression furious, gnashing his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"You all knew already?" Sect Master Wei said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this young brother, we would have been deceived by you!" the elder said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, there's nothing more to say. Let's fight!" </p><p></p><p>Sect Master Wei took a deep breath, his gaze suddenly sharp as he struck out a palm towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?!" </p><p></p><p>In front of Xu Yan, the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword circulated endlessly as he calmly said, "Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"You've ruined my plans. Today I must kill you!" Sect Master Wei said in a rage.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, you're obstinate and unrepentant!"</p><p></p><p>The two elders guarding the Heavenly Cave directly attacked, surrounding Sect Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Heavenly Cave shook. Blood light blossomed from its depths as blood-colored figures descended.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Prison had invaded.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly send a message for help. The Iron Ridge Heavenly Cave is being invaded by enemies from the Netherworld Prison!" an elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the message has already been sent out," a martial artist at the cave entrance responded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go suppress the Netherworld Prison invaders."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure moved, heading directly into the depths of the Heavenly Cave. He raised his hand for a palm strike, and with a dragon's roar, a golden giant dragon angrily pounced towards the descending blood-colored figures.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A great battle erupted.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the constantly appearing blood slaves, and even a Blood Disciple, Xu Yan was excited, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good chance to practice my divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, mountains and rivers appeared - Mountains and Rivers in the Sword! True Dragon's Fury, Heaven-Severing Sword, Great Heaven-Plucking Hand... Several divine abilities were used simultaneously as one person held back the invasion of the Netherworld Prison's army.</p><p></p><p>Blood slaves were destroyed one after another in the sword light. Even that Blood Disciple felt threatened, constantly slashing with his crimson long blade, but never able to harm Xu Yan in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, the two elders were surrounding and attacking Sect Master Wei, but still at a disadvantage. At this moment, all three people fighting were shocked. What kind of martial arts was that? It was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>A young man alone, fighting against the enemies of the Netherworld Prison without falling behind!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became more excited as he fought, growing stronger as he fought. In the heat of battle, he seemed to gain new insights into martial arts, divine abilities, and the way of killing.</p><p></p><p>"This is my path, the path of invincibility," Xu Yan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! At a certain moment, a sword slashed out. The sword light in mid-air seemed to gain intelligence, turning a corner to avoid the Blood Disciple's block and stabbing into the Blood Disciple's shoulder from behind.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Blood sprayed as the Blood Disciple's face showed a shocked expression. The sword light had intelligence?</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this?</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a dragon's roar sounded. This roar was somewhat different from the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have gained spirituality.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon's eyes were full of divine might. It raised a dragon claw and struck out fiercely. Lightning appeared on its claw, then shifted and changed position, as if it were not just a palm force, but a real true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan closed his eyes slightly. Sword light constantly emerged from his hand. Each beam of sword light seemed to be using a sword technique, as if able to fight enemies on its own.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Another golden giant dragon howled out, killing into the blood slaves. It even dove up, striking at that layer of blood membrane, directly blasting away the blood slaves that had not yet descended.</p><p></p><p>"This is the wonder of the Wisdom Sword!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in profound insights. At this moment, the mysteries of the Wisdom Sword realm constantly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Above his spirit platform, his primordial spirit held a sword in hand. Formless sword intent seemed to spread throughout the spirit platform, forming a mysterious state.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a small golden dragon appeared on the spirit platform, coiling around his primordial spirit, its eyes gleaming as if full of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh level of the Dragon-Subduing Palm, Anger Raises Wind and Thunder, Hidden Without Trace..."</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the golden giant dragon disappeared among the blood slave army, as if hiding itself, without trace or shadow. But suddenly, a dragon claw appeared, wrapped in the power of wind and thunder, instantly tearing apart a blood slave.</p><p></p><p>Then, another dragon roar sounded. Wind and thunder rolled, dragon shadows coiled, dragon might surged, along with a fierce anger.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Inside the Heavenly Cave, the sound of sword humming suddenly rang out. It was as if everything in the cave had turned into swords, each sword possessing intelligence. More terrifyingly, these swords arranged themselves into some kind of sword formation.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom Sword Slays Demons!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes, his demeanor free and unrestrained. With a wave of his hand, the sword formation deployed and dragon might arose. Including that Blood Disciple, all the Netherworld Prison invaders were reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

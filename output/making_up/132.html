        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The grace of saving one's life is greater than heaven. He owes me a life, what can he use to repay it?" Meng Shushu, surrender yourself, won't I kill you?"</p><p></p><p>The peak sect master, dressed in a black robe, his face slightly pale, with a cold and stern gaze, spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression changed drastically. Suddenly, he raised his hands, unleashing a barrage of icy lights, leaping into the air and swiftly attacking Tian Jin.</p><p></p><p>"Tian, I will drag you down with me even if I die. It's a shame that we had a long-standing friendship, yet you betrayed me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Shushu's expression was extremely cold and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He struck out with a palm, fighting with a desperate manner.</p><p></p><p>Tian Jin's expression changed drastically, hastily defending himself, his figure constantly retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn and unyielding!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe let out a cold snort, his figure moving, raising his hand to grab Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>However, in that instant, Meng Shushu waved his hand, and a weapon about two feet long, resembling a pen, suddenly appeared in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The tip of the pen emitted a chilling glow, the fierce radiance abruptly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The man in the black robe struck out, but the icy light did not dissipate. Instead, it transformed into countless sparks, enveloping him from all directions. "I've underestimated you!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe let out a cold laugh, a vast white light surge erupting from his body, sweeping away the descending icy radiance.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Meng Shushu spat out a mouthful of blood, his aura suddenly surging, and the pen in his hand erupted with a dozen-foot icy glow, as he fiercely charged towards Tian Jin.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, are you seeking death?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Jin was shocked and furious, hastily defending with a long blade in his hand.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Shushu was heedless, seemingly intent on a mutual destruction, his originally scholarly appearance now replaced by blood-red eyes, ruthless and merciless.</p><p></p><p>Tian Jin panicked, for if he struck, Meng Shushu would die, and he would die as well. Originally, he had intended to force Meng Shushu back with this strike, but he never expected Meng Shushu to be willing to die together, a testament to his rage at being betrayed.</p><p></p><p>In the spur of the moment, Tian Jin's figure abruptly retreated, hastily trying to parry.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu had been waiting for this moment, his body suddenly twisting, forcefully shifting to the side, and the pen in his hand shot out.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The pen pierced through Tian Jin's chest.</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Jin was horrified, letting out an angry roar, swinging his blade towards Meng Shushu, determined to take him down with him. However, the unarmed Meng Shushu took out two hammer-sized hammers, with what seemed to be a mechanism on the handles. With a click, the heads opened up, spreading into eight petals, like a blooming flower.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu raised the opened hammers to block Tian Jin's final desperate strike.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe let out a furious roar, raising his hand and unleashing a beam of light, a crescent-shaped blade flying out, with a boom, intercepting Tian Jin's attack.</p><p></p><p>The crescent blade continued its momentum, Pu Ci, Tian Jin's head flew off!</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events startled the other two sect masters, their expressions changing drastically, their figures halting, their faces filled with horror! Their companion Tian Jin had been killed. And all of this seemed to be within Meng Shushu's expectations. When the man in the black robe acted to block Tian Jin's final strike, Meng Shushu's figure had already leapt forward.</p><p></p><p>He quickly retrieved the long pen from Tian Jin's corpse, and while the two sect masters were hesitating, unwilling to make a move, he leapt into the depths of the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's expression was icy cold, glancing at the other two sect masters, angrily shouting, "Don't just stand there, chase him! Don't destroy those two items, they are the keys to the treasure land!"</p><p></p><p>With that, his figure soared into the air, pursuing Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>The two sect masters finally realized, the small transforming hammers in Meng Shushu's hands were the keys to the treasure land, no wonder he was so furious and acted to block Tian Jin's attack. If the keys were destroyed, how could they enter the treasure land? Their figures moved, frantically chasing after Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed deeply, the members of his family did have some capabilities, but Meng Shushu was severely injured, this time, escaping would be impossible. </p><p></p><p>What caught his attention the most was the treasure land keys in Meng Shushu's hands! "The keys must be hidden inside those large hammers."</p><p></p><p>The centers of the two large hammers were hollow, surely the treasure land keys were hidden there. Since it was called a treasure land, and Meng Shushu was a spirit herb explorer, the sixth-grade spirit herbs must be in the treasure land! And it was highly likely not just one or two! Meng Chong's heart became excited, he must save the family member, not for anything else, but for the spirit herbs in the treasure land!</p><p></p><p>He descended from the tree, approaching Tian Jin's corpse, bending down to search it.</p><p></p><p>He retrieved several spirit talismans, totaling over a thousand spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he betrayed his friend, it turns out he was a poor sect master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong despised Tian Jin.</p><p></p><p>Pocketing the spirit talismans, his figure moved, heading towards the direction Meng Shushu had fled.</p><p></p><p>He saw Meng Shushu in the distance, already nearly exhausted, while the three sect masters had formed a surrounding formation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, with the three-sided encirclement, Meng Shushu could only flee in one direction, and he wouldn't be able to escape far.</p><p></p><p>So, he went to the path Meng Shushu was most likely to take, sitting down on a large tree, waiting for Meng Shushu to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Meng Shushu came in a disheveled state, panting heavily, his face deathly pale, his injuries worsening.</p><p></p><p>"I can't escape this time!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu felt his entire body weak, his breathing erratic, barely able to hold on.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The man in the black robe stepped forward, the other two sect masters also closing in to surround him.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, hand over the keys, surrender, or die!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu gritted his teeth, angrily saying, "You despicable people, you promised that I would explore the spirit herb treasure land for you, but not only did you not pay the agreed reward, you even want to control me to serve you. I, Meng Shushu, will never be your dog!"</p><p></p><p>He inserted the long pen into the ground, holding the treasure land keys in his hand, coldly saying, "Even if I die, you will never get the spirit herbs from the treasure land!"</p><p></p><p>He seemed ready to destroy the keys.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe, however, let out a cold laugh, saying, "Meng Shushu, how much strength do you have left? With your current abilities, can you destroy the keys?"</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, his expression suddenly turning cold and fierce, looking towards a large tree.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was startled, but remained unmoved, not turning to look at the direction the man in the black robe was shouting, still staring intently at him, inwardly scoffing, such a small trick would not fool him.</p><p></p><p>However, a familiar voice rang out, "Hmm, family member, it seems you're being chased? You look quite miserable!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's eyes welled up with tears of excitement, turning to look, and sure enough, he saw Meng Chong sitting on the large tree, with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Please save me, brother Meng!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a hesitant look on his face, "Family member, your enemies seem quite formidable, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Two sixth-grade spirit herbs!" Meng Shushu hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was more important than his life, two sixth-grade spirit herbs, although rare, could still be found!</p><p></p><p>"What are you talking about spirit herbs? Your life, how can it be compared to spirit herbs? Since you're in trouble, I naturally won't just stand by and watch!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Two sixth-grade spirit herbs, just to settle the score, what was he thinking?</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, landing in front of Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, do me a favor and let this matter go, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's best not to get involved in some matters, otherwise you might end up with nowhere to be buried!" </p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe had a cold, gloomy gaze.</p><p></p><p>The curved blade in his hand gleamed with a chilling light, his aura bursting forth, undoubtedly that of a peak master.</p><p></p><p>The other two master cultivators also erupted with powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous sound, the surrounding large trees were instantly shattered and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"This is your family's matter, and your enemies are quite formidable. It wouldn't be easy for me to kill them, and I might get implicated, so remember that you owe me a life!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, if you can escape, do so quickly, you don't necessarily have to fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu reminded him.</p><p></p><p>After all, one peak master and two mid-level masters were extremely powerful. </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong alone was no match for them.</p><p></p><p>However, if he tried to escape, there might still be a chance. Seeing Meng Chong risk himself to intervene, he was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the man in the black robe, he said in a deep voice, "Sir, won't you show me some courtesy?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's cold, ruthless gaze was filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"You'll get my courtesy when you're dead!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled, "In that case, I'll have to offend you. Taste my blade!"</p><p></p><p>Clang! The blade was unsheathed, and in that instant, an overbearing aura suddenly surged, with only a flash of the blade seeming to tear through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was alarmed. In that moment, he sensed the presence of death.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a terrifying crisis since becoming a master.</p><p></p><p>There was nowhere to hide!</p><p></p><p>This strike seemed to have cut off all his retreat routes! Boom! He unleashed his full power, his black robe shattering to reveal his upper body, covered in thick scars the size of fingers.</p><p></p><p>The curved blade in his hand emitted a brilliant glow as he struck out with all his might, trying to block the incoming blow.</p><p></p><p>Poof! However, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>Under the tyrannical Heavenly Dominating Blade, the man in the black robe was instantly cleaved in two, and the blade's intent swept over, reducing his body to ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's blade light rolled up like a bolt of silk, sweeping out.</p><p></p><p>The other two masters were also slain by a single stroke, their bodies turning to ash and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The drawing and sheathing of the blade all happened in a flash!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was stunned. What a terrifying strike! Peak masters were like paper dolls, instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the burly and muscular Meng Chong, he swallowed hard, realizing that Meng Chong's strength was far beyond his imagination. "No wonder they are master cultivators, they are too hard to kill."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>Was that supposed to be human speech? One strike and they were killed, how is that hard to kill?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, thank you for saving me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sat on the ground, panting.</p><p></p><p>"It's only natural, after all, you're from my family. Here, sign the document."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, handing the paper and pen to Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>"This time, you owe me a life, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took a deep breath and asked, "My family member, can I get a discount, like a few spiritual herbs to buy back?"</p><p></p><p>Owing a life is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>If it could be bought back with spiritual herbs, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying? Is your life so cheap? How can spiritual herbs compare to your life?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu didn't know whether he should feel touched or not. After a long while, he said, "Brother Meng, I can't just not repay the life-saving grace. Tell me a condition."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then a storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Just kill me, please kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu, hearing this, forgot about his injuries and jumped up, shouting.</p><p></p><p>His face flushed red, "A storage bag? You can't even afford to buy me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was taken aback, a storage bag was actually so precious?</p><p></p><p>He placed his hands on Meng Shushu's shoulders and said, "Don't get so agitated, just because you can't afford it now doesn't mean you can't in the future.</p><p></p><p>"My family member, I see that you lack ambition and a goal to strive for.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do, now I'm giving you a goal to strive for, and that is to remember that you owe me a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"With this goal to strive for, you won't lose your way, and you can urge yourself to work hard for it at all times.</p><p></p><p>"I'm doing this for your own good, not because I really want you to give me a storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was stunned, had he really lacked a goal to strive for?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued, "My family member, as long as you have a goal to strive for, and keep moving forward towards it, you will definitely surpass your current self.</p><p></p><p>"Although a storage bag is precious, as long as you have perseverance, determination, and an unwavering will, one day you will be able to afford it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not asking you for the storage bag now, you just need to remember it in your heart, and make it your goal to strive for."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu calmed down, "You're right, I've been too lazy. If I hadn't been, I wouldn't have been chased and have no strength to fight back."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked very pleased, "That's right, you can't continue to be lazy. You already have powerful enemies, you need to set a lofty goal for yourself, and let it start with owing me a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Come, sign the document, engrave it in your heart, and urge yourself constantly.</p><p></p><p>"This document is like a whip, whipping you to keep striving forward."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was deeply moved, and immediately signed his name.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized, did he just get tricked?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, how come I owe you a life and a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about the details, the storage bag is your goal to strive for, you just need to remember that you owe me one, I won't really ask you for it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put the document away as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked at the burly and muscular ruffian, suspecting that he might have been swindled!</p><p></p><p>"Come, Brother Meng, tell me, what's the deal with your enemies? Now I've also been implicated. From now on, your enemies are my enemies, killing you is the same as killing me.</p><p></p><p>"Since we're now inseparable, we need to plan carefully on how to deal with the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"And what about the spiritual herb grounds? Your herbs are my herbs, coveting your herbs is the same as coveting mine.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to covet my herbs, they shall all die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's head was spinning, he realized he seemed to have been drawn into a trap.</p><p></p><p>And one he couldn't get out of.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, the spiritual herb grounds should belong to me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, but before Meng Shushu could breathe a sigh of relief, he continued, "You're my family member, with a common enemy. What's yours is naturally also mine. Why would you separate us? Am I just a fool to you? Do the spiritual herb grounds mean more than our brotherly bond?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was completely dumbfounded. Who was the fool here?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

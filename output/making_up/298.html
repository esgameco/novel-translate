        <h1>Chapter 298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine soul was severely injured, with the spiritual essence depleted by 90%, and more than half of the flesh and blood was scorched black by lightning. Even the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms refined into the divine soul were on the verge of collapsing and dispersing.</p><p></p><p>This was a warrior stronger than Huang Liang, who had refined two strands of heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>However, the injuries were too severe, and he was almost ruined.</p><p></p><p>Especially the injury to the divine soul, which made it difficult for him to focus his consciousness, often causing him to be distracted. And in order to maintain the integrity of the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, 90% of his attention was focused on preventing their dispersal.</p><p></p><p>This made his state of distraction even more serious, requiring him to shake his head from time to time to alleviate the condition.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, his injuries were even more severe than those of Yue Chang Ming back then.</p><p></p><p>The main focus of the injury was on the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Injured by the divine artifact of the Thunder Cloud Manor?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>The news of the battle between the Millennium Alliance and the Transcendent Spirit Sect had already spread, and he also knew that the Thunder Cloud Manor had used divine artifacts to repel the experts of the Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The power of this divine artifact is not too strong, just average."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan evaluated it, the divine artifact of the Thunder Cloud Manor was just so-so.</p><p></p><p>If there were enough and suitable materials, Fang Hao could forge a weapon with greater power.</p><p></p><p>"Lie still and don't move, let me examine you."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was very excited. This was the first time the Long Qing Pavilion had opened a branch in the Spirit Realm, and such a severely injured patient had come, which was a good opportunity to test the diagnostic spirit artifact! Yue'er was also very excited, pushing a small cart over and stopping it by the bedside.</p><p></p><p>This small cart was rather peculiar, with a square instrument on it, the purpose of which was unknown.</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan saw this cart, he couldn't help but smile wryly.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had mentioned casually before, about diagnostic instruments. With this instrument, even without Su Ling Xiu's medical skills, they could still make a diagnosis.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Su Ling Xiu had learned from Fang Hao for a while to forge, just to forge this diagnostic spirit artifact based on her own insights and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Fang Hao's assistance was indispensable during the process.</p><p></p><p>Now, the diagnostic spirit artifact could be put to use.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing Zheng looked at this small cart, a bit dumbfounded, was this just for fun?</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was also full of curiosity, standing by the bedside, watching how Su Ling Xiu would treat Jiao Li.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu excitedly pulled out a tube from the diagnostic spirit artifact, the end of which had something like a sticker.</p><p></p><p>She stuck it on Jiao Li's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Then Yue'er took out the tube and handed it to Su Ling Xiu, while staring at the square instrument.</p><p></p><p>Her finger tapped on the instrument, and the originally smooth mirror surface lit up, a blurry image appeared, along with a few wave-like lines.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li only felt that the thing stuck to his forehead seemed to have a warm and moist sensation, as if it was probing his divine soul, and the tube on his chest seemed to be examining his entire body.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was a bit confused, was this some kind of scheme to harm him?</p><p></p><p>But he did not struggle, but silently waited to see what the other party would do next.</p><p></p><p>"The result is coming out!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu stared excitedly at the mirror surface of the instrument.</p><p></p><p>This was the first diagnostic spirit artifact, and the effect, as well as the accuracy of the diagnosis, needed to be verified in a series of tests.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xing Zheng and Cai Ling'er were also curious about this thing, can it really diagnose injuries?</p><p></p><p>As warriors, especially those who had refined their divine souls, it was easy for them to judge the injuries, so why bother going through the trouble of using a strange spirit artifact for diagnosis?</p><p></p><p>The diagnostic result appeared on the smooth mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>"Divine soul damaged, touching the origin, the symptom is inability to concentrate, often distracted..."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual essence depleted by 90%, lost through scorching evaporation, flesh and blood scorched black, burned by thunder and fire..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the diagnosis listed on the instrument, Zhu Xing Zheng and Cai Ling'er were a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li's divine soul was damaged, and his spiritual essence was depleted, these injuries were already known and easy to judge.</p><p></p><p>But the instrument had diagnosed it in such detail, even the specific part of the divine soul that was damaged and the reason for the depletion of the spiritual essence, which was more detailed than their own judgment.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu glanced at it and nodded in satisfaction. Although the diagnostic result was not as good as her own, as a diagnostic spirit artifact, not a warrior-physician like her, being able to make such a detailed diagnosis was already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er excitedly said, "If it can also provide a treatment plan, that would be even more perfect, integrating diagnosis and treatment!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's eyes lit up, clapping her hands and saying, "That's a good idea, I can ponder on that."</p><p></p><p>After retrieving the tubes attached to Jiao Li, she saw Cai Ling'er and her eyes suddenly brightened, as if she had found some treasure.</p><p></p><p>That gaze made Cai Ling'er a bit confused. What kind of gaze was that?</p><p>"You're also injured, and not lightly. Come, come, let me diagnose you."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Tribe, this was the first time she had seen one, and it was even a powerful member of the tribe.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu even had the idea of dissecting a Sea Spirit Tribe member to see what differences there were from the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, quickly push a bed over!"</p><p></p><p>She called back.</p><p></p><p>"Coming!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, who was practicing his saber, hurriedly pushed a bed over.</p><p></p><p>"Senior from the Sea Spirit Tribe, quickly lie down, let me diagnose you."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and Yue'er, one on the left and one on the right, excitedly helped the bewildered Cai Ling'er onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>Casually, she pulled out a few tubes from the diagnostic spirit artifact and stuck them on Cai Ling'er's body.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er looked at Su Ling Xiu, her hands caressing Su Ling Xiu's cheeks and elbows, her eyes shining brightly, as if she had some unpleasant thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was about the same.</p><p></p><p>The diagnostic result came out, and Su Ling Xiu glanced at it, her brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"There's some deviation, is it because of the Sea Spirit Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>The diagnostic result of the spirit artifact was slightly different from her own diagnosis, perhaps because of Cai Ling'er's Sea Spirit Tribe background?</p><p></p><p>Does this mean that the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race have differences in physical structure and even divine souls, which led to the deviation in the diagnostic spirit artifact?</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu became even more interested in the physical structure of the Sea Spirit Tribe, directly leaving Jiao Li aside.</p><p></p><p>"Senior from the Sea Spirit Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Just call me Cai Ling'er, don't call me senior, it makes me feel old."</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Cai Ling'er, let's discuss something, this treatment, I won't charge you a diagnosis fee, but can you agree to let me research you a bit?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said with a hopeful expression.</p><p></p><p>"No diagnosis fee? Can you really heal me?" </p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was greatly surprised, was this girl not just joking around?</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Sister Cai Ling'er's injury is a trivial matter for me."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was about to agree wholeheartedly, but then she remembered what Su Ling Xiu said about researching her, what did that mean?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Suling Xiu's face was filled with anticipation and excitement as she took out a thin, extremely sharp little knife and said, "It's like this, Sister Cailingr, you are from the Sea Spirit Tribe, and I want to study the differences in the body structure and so on between the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race."</p><p></p><p>Cailingr looked at the little knife in her hand and had some bad premonitions, but still asked, "What kind of research method?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu waved the little knife a few times and said, "Dissect it, so that we can clearly and clearly understand the differences in structure, including the differences in martial arts cultivation, and even the differences in divine souls."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Cailingr, you can rest assured, your realm is high, your strength is strong, and with the elixir I have prepared, you will not be in danger of life, nor will you suffer any pain.</p><p></p><p>"And I can guarantee that after the research, you will be intact, without any loss."</p><p></p><p>Dissect?! Cailingr almost exploded, jumping up from the sickbed. "Are you trying to harm me? Are you a member of the Spirit Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Dissect and still be intact? </p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it was terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li, who was lying on the sickbed, was also shocked and sat up.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was completely dumbfounded, looking at Suling Xiu, who was holding a small knife and full of excitement, eager to dissect the powerful Sea Spirit Tribe warrior Cailingr. His heart sank and he started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>So scary!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but be speechless. Ever since he let Suling Xiu dissect and study the living corpses of the Hidden Pavilion Master and others in the Inner Domain, she had made many new research achievements.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to dissection, Suling Xiu is extremely proficient and skilled.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the Sea Spirit Tribe's Cailingr, she immediately became interested, but Cailingr is not a corpse, how dare she openly ask for permission to study her! Cailingr must have water in her brain to agree!</p><p></p><p>"Don't be angry, Sister Cailingr, don't be angry, I'm not a member of the Spirit Sect, and I have no ill intentions at all, I just want to study the differences between the Sea Spirit Tribe and the human race," Suling Xiu hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Cailingr didn't believe it, her body surging with light, ready to capture the person.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem!" Li Xuan coughed lightly and said, "Girl, don't be foolish!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master!" Suling Xiu said, feeling frustrated.</p><p></p><p>The momentum that Cailingr was about to burst out suddenly dissipated, and she looked at Li Xuan with a terrified gaze.</p><p></p><p>That light cough seemed ordinary to the others, but it was as if it had exploded in her divine soul, as if it could shatter her divine soul at any moment!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying expert! At this moment, Cailingr dared not show any momentum, she knew the other party was warning her!</p><p></p><p>Since Cailingr was unwilling, Suling Xiu, although disappointed, did not insist, and began to treat Jiao Li.</p><p></p><p>"Your divine soul is damaged, your foundation is also damaged, your essence blood is depleted by 90%, your flesh and blood are blackened, and there is residual thunder and fire energy..." Suling Xiu explained his injuries one by one, and then looked at Zhu Xingzheng and said, "Where's the diagnosis fee?"</p><p></p><p>"Here, here it is!" Zhu Xingzheng hurriedly handed over a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er took it, opened it, and nodded, "The diagnosis fee is fine!"</p><p></p><p>"Lie down, I'll start treating you now!" Suling Xiu nodded and pressed Jiao Li's shoulder, making him lie down on the sickbed. Even the semi-disabled Jiao Li could not resist, he was shocked in his heart, this girl's strength was so strong! Whoosh! The golden needles were instantly inserted into Jiao Li's body, and at the same time Suling Xiu took out an elixir and stuffed it into Jiao Li's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"This is an elixir that greatly replenishes essence blood."</p><p></p><p>Cailingr was uneasy, occasionally glancing at Li Xuan, seeing him leisurely reading a book, without any intention of harassing, and she breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>She then stared intently at Suling Xiu treating Jiao Li.</p><p></p><p>This kind of treatment method, she had never heard of, especially that elixir.</p><p></p><p>"The residual thunder and fire energy in your flesh and blood needs to be removed with the help of an elixir that can dispel the scorching heat of thunder and fire, as well as the acupuncture technique of passing through the acupoints with golden needles to expel the thunder and fire energy."</p><p></p><p>As Suling Xiu spoke, she took out some spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Cinnabar flames appeared and she began to refine the needed elixir.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Cailingr and Zhu Xingzheng in shock, what kind of technique was this? Those spiritual herbs, with different medicinal properties, could actually be fused together?</p><p></p><p>"My essence blood is recovering rapidly!" Jiao Li suddenly exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>His depleted essence blood, which had almost dried up and damaged the source of essence blood regeneration, could only be maintained by taking a nourishing essence blood elixir, but could not be replenished.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the blackened flesh and blood, the residual thunder and fire energy, had not been expelled, and the depleted essence blood could not be replenished.</p><p></p><p>However, after taking an elixir, he suddenly found that his essence blood was regenerating and beginning to recover!</p><p></p><p>How could this not be shocking?</p><p></p><p>"Calm down!" Yue'er patted his shoulder and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Jiao Li hurriedly nodded, his breathing couldn't help but become rapid, it seemed that his recovery was really promising.</p><p></p><p>Cailingr and Zhu Xingzheng were both shocked, could it really be cured?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the elixir to expel the thunder and fire energy was refined, and Suling Xiu said solemnly, "Come, eat the elixir!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li obediently ate the elixir.</p><p></p><p>A warm and cool energy permeated his entire body, and the painful scorching of the thunder and fire gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Suling Xiu inserted the golden needles in a certain order and vibrated them, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first time she had treated such an injury, the first time she had expelled the remaining power from the injured person's body.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li felt that the thunder and fire energy in his blood and flesh was actually gathering towards his right palm, and the right palm seemed to be swelling, emitting a red and hot steam.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for a warm and moist energy protecting him, he even suspected that his right palm might have already turned black and rotten!</p><p></p><p>"Raise your hand!" Suling Xiu ordered.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li subconsciously raised his right hand, and Suling Xiu flicked her finger, and a golden needle slid across his five fingertips, and a burst of thunder and fire spurted out.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the thunder and fire disappeared, and the palm returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Eat this elixir, it can help your flesh and blood regenerate," Suling Xiu gave Jiao Li another elixir.</p><p></p><p>Then, the golden needles were all inserted into Jiao Li's head, and she said seriously, "I need to treat your divine soul injury, it will be very painful during this time, if you can't bear it, take this elixir and enter a deep sleep, when you wake up, your divine soul will be repaired."</p><p></p><p>Having come this far in the treatment and seeing the hope of recovery, Jiao Li naturally swallowed the elixir and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was secretly excited in her heart, but her face remained serious as she looked at Zhu Xingzheng and Cailingr and said, "Divine soul injuries are not easy to treat, and they need to be treated in a closed room, it's easy to be affected outside, so you wait here!"</p><p></p><p>"I believe in Miss Su!" Zhu Xingzheng said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Cailingr didn't speak, if the other party really had malicious intentions, with that terrifying strength, it would be easy for them to control her.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er had already pushed the sickbed and entered the room with Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

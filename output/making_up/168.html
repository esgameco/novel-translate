        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The remaining elixirs, Xu Yan wanted to give to his parents and relatives. Zhou Ying got one, and Shi Er looked at them pitifully, so Suling Xiu also gave him one.</p><p></p><p>Out of the thirty elixirs, there were sixteen left in the end. Suling Xiu collected them.</p><p></p><p>These sixteen Tiansuo Elixirs were extremely precious. After all, whether another batch of fifth-grade spiritual herbs that could enhance talent or insight could be found was unknown.</p><p></p><p>These were kept in reserve for emergencies.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the elixirs and hurriedly went to give them to his parents and others.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan each found a place to take the elixir.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying and Shi Er did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat looked at Suling Xiu pitifully, its gaze constantly fixed on those six inferior products.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the red cat seems to have become smarter."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was surprised, reaching out to rub the red cat's big head.</p><p></p><p>"Here, have one."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu threw one of the inferior products into the red cat's mouth, rubbing and kneading the red cat's big head, saying, "You've eaten quite a few elixirs. If you can't cultivate into a great demon, you can grow big and small. I even want to refine you into a big cat elixir!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat rolled over, its eyes showing a sense of urgency, afraid of being refined into an elixir.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the red cat. Even the inferior Tiansuo Elixir had effects. The red cat had eaten one, so its insight should have improved a bit.</p><p></p><p>According to the red cat's current changes, it seemed to be in the process of transforming into a great demon. Its body was becoming more and more massive, and it contained a powerful blood essence. Its physical body was also constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a fat tiger, but in terms of strength, ordinary sect master cultivators would probably be unable to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>The red cat returned to the courtyard outside, lying on the ground with its eyes narrowed, seemingly digesting the inferior Tiansuo Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu successfully refined the Tiansuo Elixir and felt relieved. She focused her thoughts on cultivation, continuing to ponder the Danjue Martial Classic and the Void Elixir Refinement Technique, researching various elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she was preparing to enter the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had been in the Inner Domain for a while, and he should be returning soon.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Tiansuo Elixir, Zhou Ying could feel her talent had been enhanced, and her cultivation had become easier.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm was no longer as difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>She excitedly began to ponder the Xiantian Realm cultivation technique, preparing for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was also very happy. He felt his talent had been enhanced, and the Tiansuo Elixir was truly amazing.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng didn't feel much difference, only slightly feeling that his mind had become clearer, as if his insight had improved.</p><p></p><p>His talent was already not weak, so the effect of the Tiansuo Elixir on him was naturally weaker.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's experience was more obvious. He was excited and diligently cultivating, striving to break through to the Great Success Sect Master Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"There are less than ten people left before the hundred cultivators enter the door."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>As more people cultivated the Martial Dao, and with the assistance of elixirs, the entry of a hundred cultivators was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the cultivators in the Frontier were mainly concentrated in the Xu Family and the Changqing Pavilion. The rest of the cultivators were mostly at the Foundation Realm, still some distance from the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>That day, Kou Ruozhi returned.</p><p></p><p>He was reporting the mission to Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion had already established a branch in Iron Mountain County, not in the county city, but in the suburbs, building a manor and a tall building.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he easily obtained the territory and initially established the reputation of the Changqing Pavilion, and also contacted a manager of the Tianbao Pavilion in Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>He laid the foundation for possible future cooperation.</p><p></p><p>"You have handled this matter well. This is a reward for you."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded in satisfaction, giving Kou Ruozhi an elixir bottle for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Pavilion Master!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to work hard. If the Changqing Pavilion develops well, you will not be without benefits, such as elixirs that can enhance talent and insight."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Pavilion Master, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi thumped his chest, promising to do his utmost to develop the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to enter the Inner Domain. The Elixir Refinement Room is of great importance. You should have an idea. After entering the Inner Domain, how to maximize the benefits of the elixirs and how to obtain resources, you should give me a plan."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu continued to instruct.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, don't worry, I have it figured out!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>This was his forte.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Kou Ruozhi said again, "Pavilion Master, for business matters, there is actually a more suitable candidate, which is Master Xu. He is a cunning..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suling Xiu's gaze glaring at him, Kou Ruozhi hurriedly corrected, "He is a resourceful person with extraordinary business skills, far better than me."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu couldn't help but nod. She knew about the exploits of the Patriarch Xu Junhe, after all, he was a legendary figure who had risen from humble beginnings to become a powerful tycoon.</p><p></p><p>"I'll talk to the Elder Brother about it and ask for his father's opinion."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that Xu Junhe may also be preparing to enter the Inner Domain. Should I contact him?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Inner Domain together, it's about time. Iron Mountain County is a small place, and there shouldn't be any threats."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's voice came, as he had just returned.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, is your father interested in doing business in the Inner Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"He should be interested, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not entirely sure.</p><p></p><p>His father seemed to have more thoughts on the Martial Dao, and had already become indifferent to business matters.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go ask him when I have the chance."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu made a decision.</p><p></p><p>The development of the Changqing Pavilion, especially the sale and maximization of benefits of the elixirs, could not rely solely on Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>And she herself was not very familiar with these matters.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was undoubtedly the best candidate.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, when I was chatting with a manager of the Tianbao Pavilion in Iron Mountain County, I heard some news that seems to be related to the Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what news?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows, as news from the Inner Domain had been largely cut off since he returned to the Frontier.</p><p></p><p>"Canglan Island!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi spoke: "That manager mentioned that there was a notorious Grand Master who boasted that he would challenge the Young Master on Canglan Island and kill him.</p><p></p><p>And the manager also said that powerful Grand Masters had searched for the Young Master's whereabouts and gone to Canglan Island several times."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "It seems to be a Peak Grand Master, could it be the Black-Robed Man?"</p><p></p><p>Aside from the forces of the Black-Robed Man, he didn't think he had offended other powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>He then thought of another person.</p><p></p><p>The Fiend Extermination Venerable, one of the Nine Great Venerables of the Demon Sect! He had killed one of his three great subordinates, the Killing Skeleton.</p><p></p><p>"Did they say when he would challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "Never mind, when I return to the Inner Domain, I'll deal with it then.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Find them, the peak grand masters, and kill them with a single sword strike!" </p><p></p><p>He had already reached the peak of the innate realm, and could break through to the profound realm at any time. However, he was holding back his breakthrough in order to refine and transform himself during the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But his strength was constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>The peak grand masters were no longer in his sight.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they were the top-tier peak grand masters, he would still take a brief look at them, but for ordinary peak grand masters, he could just slap them to death!</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, the black-robed person is not weak in strength, we should still be careful. I'm afraid they have set up an ambush on Canglang Island!" Suling Xiu said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, don't worry. I'll go with the elder brother. It's a good opportunity to kill a few grand masters and vent our anger!" Meng Chong came over, grinning wickedly.</p><p></p><p>He had been hunted by the grand masters for a while, and was itching to kill some. Now that his strength had broken through, he was looking for grand masters to kill, and the other party had conveniently come to them.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, don't worry. In the face of absolute strength, so-called ambushes are nothing but suicidal." Although Xu Yan said this, he would not be the least bit careless.</p><p></p><p>The teachings of his master were deeply engraved in his heart. Many ultimate experts had ultimately died from being overconfident. He, Xu Yan, was not a reckless person!</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry for the trouble." Suling Xiu said embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>"What trouble? The black-robed person is just bringing wealth to me." Xu Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing." Kou Ruozhi spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Xu Yan looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was most afraid of Xu Yan, not Suling Xiu, so he was always cautious and careful in front of Xu Yan, afraid of offending him.</p><p></p><p>"There is someone in Tieshan County looking for news of you two, and it seems to be urgent."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong frowned. Who in Tieshan County was looking for news of the two of them? Meng Shu!</p><p></p><p>"Is it a family member? Did they encounter some trouble and get chased by the black-robed people again?" Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Kou Ruozhi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go to the family. I can send some medicinal pills to them." Meng Chong made the decision.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was a spiritual herb explorer. Did he discover another spiritual herb vein that he couldn't enter alone? Kou Ruozhi finished his report and began to prepare to go to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu also became busy, as did Xu Yan, shuttling between the Eastern River Commandery and the capital of Qi Kingdom. Since they were going to the inner domain, their family members would also move over.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain was not like the borderlands. Even Tieshan County had certain dangers.</p><p></p><p>However, the dangers were not too great. After all, the only master in Tieshan County was the one guarding the Tianbao Pavilion. </p><p></p><p>Since Tieshan County was a barren place, the master guarding it was only a third-rate master. He couldn't even defeat the Crimson Cat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe had already reached the peak of the qi-blood realm, and was not far from perfection. Although it would still take a long time for him to break through to the innate realm, with his qi-blood realm at its peak, he was already the top expert in Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his busy disciple and sighed. They were finally leaving the borderlands and going to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to change places. I wonder if I can find suitable disciples in the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the martial artists from the borderlands entered the inner domain, martial arts would also spread to the inner domain, and there might gradually be a competition of martial arts...</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, Xu Yan's feat of slaying a grand master at the peak had caused a huge sensation and shaken the entire inner domain.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, the Grand Supervisor Fu Yuntian sighed, admitting that Xu Yan was truly a prodigy. His strength had already surpassed Fu Yuntian's.</p><p></p><p>And how old was Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fu Yuntian recalled the scene of Xu Yan discussing martial arts with those dozens of martial arts scholars.</p><p></p><p>"Iron bone, copper bone, gold bone, jade bone... Tendons and bones rumbling, qi and blood like a storm..."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian muttered to himself. Xu Yan's exposition of martial arts was not fabricated! He was not a master realm cultivator, but an innate realm cultivator! Those martial arts scholars who had discussed martial arts with Xu Yan had been arguing endlessly, all thinking that Xu Yan was a shameless upstart making things up.</p><p></p><p>Some also believed that Xu Yan's exposition did have complete theories and seemed to be real.</p><p></p><p>Those martial arts scholars argued and fought with each other repeatedly, debating whether Xu Yan's theories were fabricated or real.</p><p></p><p>But after the news of Xu Yan slaying a grand master at the peak spread, those martial arts scholars no longer argued, but were questioning their own lives. Some even came to Fu Yuntian to spar, wanting to test whether Xu Yan's martial arts could indeed defeat them.</p><p></p><p>The result was naturally that they were all suppressed by Fu Yuntian.</p><p></p><p>This news gradually spread, and the grand master realm martial arts scholars also got involved, pondering every day about the truth behind Xu Yan's martial arts exposition.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Yan's exposition, he was at the innate realm, which should correspond to the master realm. But he had killed a grand master beyond his realm!</p><p></p><p>This was far stronger than the martial arts they cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian sighed, muttering, "I feel like trouble is brewing. Those guys are all martial arts fanatics, they'll stop at nothing to pursue martial arts."</p><p></p><p>The martial arts scholars in the Seven Star Academy were all such martial arts fanatics, their minds filled with nothing but martial arts. And the Seven Star Academy had a deep foundation that could provide them with an environment to research martial arts.</p><p></p><p>That was why these martial arts scholars had previously taken action to crush those who coveted the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was a bit troubled. He shouldn't have agreed to let the martial arts scholars discuss martial arts with Xu Yan in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Now these martial arts scholars would probably leave the Seven Star Academy to go find Xu Yan, in order to delve into the martial arts he expounded.</p><p></p><p>"I should go talk to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian sighed.</p><p></p><p>As for suppressing Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>That would go against the principles of the Seven Star Academy, and he might not even have the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since Xu Yan slew the grand master at the peak. His strength had probably risen even further.</p><p></p><p>Only by understanding the changes in Xu Yan's strength could he truly grasp the extent of his prodigy and power.</p><p></p><p>Another message arrived.</p><p></p><p>One of the nine great Demon Overlords, the Demon Overlord of Burning Slaughter, openly declared that he would annihilate Xu Yan on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>But when he went to Canglang Island, Xu Yan was not there.</p><p></p><p>Furious, he raged that he would destroy Canglang Island and kill everyone related to Xu Yan if Xu Yan didn't come to Canglang Island to die.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian looked at the envelope in his hand, which contained intelligence about Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Overlord of Burning Slaughter, and two other peak grand masters... They must have sensed the threat from Xu Yan and want to join forces to suppress this hidden danger. The black-robed person..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Fu Yuntian summoned a flying messenger bird, wrote a letter, and sent it off.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful hidden force, there are only a few in the entire inner domain. The black-robed person's organization is..."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian mused. This was an opportunity to establish a good relationship with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

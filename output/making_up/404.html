        <h1>Chapter 404</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From this, we can see how much importance the Wan family places on Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes flickered slightly. Wan Tianlin had made a breakthrough in his power, and his aura had become more solid, clearly having used the Blood Heart Fruit to successfully comprehend the Wan family's secret technique.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique was evidently related to the foundation for breaking through to become an Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Although mastering this secret technique did not guarantee breaking through to Immortal Heavenly Venerable, it greatly increased the chances of doing so.</p><p></p><p>Within the Wan family, Wan Tianlin was already viewed as a future Immortal Heavenly Venerable powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Each additional Immortal Heavenly Venerable would naturally elevate the Wan family's strength to the next level, giving them more advantage in suppressing the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, have you made any discoveries?" Wan Tianlin asked with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>Although he had made a breakthrough in power, Xu Yan still looked the same as when they last met, with no apparent growth. But Wan Tianlin did not dare underestimate him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"To be frank with Brother Wan, I used some methods to extract some clues from the mouths of the death soldiers from the forces behind the assassination attempt on me..." Xu Yan nodded and said straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's gaze shifted. The "methods" Xu Yan mentioned, which could extract valuable information from death soldiers, were likely not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Please continue, Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's expression turned solemn. As long as that mysterious force was not rooted out, it was as if a pair of sinister eyes were watching the Wan family from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow. The force behind this is called Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, composed of the Heavenly Fiend and Earthly Shadow divisions. Heavenly Fiend are the leaders, skilled in the art of killing, while Earthly Shadow specializes in infiltration and assassination..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held nothing back, revealing all the information about Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow to Wan Tianlin without reservation.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow?"</p><p></p><p>The more Wan Tianlin and the two clan elders listened, the more shocked they became. Such a force had never been heard of before, hidden so deeply - their schemes must be significant.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family members who attempted to assassinate me last time were actually Earthly Shadow members. The Wan family likely still has infiltrators. Additionally, it's known that in the Nine Mountains Realm, there is a Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend leading Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, and the strength of this Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend is at the level of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, is this Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend truly an Immortal Heavenly Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>At this, Wan Tianlin and the two clan elders could no longer remain seated.</p><p></p><p>This meant that an Immortal Heavenly Venerable powerhouse was plotting against the Wan family! Within the Nine Mountains Realm, Immortal Heavenly Venerables were few in number, and they all knew each other.</p><p></p><p>"This cannot be false. It's even uncertain if there is only one Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend. After all, the status of that death soldier was limited, and he may not have known too much."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's expression grew heavy. "Brother Xu, what is Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's purpose in stirring up conflict between us?"</p><p></p><p>"To incite conflict between the Qinghua Realm and the Nine Mountains Realm. Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's goal is to create turmoil in the Divine Realm, in order to restore something called the 'glory of heaven and earth'..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not conceal anything, telling Wan Tianlin everything about Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's purpose of creating turmoil to restore the so-called "glory of heaven and earth".</p><p></p><p>As for what methods he used and how he obtained this information, he naturally did not mention a word.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin did not ask either.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is of great importance. I need to report to the Immortal Ancestors of our family before we can decide on the next course of action."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin was deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>The plans of this mysterious force, Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, were so terrifying to hear.</p><p></p><p>What was this "restoring the glory of heaven and earth"? It was unheard of, but it showed that these were a group of terrifyingly fanatical people.</p><p></p><p>The 36 realms of the Divine Realm faced invasion from the Heavenly Abyss, and there was an unspoken agreement between them not to incite intense conflicts or attack each other. They would even come to each other's aid if any realm was in danger of being occupied by the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, they were all in it together.</p><p></p><p>Yet Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow dared to attempt to incite attacks between the 36 realms and create turmoil in the Divine Realm. If they succeeded, wouldn't that be taken advantage of by the Heavenly Abyss? If even one realm, or several realms of the Divine Realm fell into the hands of the Heavenly Abyss, the consequences were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"From my investigation, I know the location of a Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow base, but I fear my strength alone is not enough to completely destroy it. That's why I sought Brother Wan's help to take action together.</p><p></p><p>"Besides this, I also want to ask Brother Wan to help me pass on a message, to find someone..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan then stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Apart from joining forces to destroy the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow base, it was naturally to find Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>Dacai Mountain was Wan family territory. No matter what, any force hiding there had to be rooted out.</p><p></p><p>As for passing on a message to find someone, that was even simpler.</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence. Brother Xu, let's take action now."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin was somewhat impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the two Wan family elders, assessing their strength. It should be sufficient to destroy one of Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's bases.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to Shadow One's description, although the strength of each Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow base varied, they wouldn't be too strong. The Heavenly Fiend leading the Dacai Mountain area might not necessarily be stronger than these two Wan family elders.</p><p></p><p>"One of Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's bases is located here..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed the location of one of the bases. After all, when it came to familiarity with Dacai Mountain, Wan Tianlin naturally knew it better.</p><p></p><p>"So it's there!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin nodded, quickly finding the location of Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow on the Wan family's map of the Dacai Mountain area.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The mission failed!"</p><p></p><p>Shadow One had returned to his base, his aura weakened, clearly having used a secret technique and paid a considerable price.</p><p></p><p>"Why did it fail?"</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's strength was greater than estimated, and there was also a Wan family powerhouse who intervened. I had to use a secret technique to escape..."</p><p></p><p>Shadow One said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Recover here. Once you've healed, I'll arrange a new mission."</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The mission had failed. In the past, the Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend wouldn't have cared much, as no one could guarantee 100% success on missions.</p><p></p><p>But ever since a traitor had appeared, they had to be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Shadow One to recover at the base, the Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend and the rest of the base personnel silently left and went into hiding elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>If the base had been compromised, someone would surely come to attack.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after waiting for three days with no attack, the Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend breathed a sigh of relief. Shadow One hadn't been compromised, and no one had followed his trail.</p><p></p><p>Just as he relaxed, a black spirit bee about two inches long suddenly flew over and landed on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Buzz! The spirit bee's antennae moved, transmitting a faint soul fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend's face instantly changed drastically. One of Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's secret bases had actually been wiped out by Xu Yan and the Wan family! Only one person had escaped alive, paying a heavy price!</p><p></p><p>"Is there a traitor, or was our whereabouts leaked and discovered by the Wan family?"</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heavenly Fiend's gaze grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Return to the branch!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha couldn't sit still anymore and led his people back to the Tiansha Diying branch in Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>He had a hunch that Tiansha Diying may have been discovered by the Wan family, and they would likely soon launch a pursuit against Tiansha Diying.</p><p></p><p>Before returning to the branch, another spirit bee arrived.</p><p></p><p>The second stronghold had also been wiped out, and the ones who did it were again Xu Yan and the Wan family working together. This stronghold was stronger, and two people managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Two connected strongholds leaked at the same time!" </p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha pondered.</p><p></p><p>These messenger spirit bees were unique to Tiansha Diying - fast and secretive in their communication, ensuring messages wouldn't be intercepted. Given the bees' speed, the time between the destruction of the first and second strongholds wasn't long.</p><p></p><p>From this, he deduced that after wiping out the first stronghold, Xu Yan and Wan Tianlin immediately moved to destroy the second one without pause.</p><p></p><p>This indicated they had already thoroughly investigated the situation of these two strongholds beforehand.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he couldn't understand was that while Xu Yan's involvement wasn't surprising, why were there only two clan elders from the Wan family taking action? Shouldn't they have completely wiped out the stronghold without letting anyone escape? Then his expression changed slightly as he wondered - could the Wan family have deliberately let some people escape, then followed the escapees, hoping to use this method to find Tiansha Diying's branch in Mount Dagai?</p><p></p><p>"The Diying are skilled at stealth. To track them silently would be impossible for a True King Celestial Lord. Could it be that an Immortal Celestial Lord from the Wan family personally took action?"</p><p></p><p>At this thought, Five Leaf Tiansha's heart sank. </p><p></p><p>After all, if an Immortal Celestial Lord acted, they would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>"Although the heavenly cave in Mount Dagai is currently relatively stable without major upheavals, it's still impossible for a Wan family Immortal Celestial Lord to easily leave their post..."</p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha pondered for a while, then ordered: "Notify those who escaped to gather at this location."</p><p></p><p>To be cautious, Five Leaf Tiansha ultimately didn't instruct the escapees to rendezvous at the branch, but instead had them go to a secret location.</p><p></p><p>This was where Tiansha Diying's backup branch was located.</p><p></p><p>"Order One Leaf Tiansha and Two Leaf Tiansha to go to this location and await orders!"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Five Leaf Tiansha issued another command.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to mislead people, how could there not be other Tiansha Diying members at this backup branch? When necessary, sacrificing some members was also essential.</p><p></p><p>Buzz! Two spirit bees instantly departed, responsible for relaying the messages.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Five Leaf Tiansha continued leading his confidants back to the Mount Dagai branch location.</p><p></p><p>Just as they arrived at the branch, a spirit bee flew over.</p><p></p><p>Another stronghold had been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The guardian of this stronghold was quite powerful. Under his desperate attack, two people escaped from this stronghold, and one of the Wan family clan elders was wounded.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha pondered.</p><p></p><p>Then a flash of inspiration struck him, and he seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Wan family using Wan Tianlin as bait, wanting to lure out Tiansha Diying's powerful members?"</p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha now suspected that the reason the Wan family hadn't completely annihilated Tiansha Diying's strongholds, allowing people to escape each time, was to deliberately send a message to Tiansha Diying.</p><p></p><p>The protective forces around Wan Tianlin were weak, making it the best opportunity to assassinate Wan Tianlin and Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Heh, so that's it. They want to lure us out!" </p><p></p><p>After figuring this out, Five Leaf Tiansha couldn't help but sneer. How could he fall for such a trick?</p><p></p><p>The fundamental purpose of killing Wan Tianlin was to provoke conflict. Since the instigation had already been exposed, risking further attempts to kill Wan Tianlin would be more trouble than it's worth.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!" </p><p></p><p>Five Leaf Tiansha muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wan, let's cooperate again when we have the chance!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a cupped-hand salute and a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>This joint operation had eliminated three Tiansha Diying strongholds, all of which were provided by Xu Yan. At each stronghold, they deliberately let some people escape.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those who fled had used secret techniques and their strength had declined.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan would follow those who escaped, returning shortly after, seemingly having obtained information about new stronghold locations from the escapees.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't clear what methods Xu Yan used to accomplish this, obviously these escaped Tiansha Diying members would be of great use!</p><p></p><p>From this joint operation, Wan Tianlin also obtained part of a list of Diying members infiltrating the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>All of this was provided by Xu Yan, obtained from those who escaped.</p><p></p><p>Being able to pry open even the mouths of death squads was truly incredible, deepening Wan Tianlin's admiration for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Six now. Tiansha Diying, just wait for me, Xu Yan, to wipe you all out at once!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was cold.</p><p></p><p>He had already gained control over six people, from Shadow One to Shadow Six. He just needed to wait for the right moment, after grasping the location of Tiansha Diying's branch, to take action and eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for junior brother to arrive!"</p><p></p><p>The message to search for Meng Chong had already been sent out by the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>As long as Meng Chong was in Mount Dagai, he would surely receive this information and come.</p><p></p><p>This time, in wiping out Tiansha Diying's strongholds, Xu Yan had gained more information about Tiansha Diying stronghold locations, but he hadn't taken action, only destroying three strongholds.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the stronghold in Mount Dagai, there was actually information about strongholds in other regions like Thousand Fold Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In a city in Mount Dagai, a burly man with thick hair was leaving the city.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is looking for me."</p><p></p><p>This burly man was Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>To avoid pursuit, he deliberately wore a thick wig and made some changes to his appearance.</p><p></p><p>But because of his large, muscular build, those pursuing him would pay extremely close attention to any person with a similar physique, carefully investigating.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong's technique for concealing his aura and changing his appearance was clever, allowing him to easily deceive them. If necessary, he could even shrink his physical body, reducing his muscular frame.</p><p></p><p>"I've almost gathered enough treasures needed to accumulate my foundation. It's a good time to break through."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong left the city, avoiding potential pursuers.</p><p></p><p>"Once I break through to the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun Star, I'll kill them one by one!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes were cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>Having faced assassination attempts right after entering the Nine Mountains Realm, even falling into dangerous situations, how could he let it go?</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through, he would fear nothing below Immortal Celestial Lords. Even True King Celestial Lords wouldn't be able to threaten him. Then it would be time to display his might, letting these assassins witness the ferocity of physical body martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was waiting for Meng Chong to appear, received a message from Meng Chong through a communication talisman. They were now within range of the talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Second junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong wearing a wig, Xu Yan's gaze grew even colder.</p><p></p><p>Tiansha Diying's pursuit had forced Meng Chong to wear a wig, showing how many dangers he must have faced these days.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed, taking off the wig and putting it away.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend of Hengfeng Mountain, in the identity of the Immortal Lord of Hengfeng Mountain, came to Thousand Layers Mountain to persuade the Immortal Lord there to join forces in killing Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"There may be some misunderstanding between Thousand Layers Mountain and Xu Yan. I can offer some compensation, and perhaps this matter can be put to rest," the Immortal Lord of Thousand Layers Mountain hesitated. </p><p></p><p>Once involved in assassinating Xu Yan, there would truly be no turning back. If the assassination succeeded, the hidden danger would be eliminated. But if Xu Yan escaped, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>"How foolish! A genius like Xu Yan is extremely arrogant at heart. How could he accept your apology and compensation? Are you, a dignified Immortal Lord, going to kneel down and beg for his forgiveness?</p><p></p><p>"If you could do that, perhaps Xu Yan would really let bygones be bygones!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Immortal Lord of Thousand Layers Mountain's expression changed several times. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said in a deep voice: "What you say makes sense. Since we're already at odds, we might as well go all out and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>How could a dignified Immortal Lord kneel and beg for forgiveness? He couldn't bring himself to do it, couldn't lose face like that! Since that was the case, there was only one path forward - to join forces with the Immortal Lord of Hengfeng Mountain to kill Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Very good then. Wait for my news."</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend nodded with satisfaction and left, returning to Hengfeng Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Huang, what are you doing? Apologizing to Xu Yan and Meng Chong? Don't you care about Hengfeng Mountain's reputation? You are a dignified Immortal Lord!"</p><p></p><p>After returning to Hengfeng Mountain, he immediately sought out the senior brother who had a grudge against Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ke from Thousand Layers Mountain has already sent a message, inviting Senior Brother Huang to join forces in killing Xu Yan and Meng Chong, eliminating the hidden danger in its infancy.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Senior Brother Huang, I will also participate in this. How can a dignified Immortal Lord suffer humiliation from a youngster like Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan relies on his status as a peerless genius and looks down on everyone. How could he take your apology seriously? There's only one way out - kill him. A dead genius poses no threat."</p><p></p><p>Under his junior brother's persuasion, Senior Brother Huang felt it made sense and thanked his junior brother for offering to help.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Hengfeng Mountain and Thousand Layers Mountain joined forces to issue a bounty, hunting down Xu Yan and Meng Chong. They even directly entered Great Canopy Mountain to search for traces of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, confronting the Immortal Lord of the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Only after learning that Xu Yan and Meng Chong had already left Great Canopy Mountain did they withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on Spirit Veneration Mountain, Xu Yan's group of three found a hidden location, set up formations, and then each began to consolidate their martial arts gains.</p><p></p><p>"Hengfeng Mountain and Thousand Layers Mountain are determined to oppose us brothers."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the message sent by Red Cat and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"We'll take down Hengfeng Mountain sooner or later!" Meng Chong said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"These Immortal Lords are on guard now. It will be much more difficult to assassinate them," Jiang Buping sighed.</p><p></p><p>In a direct confrontation, even if the three of them joined forces, they couldn't kill an Immortal Lord. Whether it was killing the Immortal Lord of Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow or killing Blood Son Mo, it was all about catching them by surprise, about the opponent being careless and underestimating them.</p><p></p><p>Now that the news had spread and these Immortal Lords were on guard, even if they were injured, they would have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry about it. The Divine Realm is so vast, we don't have to stay in the Nine Mountains Region," Xu Yan said with a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother is right," Jiang Buping nodded.</p><p></p><p>The three brothers hid in a certain place on Spirit Veneration Mountain, consolidating their recent gains.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Nine Mountains Region continued. The Immortal Lords of Hengfeng Mountain and Thousand Layers Mountain began searching for traces of Xu Yan and Meng Chong in the Nine Mountains Region, but naturally came up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they clashed with other forces, and so another battle between Immortal Lords erupted in the Nine Mountains Region.</p><p></p><p>In the turbulent Nine Mountains Region, the friendships of the past between the major forces were long gone, replaced by constant strife.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, my Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow has already demonstrated its strength. What do you think?" </p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen came to Spirit Veneration Mountain again.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's strength is just so-so. It depends on how much sincerity you can show," Wind Spirit Tiger said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"We certainly have sincerity. How about this, Wind Spirit King - you kill two people? Xu Yan and Meng Chong. As long as you personally take action and kill them, you'll get what you want."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger's eyes rolled as he said, "Give me the item first. Otherwise, if I take action and you give me some worthless thing in return, could I still kill you?"</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, I, Sky Seventeen..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop wasting words. I'm not familiar with you, Sky Seventeen. If you want me to take action, that's fine, but deliver the item first. Otherwise, forget it. Also, you need to provide me with Xu Yan and Meng Chong's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"What, did you expect me to go find them myself? With my status as Wind Spirit King..."</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger sat imposingly in his chair, speaking with great authority.</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen frowned, considering whether to continue seeking cooperation with Wind Spirit Tiger. However, Wind Spirit Tiger was extremely powerful, and as one of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings of the Divine Realm, and a tiger spirit beast at that, there was no one more suitable.</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, he nodded and said, "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>"Then it's settled. But let me be clear upfront - if you don't provide the targets' whereabouts and I don't kill them, you can't blame me. The item won't be returned."</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger added in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" </p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen nodded. He was still very confident. With Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's intelligence capabilities, they would immediately discover Xu Yan and Meng Chong's whereabouts as soon as the two showed even the slightest trace.</p><p></p><p>Once their whereabouts were discovered, with Wind Spirit Tiger's strength, he could easily kill them.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll wait for your item to arrive. We'll see if it's satisfactory."</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Why not accept free gifts?</p><p></p><p>As for taking action?</p><p></p><p>Brother Red Cat had said to just "try his best". After all, as the Wind Spirit King, every outing was quite grand and majestic, so it was normal to be a bit slow.</p><p></p><p>If the targets escaped, that was due to Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's inadequate preparation, not Wind Spirit Tiger King's problem.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of Wind Spirit Tiger's thoughts, Sky Seventeen left satisfied, preparing for the next plot and action. He secretly sneered to himself - with Xu Yan and Meng Chong dead at Wind Spirit Tiger's hands, a great battle would surely erupt.</p><p></p><p>How could Wind Spirit Tiger withstand the retaliation?</p><p></p><p>In the end, he would have no choice but to seek refuge with Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, allowing them to command him as they pleased.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sky Seventeen, I'll remember you. Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow still won't give up, huh? Hmph!" A cold light flashed in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the message sent by Red Cat, he understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>After these days of consolidation, Meng Chong had broken through to the early stage of the Divine Phase realm. Xu Yan had also made no small improvement, and although he was still some distance from the great achievement stage of the Divine Phase realm, it wasn't too far off.</p><p></p><p>His use of divine abilities had also improved significantly after defeating Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, what are your plans next?" Xu Yan looked at Jiang Buping and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I want to increase my strength more quickly..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Strength needs to be gained through battle insights, and also requires immutable qi to cultivate the Extreme Soul martial arts. So I plan to go to other realms and train in the Immutable Celestial Cave," Jiang Buping said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>He would return to the Taikun Realm one day, but not now - his strength was not yet enough to avenge his humiliation! </p><p></p><p>"What about Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother? Will you continue to roam the Nine Mountains Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head: "The Nine Mountains Realm is no longer interesting. The Divine Realm is so vast, why linger in Nine Mountains? We should travel the Divine Realm and gain insights from all things in heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and chuckled: "I plan to head towards the Great Yan Realm to find some old acquaintances."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, we'll meet again in the Taikun Realm someday. Big Senior Brother will go there to help you avenge your humiliation," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Me too. We'll definitely go to Taikun Realm eventually. Let's agree to reunite there!" Meng Chong nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brothers. Then we'll meet again in Taikun Realm!" Jiang Buping said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was just a small part of the three brothers' martial arts journey. Regardless of what schemes Tian Shiqi, Thousand Layers Mountain and横峰 Mountain had, the three were no longer willing to play along.</p><p></p><p>The chaos in the Divine Realm was also a time for geniuses to make a name for themselves. In the eyes of the three, these Immortal Venerable Lords were nothing but grasshoppers jumping around for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping left. He didn't go through the realm gate of Nine Mountains to the next realm, but directly crossed the wilderness to enter the next realm.</p><p></p><p>At the Nine Mountains realm gate, the Blood Son and Immortal Venerable Lords were still in a standoff. Forces like Tiansha and Diying were searching for traces of the three, and had surely sealed off the realm gate.</p><p></p><p>For Jiang Buping, crossing the wilderness to the next realm was also a form of martial arts training. It just took a bit more time to cross one realm's territory and enter the next.</p><p></p><p>"Second Junior Brother, see you in Taikun Realm!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"See you in Taikun Realm!" Meng Chong rubbed his bald head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers parted ways again, each embarking on their own martial arts journey. </p><p></p><p>However, this time they all had communication talismans to stay in touch. No matter where they were in the Divine Realm, they could contact each other and exchange their experiences.</p><p></p><p>In the 36 realms of the Divine Realm, the areas connecting the realms were vast wilderness. Apart from crossing through realm gates, one could only traverse the endless wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Even for Immortal Venerable Lords, crossing the vast wilderness took considerable time. That's why travel between realms was usually done through realm gates, which was quick and convenient.</p><p></p><p>The endless wilderness was empty and devoid of life, as if not even an insect existed there. Walking in such a place made one feel uneasy and infinitely lonely.</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that a True King Venerable Lord went mad from the emptiness and loneliness while crossing the wilderness, becoming insane. It took a long period of recuperation before he slowly recovered.</p><p></p><p>The desolate emptiness of the wilderness revealed one's loneliness. Even the strong will of martial artists could not endure it. Because of this, very few martial artists came to the wilderness, and almost none crossed it.</p><p></p><p>Some supreme experts had warned that the laws of heaven and earth in the wilderness were lonely and imbued with a sense of sorrow. So when martial artists entered, they would be affected. Those with insufficient willpower would become mentally deranged from the loneliness.</p><p></p><p>In the empty wilderness, a solitary figure walked. As far as the eye could see, there was no sign of human habitation or vegetation, not even the sound of insects could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"I once read about the wilderness in the library of the Jiang family in Taikun Realm. Legend has it that when the world changed greatly and the Divine Realm was divided into 36 realms, this was a forgotten place, also called the Forgotten Land."</p><p></p><p>"The laws of heaven and earth in the Forgotten Land are lonely and sorrowful. There are also rumors that the existence of the wilderness is to commemorate some being..."</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Buping walked through the wilderness, he communicated with his Senior Brothers via the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Besides bordering the Qinghua Realm, the Nine Mountains Realm also borders the Longyun Realm and Yuanping Realm. I'm crossing the wilderness on this side to the Yuanping Realm. Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother, you should be crossing the wilderness towards the Longyun Realm."</p><p></p><p>The wilderness was desolate, with only Jiang Buping walking alone. A sense of loneliness permeated heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"When crossing the wilderness, one cannot fly through the air. It's said there are unknown dangers in flying through the air, and even Immortal Venerable Lords can easily have accidents. So crossing the wilderness can only be done on the ground."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping explained what he knew about the rumors of the vast wilderness between realms.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a former member of the Jiang clan in Taikun Realm, he had read quite a few texts, including some records about the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"I once read an account in a travelogue that there are dangers in the wilderness too. Someone entered an ancient tomb in the wilderness and saw an unknown bone. As a result, an accident occurred - their flesh disappeared and they turned into a skeleton."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, every so often they would lose consciousness and become frenzied and murderous. In the end, they were killed."</p><p></p><p>Recounting the travelogue he had read, Jiang Buping continued to communicate: "When walking in the wilderness, one cannot be too curious, nor be tempted by treasures seen. When crossing the wilderness, just cross directly without entering strange places."</p><p></p><p>The deeper one went into the desolate wilderness, the stronger the sense of loneliness. The feeling of solitude and desolation seemed to permeate heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Although Jiang Buping was walking on the ground, his speed was not slow. He did not gaze at the seemingly endless wilderness, but focused his attention on the communication talisman. It was precisely because he could communicate that he did not fall into loneliness.</p><p></p><p>The more one looked at the wilderness, the easier it was to feel lonely and pessimistic.</p><p></p><p>In addition to communicating with his Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother, he naturally also communicated with Third Senior Sister and Fourth Senior Brother who were far away in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Walking alone in the wilderness, heaven and earth were desolate. Especially when night fell, it became silent and empty, even the gentle breeze had disappeared. In such an environment, even martial artists would develop some negative emotions.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping looked up at the dark wilderness and took out a moonstone. Its faint silver light illuminated an area of several feet.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged. "At night in the wilderness, there's a certain chance of losing direction. So it's better to cultivate at night and continue the journey when it's light."</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black wilderness, only Jiang Buping's spot had a faint light, appearing extremely small in the dark wilderness.</p><p></p><p>After setting up an alert formation, Jiang Buping began to cultivate, waiting for daybreak to continue his journey.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly the sound of howling wind arose in the distance, breaking the dark and silent wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping awoke with a start. He immediately put away the moonstone, concealed his aura, and merged into the darkness. After a moment's hesitation, he waved his hand to remove the formation and quietly changed position.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The sound of howling wind arose again, coming closer, but no wind could be felt blowing.</p><p></p><p>"Wind has appeared in the wilderness. I see a green flame jumping around, like a human face."</p><p></p><p>A message from Big Senior Brother came through the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 272</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Yushen Sect and the Su family was suddenly occupied by someone else.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful spiritual sects did not have time to react. By the time they had discussed and prepared to investigate, Shen Tai from the Shen family appeared.</p><p></p><p>After Zhu Liang, the newly ascended late-stage Refiner of the Yuzhou region became the number one expert of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family directly incorporated the territory of the Yushen Sect and the Su family into their own domain, without giving any share to the other powerful spiritual sects.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful spiritual sects were helpless. After witnessing the Genius Battle, they were awed by the strength of Xu Yan, especially the final scene, which had overturned their understanding of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Yushen Sect and the Su family might be coveted by Xu Yan, as that mysterious unaffiliated cultivator force was very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Since the Shen family has stepped forward, the others can only lend their support, just trying to stabilize their own territories is already difficult enough.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is the public facade. In reality, the territory of the Yushen Sect and the Su family is controlled by the Wanshi Alliance and the Shen family, who have reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family will not admit that they have colluded with the unaffiliated cultivator force. The Wanshi Alliance will also not admit that they have connections with the Shen family. They are in tacit understanding, with the Shen family ostensibly in control, while the resources are already divided.</p><p></p><p>The two spiritual mines of the Yushen Sect had their formations removed, and the Yushen Sect disciples mining there were shocked to discover that the Yushen Sect no longer existed! They suddenly fell from being spiritual sect disciples to becoming miners, a drastic change that many could not accept.</p><p></p><p>Some Yushen Sect disciples who considered themselves talented are leaving the mines, planning to seek out the other powerful spiritual sects and families.</p><p></p><p>The entire Yuzhou forces and cultivators are waiting for the Qingming Sect's response. How will Xu Yan deal with the Qingming Sect's retaliation, as they are the top-tier spiritual sect of Luozhou?</p><p></p><p>However, considering how the Heavenly Dao descended in an instant, causing Refiners to be annihilated, one cannot help but doubt whether the Qingming Sect has the power to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Qingming Sect, a peak Refiner, has already died.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Qingming Sect only has two peak Refiner experts left, the Sect Master Xing and the Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Qingming Sect mobilizes all their forces, can they really handle the powerful backer behind Xu Yan? Some experts who know the inner situation of the Spiritual Realm and are more familiar with the Genius Battle are observing, wondering if the Transcendent Spiritual Sect will respond.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps an even more powerful top-tier spiritual sect will intervene.</p><p></p><p>The significance of the Genius Battle is not just about the simple victory or defeat. One side represents the spiritual sects, the other the unaffiliated cultivators. The implications are far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan is suspected to be a genius cultivated by the former Wanxing Martial Academy, taking the first step to return to the Eighteen Prefectures of the Spiritual Realm. Qingzhou, the Yuling Manor.</p><p></p><p>The entire Qingzhou region is the territory of the Yuling Manor, which borders Tianling Prefecture, the main domain of the Spiritual Beast Clan. The disciples of the Yuling Manor, from the beginning of their martial cultivation, need to subdue the Yuling Spiritual Beasts and have a complex relationship with the Spiritual Beast Clan - both antagonistic and cooperative, with a certain degree of friendliness.</p><p></p><p>But without a doubt, the existence of the Yuling Manor is to intimidate the Spiritual Beast Clan, to prevent them from continuously growing stronger, and to confine the Spiritual Beast Clan within Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Beast Clan is naturally not weak in strength, but they are unable to harm the Yuling Manor, demonstrating the formidable power of this Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu, one of the true inheritors of the Yuling Manor, is the only one who witnessed the Genius Battle of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cui Huayu is respectfully waiting in the core area of the Yuling Manor.</p><p></p><p>Under the towering ancient tree, Cui Huayu is bowing, waiting. Not far from him is a white spiritual ape, eating a spiritual fruit and staring intently at Cui Huayu.</p><p></p><p>This is a peak sixth-stage spiritual beast, equivalent to the peak of the Refiner Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a spiritual fruit, the spiritual ape extended a hand and said, "Your clothes look nice, let me borrow them to wear."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's face turned green, but he could only obediently take off his colorful feather robe and hand it to the spiritual ape.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual ape was very excited, putting on the robe and looking left and right, nodding in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was very helpless. This spiritual ape was one of the strongest beings in the Yuling Manor, with a high status, and it had a peculiar habit of borrowing things it liked and never returning them.</p><p></p><p>The feather robe was a spiritual artifact that Cui Huayu had painstakingly collected many spiritual beast feathers, used rare materials, and commissioned top-tier forgers to craft over half a year.</p><p></p><p>Now it's gone, and he deeply regretted coming to this powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, a voice came from the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu took a deep breath and entered the old and simple wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the hut, an old man with white hair did not even look up as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple witnessed the Genius Battle in Yuzhou..."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu told the old man everything he had seen and heard, without omitting a single detail.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Transforming grass, wood, sand, and stone into swords? Transforming mountains into swords?"</p><p></p><p>The old man's tone revealed a sense of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao descended, turning into a battlefield of slaughter, instantly annihilating Refiners?"</p><p></p><p>The old man raised his head, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, disciple could not fathom what technique it was, nor how to summon the descent of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu nodded.</p><p></p><p>The old man fell silent for a while, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu curiously asked, "Disciple has never heard of such techniques in the Spiritual Realm. Master, do you know what martial art this is?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know much about it."</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression was puzzled and solemn. Based on Cui Huayu's description, it seemed to exceed his understanding.</p><p></p><p>The descent of the Heavenly Dao appears to be a realm only the highest-level cultivators can achieve. However, it did not seem to be the case here.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's heart was filled with awe. Even his master, a powerful expert, did not understand this?</p><p></p><p>"Can you confirm if that person was from the Wanxing Martial Academy?"</p><p></p><p>The old man asked after some thought.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary unaffiliated cultivators would not possess such techniques or cultivation, and it was likely only the former Wanxing Martial Academy that could have such powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts widely circulated in the Spiritual Realm were mostly derived from the Wanxing Martial Academy, which had broken the monopoly of the powerful spiritual sects over the martial dao to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxing Martial Academy, dedicated to the propagation of martial arts, undoubtedly had formidable strength, and there was a group of people within constantly researching the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>They had once developed powerful martial art secrets, so the old man immediately thought of the Wanxing Martial Academy.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a former Wanxing expert has researched and developed a new technique?</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, the Wanxing Martial Academy might be trying to make a comeback and rise again.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple cannot confirm."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Then just observe and see how things unfold."</p><p></p><p>The old man said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If it really is the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, this clash of geniuses will likely be reignited. We of the Lingzong Sect can defeat them once, and we can defeat them again.</p><p></p><p>"And after this time, the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy will have no more chances to come back."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>This was the confidence of the Chaoran Lingzong Sect. No matter if the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy made a comeback, in the end they would inevitably be crushed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this time I encountered a young girl, who seems to be a spirit-type talent. But she is unwilling to undergo testing, and the people around her are also very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu thought for a moment, then continued.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a spirit-type genius? How could she not join our Chaoran Lingzong Sect? How could she not be willing to join our Chaoran Lingzong Sect? You said the people around her are very strong, stronger than you?"</p><p></p><p>The elder was surprised.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a spirit-type talent that did not join the Chaoran Lingzong Sect? Furthermore, no matter what force they were from, no matter their background, as long as a spirit-type talent was discovered, they would immediately report it to the Chaoran Lingzong Sect. </p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity, a chance to rely on the Chaoran Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>No force would miss this chance.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Refiner Celestial, and not just any ordinary Refiner Celestial. I suspect he also has a spirit-type talent, but it doesn't quite fit..."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and his spiritual power sketched out the elder's appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, it's him."</p><p></p><p>The elder looked up, his brow furrowing. He lowered his gaze, but then suddenly raised his head again, staring intently at the elder's appearance that Cui Huayu had sketched.</p><p></p><p>His expression was one of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you know this person's identity?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elder's reaction, Cui Huayu asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The Moonlit Sky, one of the Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy in the past!"</p><p></p><p>The elder said solemnly, word by word.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was greatly shocked in his heart. This elder was actually one of the famous Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing in the past, no wonder his strength was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>But then he realized something was off.</p><p></p><p>If he was one of the Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing in the past, his strength should be even greater. However, although the elder's strength was formidable, he did not give Cui Huayu the feeling of facing an absolute powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, could you have mistaken his identity? I feel that while his strength is indeed very strong, but..."</p><p></p><p>The elder shook his head: "I cannot be mistaken."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he said: "The Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing in the past were all spirit-type geniuses, including the Moonlit Sky. But his spirit-type talent was crushed by someone from the Qianwu Hall.</p><p></p><p>"I thought he had died, or even been ruined. Unexpectedly, he has lived until now. </p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being called the Moonlit Sky, one of the Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing. That young girl must indeed possess a spirit-type talent."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was greatly shocked. His spirit-type talent had been crushed, yet not only had he survived, but his strength was still so powerful - truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Since he is from the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, does that mean Xu Yan is also a Wanxing genius?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps. We'll just have to see. But a mere Xu Yan, even if he is a genius, how could he affect the Lingdom? The Qingming Sect will take action, we'll just have to wait and see."</p><p></p><p>The elder said calmly.</p><p></p><p>This was the confidence of the Chaoran Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu nodded.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong Xu Yan was, how could he shake the Chaoran Lingzong Sect? The Blood Demon in the past was so powerful and arrogant, but in the end he was slain time and time again, until he was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xu Yan was stronger than the Blood Demon, it would not change anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, where do you think Xu Yan has hidden himself? We can't seem to find him anywhere?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was searching all over Zheng Country, passing by the manor several times.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming looked at his granddaughter affectionately and smiled: "To be able to hide, that's a skill!"</p><p></p><p>And inside the manor, it was as usual.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil outside, the Lingzong Sect's reaction, the impending retaliation from the Qingming Sect - none of it was a concern.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already reached the eighth page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>"The further in, the more profound the laws of heaven and earth become."</p><p></p><p>As he recorded more and more of the laws of heaven and earth, he had also created two more law pattern diagrams, and explained the concepts of the laws of heaven and earth to his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Half a month had passed since the conclusion of the battle of the geniuses. The four disciples' strength had all increased, and their comprehension of the Dao had also grown.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not far from fully mastering the Divine Intent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had made great strides in formations, seals, and the Heavenly Secrets.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Fang Hao was refining a blade.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, this blade not only can be large or small, but also has some other special properties. I can guarantee that in the entire Lingdom, this blade will be unparalleled!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"In the Dao of the Blade in this Lingdom, none can match me at the same realm!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother's Sword Dao was unrivaled, and his Blade Dao would be unrivaled as well.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to find an opportunity to show those cultivators of the Lingzong Sect what the true Dao of the Blade is!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his eldest senior brother's magnificent Myriad Sword Torrents that could turn mountains into swords, Meng Chong was greatly excited, as his own Blade Dao had not yet been revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother, do you want me to refine a sword for you?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at Xu Yan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then took out the Transparent Sword, saying, "This sword is only a treasure-grade weapon, but I'm used to using it. Just add some materials and refine it a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw Fang Hao refining a precious blade for Meng Chong, and an idea occurred to him. He had heard of the concepts of "blood-awakening" and "blood-refining" to imbue weapons with sentience and make them attuned to the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So he spoke up: "Nurturing a blade to sentience, blood-awakening, blood-refining, allowing the weapon to be in harmony with one's will, even to the point of integrating the weapon into one's dantian to nourish it..."</p><p></p><p>The three disciples were taken aback. They began to ponder this deeply.</p><p></p><p>The materials Meng Chong used to refine his blade were obtained from the Yushen Sect's treasury - they were extremely rare and precious in the Lingdom.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had used his current peak refining abilities to refine it, and it was not something that could be accomplished in a day or two.</p><p></p><p>It took a full seven days before the blade was finally shaped and nearing completion.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, you can try it."</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, the three senior brothers had contemplated how to put their master's words about nourishing weapons into practice.</p><p></p><p>They had finally come up with a method. Whether it would succeed, they could only try and see.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, took a deep breath, and squeezed out a drop of essence blood. He infused his Divine Intent and his comprehension of the Blade Dao into the blood.</p><p></p><p>Then he poured the blood onto the blade, where a formation diagram engraved by Fang Hao was located.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! The blood was absorbed by the blade, and the formation diagram faintly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao clapped his hands, the final refinement was complete!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ziyun thought for a moment and sat down next to him.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing by leaning on me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and moved away.</p><p></p><p>"I'm cold!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun continued to lean in closer.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, don't be rash. If you offend a powerful cultivator in the Spirit Realm, take out the jade token."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong knitted his brows and said, "I know what I'm doing!"</p><p></p><p>The ripples in front of the high peak gradually revealed the outline of a gateway.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a massive gateway was about to open.</p><p></p><p>At the Sky Treasure Pavilion, the purple-crowned man moved to the peak of the mountain, gazing at the distant rippling gateway with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm Gate is about to open? Why now? Could it be because of Su Ling Xiu?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the purple-crowned man's gaze became heavy, revealing a hint of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go to Canglan Island?" </p><p></p><p>He was unsure about the person on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, this is not something I can get involved in."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man sighed and returned to the Sky Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued cultivating while waiting for the Spirit Realm Gate to open.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There was no danger in the Celestial Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Du Yuying, protected by the Xuan Wind Sword Qi, entered the Celestial Tomb without encountering any special situations.</p><p></p><p>Only the last door leading into the tomb chamber seemed to have something attached to it, a faint fluctuation, perhaps the remnant consciousness of a Celestial Warrior?</p><p></p><p>However, that remnant spiritual consciousness was very weak and did not possess any thinking ability, seeming only like a mark.</p><p></p><p>When Du Yuying approached, the faint spiritual consciousness fluctuated, and the tomb chamber door opened.</p><p></p><p>As the tomb chamber door opened, the spiritual consciousness immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"For identity verification?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The tomb chamber was very spacious, with a central pool filled with dense spiritual energy, enveloping the entire chamber in a hazy spiritual mist.</p><p></p><p>Floating in the pool was a crystalline leaf-like spiritual herb, emanating a faint fragrance, and in the center of the leaf was a drop of blood-red liquid. It seemed to be a drop of essence blood!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying looked at the drop of essence blood on the leaf in the pool, and a mysterious desire arose in her heart, wanting to absorb it into her body.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, that is what I need. Absorbing it will solve my problem."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"There doesn't seem to be any danger here."</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Wind Sword Qi had scanned the tomb chamber, and if there were any remnant spiritual consciousness, Xu Yan would have immediately sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, I don't need the spiritual herb in the pool. You can take it for your cultivation. The pool contains abundant spiritual energy, which is also a good place for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying began to undress while speaking in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze remained calm, without the slightest change, and he nodded, saying, "I don't need the spiritual herb, it may not be suitable for me, but I can cultivate in the pool."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was wearing a thin, tight-fitting garment, revealing much of her jade-like delicate skin, stunningly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Her jade-like face flushed red, and she stole a glance at Xu Yan, only to find that he was staring at the pool, as if the pool was more attractive than her.</p><p></p><p>He was not at all captivated by her beauty.</p><p></p><p>She felt a little disappointed, but also admired him greatly, "Indeed, Young Master Xu is pure-hearted and handsome."</p><p></p><p>She stepped into the pool and gently placed the drop of blood on her palm, absorbing it into her skin. The drop of blood seemed to contain a certain spiritual charm.</p><p></p><p>Under the nourishment of the pool and the spiritual herb, it had transformed into a drop of spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual blood slowly seeped into her delicate skin, causing a flush to spread across her fair skin, making her even more alluring.</p><p></p><p>Thump! Thump! Du Yuying felt her heartbeat accelerating, a warm current circulating in her body, as if her body was becoming more rounded, and some unknown defects were being repaired.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy surged into her body from the pool.</p><p></p><p>A sense of drowsiness overcame her, and Du Yuying's eyelids grew heavy, wanting to fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>With great difficulty, she raised her head and saw Xu Yan standing by the pool, observing the changes in her body. At that moment, her heart calmed, and she closed her eyes, falling into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched Du Yuying in the pool, sensing that she was undergoing a transformation, as if the defects in her body were being repaired.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that there was no danger, he stepped into the pool and sat down on the other side. The spiritual mist in the tomb chamber surged into his body like a whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the pool also continuously flowed into his body. Xu Yan realized that the spiritual energy in the pool seemed to be endless, no matter how much he absorbed, it would never be exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be a spiritual crystal vein underneath the pool?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Tomb should have other treasures to be found, and Xu Yan was in no hurry to search for them, instead choosing to settle down and begin cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He transformed into a Mountain-River Spiritual Body, and the terrifying spiritual energy constantly poured into his body, being frantically refined into true essence.</p><p></p><p>"This time, breaking through to the Small Perfection of the Penetrating the Profound Realm should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the spiritual mist in the tomb chamber had been completely absorbed by Xu Yan, while the spiritual energy in the pool continued to flow endlessly, showing no signs of drying up.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became increasingly convinced that the pool was built upon a spiritual crystal vein.</p><p></p><p>Considering that this was the Celestial Tomb, having a spiritual crystal vein here was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, his aura surged, and he broke through to the Small Perfection of the Penetrating the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I've reached the Small Perfection of the Penetrating the Profound Realm. The distance to the Great Perfection is not too far, and even without using the pool for cultivation, I wouldn't be too far from breaking through to the Great Perfection."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan got out of the pool. Du Yuying's physical defects had been completely repaired, and her aura had become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Great Perfection Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Shifting his gaze, Xu Yan examined the tomb chamber and saw that after the spiritual mist had dissipated, a section of the tomb chamber wall had been hollowed out.</p><p></p><p>In the recess, a coffin was placed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but become curious. Why was the coffin placed in a recess instead of in the main tomb chamber?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had woken up.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were filled with excitement. The problem with her body had been solved, and her strength had greatly increased. More importantly, she felt that her innate talent had also improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>After getting out of the pool, she used her cultivation to evaporate the water on her body and put her clothes back on.</p><p></p><p>"Who was the owner of this tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked as he approached the coffin.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about the Celestial Warriors.</p><p></p><p>"It may be an ancestor, but I'm not sure. I only know this is the place left behind by my ancestors, where I can remedy my physical defects. The specifics, I'm not too clear about."</p><p></p><p>It seemed there was some secret here that she didn't know about.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This should be passed down to the next generation," Du Yuying said softly.</p><p></p><p>"There is one more thing here that is very important, but I'm not entirely sure of its specific use," she added after a moment of thought.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"A jade token, a jade plaque!" </p><p></p><p>The two then arrived at the concave hollow.</p><p></p><p>The coffin was pitch black, made of an unknown material, and there seemed to be lines of small characters written in fresh blood on its surface.</p><p></p><p>"Bury the Blood Demon here! Whether it is grace or resentment, it ends here; born in lowliness, also buried in the wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>In front of the small characters, on the coffin lid, lay a jade plaque.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon?" Xu Yan took out the jade plaque and handed it to Du Yuying, puzzled, "Was your ancestor the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying put away the jade plaque and shook her head, "No, it should be that my ancestor buried the Blood Demon." After a pause, she added, "To be precise, it was my ancestress who buried the Blood Demon."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked towards the concave hollow and suddenly noticed some patterns drawn on the wall, which seemed to depict a person's life. Clearly, it was the life of the Blood Demon! This was the tomb of a Heavenly Immortal, and the Blood Demon was undoubtedly a Martial Dao Heavenly Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but be curious about the life of this Martial Dao Heavenly Immortal and carefully examined the drawings on the wall.</p><p></p><p>The first painting showed a woman in a small mountain village giving birth to a baby...</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan looked through the paintings one by one, he sighed deeply at the life of the Blood Demon - an illegitimate child of a noble family, not recognized, and subjected to all kinds of humiliation. He entered a sect to cultivate, but was also mocked and scorned.</p><p></p><p>Later, he was saved by a woman, and he fell in love with her, but she was infatuated with another man... A tangled web of love and hatred, he killed the woman's beloved, and in her grief and rage, she stabbed him in the chest, but then seemed to soften her heart and left.</p><p></p><p>The severely injured Blood Demon went into hiding, pursued by others. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw a painting where the woman was kneeled on the ground, being scolded by a group of people who seemed to be the family of her beloved, accusing her of letting the Blood Demon go and having an entangled relationship with him. A young girl stood up to defend the woman.</p><p></p><p>In one painting, the group forced the young girl, and the woman stood up and committed suicide to end all grievances, and at that moment, the Blood Demon appeared. The Blood Demon, embracing the woman's body, fled, while the young girl seemed to curse the Blood Demon even as she protected him.</p><p></p><p>In one painting, the crazed Blood Demon mistook the young girl for the woman and pounced on her...</p><p></p><p>The last few paintings depicted city after city in a sea of blood and corpses, with a lone figure standing with a sword.</p><p></p><p>The sect was destroyed, and a group of bloodthirsty people spread out, devouring spiritual essence to strengthen themselves. </p><p></p><p>In the second-to-last painting, a group of powerful experts attacked and killed the bloodthirsty people, besieging the Blood Demon, and a portal opened, allowing the Blood Demon to escape.</p><p></p><p>The final painting showed a great mountain, and the young girl from the past pierced the Blood Demon's head...</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" Xu Yan was suddenly filled with doubt. The great mountain in the last painting seemed to be the Boundless Great Mountain!</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon? Could it be the Demon Sect's Demon Lord?" The Demon Lord had suddenly disappeared, and it turned out that he was killed, and the Blood Demon was the Demon Lord, not from the Inner Domain!</p><p></p><p>"It's said that my ancestress was seriously injured, and it was my ancestor who saved her, and they ended up together..." Du Yuying spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"Your ancestress was a powerful Heavenly Immortal expert, and your ancestor..." Xu Yan trailed off.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it was to repay a debt," Du Yuying thought for a moment and continued, "The ancestress I mentioned is not from the Du Hou Wang Mansion, my bloodline is more from my mother's side. Generation after generation, they only passed down to daughters, and they all gave birth to daughters as well, perhaps because the Heavenly Immortal bloodline was too strong."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, after learning about the tragic life of the Blood Demon, he couldn't help but sigh. Just as the inscription on the coffin said, born in lowliness, buried in the wilderness, that was his final resting place.</p><p></p><p>As they exited the concave hollow, Xu Yan noticed some paintings and words on the ceiling of the tomb chamber.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The paintings on the ceiling depicted a grand mountain with pavilions, towers, lakes, and beautiful scenery. A woman stood in a pavilion, as if reminiscing about something.</p><p></p><p>Next to the mountain, three characters were carved: Tai Miao Sect!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took out the jade plaque, and sure enough, the words "Tai Miao" were engraved on it.</p><p></p><p>"The Tai Miao Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exclaimed in delight.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm, the three realms of Heavenly Immortals?"</p><p></p><p>Next to the paintings, there were lines of text introducing the Martial Dao Heavenly Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Immortals are divided into three realms, each a higher level of heaven. The first realm is called the Small Heavenly Immortal, the second realm the Great Heavenly Immortal, and the third realm the Refined Spiritual Heavenly Immortal...</p><p></p><p>"The Gathering Spiritual cultivates and gathers one's own spirit, the Combining Spiritual combines the spirit and soul into one, and the Refining Spiritual refines the spirit and soul...</p><p></p><p>"The spirit and soul do not perish, they can be transmitted to a new body..."</p><p></p><p>The text on the stone wall did not pass down any cultivation methods, but rather introduced the three realms of Heavenly Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind raced as he recalled Meng Chong's previous encounter and the experience of Elder Wu. Could it be that the Blood Demon, or the Demon Lord, had not completely perished, but had fled with a remnant of his spirit, and eventually chose to inhabit Elder Wu's body? And when Meng Chong's sword spirit awakened and comprehended the Dao of the Sword, it completely extinguished the Blood Demon's remaining spirit! The final painting in the concave hollow showed the Blood Demon being killed in the Boundless Great Mountain, and Elder Wu had entered the Boundless Great Mountain, leading to the subsequent events in the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that his speculation was likely the truth.</p><p></p><p>He continued to read the introduction to the three realms of Heavenly Immortals. Although there were no cultivation methods passed down, the information still had its value.</p><p></p><p>"The first realm of Heavenly Immortals is to cultivate and gather one's own spirit... The Realm of Spiritual Intention is theoretically at the same level as the first realm of Heavenly Immortals, but the Realm of Spiritual Intention is to refine the Martial Dao Spiritual Intention, to refine the will of Heaven and Earth into Spiritual Intention..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of Heavenly Immortals is to cultivate and gather one's own spirit, and the strength of one's own spirit determines the strength of the first realm. The Realm of Spiritual Intention is to refine the Martial Dao Spiritual Intention, to refine the will of Heaven and Earth - my Sword Intention is already capable of withstanding the power of the first realm of Heavenly Immortals, as their own spirit is ultimately limited. But the Martial Dao Spiritual Intention, which embodies the will of Heaven and Earth, is something that the first realm cannot compare to.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a realization - the truly powerful among the Heavenly Immortals are those in the third realm, the Refined Spiritual Heavenly Immortals. </p><p></p><p>The first and second realms are only the foundation of Heavenly Immortal cultivation, and only the Refined Spiritual Heavenly Immortals can be truly called true Heavenly Immortals!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

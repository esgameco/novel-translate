        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui was dead. Although his sneak attack failed to kill the masked Xiongsha, he had still severely wounded his opponent. More significantly, this was the first time such an incident had occurred within the Tiansha Diying organization, causing ripples that were only just beginning.</p><p></p><p>The masked Xiongsha's aura was weak, his injuries extremely severe. If not for his powerful strength, he likely would have perished already. </p><p></p><p>Even so, his current injuries were so grave that it would take several years of recuperation to fully recover. They had even affected his foundation, causing his power to decline.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..." </p><p></p><p>The outpost leader who had killed Shen Kui hurriedly came over, wanting to treat the masked Xiongsha's wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!" </p><p></p><p>The masked Xiongsha's eyes changed as he spoke sternly.</p><p></p><p>The outpost leader halted, his eyes innocent as his lips moved slightly before saying, "My lord, I had nothing to do with this..."</p><p></p><p>He was wrongly accused. How could he have known that this Diying member would betray them?</p><p></p><p>"I know you weren't involved, but this matter is of great importance. Whether the plans of Tiansha Diying have been leaked still requires investigation. </p><p></p><p>Send a message for the others to come here..."</p><p></p><p>The masked Xiongsha's eyes shifted slightly as his voice softened and he gave the order.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The outpost leader's expression changed slightly beneath his mask. His heart sank as he realized he may be in danger! He had notified the Tiansha lord to come here, where he was then ambushed. How could he not be suspected? Speaking this way was only because the lord had been severely injured and feared he might take advantage of the situation to attack.</p><p></p><p>If the other Tiansha Diying members arrived, would he find himself in a dangerous situation? </p><p></p><p>Would he even be treated as a traitor? Tiansha Diying had never had a traitor before. He dared not imagine what consequences the first traitor would face.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on that fierce mask, which had two leaves engraved on it, indicating this was a Two-Leaf Tiansha.</p><p></p><p>Tiansha ranked their levels by strength. A Two-Leaf Tiansha was not the weakest among them, but also not particularly strong. </p><p></p><p>It was rumored that Seven-Leaf Tiansha were Immortal Venerable realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Diying, on the other hand, did not rank levels by strength, but rather by infiltration abilities, meritorious service, and completed missions.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, I've sent out the message."</p><p></p><p>The outpost leader reported respectfully after completing the task.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" The masked Xiongsha nodded, still maintaining vigilance despite his grave injuries.</p><p></p><p>For a time, silence fell over the outpost, the atmosphere somewhat oppressive. </p><p></p><p>The outpost leader looked at Shen Kui's corpse on the ground, his eyes shifting. The real traitor was dead, and he had been the first to interact with this traitor. </p><p></p><p>He was also the one who had sent the message for the Tiansha to come here.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more his heart sank. He stole another glance at the masked Xiongsha, whose injuries were so severe that he retained barely a tenth of his power.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, he remained vigilant, guarding against him.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, are you suspecting me?" </p><p></p><p>Finally, the outpost leader spoke up gravely.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be? Don't overthink things!"</p><p></p><p>The masked Xiongsha's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"The traitor is dead. I was the last person he saw before dying, and I was the one who sent you the message. It's normal for you to suspect me, but I truly am innocent."</p><p></p><p>As the outpost leader spoke, he suddenly gritted his teeth and drew his weapon.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you were ambushed, so why aren't you dead? If you died, I wouldn't have so much trouble!"</p><p></p><p>The outpost leader suddenly realized - if the Tiansha died, then the one who ambushed him would be Shen Kui, and he himself would be innocent. </p><p></p><p>It was only that his strength was limited and he hadn't been able to save the Tiansha lord in time.</p><p></p><p>Yes, that's right!</p><p></p><p>"You traitor!" </p><p></p><p>The masked Xiongsha roared in anger, disregarding his injuries as he unleashed his aura and struck out, turning to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, how could he escape in his gravely injured state? A brief clash erupted in the outpost before quickly falling silent again.</p><p></p><p>The wound in the masked Xiongsha's chest had grown even larger, and now he was completely lifeless.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you died at the hands of a traitor..." </p><p></p><p>The outpost leader muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Some turmoil arose within Tiansha Diying as a traitor had appeared. For a time, everyone became wary of each other, fearing the person beside them might suddenly attack.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly, the impact of Shen Kui's incident on Tiansha Diying would continue.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan, the instigator behind all this, knew nothing of it. He still thought Shen Kui was from the Wan family and had gone back to attack someone from the Wan family after leaving.</p><p></p><p>He believed Shen Kui had gone to assassinate Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had now entered a large city in Mount Dagui.</p><p></p><p>Then he discovered that he had a bounty on his head, placed by the Wan family!</p><p></p><p>"Very good, very good. While I was cultivating all this time, you've been searching for me, wanting to assassinate me, is that right? I killed Wan Tianlin, let's see what your Wan family can do to me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was furious.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother concealing his identity, swaggering around the city openly. He even deliberately went to a Wan family shop and left information about wanting to sell blood heart fruits.</p><p></p><p>"The person with the Wan family bounty has appeared, quickly capture him!"</p><p></p><p>"Here's our chance to make merit for the family and for young master Wan Tianlin!"</p><p></p><p>Some True Monarchs in the city were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who they had been searching for in vain, had suddenly appeared! Especially the Wan family warriors felt as if they could already see themselves being promoted for their meritorious service.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strode out of the city nonchalantly, with True Monarchs and Venerable Ones pursuing him.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>A Wan family True Monarch roared angrily as he attacked swiftly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan swung his sword, using the Heaven-Severing Sword technique! Swish! With one strike, that True Monarch hurriedly defended but still couldn't fully block the attack. He was instantly gravely wounded.</p><p></p><p>This single sword strike made the other True Monarchs hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Wan Tianlin, if he wants the blood heart fruit and wants to kill me, then come!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered before vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin had put himself at risk to lure him out, so Xu Yan simply used the blood heart fruit to draw Wan Tianlin to him instead.</p><p></p><p>Given Wan Tianlin's arrogance and the backing of the Wan family, he would certainly show up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see just how many True Monarchs your Wan family sends to encircle and kill me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed coldly to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even peak True Monarchs were not enough to threaten him.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to leave, no one could stop him. </p><p></p><p>Although the Wan family had Immortal Venerable powerhouses, they could not easily leave their posts to come here.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's appearance instantly stirred up a storm in the Mount Dagui region.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family and the True Monarchs and Venerable Ones who had come from Thousand-Layered Mountain all began to take action.</p><p></p><p>"You want me to show myself? Fine, I'll go. Let's see what forces are backing you!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin sneered.</p><p></p><p>While Immortal Venerables could not easily leave their posts, the Wan family's deterrent power did not rely solely on Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>There were also vast differences in strength among True Monarchs and Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family will certainly try to kill him. This person cannot die - we must bring him to Thousand-Layered Mountain. So no matter what, if he encounters danger, we must help him escape at all costs!"</p><p></p><p>The True Monarchs and Venerable Ones from Thousand-Layered Mountain gathered and spoke gravely.</p><p></p><p>Their mission was to lure Xu Yan to the Demon Sorcerer's Abyss in Thousand-Layered Mountain. If Xu Yan died, how could they complete their task?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has appeared. How should we proceed? Will the plan be affected?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Loophole?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the cave, several masked figures gathered together.</p><p></p><p>This time, one person was missing from the gathering - the one with the fierce mask. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, they all tacitly maintained some distance from each other, vaguely guarding against one another, as if there was a traitor among them.</p><p></p><p>"We can just sit back and watch them fight. Whether Wan Tianlin dies or Xu Yan dies, the plan will be considered successful," one person said.</p><p></p><p>"What if Xu Yan and Wan Tianlin reconcile?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, how could they possibly reconcile? Their hatred runs deep."</p><p></p><p>"You should know that the grudge between Xu Yan and Wan Tianlin was instigated by us behind the scenes. If the plan is leaked, will Wan Tianlin and Xu Yan continue to fight each other?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the cave fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Everyone was quiet.</p><p></p><p>That traitor came from the Diying infiltrated in the Wan family. If the plan was leaked...</p><p></p><p>They dared not imagine!</p><p></p><p>"When will the new Lord Tianshe arrive?" someone broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>"Probably in the next two or three days."</p><p></p><p>After the previous Tianshe in charge of this area was killed, they had been waiting for the new Tianshe to arrive since the news was sent up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for Lord Tianshe to arrive before making a decision!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, they all made a relatively favorable decision.</p><p></p><p>The situation in Tianshe Diying was unclear, and they couldn't act rashly. Otherwise, if problems arose, it would be easy to be targeted!</p><p></p><p>In the Dagaishan area, there was a straight stone peak standing tall. Xu Yan stood proudly at the top of the stone peak, waiting quietly for Wan Tianlin to arrive.</p><p></p><p>He was so direct, not concealing his whereabouts at all.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is over there. Should we go up and tell him to flee quickly, or lure him to Qiandie Mountain with treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't show ourselves. Wait until Xu Yan is in danger, then we'll step in to help. This way we can surely get him to follow us to Qiandie Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Venerables who came from Qiandie Mountain were extremely excited at this moment, finally about to complete their mission.</p><p></p><p>"I, Wan Tianlin, have arrived. Whatever tricks you have, bring them on."</p><p></p><p>Three figures approached, one of whom was Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>On his left and right were two elders, whose auras seemed to merge with heaven and earth, far beyond ordinary peak True King Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin also came directly, not concealing himself, and appeared openly.</p><p></p><p>The two clan elders accompanying him were both powerful True Kings with respected positions in the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. These two True Kings from the Wan family were extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>However, they were still not enough to break through the defense of the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword, so there was no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and a Blood Heart Fruit appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Heart Fruit you want is here. Whether you can obtain it depends on your abilities, Wan Tianlin!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin took a deep breath. A cold light swept out like a bolt of silk, the Spirit Cicada Blade struck out, its soft cold edge sweeping towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out with his sword. The sword light was magnificent, like a surging wave rolling forward, completely suppressing Wan Tianlin's attack. The sword light continued forward, threatening to engulf Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin was only at the early stage of True King Celestial Venerable. Although his strength was top-tier among those at the same level, much stronger than Shen Kui, he was somewhat weak compared to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't threaten Xu Yan at all.</p><p></p><p>Killing Wan Tianlin wouldn't be too difficult either.</p><p></p><p>Light shimmered in Xu Yan's eyes. Every attack from Wan Tianlin appeared full of flaws to him.</p><p></p><p>Each sword strike hit the weak points in Wan Tianlin's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>After just a moment of exchange, Wan Tianlin had to dodge the sharp edge and retreat, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>He was also greatly shocked inside. This person seemed even younger than him, yet his strength was so powerful. Which force's prodigy was he from?</p><p></p><p>Especially his sword techniques, which were truly marvelous beyond compare.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, considering your good talent, if you hand over the Blood Heart Fruit and submit to our Wan family, we can spare your life!" </p><p></p><p>Unable to withstand Xu Yan's attacks, one of the Wan family elders stepped forward and said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention you're not an Immortal Celestial Venerable, even if you were, you wouldn't be qualified to speak to me like that."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Wan family elder struck out with one attack.</p><p></p><p>This attack seemed to carry the might of heaven and earth, like a giant hammer smashing down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Around Xu Yan, the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword circulated endlessly, manifesting mountains and rivers within the sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Under the circulation of the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword, the Wan family elder's attack instantly weakened, then was countered back.</p><p></p><p>"This is...!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder's expression changed as he struck out again, blocking the countered attack with a loud boom.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's face darkened. This person's martial techniques were marvelously extraordinary. Which force did he come from?</p><p></p><p>"Attack together!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder took a deep breath. He was shocked to discover that with his strength alone, he seemed unable to break through that mysteriously circulating sword light.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The other Wan family elder's aura erupted as he prepared to attack as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several figures flew over.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family is shameless, ganging up on one person. We are your opponents!"</p><p></p><p>Although not as strong, these True King Celestial Venerables were no less imposing in their aura, looking ready to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>"It's you?" </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's gaze turned cold. "So you really are in cahoots!"</p><p></p><p>He recognized them as the group of foreign True King Celestial Venerables who were searching for Xu Yan, seemingly from Qiandie Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that those targeting the Wan family and him, Wan Tianlin, were from Qiandie Mountain?</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family cannot be underestimated. They came prepared this time. We must not be careless. Quickly follow me and leave."</p><p></p><p>A True King Celestial Venerable came to the stone peak and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a surprised expression. Why were these True King Celestial Venerables helping him? Were they True King Celestial Venerables from the Qinghua Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"We were ordered by an important person to protect you, young master!" </p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Venerable said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This person is lying! Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and activated his Small Heavenly Dao Eye. At this moment, he discovered the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Their minds have fallen, bewitched?"</p><p></p><p>These True King Celestial Venerables had their minds controlled and had become servants.</p><p></p><p>Who was targeting him?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan secretly tensed up. He had just arrived in the Nine Mountains Realm and had never made enemies with anyone. These True King Celestial Venerables were not from the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Wan family, who else would target him?</p><p></p><p>"The Small Heavenly Dao Eye is truly marvelous. Previously, I wouldn't have been able to discover that they had lost their minds and been bewitched."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly had a realization. Bewitched minds? In that instant, he had a familiar feeling. He seemed to have seen this state of these True Kings somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>"Ice State, Charming Witch!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened. He knew the Charming Witch wasn't dead, as his master had already told him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that as soon as he arrived in the Nine Mountains Realm, he would be targeted by the Charming Witch.</p><p></p><p>"Does she want revenge?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was inwardly alarmed and didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>How strong the Charming Witch's power was remained unknown for now. The strength of the Charming Witch's incarnation that descended in the Nine Mountains Realm was also unknown.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 486</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's your status within the True Dragon clan?" Xu Yan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"My... my grandfather is the ruler of the Dragon Realm, and I'm rather special - I'm the only Jade Snow True Dragon, with thunder and ice powers..." Ao Yuxue hesitated before replying.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others suddenly understood. No wonder Ao Yuxue had been chosen. Moreover, Tianshadiying must have deeper intentions, needing to borrow power from the Dragon Realm through Ao Yuxue, or even plot something. </p><p></p><p>However, plans don't always go as expected. Ao Yuxue had been subdued by Xu Yan! This meant that Xu Yan had disrupted Tianshadiying's schemes, and would inevitably be targeted by Tianshadiying's powerful experts. At the same time, he had also offended the True Dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the True Dragon clan, this was a great humiliation!</p><p></p><p>"Why are you able to transform into human form?" Xu Yan asked the question on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Other spirit beasts and true spirits seemed unable to take human form, so why could Ao Yuxue? Or rather, why could the True Dragon clan?</p><p></p><p>"It's an innate talent of my True Dragon clan!" Ao Yuxue said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why can the True Dragon clan transform into human form?" When in doubt, it was natural to ask the master. So Xu Yan curiously inquired.</p><p></p><p>"That little dragon obtained the purple light, and used a strand of it to give the dragon clan the ability to transform into human form," Li Xuan explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already grasped the mystery of why the True Dragon clan could transform. It was simply that the founder of the True Dragon clan had used a strand of purple light on the bloodline of their descendants, giving the True Dragon clan the ability to take human form.</p><p></p><p>The first intelligent non-transforming true spirit that Tai Cang encountered back then was a true dragon, and Tai Cang's strength and martial mysteries had a strong impact on it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was also the reason why the True Dragon clan developed the ability to transform into human form.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan and the others suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue looked at Li Xuan with curiosity all over her face. This master of Xu Yan seemed very, very powerful? </p><p></p><p>Was the "little dragon" he mentioned the ancestor who founded the True Dragon clan?</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go inside to recuperate?" Xu Yan took out the Primordial Turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Ao Yuxue shook her head. Although the Primordial Turtle shell was like a small world, it was ultimately an enclosed space. Being inside was no different from being in prison.</p><p></p><p>"Then find your own place to stay. You are not allowed to leave the Medicine Hall without permission!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Ao Yuxue tactfully left.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou, Du Yuying and the others also respectfully bid farewell and departed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only the master and his six disciples remained.</p><p></p><p>With his five disciples reunited, Li Xuan felt quite gratified. It was not in vain that he had spent so much effort creating the martial way - his disciples had finally achieved success in their studies.</p><p></p><p>Especially his eldest disciple Xu Yan, who was still the pioneer of his martial way. Now he was only half a step away from perfecting the Void-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from the Heaven and Earth realm either.</p><p></p><p>Once he entered the Heaven and Earth realm, with Xu Yan's divine abilities and sword techniques, he would not fear even Deity Lord realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>And if he broke through to the great completion of the Heaven and Earth realm, he would not fear even Supreme realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Establishment realm is not too far off either." Li Xuan felt quite gratified. Once one entered Dao Establishment, they would transcend heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping were all recounting their experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I found these for you in the Sea Spirit clan's treasure vault." Xu Yan took out the treasures he had selected from the Sea Spirit clan's vault.</p><p></p><p>A stone jar and a jade scroll.</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan saw them, he felt even more gratified. "I'll accept them then." </p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the stone jar and jade scroll fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the stone jar were emerald green leaves, with veins like laws, and lingering charm.</p><p></p><p>"These tea leaves are not bad, far superior to the spirit tea we drink now. This jar of tea leaves, even that fellow Tianzi wouldn't consider it trash, right?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The stone jar was forged from special materials that did not exist within heaven and earth, and could only be found in the Unchanging Lands.</p><p></p><p>The person who made the stone jar must have been at least a small world lord in strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw through the nature of the stone jar at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo scroll was even more extraordinary, made from bamboo more precious than the stone jar.</p><p></p><p>"I've already finished reading the Tai Cang Book, so it's perfect timing to take a look at this bamboo scroll and see what strange tales it records." Li Xuan revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan took out treasures one by one, all for his junior brothers and sisters, carefully selected by him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping looked a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, although I extorted a sum from the Treasure Alliance, the treasures are all rather ordinary, far inferior to eldest senior brother's..." Meng Chong said as he took out those treasures.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping did the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and smiled, "These treasures are of no use to me. You can keep them for yourselves. The tea in this stone jar and the records in this bamboo scroll are just right for me to pass the time."</p><p></p><p>"Master, we understand!" Meng Chong and Jiang Buping nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Given their master's level, what treasures could catch his eye?</p><p></p><p>A jar of spirit tea and a bamboo scroll just suited their master's leisurely nature, useful for passing time. So next time they encountered such things, they should select some to bring back as filial offerings to their master.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, eldest senior brother understood their master best. No wonder eldest senior brother's strength was always ridiculously high - because he had gained more insights into the Dao from their master!</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping recounted their adventures in the Divine Realm, Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu listened with longing expressions, wishing they could go out and have adventures too.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Sect is already on the right track and will surely grow stronger. As the sect leader of Qinghua, I will definitely be able to make a name for myself in this era of great changes in the world." Fang Hao said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, once my medicinal pills are promoted, who would dare not revere me as the Medicine Immortal?" Su Lingxiu had an excited look on her face.</p><p></p><p>The master and disciples gathered joyfully. In the end, they inevitably discussed matters of the martial way.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already reached the Dao Establishment realm. As a true expert, he naturally had no problem guiding his disciples in martial arts and divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ability Martial Classic was nearly perfected, with almost all 3,000 great divine abilities compiled.</p><p></p><p>With all his disciples present, it was the perfect time to give them some guidance in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other five had respectful expressions as they took turns asking about their doubts regarding the martial way. Li Xuan gave them guidance one by one.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Great Yue Kingdom had already been renamed Qinghua Spirit City, the location of the Qinghua Sect's headquarters.</p><p></p><p>After major expansion, Qinghua City was no longer comparable to the former Great Yue capital. Even the original Great Yue Heavenly Pit had been incorporated into the great city, becoming an important place for the Medicine Faction.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao walked dazedly through Qinghua City, unconsciously arriving at the location of the Great Yue Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" Old Man Xiao had a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>This place should have been a heavenly pit, but now it seemed to have become a furnace.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that inside the heavenly pit, it was as if many small furnaces had been opened up. Numerous martial artists were throwing spirit herbs and divine herbs into them.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside, something was being refined.</p><p></p><p>This refining method was unlike anything he had ever seen before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the pills that were produced, Old Man Xiao was shocked in his heart. This method of refining medicine was far superior to Taicang's current pharmaceutical methods.</p><p></p><p>Using the same grade of medicinal materials, combined and refined according to certain rules, it was as if a transformation had occurred. The efficacy was more than ten times that of pills made using Taicang's current pharmaceutical methods.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, Old Man Xiao approached one of the pill-refining furnaces and silently observed. With his strength, the alchemists of Changqing Pavilion naturally could not detect anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Then, Old Man Xiao looked towards the core of the Heavenly Cave and was shocked once again. That place was originally the entrance for otherworldly enemies, presumably where the Netherworld realm had invaded this place. Yet it had somehow become a place that gathered otherworldly auras and Netherworld auras, and even had the power of heavenly laws descending upon it.</p><p></p><p>It was actually using heavenly laws to fuse otherworldly qi and Netherworld qi to refine some kind of pill! And these pills had powerful effects, allowing even Immortal Realm and Heavenly Union Realm martial artists to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"What a marvelous method!" Old Man Xiao exclaimed in admiration at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His dazed mind gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Dao?!"</p><p></p><p>Silently mouthing this title, Old Man Xiao now deeply felt the power and profound meaning behind these two words.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Taicang teacher was strong, he ultimately perished. And the Taicang teacher had not fully explored the Unchanging Lands either. So what's strange about there being even stronger beings?" </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Old Man Xiao came to terms with it.</p><p></p><p>It was not unacceptable that Taicang was inferior to the Ancestor of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Lands were boundless - who could know what existences were hidden within? Just like how the Unchanging Divine Palace had appeared from somewhere in the Unchanging Lands and approached the Seven Great Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should ask the Ancestor of the Dao how to proceed on the path ahead?" Old Man Xiao pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was already a Realm Lord. In terms of strength, some weak minor Realm Lords were no match for him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those minor Realm Lords, having obtained the purple light of world creation, while weaker than him would not be too much weaker. And their self-preservation abilities were extremely strong, making them difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>What he lacked was that purple light of world creation.</p><p></p><p>Without this purple light, Old Man Xiao felt he had reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming the Lord of the Taicang Realm, that was not so easy to achieve. The schemes of Tianshai and others were destined to come to nothing.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao came out of the Heavenly Cave and looked in the direction where Li Xuan was. He hesitated, wondering whether he should go pay his respects immediately and ask for guidance on the martial path ahead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Man Xiao's expression changed as he looked back towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Four figures were crossing the wilderness, heading straight for Qinghua City. In an instant, as if locking onto their target, they went directly towards the Medicine Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai's lackeys?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's expression sank. He felt his opportunity had come.</p><p></p><p>This was the perfect chance to kill Tianshai's lackeys and curry favor with the Ancestor of the Dao. By doing so, he could naturally ask the Ancestor for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Old Man Xiao was secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai, your lackeys have come at just the right time."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was excited, a faint smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, concealing his aura, and instantly caught up. He planned to strike with lightning speed to kill Tianshai's lackeys and make a good impression on the Ancestor of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the Medicine Academy, Li Xuan was instructing his disciples in the martial way.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other four were immersed in their master's explanation of martial arts. Some previously confusing points suddenly became clear, and they gained new understanding of mystical techniques they hadn't grasped before.</p><p></p><p>In particular, they made significant progress in how to strengthen their innate mystical abilities and how to bring out the unique power of these abilities.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>Four powerful auras surged forth, shocking all the martial artists in Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor's figure appeared, a look of shock on his face as he gazed at the four figures that had suddenly appeared. Even though he had broken through to the Heavenly Union Realm, he felt as insignificant as an ant in the face of this aura.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor was stunned. Where had such powerful martial artists come from? Could they have descended from the Dao Realm?</p><p></p><p>But the fallen realm had not yet merged with the Divine Realm, and the disturbances in the Divine Realm had not yet subsided. Powerhouses from the Dao Realm should not be able to descend.</p><p></p><p>"Were such strong beings hidden in the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor then realized that the powerful aura released by those four strong beings was directed at the Medicine Academy - their target was very clear!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Sect is too weak. We have to rely on the Ancestor of the Dao to deal with strong enemies."</p><p></p><p>These four were heading for the Medicine Academy, clearly targeting Xu Yan and the others. The three who had made such a great name for themselves had just returned and were at the Ancestor's residence.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Venerable realm martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others looked up.</p><p></p><p>The aura of these four was extremely powerful, far beyond what Heavenly Union Realm martial artists should possess. They were clearly Divine Venerable realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai Diying's people!</p><p></p><p>"They're coming for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instantly understood that they were coming for him, for the Dragon Subduing technique.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue, who was recuperating, walked out of the house.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou and the others did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan..."</p><p></p><p>Among the four Divine Venerable martial artists, one immediately fixed his gaze on Xu Yan and spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly raised his head to look, as if displeased at being interrupted while instructing his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity has come!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai was such a good person, actually sending him such a perfect opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to unleash his aura to suppress the four and righteously denounce them for daring to disturb the Ancestor's peace, before swiftly killing them...</p><p></p><p>He heard a light snort.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>It was a light snort, not loud, and not directed at Old Man Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But Old Man Xiao's scalp tingled, his eyes widened, and he was so frightened that cold sweat almost poured out.</p><p></p><p>With just a light snort of displeasure from the Ancestor of the Dao, the four arrogant Divine Venerable martial artists instantly turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all traces of their existence in the world had been erased!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao swallowed hard, too shocked to speak. He also deeply regretted not acting sooner.</p><p></p><p>He had completely missed such a great opportunity! He didn't dare to keep floating in the air anymore. What if the Ancestor found his presence in the air annoying and turned him to ash with a light snort too?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly landed on the ground and bowed respectfully, saying shamefully: "This Xiao was slow-witted and failed to drive away the troublemakers for the Ancestor in time. I am ashamed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled warmly and said, "Young friend, there's no need to feel ashamed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Xiao felt even more ashamed and bowed even lower.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou and the others also walked over.</p><p></p><p>Four Divine Venerable martial artists had come with such momentum and powerful auras, yet before the elder, they were not even as significant as ants! The elder was truly unfathomable, a truly invincible existence.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this title appeared in all their minds!</p><p></p><p>They felt even more deeply the meaning contained in this title!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

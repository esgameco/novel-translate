        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 51 Mysterious Aura, the Bald Young Man Meng Chong (Seeking Readers)</p><p></p><p>The golden finger appeared, which meant there was a harvest.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough,</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple single-handedly swept away a myriad of troops, and the Dragon Palm technique was honed and improved. You have gained the experience of a hundred battles!"</p><p></p><p>The experience of a hundred battles!</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's mind, the scenes of going through a hundred battles suddenly emerged, directly infusing him. From being a complete novice without any combat experience but possessing great strength, he was now transformed into a seasoned warrior.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am no longer a novice without any battle experience."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clenched his fists. A moment ago, he was still a complete newcomer who had never experienced battle, but now he had become a warrior with the experience of a hundred battles.</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple is impressive, single-handedly sweeping away a myriad of troops, and the Dragon Palm technique was also honed and improved. This means he was in full control during the great battle and used it to refine himself."</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had the intention to hone the Dragon Palm technique in battle, it meant the situation was under his control.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple's formidable martial arts have shaken the county city, and his fame has spread widely. As his master, you have gained a mysterious aura."</p><p></p><p>The golden finger appeared again.</p><p></p><p>A profound and unfathomable, mysterious aura emerged.</p><p></p><p>It made Li Xuan appear even more mysterious. The aura of mystery and profundity enveloped him, making him seem unfathomable and deeply inscrutable to those who saw him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited. With the mysterious aura, no one would doubt that he was a reclusive high-level expert.</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple is indeed impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Although this mysterious aura did not seem to enhance his actual strength,</p><p></p><p>it could make him appear mysterious, and sometimes mystery is a symbol of power.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's thoughts shifted, and the mysterious aura disappeared, making him return to an ordinary appearance.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the mysterious aura reappeared, and he instantly became mysterious again.</p><p></p><p>"I must take on disciples! I must take on disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>A single disciple like Xu Yan had brought him such tremendous gains. If he had more disciples, the harvests would be even more abundant.</p><p></p><p>"The current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect can be a candidate. Let the experts of the Heavenly Mother Sect notify her to come to Yunshan County as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any suitable people in Yunshan County. I hope I can find some."</p><p></p><p>His requirements for disciples were very high. Their mental agility and comprehension must be exceptional, so that they could successfully cultivate the techniques he had created.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was an example of this.</p><p></p><p>His extraordinary imagination and exceptional aptitude allowed him to successfully cultivate the techniques.</p><p></p><p>"It's not about the quantity of disciples, but the quality. The more talented the disciple, the more feedback I can get, and the easier it will be for them to cultivate the techniques I've created."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a general standard for taking on disciples.</p><p></p><p>As he walked out of the courtyard, he strolled leisurely through Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Yunshan County had already been under the control of the Heavenly Mother Sect. The common people were either Heavenly Mother Sect disciples or devout believers, with every household having a shrine to the Heavenly Mother.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a scuffle reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, don't run! Surrender peacefully!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was loud and familiar.</p><p></p><p>It was Stone Two, one of the Heavenly Mother Sect experts from the previous night.</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to arrest me for?" </p><p></p><p>A young voice responded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's for the bounty!"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of the fight came from a small alley, with a fleeing figure being chased by another.</p><p></p><p>The two figures emerged from the alley, the one running being a muscular young man wielding a thick, broad-bladed knife.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the young man and was suddenly taken aback. What was with that shiny bald head?</p><p></p><p>Judging by his age of around sixteen or seventeen, why did he have a completely shaved head? It was shiny and reflective, as if he was naturally bald!</p><p></p><p>Neither in Qi nor Wu states were there any Buddhist practices that required shaving the head, so why did this young man have a bald head?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Bald Ones' Sects</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he was born bald?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>His mind stirred, and a mysterious aura emerged, making him suddenly seem unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The bald youth and Shi Er, one chasing and the other fleeing, soon came running over.</p><p></p><p>"Senior! Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's face paled, and he hurriedly stopped in his tracks, bowing his head respectfully.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The senior was so mysterious, so unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong abruptly stopped, his eyes wide open, staring at Li Xuan and unable to tear his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>"Eminent person! Peerless eminent person!"</p><p></p><p>This was the only thought in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This was a mysterious and unfathomable hidden eminent person!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why are you fighting in the street?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'm trying to capture the fugitive Meng Chong, who has a bounty from the Wu Kingdom," Shi Er said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"You're still helping the Wu Kingdom's court capture fugitives?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but be startled.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Mu Sect was full of thoughts of rebellion, yet they were helping the Wu Kingdom's court capture fugitives?</p><p></p><p>"It's mainly... mainly because the reward is too much!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er said with an embarrassed look.</p><p></p><p>"How much is the reward?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, showing his curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Ten... ten thousand taels of gold!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's eyes gleamed with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of gold - if they could obtain this reward, the funds needed for the rebellion would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly surprised, looking at the bald youth Meng Chong and exclaiming in astonishment, "Young man, what heinous crime have you committed to have a bounty of ten thousand taels of gold on your head?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt that the person before him was mysterious and unfathomable, a peerless eminent person, and he became cautious and respectful, saying, "Senior, I... I only sought revenge, and the Wu Emperor was actually the one who helped me take revenge."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit confused. If it was just a matter of revenge, and the Wu Emperor had even helped him take revenge, then why was there such a high bounty on him?</p><p></p><p>"What's the story?"</p><p></p><p>He asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong touched his bald head, looking a bit embarrassed, his expression bashful like a simple and honest youth.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I, Meng Chong, am the legitimate son of the Meng family, a prominent clan in the Wu Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>According to Meng Chong's words, he was born bald and had extraordinary physical strength, far exceeding that of ordinary people, possessing a natural divine power.</p><p></p><p>At the age of five, he was sent by his parents to learn martial arts in a sect, so that he could one day enter the court and become a military official.</p><p></p><p>However, when Meng Chong returned from his martial arts training, he found that his parents had both died.</p><p></p><p>From the day he returned, the entire Meng family, from the eighty-year-old elders to the five-year-old children, constantly targeted him, labeling him as an ominous omen, saying that his bald head was an inauspicious sign, and that he was destined to ruin the Meng family's prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the uncles and elders, even the young children in the family despised him, spitting at him whenever they saw him.</p><p></p><p>The family had also plundered the property left behind by his parents, not only not giving him a single penny, but also trying to expel him from the Meng family.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong secretly investigated and found that his parents' deaths were suspicious, so he wanted to seek an explanation, but he was beaten and driven out by the Meng family elders.</p><p></p><p>The injured Meng Chong vowed to take revenge, but his uncles simply didn't care, boldly declaring that if he dared to come back, they would kill him and bury him.</p><p></p><p>According to normal logic for seeking revenge, Meng Chong should have trained diligently, allied with a powerful force, or even become a bandit or entered the court, waiting until he had enough strength before seeking revenge against the Meng family.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong's method of seeking revenge was unprecedented, pioneering a new approach to vengeance, leaving Li Xuan completely bewildered and his gaze towards Meng Chong changed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

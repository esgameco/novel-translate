        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Wan Tianlin came or not, Xu Yan would not let this matter rest.</p><p></p><p>Daring to ambush and try to kill him, attempting to snatch the Blood Heart Fruit - they should bear the appropriate consequences. </p><p></p><p>As for the Wan family, no matter how strong they were, what did it matter? Being unable to defeat them today did not mean being unable to defeat them forever. One day, he would trample the Wan family into the dust.</p><p></p><p>"I'll make the Wan family my target, and train hard to destroy them!" Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The divine element avatar sat casually in the chair, appearing relaxed as it waited for visitors. Meanwhile, Xu Yan's true self had already hidden away, blending in with the surroundings. </p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal Celestial Lord would be unable to detect his concealment.</p><p></p><p>This was Xu Yan's confidence - as long as he wasn't directly intercepted by an Immortal Celestial Lord, he could use this to evade their pursuit.</p><p></p><p>As long as he successfully escaped Mount Dagai and the Nine Mountains region, the Wan family would no longer be able to threaten him. Once his strength increased, he would settle the score with the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Wan Tianlin doesn't come, he'll probably send someone," Xu Yan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was already contemplating assuming a new identity and using the Blood Heart Fruit to lure out Wan Tianlin again.</p><p></p><p>At the Wan family residence.</p><p></p><p>Information about Xu Yan had already been delivered to Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"Entered the Snake Peak Celestial Cave, picked the Blood Heart Fruit..."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin pondered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's identity was still unknown, but it was almost certain he was not a martial artist from Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had specifically entered the Snake Peak Celestial Cave to obtain the Blood Heart Fruit?</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!" </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin took a deep breath, his expression extremely cold. According to the information from Snake Peak Celestial Cave, the timing of Xu Yan's appearance and the Snake Peak Blood Son going berserk was too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Snake Peak Blood Son go so mad? He was even willing to fight to mutual destruction, all because this person appeared in the Snake Peak Celestial Cave..."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's gaze turned fierce.</p><p></p><p>The incident at Snake Peak Celestial Cave was caused by this person, and it was highly likely he had colluded with the Netherworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking it over, if he had colluded with the Netherworld Prison, why would the Snake Peak Blood Son fight the clan elder to mutual injury for his actions? What was the purpose?</p><p></p><p>It brought no benefit to the Snake Peak Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>"He may not have colluded with the Netherworld Prison, but merely used them to weaken our Wan family, targeting us... The Blood Heart Fruit was probably not picked this time, but he merely entered Snake Peak Celestial Cave under the pretense of picking it, and used some method to enrage the Snake Peak Blood Son, causing him to attack madly..."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin sensed the smell of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>"Have our people returned?" Wan Tianlin suddenly looked up and asked.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the guard replied gravely.</p><p></p><p>"The situation looks grim!" Killing intent flashed in Wan Tianlin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, shall we still go to Jade Bamboo Slope?" the guard asked after a moment's thought.</p><p></p><p>"You go and see if he's there," Wan Tianlin said after pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what if he is there?"</p><p></p><p>"Proceed with the trade as agreed, and get the Blood Heart Fruit first. If he's not there, then he clearly has a guilty conscience."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said with a cold smile, "Once we have the Blood Heart Fruit, the next step is to investigate the forces behind him. I want to uproot them completely!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Young Master!" The guard nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This time, two clan elders will follow in secret. You can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>For Wan Tianlin, the Blood Heart Fruit was the most urgent matter - it was an item he must obtain.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heart Fruit in Snake Peak Celestial Cave had always been difficult to obtain. Moreover, the Snake Peak Blood Son had just gone berserk, and the clan elder was also seriously injured. There would be no opportunity to create a chance to pick the Blood Heart Fruit in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Blood Heart Fruit in Xu Yan's possession was extremely important to him.</p><p></p><p>"Also, have someone investigate who has obtained Blood Heart Fruits before, and who has entered the depths of Snake Peak Celestial Cave with the opportunity to pick them. </p><p></p><p>Make a list and conduct a secret investigation to see if there are any findings!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin thought for a moment and instructed.</p><p></p><p>The special and precious nature of the Blood Heart Fruit meant that those who obtained it would consume it to comprehend martial arts techniques, especially martial artists at bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't use it themselves, they would trade it immediately to obtain resources they urgently needed.</p><p></p><p>Even the Wan family had no stock.</p><p></p><p>To obtain a Blood Heart Fruit, they could only wait for war with the Netherworld Prison to create opportunities to pick them, and the quantity was limited - not everyone could obtain one.</p><p></p><p>Only geniuses like Wan Tianlin would receive special treatment, with people actively seeking to obtain Blood Heart Fruits for him. However, plans couldn't keep up with changes.</p><p></p><p>For now, to quickly obtain a Blood Heart Fruit, the only option was to trade with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>In a dark cave somewhere on Mount Dagai, several figures gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The plan is proceeding smoothly so far," the leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the cave wore masks. The leader's mask had an extra pair of fangs, giving it a fierce and murderous appearance. </p><p></p><p>He was also the strongest among them.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin wasn't killed, and Xu Yan didn't die either. How can you say the plan is going smoothly?" one of them asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"If it were so simple to kill Wan Tianlin and Xu Yan, we'd have to question whether this affair could cause enough turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Now the Wan family is investigating Xu Yan, and Xu Yan will certainly believe it was an assassination attempt by the Wan family. We just need to continuously intensify their conflict and deepen the hatred between them.</p><p></p><p>When the critical moment comes, we'll kill either Wan Tianlin or Xu Yan. Our goal will be achieved, and conflict between the Qinghua Territory and Nine Mountains region will inevitably break out!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the fierce mask said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan isn't one of the three major powers of the Qinghua Territory. Can he really cause conflict between both sides?" someone asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"The name of Sword Saint Xu Yan is renowned in the Qinghua Territory, and he's an object of reverence for sword cultivators there. His identity is not simple. If I hadn't personally gone to the Qinghua Territory, I might not have been able to confirm his importance.</p><p></p><p>Now Xu Yan has come to the Nine Mountains region and wants to trade a Blood Heart Fruit with Wan Tianlin. This is a heaven-sent opportunity that can't be missed."</p><p></p><p>The man in the fierce mask said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"What's our next move?" a masked figure asked.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin urgently needs a Blood Heart Fruit now, and Xu Yan has one. They will certainly trade. Our next move is simple - further intensify the conflict..."</p><p></p><p>The man in the fierce mask coldly laid out the next steps of the plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the appointed time to meet Wan Tianlin arrived, Xu Yan was surprised to see that the person who came was one of Wan Tianlin's guards from before.</p><p></p><p>And he had actually come to trade for the Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>"These are the treasures you requested. Please check them," the guard said straightforwardly, his expression cold, as if they both tacitly understood something had happened between them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and didn't stand on ceremony. He checked the items, and after confirming everything was in order, he directly traded over a Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Since</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, since the other party was so forthright, Xu Yan considered himself a man of his word. The agreed-upon transaction still needed to be completed. As for killing Wan Tianlin, that could be done after the transaction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since Wan Tianlin didn't come, it was clearly to avoid further deepening the conflict. With his status as the Wan family's prodigy, he certainly wasn't afraid, but rather the Blood Heart Fruit was more important to him.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>The guard breathed a sigh of relief, having successfully obtained the Blood Heart Fruit. As for subsequent actions, that was no longer his concern.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled slightly, not stopping him. Judging by the guard's expression, someone would likely come after him soon.</p><p></p><p>He would just wait and see.</p><p></p><p>Besides, this divine element avatar couldn't detain this guard anyway.</p><p></p><p>Watching the guard leave, Xu Yan inwardly sneered, "The Blood Heart Fruit is in hand, let's see what you'll do now, Wan Tianlin."</p><p></p><p>To Xu Yan's surprise, he never saw anyone from the Wan family arrive.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but wonder, had he guessed wrong?</p><p></p><p>Was Wan Tianlin sincerely trading, and willing to let bygones be bygones regarding their previous conflict?</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the loss of his killed guard? "With the Wan family's power, it's strange that Wan Tianlin could swallow this anger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled. He was now somewhat conflicted - since Wan Tianlin chose to back down, should he still seek revenge? After all, he hadn't suffered any losses himself!</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right. How can I let the Wan family's attempt to assassinate me go just like that? Even if Wan Tianlin backed down, he hasn't compensated me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan decided he still needed to lure Wan Tianlin out to settle accounts.</p><p></p><p>With the divine element avatar returning, Xu Yan obtained the needed heavenly materials and earthly treasures. He was excited, as he was one step closer to accumulating sufficient foundation.</p><p></p><p>"There are still quite a few Blood Heart Fruits left. Besides the Wan family, other factions' prodigies will surely need them too. Trading one more should be enough to gather what I need."</p><p></p><p>After some calculations, Xu Yan decided to find a place to consume the Blood Heart Fruit and comprehend the Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>By the time Xu Yan left Jade Bamboo Slope, Wan Tianlin's guard was already dead.</p><p></p><p>A mighty True King Celestial Lord at his peak had actually been killed, and the Blood Heart Fruit obtained in the trade had naturally vanished.</p><p></p><p>The two clan elders secretly following the guard's movements were separately intercepted by powerful figures, preventing them from accompanying the guard all the way.</p><p></p><p>They also couldn't escort the Blood Heart Fruit back.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they both suffered some minor injuries. After repelling the powerful enemies, they rushed back only to find the guard's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jade Bamboo Slope was swept by a powerful force, turning the jade bamboo to dust. The cultivators originally in seclusion there all changed expression drastically and hurriedly fled.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elders went berserk - this was not something they could afford to offend.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Wan Tianlin slammed the table, murderous intent surging, his eyes seeming ready to devour someone.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Blood Heart Fruit, he had originally endured and proceeded directly with the trade. But the other party actually killed and robbed! This was going too far!</p><p></p><p>"Find him for me, I want to tear him to pieces!" Wan Tianlin roared in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wan family was alarmed by this matter. Both of Wan Tianlin's guards had been killed, and someone had set a trap using the Blood Heart Fruit, clearly targeting Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>This meant they were challenging the entire Wan family, attempting to strangle the family's prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal Celestial Lord of the Wan family took notice of this matter. The entire Wan family began to reveal its powerful foundation and strength.</p><p></p><p>Great Canopy Mountain was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivators with even slightly suspicious traces were captured and questioned about their identities before being released.</p><p></p><p>Those who resisted even slightly were killed without mercy!</p><p></p><p>"What major incident has occurred? Has the Heavenly Abyss invaded? Are there hidden traitors?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family wouldn't investigate so thoroughly unless it was Heavenly Abyss infiltrators or traitors."</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. If it were really Heavenly Abyss infiltrators or traitors, the Wan family would surely offer a bounty, not keep it so secret without announcing anything."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of Great Canopy Mountain were all astonished.</p><p></p><p>For the Wan family to take such major action in investigating Great Canopy Mountain, it must be either Heavenly Abyss infiltrators or powerful, high-status traitors who had defected to the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past they would always announce it and issue bounties. This time, those conducting the large-scale investigation were all core guards of the Wan family, led by the core forces affiliated with the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators suspected that something might have happened within the Wan family, which was why they were only using their core forces and not offering high bounties.</p><p></p><p>In a city on Great Canopy Mountain, two ordinary-looking men, appearing to be low-level rogue cultivators, watched the Wan family guards searching the entire city. They exchanged a glance, seeing the smugness in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We need to add more fuel to the fire. Have someone attack Xu Yan, using the Shadow from the Wan family guards."</p><p></p><p>"The Shadow in the Wan family guards is already prepared to act, but with his strength, he won't be able to kill Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush to kill Xu Yan. For now, we just need both sides to confirm it was the other's doing, with no third party involved. We'll leave killing Xu Yan to the Wan family."</p><p></p><p>"Understood. We Sky Fiends and Earth Shadows only incite conflicts and provoke hatred, without getting involved ourselves. We just need to provoke the hatred, and they will naturally kill each other. If we get too deeply involved, it's easier to expose flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Of the 36 Realms of the Divine Domain, facing the invasion of the Heavenly Abyss, they are united and mutually supportive. Let the conflicts between the 36 Realms begin with the Nine Mountains Realm and the Azure Flower Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid not many people know about our Sky Fiend Earth Shadow organization anymore. It's better that way."</p><p></p><p>The two men communicated telepathically.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were full of smugness, as if inciting the enmity between the Wan family and Xu Yan was their masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>In a dark cave, several masked figures gathered again.</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't find Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!"</p><p></p><p>"None of the Shadows or those infiltrated in various factions' intelligence networks have any trace of Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's as if Xu Yan vanished into thin air."</p><p></p><p>The cave fell silent. A link in their plan had encountered a problem.</p><p></p><p>They had actually lost track of Xu Yan. Without Xu Yan's whereabouts, how could they assassinate him? How could they further expand the hatred between the Wan family and Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Has Xu Yan perhaps been captured by the Wan family?"</p><p></p><p>"The Shadows infiltrated in the Wan family haven't received any news of Xu Yan being captured by them."</p><p></p><p>"What if an Immortal from the Wan family personally took action?"</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the Immortal Celestial Lords of the Wan family can't easily leave their guarding positions. Unless Wan Tianlin died, an Immortal Celestial Lord absolutely wouldn't take action."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if Wan Tianlin died, an Immortal Celestial Lord still couldn't act immediately. They would need to stabilize the situation first, to prevent Blood Children from taking advantage and launching an attack, before they could act."</p><p></p><p>The cave fell silent again. Everyone was puzzled - if Xu Yan hadn't been captured by the Wan family, and no Immortal Celestial Lord from the Wan family had acted,</p><p></p><p>Then how did Xu Yan vanish into thin air?</p><p></p><p>"Search, find Xu Yan as soon as possible," the masked figure with a fierce aura said sternly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the next step of their plan was about to succeed perfectly, but Xu Yan had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>How could this work? They had to find him at all costs!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

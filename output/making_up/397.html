        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for Wan Tianlin, he also frankly said that the Wan family's investigation would continue next, while he needed to use the Blood Heart Fruit to comprehend techniques, and similarly needed to go into seclusion for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Finally I can accumulate foundation and break through to the Divine Phase realm." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>When going into seclusion, one needs to be more cautious to avoid being tracked down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan concealed his aura, changed his appearance, and avoided all tracking and probing. Even if an Immortal Venerable took action, they would not be able to track him.</p><p></p><p>After ensuring his safety, Xu Yan set up a concealment formation in a remote area of Mount Dagai, while the mountains and rivers within his sword also enveloped the secluded area.</p><p></p><p>"I can accumulate foundation and break through to the next realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited and began using these treasures to accumulate sufficient foundation in preparation for the transformation during breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating foundation takes some time, and breaking through to the Divine Phase realm also requires time. Once again, Xu Yan disappeared from Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Tianshadiying or the True King Venerables sent by the Meiyu Sect of Thousand-Layered Mountain, they all once again lost any trace of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At Thousand-Layered Mountain, where the Demon Magic Heavenly Cave was located.</p><p></p><p>The cave had now completely changed - it was decorated with lanterns and colorful ornaments, with beautiful pink flowers planted inside.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer a dark cave, but seemed like a paradise on earth.</p><p></p><p>In an elegant small building, gauze curtains hung down, vaguely revealing a beauty lounging lazily inside.</p><p></p><p>Long snow-white beautiful legs were half exposed outside the gauze curtains.</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen beautiful women were serving in the elegant building, all of whom were True King Venerables.</p><p></p><p>However, they were no longer their original selves.</p><p></p><p>Outside the small building, several True King Venerables were prostrating themselves, their eyes filled with fanaticism and infatuation, immersed in that faintly visible enchanting figure.</p><p></p><p>"So, you didn't bring the person back?"</p><p></p><p>A charming and alluring voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The people prostrating on the ground trembled slightly, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads, looking somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"What's the reason?"</p><p></p><p>"We haven't found him yet, and he doesn't trust us."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, one of them spoke up: "It seems Xu Yan is gathering heavenly and earthly treasures, likely for some major use."</p><p></p><p>From inside the elegant small building, a graceful figure flew out and landed in the arms of the person who had spoken.</p><p></p><p>"You were able to find some information, so you've made a contribution. She will accompany you to play, and will surely let you find pleasure."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>That True King was extremely excited and thrilled. Holding the beauty in his arms, his eyes filled with intense fervor as he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, the woman in his arms bore a 30-40% resemblance to the goddess who had captured his heart and soul, making him even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly and earthly treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a seven-colored flower flew out from the small building. It had seven petals in seven colors, emanating seven-colored halos, seemingly possessing extraordinary and wondrous uses.</p><p></p><p>"Then pass this information to Xu Yan - there is a Seven Wonders Divine Flower here. If he doesn't know about the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, tell him it can make up for a martial artist's weaknesses; it can strengthen the soul, purify the martial foundation, allow martial artists to calm their minds and concentrate, and comprehend the mysteries of martial arts..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we'll definitely do it!"</p><p></p><p>The several True Kings glanced at the Seven Wonders Divine Flower inserted in the ground, and endless desire arose from the depths of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This came from the deepest intuition of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Their intuition told them that if they could obtain the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, they would have an extremely high probability of breaking through to become Immortal Venerables! But no matter how great their desire, they still did not dare to have any thoughts they shouldn't.</p><p></p><p>After the True Kings left, the person in the small building lazily turned over, murmuring: "Even the Seven Wonders Divine Flower has been brought out, I don't believe your disciple won't come. When your disciple comes, you should come too, right?</p><p></p><p>"Offending me, Meiyu, how could it be so easily forgotten? Let's see what you can do."</p><p></p><p>In her mind, that scene from before surfaced, especially that one sword strike. It was precisely that sudden sword strike that caused her true self to make a mistake while fighting back, nearly suffering heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>This grudge must be repaid! "Your disciple is quite handsome indeed, I'm a bit interested now."</p><p></p><p>The corners of Meiyu's mouth curled up slightly, revealing a smile that could bewitch all living beings.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's whereabouts remained elusive and the Wan family strengthened their surveillance of Mount Dagai, Tianshadiying, who had been unable to find Xu Yan, became increasingly cautious in their actions.</p><p></p><p>During this period, they killed several Diying members, with the reason naturally being suspicion of them being traitors.</p><p></p><p>This also caused some Diying members to feel uneasy, becoming more careful and cautious in carrying out their missions.</p><p></p><p>Hengfeng Mountain, one of the Nine Mountains of the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a heavenly cave on Hengfeng Mountain, there was a huge bronze hall suppressing this heavenly cave.</p><p></p><p>The one presiding over this place was an Immortal Venerable from Hengfeng Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Currently, this Immortal Venerable wore a fierce mask, with seven leaves on the mask.</p><p></p><p>Seven Leaves Tiansha!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, how should we proceed next?"</p><p></p><p>Several Tiansha members below the Five Leaves rank gathered in the bronze hall, respectfully asking for instructions.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Wan family has seen through it, then just kill Xu Yan directly. As long as he dies in the Nine Mountains Realm, that will suffice.</p><p></p><p>"Once he's dead, there will ultimately be ways to make the Qinghua Realm and Nine Mountains Realm erupt into conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the Divine God Meng Chong from Qinghua Realm has also arrived in the Nine Mountains Realm, we can make a move against him.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they die in the Nine Mountains Realm, what comes after will be much easier to handle. At worst, Hengfeng Mountain can take responsibility for this matter, what of it? We just need to provoke conflict with Qinghua Realm, any means are acceptable. Also send Diying to infiltrate Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"They can infiltrate both the Qimen Academy and the Medicine Academy, waiting for opportunities to act."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Leaves Tiansha spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd in the bronze hall perked up, revealing excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Leaves Tiansha lord was an Immortal Venerable of Hengfeng Mountain and could fully represent Hengfeng Mountain in taking responsibility for the killings.</p><p></p><p>This would then cause Hengfeng Mountain to erupt into conflict and strife with Qinghua Realm's Tianwu Gate, Wanlei Sect, or even the Great Yue Nation, thus achieving their goal.</p><p></p><p>After all the subordinates had left and only the Seven Leaves Tiansha remained in the bronze hall, he stood at the entrance, his gaze looking deep into the sky, then towards the heavenly cave he presided over.</p><p></p><p>Unbeknownst to others, the original Blood Child of this heavenly cave had long been killed. The current Blood Child was one in name only.</p><p></p><p>It was a cooperation he had reached with the other party, helping them take the position of Blood Child, but without actually possessing the true strength of a Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>This heavenly cave would not fall into chaos. He could temporarily leave his post at any time!</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm should be in chaos now."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself. The Divine Realm not only had to face invasions from the heavenly caves, but should also be embroiled in internal strife - this was also the goal of Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>"If the Divine Realm is not in chaos and warfare does not arise, how can heaven and earth be unified?"</p><p></p><p>With a deep gaze, he had come to this Nine Mountains Realm to stir up the Divine Realm. Only with the thirty-six realms engaged in endless warfare could such turbulence complete their mission.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm and Nine Mountains Realm should also be in chaos now, they should also be at war incessantly</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Enough."</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his body, he instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>A Immortal Venerable quietly left his post.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Venerable Mountain, one of the Nine Mountains in the Nine Mountains Realm, was the domain of spirit beasts, with an Immortal-level Spirit Beast King presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other eight mountains, the Spirit Venerable Mountain region had only one Heavenly Cave, but this cave was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to the spirit beast forces, there was also a powerful force called the Spirit Venerable Sect stationed here.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the Spirit Beast King was also a member of the Spirit Venerable Sect, and could be called the sect's guardian spirit beast, with an extremely revered status.</p><p></p><p>On Spirit Venerable Mountain, in a forest of towering ancient trees, a tiger-like beast as large as a small mountain was resting on the ground. Its breathing seemed to gust like a gale, and a gentle breeze circled its body.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger was one of the most powerful spirit beasts among spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Its bloodline rank was extremely high, holding the status of king of beasts among spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>This Wind Spirit Tiger was the Spirit Beast King of Spirit Venerable Mountain. It was rumored to be the strongest of the tiger-type spirit beasts in the Divine Realm, hailed as the undisputed king of tigers.</p><p></p><p>The name of Spirit Venerable Mountain originated from it, as did the name of the Spirit Venerable Sect. The Wind Spirit Tiger was the strongest existence in the Spirit Venerable Sect, even slightly surpassing the sect master in strength.</p><p></p><p>However, in the entire Nine Mountains Realm, those who knew this inside information could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger would not leave the range of Spirit Venerable Mountain, but usually it didn't need to intervene to suppress the Heavenly Cave, unless there was a danger of the cave going out of control.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, the Wind Spirit Tiger just lay in this ancient forest.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Spirit Venerable Mountain, only those Immortal Venerables or the younger generation valued by the Wind Spirit Tiger had the qualification to come to this ancient forest.</p><p></p><p>A figure stepped into the ancient forest. The newcomer wore a fierce mask with seven leaf patterns engraved on it. Though his aura was not prominent, each step he took seemed to merge with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Seventeen? I remember that's what you're called," the Wind Spirit Tiger said, lifting its eyelids to look at the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" Sky Seventeen stopped a hundred zhang away from the Wind Spirit Tiger and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger yawned and said lazily, "What do you want to say this time?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Divine Realm undisturbed and the Thirty-six Realms not at war, how can you advance further? How can you break through the bloodline shackles and further improve?" Sky Seventeen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Go on," said the Wind Spirit Tiger, lifting a paw and licking it with its tongue.</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen took a deep breath, already prepared to defend against an attack, and said in a deep voice, "Only when heaven and earth are united can the shackles be broken, and only then can you continue to improve.</p><p></p><p>"As one of the Twelve Kings of Spirit Beasts in the Divine Realm, are you content to stay here? Never advancing in your lifetime, unable to further improve your bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger extended sharp claws from its tiger paw, raised its head, and looked at Sky Seventeen. "Uniting heaven and earth, is that your goal? Let alone what uniting heaven and earth means, do you have the ability to achieve it?</p><p></p><p>"You think you can trick me, the Wind Spirit Tiger, into working for you with the so-called uniting of heaven and earth to improve bloodlines?"</p><p></p><p>As it spoke, a powerful aura of wind circled around the Wind Spirit Tiger, imposing without anger.</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen said in a deep voice, "Wind Spirit Tiger, you should understand that the Divine Realm is not the core of heaven and earth. Our task is to create the conditions for uniting heaven and earth. The actual implementation of uniting heaven and earth is not something that can be done at our level.</p><p></p><p>"I can guarantee you, as long as you participate, breaking through the bloodline shackles and improving is just a small benefit. Once heaven and earth are united, the authority over heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't continue speaking towards the end.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger pondered, lowering its raised paw, and after a long while said, "I'll think about it!"</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen's eyes relaxed. Since it was considering, agreeing was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I won't disturb you further. I'll come again."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Sky Seventeen turned and left.</p><p></p><p>After Sky Seventeen left, the Wind Spirit Tiger looked in the direction he had gone, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm not being the core of heaven and earth is not surprising. Divine Realm, Spirit Realm, Inner Realm... Uniting heaven and earth, breaking through barriers? The current structure of heaven and earth formed after the ancient changes, and they actually intend to restore heaven and earth to its ancient state?</p><p></p><p>"Who can achieve this? With enemies surrounding the Heavenly Caves, the current heaven and earth is no longer what it once was.</p><p></p><p>"However, Sky Seventeen's background must be extraordinary. Are there experts beyond the Immortal level behind him? Could the Divine Realm still conceal such powerful beings?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger closed its eyes, pondering whether to agree to Sky Seventeen's proposal, whether it could gain the benefits it needed, while also being wary of being used.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Cloud Pool Mountain area of the Nine Mountains Realm. I wonder which mountain Senior Brother is on."</p><p></p><p>In front of a misty mountain lake, Meng Chong looked at the divine herb he had just excavated from the bottom of the lake, considering whether to meet up with his Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Having made a name for himself as a Celestial God in the Qinghua Realm and even pioneering the body cultivation school, Meng Chong had left the Qinghua Realm for the Nine Mountains Realm after breaking through to the peak of the Divine Traversing realm, seeking treasures to accumulate his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The treasures he needed naturally had a focus. The Nine Mountains Realm had many thick, heavy mountains with many divine herbs focused on physical cultivation, which was his purpose for coming here.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a tiny bit away from comprehending the Small Heavenly Eye, but this last step is the most difficult. I wonder if Senior Brother has cultivated it yet.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Junior Brother's communication talisman has been upgraded again. I should deliver some new ones to Senior Brother as spares."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Meng Chong decided to go find his Senior Brother to exchange insights on the Small Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm is vast, divided under the rule of nine major forces. The communication range with Senior Brother's talisman is limited... I can only go to the big cities in the Nine Mountains Realm to see if I can leave some messages to find Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Having made his decision, Meng Chong turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression tightened. With a boom, divine waves surged from his body, golden light shone brilliantly, and wind and thunder encircled him. A great sun appeared behind his head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He threw out a punch, colliding with a thin, cold beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The fist imprint was pierced through, and though weakened, that beam of light continued its killing approach.</p><p></p><p>"Cowardly rat hiding in the shadows!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snorted coldly, neither dodging nor evading. He drew his sword and slashed out. In an instant, the mountain rocks transformed into a domineering long sword, frantically bombarding forward.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, four figures attacked.</p><p></p><p>Each one had the strength of a peak True King Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze focused as he looked at the four masked True King Venerables. They had clearly come to assassinate him.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists from the Qinghua Realm? No, no force in the Qinghua Realm would dare come here to assassinate me. If they were to use four peak True King Venerables, it would be easy to trace, and they're not Blood Shadows from the Netherworld either..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned. These four were clearly targeting him, but he had just arrived in the Nine Mountains Realm and had never offended any forces here. Moreover, these four didn't seem like bandits out to kill and rob.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

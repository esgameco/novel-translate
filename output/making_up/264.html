        <h1>Chapter 264</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Wanshi Alliance, almost all of them wounded, were nevertheless extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"The Yushen Sect has suffered a calamity! These wounds are worth it! As for the Yushen Sect's retaliation, that is all within expectations. Even if we had not raided the Yushen Sect's treasury, we would still have been surrounded and attacked, no difference."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Alliance Master!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao coughed up blood as he respectfully paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Alliance Master!"</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators also paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>They first looked towards Xu Yan, as his reputation was too great. They were suddenly enlightened - the new Alliance Master was actually Xu Yan! "This person is our new Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance Master, Fang Hao, Master Fang!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao introduced while coughing up blood.</p><p></p><p>The Left and Right Protectors were stunned - the new Alliance Master was not Xu Yan, but this Fang Hao?</p><p></p><p>"Greet Master Fang!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sat down and said, "Everyone, please be seated. All of you have made contributions this time. For your merits, each of you will receive a Huisheng Dan to heal your injuries, and a Yunshen Dan to nourish your spiritual souls!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, two small bottles were distributed to each person - the Huisheng Dan for healing injuries, and the Yunshen Dan for nourishing the spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao and the others were extremely excited. They all understood the miraculous effects of these elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"This expedition has yielded tremendous harvests. The two spiritual mines of the Yushen Sect have already been seized. We will soon dispatch people to take control of them. But before that, we need to arrange some affairs of the Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, wielding the authority of having seized the Yushen Sect's treasury, officially ascended to the position of the Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance Master. This would be the start of him leading the Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance to stand on par with the Spiritual Sect families.</p><p></p><p>"The Yushen Sect's executives and disciples in the spiritual mines are temporarily under our control, tasked with extracting spiritual crystals for our Alliance. But we need a cultivator to oversee them.</p><p></p><p>"Although it is unlikely that the Yushen Sect will discover the anomaly in the short term, there is still a certain degree of danger.</p><p></p><p>"I have already set up formations in the mines, capable of resisting cultivators for a period of time, preventing them from quickly entering the mines. The overseer will have time to escape.</p><p></p><p>"This task is of utmost importance. Left and Right Protectors, each of you will oversee one of the spiritual mines."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at the Left and Right Protectors with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Left and Right Protectors respectfully acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then arranged some other affairs, such as the Alliance's members, how to conceal their identities, how to maintain communication, and how to prevent traitors.</p><p></p><p>"I, Fang Hao, the new Yuzhou Alliance Master, am young and inexperienced, far inferior to all of you present. Today, I have one matter that I need to make you all aware of.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding my affairs, as well as the elixirs and formations, they must not be reported to the Main Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all have any opinions? Of course, I am not a dictator. This matter will be decided by a collective vote. Those who support my decision, or those who oppose it.</p><p></p><p>"I, Fang Hao, although the Alliance Master, will abide by the result of the majority vote!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, and dozens of jade tokens flew out, each one landing in front of a person.</p><p></p><p>"My opinion is simple: one, do not report my appointment as the Alliance Master to the Main Alliance. Officially, Yu Gao will remain the Alliance Master. </p><p></p><p>"Two, do not reveal any information about the elixirs, communication talismans, or other matters to the Main Alliance or unimportant members. This is the highest secret of the Yuzhou Alliance. Those who leak it will be treated as traitors!</p><p></p><p>"I leave this proposal to you all to decide. Do you support it, or oppose it? If the supporters are in the majority, then we shall act accordingly. If the opposers are in the majority, then I shall withdraw this proposal."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked solemnly at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"To get your true opinions without interference from others, please make your choices on the jade tokens - support or oppose!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present had solemn expressions. They inwardly marveled that the new Master was someone who listened to opinions and widely sought advice - this was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>As for concealing the Master's identity and the matters regarding the elixirs and communication talismans, some felt that the Main Alliance should be notified, so that true experts could be dispatched to oversee the mines.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao picked up the jade token, which had three options: Support - Strongly Support - Extremely Support. He was momentarily confused. </p><p></p><p>Where was the Oppose option? Although he supported Fang Hao's proposal, seeing that there was no Oppose option on the token, he was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Left and Right Protectors and the others were also puzzled. They looked left and right, but there was indeed no Oppose option. Had the Master forgotten to include it?</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao was conflicted for a while, but ultimately chose the "Extremely Support" option.</p><p></p><p>"Has everyone made their choices?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression remained serious as he waved his hand, retrieving all the jade tokens.</p><p></p><p>He silently scanned them, nodding in satisfaction. The experiences and techniques imparted by his teacher were truly extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone supports my decision, I am very pleased. This shows that your awareness of confidentiality is quite high. Since the risk of leaks is low, then let's distribute these elixirs. I hope you all can quickly improve your cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled with satisfaction, then took out a bottle of elixir and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>The Left and Right Protectors and the others were still perplexed, unsure whether the Master had forgotten the Oppose option, or if he had already made the decision and would not allow opposition.</p><p></p><p>As they were pondering this, seeing the elixir, their faces lit up with joy. They understood the miraculous effects of these elixirs. With the aid of the elixirs, their cultivation would surely advance further.</p><p></p><p>The Master had just said that since the risk of leaks was low, he could distribute the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"The Master is right. The Main Alliance has many people and is prone to leaks. This concerns the highest secrets of our Yuzhou Alliance. I strongly support the Master's decision!"</p><p></p><p>The Right Protector spoke up with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly. Our Yuzhou Alliance is about to rise. The Main Alliance is complex, and the resources like these elixirs are limited. If the Main Alliance comes to demand them, how could we provide enough for their needs? So I strongly support all of the Master's decisions!"</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector also spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The Left and Right Protectors had both spoken, and the rest also had expressions of excitement, expressing their strong support.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they had also realized that by following Fang Hao, they would have access to the elixirs to aid their cultivation. If these were leaked to the Main Alliance, how much would they be able to get? Moreover, the elixirs were all in Fang Hao's hands as the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Yuzhou Alliance's strength, and for the sake of their own cultivation advancement, they must strongly support the Master!</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded in satisfaction. Their awareness was indeed quite high.</p><p></p><p>He took out another bottle of elixir.</p><p></p><p>"With our united efforts, we will strengthen the Yuzhou Alliance and stand on par with the Spiritual Sect families. The elixirs will be available, and your cultivation will surely advance further!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao encouraged them.</p><p></p><p>He then handed over the matters of the spiritual mines to the Left and Right Protectors, giving them formation plates to control the formations in the mines, and teaching them how to use the plates.</p><p></p><p>"Keep a close watch on the movements of the Spiritual Sect families, especially the Yushen Sect. Maintain communication!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing the arrangements, Fang Hao left with Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>There was still the matter of sorting through the spoils from the Yushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had observed the entire process with his own eyes, his heart...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lǐ sighed, his disciples could finally stand on their own.</p><p></p><p>What slightly saddened him was that after slaying the Jade Divine Sect's Refining Immortal, the Great Dao Golden Book did not provide any feedback on the Godly Void, only the experience of the Godly Void.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect's retaliation would surely come.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not continue on, but instead turned and returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Divine Sect does have some capabilities, their core treasury is hidden very deeply, even I couldn't find it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had only plundered one core treasury of the Jade Divine Sect, but for the Jade Divine Sect, the core treasuries were certainly not just one.</p><p></p><p>However, even he could not discover where the remaining core treasuries were hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Hidden deep within the mountains?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, unless they destroyed the Jade Divine Sect, it would be impossible to plunder all of their core treasuries.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan's group saw Shen Haizhou again at the appointed place, they were momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Haizhou's face was swollen and bruised, his already somewhat chubby face now even chubbier.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his entire person seemed to have gotten a bit fatter.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Shen, what happened to you, who beat you up?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"My father beat me." </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Was it because of our matter?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his brow and asked.</p><p></p><p>Had Shen Haizhou's provision of intelligence been discovered, so he got beaten up?</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou shook his head and said, "It has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>He then perked up, revealing an excited yet lecherous expression, and said, "Fang Hao, one Spring Night Mirror is not enough, make me three, I'll provide the materials!"</p><p></p><p>"One is enough, all the effects will be concentrated in one, that should be sufficient for your entertainment, Big Brother Shen."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>What he was going to refine was not the previous Spring Night Mirror. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he would incorporate restrictions and illusory formations, ensuring that Big Brother Shen would be completely enthralled and unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>"One is not enough to share around." </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sighed, taking out a storage bag and handing it to Fang Hao, saying, "Fang Hao, refine three, no less, inside are the treasures accumulated by my family over three generations."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao: ...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong: ...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shen Haizhou's strange expression, it turned out this hobby was an inherited one in his family.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>Refining this kind of thing wouldn't require much materials or time.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, you've made a contribution this time, there will be a share for you. Since I've promised you, if we obtain the Earth Spirit Flower, I'll definitely give you some medicinal pills and won't go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Jade Divine Sect had yielded a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>The four of them set out to return to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou spoke, "The Jade Divine Sect has contacted the Spiritual Sects and Families of Yuzhou, investigating the scattered cultivators in Yuzhou, mainly targeting the Great Immortal scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It's likely to become turbulent again, you all better hide well."</p><p></p><p>"This is within expectations."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Myriad Worlds Alliance had long since dispersed and hidden themselves.</p><p></p><p>Back in the manor, Shen Haizhou was greatly shocked to find that Xu Yan and Meng Chong had been hiding here all along without anyone discovering them. This was simply unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Soon, he also noticed some unusual things.</p><p></p><p>He felt extremely excited about having befriended Xu Yan, absolutely the best decision he had made.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu came over excitedly to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, Junior Brother, you're finally back, how was it?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou stared wide-eyed at Su Ling Xiu, his chubby face revealing a shy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu curiously looked at Shen Haizhou, his entire face was so bruised and swollen, looking truly pitiful.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Haizhou!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan introduced him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Miss Su!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hurriedly put on a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities, here's a medicinal pill for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu waved her hand and tossed a medicinal pill to Shen Haizhou, adding, "Eat it and your face will be healed."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was skeptical, the injuries on his face were inflicted by his father, a Refining Immortal expert, with a trace of the Refining Immortal's power remaining. His father had intentionally made the swelling not subside quickly, as a form of punishment.</p><p></p><p>Could this medicinal pill really heal it so quickly? He swallowed the pill, cupped his hands and said, "Miss, I appreciate your kindness, but this injury was deliberately left by my father, as he is a Refining Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, it's healed?"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even finished speaking when he felt his face cooling down, and upon touching it, found the swelling had subsided, greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so surprised, even if you were just dead, with my shishu, you'd be revived!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's count the harvest from the Jade Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out the storage jars and began tallying the treasures. </p><p></p><p>The storage bags were also a pile, all belonging to those executives and disciples, after all, they were from the number one sect of Yuzhou, they wouldn't be poor.</p><p></p><p>This harvest was truly massive.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Meng Shu Shu, Zhou Ying also excitedly joined in the counting.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was also very excited, seeing so many spirit herbs, it was even more enthusiastic in currying favor with Su Ling Xiu, no longer worrying about lacking medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's group were counting the harvest, Yuzhou was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The renowned number one sect of Yuzhou, the Jade Divine Sect, had actually been attacked, plundered like bandits, with one of their core treasuries emptied.</p><p></p><p>The scale of the loss was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>"Our role model!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but I feel especially excited and passionate in my cultivation today!"</p><p></p><p>"Serves them right, the Jade Divine Sect got what was coming to them!"</p><p></p><p>"Shh, don't discuss this, be careful of getting caught!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of Yuzhou, both scattered and from the Spiritual Sects and Families, were not lacking in gloating. </p><p></p><p>Seeing the Jade Divine Sect in misfortune, they were happier than if their own strength had advanced further.</p><p></p><p>In the Jade Divine Sect, the executives and disciples were shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, the storage bags they had painstakingly accumulated were all stolen, their cultivation resources gone in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As for the sect's treasury being emptied, that was the concern of the Sect Master and Elders, after all, the things in the treasury didn't belong to them, but the items in the storage bags were their own.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the other powerful experts of the Jade Divine Sect had bloodshot eyes, murderous intent surging, wishing they could dig three feet into the ground to find the culprits and tear them to shreds! However, they knew they couldn't find the people!</p><p></p><p>The renowned number one sect of Yuzhou had never been so humiliated before.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong must die! No matter the cost!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we must kill them at all costs!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect's Sect Master said hatefully.</p><p></p><p>"I'll immediately contact Elder Xing, have the Crimson Dark True Transmission come to Yuzhou and initiate the Genius Confrontation, luring Xu Yan out. Even if the Crimson Dark True Transmission can't kill him, we absolutely cannot let him escape.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he shows himself, his dreams of hiding away will be shattered!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong watched as Meng Shushu hurriedly drove away, furrowing his brow for a moment, hesitating whether to follow and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, we're even now, no need to worry about it. I should figure out how to earn some spirit crystals to buy spirit medicines. I don't even know where the senior brother has gone."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought as such and was about to leave, but then he saw Meng Shushu rushing back.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, can you help me deliver a hammer to a certain place?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was delighted, "No problem, how much is the delivery fee?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu reluctantly took out a spirit token, "How about 100 spirit crystals? I don't have much spirit crystals left on me."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong readily accepted the spirit token.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, we'll meet here again in three days, and there will be extra reward!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu carefully told Meng Chong the meeting location, then hurriedly left, seeming very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what's hidden inside the hammer."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong went to the carriage, slowly driving towards the place Meng Shushu had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>He took out three grade-eight spirit herbs and examined them, not recognizing what kind of spirit herbs they were, even though Suli had introduced him to spirit herbs before, his knowledge was still limited.</p><p></p><p>Verbal descriptions and the actual objects can be quite different, unless it's a very distinctive spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to consume these grade-eight spirit herbs and cultivate the Great Sun Golden Body, I wonder how effective it would be?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered, but ultimately did not consume the spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"I'll bring them back and let my shijie refine them into dan pills, directly consuming them would be too wasteful."</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Meng Chong arrived at a small town. He glanced at a certain corner of the wall, and sure enough, Meng Shushu had left a mark there. Following the direction indicated by the mark, it led to a small mountain peak outside the town.</p><p></p><p>"So secretive, I wonder what he's trying to avoid."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong drove the carriage to the mountain, parked it at the foot, and carried two large hammers up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The mountain path was rugged and the forest was dense, but it was nothing to Meng Chong, he walked briskly and soon reached the peak.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain top, there was a solitary large tree about three people's arm spans in girth, its branches and leaves lush, covering half the peak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Meng Chong reached the peak, he saw Meng Shushu hiding in the tree, and was about to greet him, when suddenly a powerful figure came flying from behind.</p><p></p><p>The aura was extremely strong, filled with murderous intent, and the first strike was fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Hand it over!"</p><p></p><p>A Sect Master cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's cry came from the tree, and he quickly leapt down to try and block the suddenly attacking Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong didn't move at all, the attacker's fierce strike hit his back, then the other hand reached out to snatch the hammer.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Just as Meng Shushu was flying over, his expression changed, but then a shocking scene unfolded before him.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master who had sneak attacked, his strike had hit Meng Chong's back, and he had snatched one of the hammers, but just as he was about to take the other one...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, as if belatedly realizing it, with the hand that had lost the hammer, threw a punch back.</p><p></p><p>Thunder roared, his body shining with golden light! Boom! In Meng Shushu's horrified gaze, the sneaky Sect Master was instantly torn to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Meng Chong, like a ferocious beast, with a casual wave of his hand, thunderous sounds erupted, and the intense, violent power swept across, crushing the torn body into ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu swallowed hard, his face ashen with shock.</p><p></p><p>That was a Sect Master cultivator, yet he was just punched to pieces? In the end, he was even ground into ash, just how terrifying was the person he had found?</p><p></p><p>He was starting to feel panicked inside.</p><p></p><p>"What enemy dares to sneak attack me, are they tired of living?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grumbled as he picked up the dropped hammer, looking at Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>"This was your enemy, why did he want to kill me? As far as I know, I haven't offended anyone, these mysterious enemies, I have to completely annihilate them, scattering their ashes."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was still in shock, "Brother Meng, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>That was a Sect Master's strike, hitting him squarely, yet Meng Chong seemed completely unharmed, what kind of terrifying physique was this?</p><p></p><p>"How could anything be wrong? It was just a tickle, where did this enemy come from, attacking so ruthlessly, I scattered his ashes, wasn't that the right thing to do for someone targeting you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grumbled as he came in front of Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's face was a bit pale, his breathing slightly uneven, he seemed injured again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, actually... the enemy wasn't targeting you, he was after me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong slapped his forehead, suddenly understanding, "Ah, no wonder there would suddenly be an enemy, it turns out he was after you."</p><p></p><p>Reaching out, he put his arm around Meng Shushu's shoulder, "So this is your enemy, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"He came to kill you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled, "In that case, since I killed him for you, it means I saved your life, so you owe me a life, correct?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was dumbfounded, how did it become him owing a life? "Brother Meng, let me explain, he was after me, and even if you didn't interfere, I might have been able to handle him myself."</p><p></p><p>He was sweating a bit, this burly and straightforward fellow, how could he be so calculating? </p><p></p><p>If he really owed him a life, it would probably cost him a lot of money to buy it back.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glared, "My family, do you have the strength to deal with him? You should know, my Meng Chong's strength is so great that I barely survived his strike, do you really think you could have injured me with your strength? </p><p></p><p>And judging from your current state, you seem injured, how much of your strength can you even exert?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked at the glaring Meng Chong, that aura of ferocity made him feel a sense of crisis, as if he could be punched to pieces with a single fist.</p><p></p><p>The scene of Meng Chong easily destroying the Sect Master was still shocking him.</p><p></p><p>"Come, my family, let's spar a bit, if you can fight me for three hundred rounds, I'll believe you can deal with that enemy, and I won't count it as me saving your life, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said, getting into a fighting stance, ready to spar.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's face darkened, hastily saying, "No need, no need, Meng Chong, how much spirit crystals do you want for killing that Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>He seriously doubted that Meng Chong had deliberately not dodged, just to find an excuse to show off his powerful strength, and claim that Meng Shushu couldn't handle the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pulled him into a hug, "My family, what kind of talk is that? Do you think I only care about spirit crystals? Alright, since you're my family, I'll give you a discount, you just owe me half a life, how's that?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu weakly said, "Can I not owe you anything?"</p><p></p><p>"I saved your life, and as my family, I'm giving you a discount, you just owe me half a life, you can't deny it, right?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Alright, I'll admit it! Meng Shushu took out a spirit token, "Brother Meng, this is 500 spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Shou solemnly stuffed the spirit talisman into Meng Shushu's bosom, saying, "Since this belongs to our family, your half a life is only worth 500 spirit crystals. I'll give you the spirit crystals, and take your half a life, so we'll be even."</p><p></p><p>"Wait! Wait!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was terrified, "Take away half of my life?" <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>"Two seventh-grade spirit herbs, no, I can't give you any more, I don't have many left."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled happily, "Since it's our family's, you're being too polite. That's right, spirit herbs are not as valuable as life, two seventh-grade spirit herbs will do. It's not easy for me to kill a sect master, I can't just do it for free!"</p><p></p><p>"As it should be."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu nodded, took out a Tianbaoge storage certificate, and handed it to Meng Chong, "These two seventh-grade spirit herbs are the last of my spirit herbs, they are stored in Qinglin City."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then we're even." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, threw the big hammer on the ground, took the storage certificate, and said, "I've brought the big hammer back, if there's nothing else, I'll be leaving."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, take care!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Our family's matters have caused quite a stir, even sect masters have come to attack. I, Meng Chong, stepped in and killed one sect master, in exchange for two seventh-grade spirit herbs, it was worth it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself as he quickly descended the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already intervened, he couldn't just do it for free. The enemies were Meng Shushu's, and he had helped kill one, so the compensation was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the carriage below, Meng Chong simply unloaded the carriage and rode a horse to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Go to Qinglin City and retrieve the spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Riding the horse leisurely back to Qinglin City, after traveling for dozens of miles, he suddenly looked up.</p><p></p><p>"A sect master?"</p><p></p><p>A figure was flying through the air.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists below the Sect Master realm would likely be unable to detect it, this was a Sect Master, and not a newly promoted one, at least a mid-level Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Go find Meng Shushu-"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hesitated for a moment, but did not turn back, and continued towards Qinglin City.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked to the left in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Another Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"There's another one, three Sect Masters, all heading towards Meng Shushu. Are these his enemies?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered for a moment, abandoned the horse, and quickly rushed back to the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Our family's, it seems he's quite wealthy. If I save his life, and he gives me a storage pouch as a favor, that's not too much, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought happily to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also curious, what was in the two big hammers? Could it be treasures?</p><p>These Sect Masters must have come for that.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle had already broken out on the mountain peak, a figure was moving swiftly among the mountains and forests, its movements extraordinary, evading the enemies' attacks.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not immediately intervene, silently hiding in a large tree, concealing his figure behind the leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jin, you betrayed me?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu glared angrily at one of the three Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, I didn't want to either, but the people you offended are too powerful and influential. They found me, and if I didn't cooperate with them, I would be dead.</p><p></p><p>And a sixth-grade spirit herb, I was tempted too."</p><p></p><p>Tian Jin chased while speaking regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, just surrender, why keep running and hiding? You are a spirit herb explorer, your ability to find spirit herbs is among the top five in the inner realm. They won't kill you, and if you join them, you can even gain the protection of a major power."</p><p></p><p>Tian Jin persuaded.</p><p></p><p>"How could I, Meng Shushu, become a running dog? Moreover, those people are cruel and vicious, if anything goes wrong, they will torture me. Why would I willingly seek punishment?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was furious.</p><p></p><p>One of the other two attacking Sect Masters spoke in a deep voice, "Meng Shushu, tell us the location of the sixth-grade spirit herb, and perhaps I can turn a blind eye and let you go!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, tell us the location of the sixth-grade spirit herb, and we'll let you go."</p><p></p><p>The other one also spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you think I'm a three-year-old child?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>His movements were agile and his speed was extremely fast, as he dodged and evaded in the dense forest, trying to escape and flee. However, he was injured, and the three Sect Masters were not weaker than him, with one even surpassing him.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he created some distance, he was quickly caught up to, unable to shake off the enemies.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu became anxious, the longer it dragged on, the more unfavorable it was for him. If the powerful experts of those people arrived, he would have no chance of escaping.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong heard their entire conversation, his eyes suddenly shining, "Sixth-grade spirit herb?"</p><p></p><p>This was the highest grade spirit herb in the inner realm, extremely rare, indicating its immense value.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the two big hammers contain sixth-grade spirit herbs?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong silently followed, not yet planning to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu is a spirit herb explorer, and ranked among the top five in the inner realm? In that case, he must have rich experience in locating spirit herbs, knowing where they are produced?"</p><p></p><p>If his disciple needed to refine pills, she would certainly lack spirit herbs. If he had a spirit herb explorer to find herbs for her, wouldn't she never lack spirit herbs?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong became more and more excited, "No wonder he has so many spirit herbs, he's a spirit herb explorer. This time, I'll let our family's owe me a life. Since he owes me a life, how many spirit herbs would it take to buy it back?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong became happier the more he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>As for offending Sect Masters, he didn't care. </p><p></p><p>These Sect Masters, he could easily kill one with a punch, they posed no threat.</p><p></p><p>As for the power targeting Meng Shushu, Meng Chong also didn't mind. Compared to Meng Shushu's value as a spirit herb explorer, offending that power was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had a Grand Sect Master as their backer, he wasn't afraid. At worst, he could just run away.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Venerable Cliff in the inner realm is a top power, Brother Xie's reputation should have some deterrent force, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He continued to hang back, not hurrying, waiting for the right opportunity to act.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu had not yet fallen into crisis, and acting now would be inopportune.</p><p></p><p>"These three Sect Masters are too weak, although Meng Shushu can't shake them off for the moment, he won't be in mortal danger."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's movements were agile and his speed was extremely fast. Once he created some distance in the dense forest, he had a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was constantly fleeing towards the deeper parts of the forest.</p><p></p><p>"Our family's, he won't escape, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, if Meng Shushu escaped, how would he find the opportunity to make him owe him a life?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his brow raised as he looked up at the sky, a figure suddenly descended from above.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart tightened, this person's strength was not weak, and with his own abilities, he probably couldn't defeat him with just one punch.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it would take two punches! Meng Shushu's expression changed drastically, a peak Sect Master had arrived!</p>

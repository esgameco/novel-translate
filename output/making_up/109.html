            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 109 Life-and-Death Crisis, Time to Draw the Sword!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong clenched his fists, and the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering reached its pinnacle, with a faint golden glass-like bell enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what your purpose is, your wish to kill me is but a pipe dream!"</p><p></p><p>Even though he sensed an extremely dangerous aura from the Blood Spirit Master, he was not afraid at all and had no intention of fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn and obstinate!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Then this lord shall personally take your life!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and slapped out, a chilling aura bursting forth, transforming into a gloomy beam of light that instantly arrived, then exploded, spreading out like a spider web, trying to envelop Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression hardened, his eyes revealing a shocked look, and he immediately let out a roar, punching out.</p><p></p><p>The glass-like golden light seemed to have transformed into thunderous might, rumbling out, like a howling gale, instantly annihilating the gloomy web-like force that had tried to envelop him.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's expression changed. "Blazing like fire, the most Yang and rigid? I cannot leave you be!"</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, ghostly and ethereal, his claws icy pale, like demonic talons, instantly reaching towards Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on the golden bell, Meng Chong's figure shaking, his fists like thunderous winds, rumbling out, the wind and thunder sweeping, the fist shadows layered, covered in glass-like golden light.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cultivation method is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's attack failed to break through the golden bell's defense, his expression changing, his ghostly figure already floating away, increasing the distance between him and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>His expression also became grave.</p><p></p><p>The young man's strength exceeded his expectations, surpassing even the peak of the First-Grade Martial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Sect Master realm martial cultivators might not even be able to contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glared furiously, the aura of wind and thunder surrounding him, the golden bell becoming even more solid, with faint bell chimes echoing out.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Sect?"</p><p></p><p>When the Blood Spirit Master made his move, Meng Chong felt a familiar sensation.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin!</p><p></p><p>The opponent's gloomy force was more refined and ruthless than Blood Wuxin's, and the strength was even greater.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so you know of this lord's Demonic Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master let out a sinister laugh, his figure floating and flickering, transforming into layers of ghostly shadows, the icy cold aura permeating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>As if he wanted to turn the battlefield into a gloomy, ghostly realm!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart sank, why would people from the Demonic Sect come to the Borderlands?</p><p></p><p>The opponent seemed to have set his sights on his blood and essence!</p><p></p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p></p><p>His heart was pounding violently, surges of qi and blood gushing out, circulating around his body, the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering reaching its pinnacle, his flesh and blood emanating glass-like golden light.</p><p></p><p>The golden bell image enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Meng Chong had unleashed his full strength.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy aura kept surging in, but it could not affect him.</p><p></p><p>However, all he could see were the flickering ghostly figures, difficult to capture.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wu is a Demonic Sect expert? He has been hiding his true strength all along?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Could it be that he just happens to look exactly like Senior Wu?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was heavy with these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The person before him, no matter how he looked at it, seemed to be Senior Wu himself.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he could not understand why he had suddenly become a powerful Demonic Sect expert, and even more formidable than before.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had introduced the Demonic Sect to him, and in the Inner Realm, it was an extremely powerful force, with many experts, and Blood Wuxin was not considered particularly powerful among the Demonic Sect experts.</p><p></p><p>"Which Sect Master of the Demonic Sect are you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a mere Blood Food is not worthy of knowing this lord's name!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master let out a sinister laugh, his figure suddenly flickering and appearing right next to Meng Chong, his claws striking towards Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong punched out, the violent wind and thunder power gushing out, but the Blood Spirit Master's figure vanished in an instant, already appearing behind Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Pu!</p><p></p><p>One claw tore open a crack in the golden bell, the five fingers like sharp talons, grabbing onto Meng Chong's back.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's qi and blood shook, the golden bell immediately trembling and bursting out, as he turned around and punched out!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's expression changed slightly, his figure flickering and retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what kind of cultivation method is this? Why is your flesh and blood so formidable?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>That golden bell-like defense was already terrifyingly strong, something he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>And even his flesh and blood was shockingly powerful, stronger than steel.</p><p></p><p>That claw strike should have been able to pierce through steel, but it only left five pale marks on the opponent, without even breaking the skin!</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to know!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stepped forward, chasing after the Blood Spirit Master, his fists continuously striking out, the might of wind and thunder sweeping across the area, a terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's ghostly figure flickered and evaded the thunderous fist strikes, suddenly seizing the opportunity to closely approach Meng Chong again, circling and twisting, his claws tearing open the golden bell defense on Meng Chong's back.</p><p></p><p>Just as Meng Chong roared and turned around to attack, the Blood Spirit Master suddenly crouched down, pressing close to Meng Chong's chest, his sharp claws viciously striking out, shattering the golden bell and grasping onto Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong only felt a sharp pain in his chest, his qi and blood frantically circulating, the golden bell suddenly trembling and transforming into a powerful force, suppressing the Blood Spirit Master.</p><p></p><p>The claw attack failed to kill Meng Chong, and the Blood Spirit Master's figure flickered and retreated again.</p><p></p><p>His expression was grave, but more so, it was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The more formidable Meng Chong's flesh and blood, the greater the benefits he would gain from devouring it. Not only would he be able to become younger, but his foundation would also be solidified, and his flesh and blood might even surpass most martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he was greatly thrilled.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven has not abandoned me, the Blood Spirit Master! It has bestowed this delectable Blood Food unto me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong lowered his head, looking at the five bloody marks on his chest. This was the first time his defense had been breached and his flesh and blood injured since cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering.</p><p></p><p>"He is very strong, his ghostly movements and combat experience are superior to mine."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he also noticed something unusual about the opponent's body.</p><p></p><p>"Seize the opportunity to deliver a fatal strike."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Bell Covering solidified once again, the bloody marks on his chest no longer bleeding, the lingering icy aura dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, hehe, hand over your life."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Master's ghostly figure flickered even faster this time, the demonic shadows constantly shifting and changing, and along with his movements, strands of icy cold threads kept appearing, seemingly trying to enclose Meng Chong within.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Meng Chong's powerful fists swept out, he was unable to break through the enclosure, and the icy threads not only did not decrease, but instead grew more and more, forming a massive net.</p><p></p><p>The threads had fused together, becoming as thick as fingers.</p><p></p><p>These blood-sucking demonic threads were tougher and more difficult to break, with a bone-chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong kept charging and breaking through, but was repeatedly pushed back by the Blood Spirit Master, the golden bell defense being torn open again and again, leaving more and more bloody marks on his body.</p><p></p><p>On the city tower of the Wu Imperial Capital, Emperor Wu and his ministers were watching the battle outside the city.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Emperor Wu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Even from such a distance, they could see that Meng Chong was at a disadvantage, seemingly trapped and unable to attack the opponent effectively, appearing very passive.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what are we to do? Meng Chong doesn't seem to be a match for him!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, let's flee to the State of Qi. I've heard there are great masters there."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, shall we mobilize the Heavenly Mysterious Guard to surround and kill him, to assist Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>"No, we cannot. If we strike, and fail to kill the opponent, can you and I bear the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu and his ministers were more united than ever in their goal - they all hoped that Meng Chong would emerge victorious.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that ferocious "Senior Wu" who treated people as mere food, Meng Chong was truly a moral saint!</p><p></p><p>"We are not warriors, what can we do!" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>One of the ministers glanced around furtively and quietly slipped away, preparing to flee.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, Meng Chong looked quite disheveled, seemingly already exhausted, his body covered in bloody wounds inflicted by the Blood Spirit Claw.</p><p></p><p>"Now is the time!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit's eyes flashed with icy light. In a flicker, it appeared before Meng Chong, then vanished to his back, and reappeared in front of him again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong seemed flustered, swinging his hand behind him to fend off the Blood Spirit's attack, leaving his chest wide open.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit's ghastly pale claws suddenly lashed out, aiming straight for Meng Chong's heart.</p><p></p><p>This strike had been heavily charged, surely capable of tearing open the flesh and extracting the heart.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity is here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes flashed with a fierce light, his figure suddenly shifting sideways, evading the Blood Spirit's strike.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, wind and thunder rolled, golden light burst forth, as thunderous force and raging winds erupted from his fists.</p><p></p><p>The might was far beyond what it had been before.</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit's strike missed, realizing the situation had turned dire.</p><p></p><p>"Treacherous brat!"</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, the Blood Spirit's ghostly figure twisted, evading Meng Chong's fist. Yet in an instant, Meng Chong had closed the distance.</p><p></p><p>His fists once again locked down the Blood Spirit, the terrifying fist intent seemingly penetrating everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Blood Spirit felt the overwhelming force of thunder from within Meng Chong's fists.</p><p></p><p>It evaded again with its ghostly movements.</p><p></p><p>After all, having experienced life-and-death battles, this critical moment was not the first time it had encountered such a crisis, and it was already well-experienced.</p><p></p><p>But to its surprise, Meng Chong's figure instantly closed the distance again, never allowing it to create any space, the fist intent enveloping it ever more tightly.</p><p></p><p>There was nowhere left to evade.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of movement technique is this?" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit was shocked and enraged. Faced with this crisis, it had no choice but to unleash some of its primal power.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Meng Chong felt an immense pressure bearing down, like a great mountain trying to crush him.</p><p></p><p>He let out a roar, the Thunder-Shattering Golden Ape Fist erupting to its peak, thundering down and shattering that vast pressure, breaking through that defense like a quagmire.</p><p></p><p>The fist strike slammed heavily into the Blood Spirit's body.</p><p></p><p>Pah!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, its figure sent flying.</p><p></p><p>It was shocked and enraged. This aged body, it had used some methods in the cave to restore its vitality and strength. But this one punch had nearly shattered it.</p><p></p><p>"You shall die!"</p><p></p><p>It must kill Meng Chong and absorb his blood and essence to restore this body.</p><p></p><p>As the Blood Spirit was sent flying, a powerful pressure emanated from between its brows, like a great mountain descending onto the battlefield, and a serrated blade appeared in its hand.</p><p></p><p>It unleashed a slash.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Thunder-Shattering Golden Ape Fist was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Spirit's eyes had turned blood-red, an icy aura emanating that lowered the surrounding temperature.</p><p></p><p>The light flashing between its brows radiated a terrifying pressure, like a great mountain bearing down on Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was pounding furiously. He felt as if he was trapped in a quagmire, constantly suppressed, enveloped by an invisible pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even as he frantically mobilized his qi and blood, his speed still could not be raised.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder-Shattering Golden Ape Fist itself seemed to be suppressed as well.</p><p></p><p>The earlier attack he had followed up with was because he had suddenly felt as if trapped in a quagmire, his movements slowed, preventing him from pressing the attack.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Blood Spirit, Meng Chong's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>The aura of danger was growing ever stronger.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the Blood Spirit, he had sensed an intense aura of danger, so he had feigned weakness, hoping to seize the opportunity to decisively defeat the opponent. Though he had injured the opponent, he had failed to kill it, only angering it and causing it to unleash some special power.</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Master? No, not quite right, it's more like..." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>This pressure was similar to a Grand Master's, yet stronger, and also had an aura akin to his Senior Brother's sword intent, yet different.</p><p></p><p>He did not know what it was, but he understood that he was in grave danger!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the light between the Blood Spirit's brows, this pressure seemed to be emanating from there, as if there was a worm within that light.</p><p></p><p>"You should have died, forcing me to use the last of my primal power!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit was furious.</p><p></p><p>It was already very weak, yet had to resort to using this tiny bit of remaining primal power.</p><p></p><p>Even after devouring Meng Chong's blood and essence, it seemed unable to fully replenish itself.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit thrust its blade, aiming straight for Meng Chong's heart.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong unleashed a punch, but it was utterly unable to resist, the blade tip piercing his chest. In this critical moment, he grabbed the serrated blade with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a roar, golden light instantly burst forth, his immense physical strength flinging the Blood Spirit away!</p><p></p><p>Pant! Pant!</p><p></p><p>Blood flowing from his chest, Meng Chong paid it no heed. The flung Blood Spirit was even more enraged, the light between its brows growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppressive pressure, Meng Chong felt as if he was carrying a great mountain on his back, his body sinking into a quagmire, his speed and strength difficult to fully unleash.</p><p></p><p>Even the Golden Bell seemed to be cracking.</p><p></p><p>"I will devour you!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit was furious that its opponent had, in that state, still managed to unleash such tremendous physical strength to fling it away.</p><p></p><p>The light between its brows flickered, an icy, prison-like pressure descending.</p><p></p><p>The aura of death was approaching, Meng Chong panting for breath, his heart pounding wildly. In this moment, he felt as if the treasured blade was trembling.</p><p></p><p>The treasured blade was trembling, raging, synchronizing with his heartbeat, aligning with his will.</p><p></p><p>Draw the blade! Draw the blade! Draw the blade!</p><p></p><p>A stronger sensation than ever before welled up in his heart, the rage seemingly transmitted to the blade. The treasured blade at his waist was filled with fury, yearning to be unsheathed, to slay all enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit thrust its blade.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, it saw Meng Chong grasping the hilt of the blade at his waist, and then a blade light burst forth.</p><p></p><p>An aura of supreme dominance over the world erupted, the heavens and earth seeming to change color.</p><p></p><p>The pressure weighing down on Meng Chong instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong drew his blade, his eyes closing slightly. Heart and blade in harmony, blade and will as one. In that moment, in the heavens and earth, there was only this one blade, a supreme dominating slash!</p><p></p><p>The Blade Spirit had awakened!</p>

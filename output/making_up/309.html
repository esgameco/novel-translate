        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snatched the divine artifact from the Thousand Martial Hall and fled. Elder Blade tried to stop him, and was a little surprised - this powerful expert from the Myriad World Alliance actually came out to support the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"He really came out to back up the scattered cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>This obstruction allowed Xu Yan to escape far away, and there was no way Elder Blade could catch up to him. After Xu Yan broke through the Divine Origin Realm, his speed was like lightning - even the strongest experts couldn't catch up to him. Of course, Elder Blade and the Thousand Martial Hall were confident they could chase and kill Xu Yan, but that was just their inherent belief that divine artifacts couldn't be stored in a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>How could Xu Yan hide the Frigid Severance Blade and evade the pursuit? It was impossible! </p><p></p><p>However, the Thousand Martial Hall's people never imagined that while divine artifacts couldn't be stored in a storage bag, they could be kept in a storage ring!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Frigid Severance Blade, admiring its extraordinary craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good blade. If my Second Martial Brother doesn't want it, I can have Fourth Martial Brother refine it, the materials used to forge this blade are extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Divine artifacts were undoubtedly the most supreme treasures in the Spiritual Realm, and the foundation of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"This trip was not in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very satisfied, and directly stored the blade in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He had blocked the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate, slaughtered many of their geniuses, and seized a divine artifact. That scoundrel Huang Liang had shamefully claimed that his sword dao was stolen from the Thousand Martial Hall - now Xu Yan had finally vented this grievance.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his divine avatar dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Since Tian Ji had escaped, the Thousand Martial Hall probably didn't want to start a major battle with the Myriad World Alliance at this moment, and thus didn't pursue Tian Ji.</p><p></p><p>"Where should I go next?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then chose a direction and headed off.</p><p></p><p>"I'll find a city to stay in and gather news of the Spiritual Realm, and see how my Second Martial Brother is doing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't take the Thousand Martial Hall's pursuit seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the divine artifact was precisely to lure the Thousand Martial Hall to chase him, so that his journey across the Spiritual Realm would be more thrilling and full of challenges...</p><p></p><p>The news of Xu Yan blocking the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate, slaughtering their geniuses, and openly seizing their divine artifact, the Frigid Severance Blade, swept across the Spiritual Realm like a storm.</p><p></p><p>Since the Calamity of the Blood Demon, there had never been such a shocking event in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>And it was the first time in history that someone had stolen a divine artifact from the Transcendent Spiritual Sect!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was truly a formidable hero!</p><p></p><p>In a certain noble family, a dignified man sighed and said, "If only my son could be like Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>He then turned to look at his own useless son, his face flushing red with anger as he grabbed a whip and lashed out viciously.</p><p></p><p>"You wretched son, if you had even one-hundredth of Xu Yan's abilities, I would be more than satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>In a certain great city, many cultivators gathered, all discussing the theft of the Thousand Martial Hall's divine artifact and the humiliation they suffered.</p><p></p><p>An elder suddenly sighed and said, "Among the countless geniuses in the world, Xu Yan is a model!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a young man was immediately fired up, and declared boldly, "You're right, I will take Xu Yan as my role model. He dared to block and challenge the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, so I will go and block and challenge a top-tier sect!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers watched the young man leave with a sense of resignation, feeling he was just going to get himself killed.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Proclamation City, Meng Chong stood on the arena, holding his blade. By now, no more geniuses dared to challenge him. All the powerful sects were livid, especially the Three Severance Tower.</p><p></p><p>One person had suppressed many top-tier sect geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The arrogant and disdainful sect geniuses had lost their overbearing aura.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed inwardly, these sect geniuses were too weak.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the peak of the Divine Will Realm and was accumulating his foundation, preparing for his own transformation and breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no more geniuses coming to challenge him, his gaze shifted to the Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders.</p><p></p><p>He had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Severance Tower's Sect Master's strength is indeed formidable, but he is not unbeatable. Even their elders, one-on-one, pose no threat to me. They may not even be able to accumulate their dao foundation well, and with my Unbreakable Golden Body, it's almost impossible for them to seriously injure me. Since that's the case, I might as well give it a try.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the physical dao requires constant tempering and self-improvement. With the Heaven Hammer Hundred Forges Technique boosting me, my foundation will accumulate even faster.</p><p></p><p>"I can't drag this on any longer. The Spiritual Realm is vast, and staying in the Great Proclamation City is meaningless. I also don't know how my Eldest Martial Brother is doing, I heard he recently blocked the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>"After finishing up here in the Great Proclamation City, should I also go and block the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, he looked at the Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and scratched his head, grinning widely.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Three Severance Tower must hate me to death and want to kill me, right?"</p><p></p><p>The onlooking cultivators all rolled their eyes. Wasn't that obvious? The Three Severance Tower's three top geniuses had all been killed by him, their corpses nowhere to be found. Of course they hated him to death!</p><p></p><p>Not just the Three Severance Tower, all the top sects' experts despised him!</p><p></p><p>The Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders glared at him with murderous intent, but seeing the orders passed down from the League of Provinces, they could only suppress their killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"I, Meng Chong, am giving you all a chance today. Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders, you can come at me now. I challenge you old fools!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his blade and declared arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>The Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders were stunned, even doubting if they had heard correctly. Meng Chong was actually challenging them all together?</p><p></p><p>Where did he get such courage and arrogance?</p><p></p><p>The watching cultivators were all dumbfounded. Had Meng Chong become so arrogant after easily defeating all the geniuses, that he thought he could sweep away the Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders? This was just courting death!</p><p></p><p>"Unacceptable!" the League of Provinces' Sect Master hurriedly tried to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>However, the Three Severance Tower's Sect Master wouldn't let this opportunity slip by, and directly descended onto the arena, sneering coldly, "Since you're the one challenging us, killing you won't violate the rules of the Genius Confrontation!"</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!" the League of Provinces' Sect Master and the others sighed.</p><p></p><p>Youthful rashness, not knowing one's own limits! Meng Chong looked at the Three Severance Tower's Sect Master, then at the elders surrounding the arena, and sneered, "One of you is not enough, have those old fools come as well."</p><p></p><p>The Three Severance Tower's Sect Master was stunned for a moment, this bald youth's brain didn't seem to be working properly.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he nodded, and the Three Severance Tower's elders immediately descended onto the arena, surrounding Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Using their numerical advantage to bully him, these shameless acts didn't bother them at all, since it was Meng Chong who had challenged them.</p><p></p><p>"He's gone overboard!"</p><p>"Meng Chong is going to meet his demise in the Great Proclamation City."</p><p>"This is no longer youthful rashness, but arrogance beyond measure."</p><p></p><p>The onlooking cultivators sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Come at me!" Meng Chong threw out a punch, striking first.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" The Three Severance Tower's Sect Master and elders unleashed their powerful auras, launching a fierce attack. The tremendous forces shook the arena, sending the onlookers flying into the air as the intense battle unfolded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure suddenly fell down with a bang, crashing onto the arena and creating a human-shaped pit! "Meng Chong is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Even the Prefect Alliance Master was helpless, as he had no reason to intervene, and the other top Spiritual Sect experts were guarding against him, not giving him a chance to go and rescue.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted the dust off his body and laughed loudly, "You're so weak, haven't you had your fill? Put all your strength into it!"</p><p></p><p>He rose up into the air and charged in again.</p><p></p><p>"You insolent one!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes were also shocked. Such a powerful strike had knocked Meng Chong down, yet he didn't have a single injury? What an incredibly sturdy physique.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle became even more intense. Meng Chong kept suffering attacks, but he was fearless, constantly punching and slashing, even focusing on one of the Elders, trying to kill him. The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes and the others attacked him, but he resisted with his bare body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Armor emerged, shining with golden light, making Meng Chong look like he was wearing a golden suit of armor, majestic and extraordinary! "What kind of defensive technique is this!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Almost there, just a little more!"</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong was subjected to fierce attacks, the Indestructible Divine Armor was occasionally shattered but then restored, his flesh booming and even feeling pain.</p><p></p><p>However, he was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Hammer Hundred Tempering Technique was running, and his martial dao foundation was continuously accumulating in the bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he raised his hand, and a small bottle appeared, pouring a medicinal pill into his mouth, accelerating the accumulation of his martial dao foundation.</p><p></p><p>"He's injured!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes were greatly encouraged, Meng Chong was injured and taking medicine to heal! His flesh was not impenetrable.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong continued to focus on attacking one of the Elders, who was beaten until he vomited blood, covered in wounds, seemingly doomed if attacked further.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes were also anxious, constantly attacking and trying to rescue.</p><p></p><p>But Meng Chong seemed single-minded, determined to kill that Elder, as if he had a deep grudge against him!</p><p></p><p>"I'll fight you to the death!"</p><p></p><p>The Elder roared, his blood qi surging, instantly unleashing a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous sound, a violent punch slammed into Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong was directly smashed down, creating a large pit on the arena, and that Elder was also killed by Meng Chong's punch! "Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes' eyes turned bloodshot, pouring down their furious attacks.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The spectators all retreated, afraid of being caught in the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Is Meng Chong dead?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the area where Meng Chong was buried under the Sect Masters' furious attacks.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light surged, and to everyone's horrified gaze, a golden giant stood up.</p><p></p><p>His fists thundered out, colliding with the pouring attacks.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p>"What kind of martial dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the suddenly appearing golden giant, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>A six-zhang giant, majestic and extraordinary, making everyone in front of him seem like tiny grasshoppers!</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm, when has there ever been such a martial dao? Could it be that this is Meng Chong's true form? Is he a giant? Has the Spiritual Realm ever had giants before?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong unleashed the Six-Zhang Golden Body, a giant-like figure, directly charging towards the Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, come again!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>With a roar, they rushed up to surround and attack Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Encircle and attack him!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Absolutes said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The giant may seem mighty, but he must certainly lack agility.</p><p></p><p>"Encircle?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned, sweeping his huge fists, twisting and turning, his movements agile and his speed lightning-fast, not the slightest bit clumsy.</p><p></p><p>Each punch was extremely violent, stirring up wind and thunder, and once he had targeted an Elder, he kept bombarding him, not caring about the other attacks, relying solely on his sturdy flesh to withstand them.</p><p></p><p>And with the Six-Zhang Golden Body unleashed, Meng Chong's defensive power was taken to the next level. The Elder he had targeted could not evade at all, facing the violent punches, he was in a miserable state, full of despair.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes and the remaining Elders attacked frantically, although they made Meng Chong's flesh tremble and the Indestructible Divine Armor shatter, they could not inflict too much damage.</p><p></p><p>"I'll fight you to the death!"</p><p></p><p>The Elder once again unleashed a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong's giant figure stumbled back a few steps before stabilizing, and he grinned, looking at another Elder, saying, "Your turn!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes suddenly felt their scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>The spectators also felt their scalps tingle, Meng Chong was too violent, and he was deliberately targeting one person at a time.</p><p></p><p>They had thought Meng Chong was courting death, but it seemed that the ones courting death were the Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes and the others!</p><p></p><p>The group of top Spiritual Sect experts were now extremely solemn, glaring at Meng Chong's giant figure.</p><p></p><p>Among the scattered cultivators, how could there be such a majestic and extraordinary martial dao technique? What is this martial dao? It's too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes were starting to have thoughts of retreat, but Meng Chong grinned and said, "Since you've made a move, you can only fight to the end, there's no way you can retreat now!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight him to the end!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Absolutes roared.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Elders were the same, their eyes icy cold, their auras surging, instantly launching a coordinated attack directly at Meng Chong's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A bloody light erupted, the Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes burning their essence blood to unleash their secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression darkened, at this moment he felt a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>If he tried to withstand this attack head-on, it would definitely break through his flesh defense and inflict significant damage on him.</p><p></p><p>He poured a medicinal pill into his mouth, the golden light blazing, the Indestructible Golden Body running to its limit.</p><p></p><p>He punched again and again, the wind and thunder roaring, even blades of light surging from his fists.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters of the Three Absolutes' attacks, filled with a sense of finality, charged towards Meng Chong, breaking through the wind and thunder, shattering the incoming blades of light, directly approaching Meng Chong's head.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong retreated, his speed incredibly fast.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Meng Chong roared, using his hand like a blade to slash out a blade of light, in the thunderous sound, splitting the attack in two.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he slashed out another blade of light, shattering the attack into more than a dozen fragments.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this attack's power had not been exhausted, it was still extremely fierce, only that it had been fragmented from a concentrated force into multiple strands.</p><p></p><p>"Enough!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes narrowed, having weakened the attack enough for him to withstand.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Hammer Hundred Tempering Technique ran, and he directly met the attack with his flesh.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Armor shattered, and even his flesh had shallow wounds, but under the tempering of the Heaven Hammer Hundred Tempering Technique, the attack's power was transformed into tempering force.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into his martial dao foundation, Meng Chong felt that his accumulated martial dao foundation was just a little short of being complete.</p><p></p><p>And this little bit, by refining some medicinal pills, or spiritual herbs, or by letting it settle for some time, he could accumulate it to the perfect realm.</p><p></p><p>Then, it would be time to break through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Great Proclamation City should come to an end!

        <h1>Chapter 437</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out several pills and placed them in Song You's hand, explaining the uses of these pills to him.</p><p></p><p>"This pill can stimulate potential, instantly increasing your strength more than using certain high-cost secret techniques. Of course, there is a price to pay after taking this pill, but it's much better than some secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"This pill greatly replenishes essence and blood, instantly boosting the power of your soul. Of course, this boost to soul power has a time limit. Once the medicinal effects wear off, your soul power will drop back down, and you'll feel mental fatigue. It will take some time to fully recover.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining pills are partly for healing injuries and partly for nourishing the body and soul. Taking all these pills together can make your strength surge two to three times, though it can't be sustained for long, but that should be enough.</p><p></p><p>"With the healing pills, you can minimize damage. If you manage to escape, the healing pills will be enough to ensure you don't damage your foundation..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong explained the effects and usage of each pill to Song You one by one.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had no use for these pills he was carrying at the moment. As for healing pills, he had more than enough. Besides, how could he easily get injured? With his powerful physical recovery ability, he didn't need pills for ordinary injuries. Even immortal heavenly venerable cultivators couldn't injure him severely enough to require healing pills.</p><p></p><p>These pills were just precautionary, but now they could be put to good use.</p><p></p><p>As for helping Song You, it was partly because his situation was similar to Meng Chong's own past experience. Secondly, the Song family was almost certainly a hidden force of the Tiansha Diying. Thirdly, they had a grudge against the Wanbao Alliance. Since there was an opportunity to retaliate against Tiansha Diying, why not take it?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Meng Chong suspected that the Tiansha Diying force that framed him was very likely the Song family! The Song family was affiliated with the Wanbao Alliance and could better track the movements of Yan Shanhe and his disciples, making it easier to find an opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>Song You was already stunned. How could there be such miraculous pills in this world? He didn't doubt Meng Chong's words at all. At this moment, he was so excited that his eyes were filled with tears, his lips trembling, unable to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Carefully putting away the pills, he finally said with tears of gratitude, "Brother Meng's great kindness, if Song You is lucky enough to survive, I will repay this great favor even if I have to be a beast of burden."</p><p></p><p>"You're too kind, it's just a small matter," Meng Chong said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took out a formation disk.</p><p></p><p>"This is an Illusion Reversal Formation. Once activated, it can conceal your form and also confuse enemies, creating more opportunities for you. Of course, this formation disk is not high-level, it can only achieve the effect of surprise and can only confuse enemies once, so you must seize the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out another formation disk.</p><p></p><p>This formation disk was not high-level. If a true king heavenly venerable experienced it once, they would become alert, and the illusory power would have limited effect on true king heavenly venerables.</p><p></p><p>However, since the way of formations had never appeared in the Changyu Realm before, these true king heavenly venerables would certainly be confused when first encountering it, but there would only be one chance.</p><p></p><p>After being fooled once, they certainly wouldn't be fooled a second time.</p><p></p><p>But when facing unknown illusions, although they wouldn't be fooled, they would become cautious and not dare to act rashly. This was also an opportunity for Song You.</p><p></p><p>As for higher-level formation disks, Meng Chong naturally wouldn't give them to Song You to use. After all, they weren't that close. Giving Song You an outdated formation disk he couldn't use was already quite generous.</p><p></p><p>"Formation disk?" Song You was stunned again. What was this? He had never heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>He thought he was quite knowledgeable, coming from a big faction, but he had never heard of such miraculous pills, and now these formation disks and formations were also unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"The formation disk is very simple to use, you just need to do this..." Meng Chong explained how to use the formation disk.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, thank you for your great kindness, Brother Meng!" Song You said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Take this mask."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong handed a Diying mask to Song You, then instructed him on how to create a plan to deceive the Wanbao Alliance, making it seem like he was a secret agent of the Song family who had been plotting for years, looking for an opportunity to assassinate Yan Shanhe and his son without implicating the Song family.</p><p></p><p>As long as it succeeded, the Song family would definitely be implicated, and Yan Shanhe of the Wanbao Alliance would surely destroy the Song family in a fit of rage. This way, Song You's revenge would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Brother Meng, I know what to do. I will definitely succeed!" Song You said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The dawn of revenge had appeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could get his revenge, even if he perished, it would be worth it! Song You began his action, first to confirm the whereabouts of Yan Shanhe and his only son Yan Long, and then to wait for a suitable opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also decided to stay in the Changyu Realm for now.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe's only son Yan Long was the young master of the Wanbao Alliance in the Changyu Realm. With extraordinary talent, he naturally practiced the most top-tier cultivation methods and lacked neither cultivation resources nor guidance from immortal heavenly venerable cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Yan Long had an 80% chance of breaking through to the immortal realm, so Yan Shanhe doted on this only son excessively. He was absolutely Yan Shanhe's reverse scale.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the major factions and among the powerful cultivators in the Changyu Realm knew that the person one must not offend in the Wanbao Alliance was Yan Long! For the safety of his only son, to ensure no accidents would occur, Yan Shanhe personally selected a rogue cultivator who was just a hair's breadth away from breaking through to the immortal heavenly venerable realm, bestowed upon him stronger cultivation methods and resources to help him break through to the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The price was to become Yan Long's guard.</p><p></p><p>Having an immortal heavenly venerable as a guard was a treatment that even the top geniuses of some major factions didn't enjoy.</p><p></p><p>This shows how much Yan Shanhe valued Yan Long, and also indirectly reflects the wealth and generosity of the Wanbao Alliance, being able to have an immortal heavenly venerable as an attendant.</p><p></p><p>Although the incident of Meng Chong robbing the Wanbao Alliance had occurred, few people were worried about Yan Long's safety, after all, Yan Long had an immortal heavenly venerable protecting him.</p><p></p><p>Yan Long was not in Baimu City, but traveling around.</p><p></p><p>On this day, just after leaving a city, a beautiful woman appeared by Yan Long's side, serving him. Several peak true king heavenly venerable guards were on alert, not allowing anyone to approach.</p><p></p><p>An immortal heavenly venerable was also protecting him in secret.</p><p></p><p>"I really envy Yan Long!"</p><p></p><p>"Worthy of being Changyu's number one young master, wherever he goes, there are genius beauties willing to serve him!"</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary talent, noble birth, endless resources... I wish I had a good father!"</p><p></p><p>"Give it up, with your aptitude, if your father was Yan Shanhe, he probably would have sent you to some remote mountain long ago!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the city looked at Yan Long's group leaving the city with envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong?!"</p><p></p><p>A low voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"You protect the young master."</p><p></p><p>A figure burst forth with momentum, rushing towards a bald young man who appeared in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss! Meng Chong actually wants to kill Yan Long? This is even more serious than robbing the Wanbao Alliance branch. Yan Shanhe might personally take action."</p><p></p><p>"Too arrogant, he's simply not putting Yan Shanhe in his eyes at all."</p><p></p><p>"What background does Meng Chong have? His martial arts are terrifyingly strong, there might be a top expert backing him, so he's not afraid of Yan Shanhe."</p><p></p><p>"This is not just Yan Shanhe's matter anymore, but the entire Wanbao Alliance. You should know that the Wanbao Alliance has extremely deep connections with those great realms."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the martial artists watched the Immortal Venerable chasing after Meng Chong, they were all shocked. Meanwhile, Yan Long's group, who had continued moving forward, suddenly encountered an ambush.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared without warning, as if it had been lying in wait.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, protect the young master!" </p><p></p><p>Yan Long's guards were furious and alarmed. They all attacked, but their strikes missed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were terrified to realize that the figure was just an illusion! The real attacker was elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Yan Long let out a cold snort. His strength was extremely high among True King Venerables. As long as it wasn't an Immortal Venerable attacking, or a freak like Meng Chong, he wasn't afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He threw out a punch, but suddenly his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The attack he saw was inverted. The real attack came from another direction! In this critical moment, he hurriedly pulled the woman beside him over to use her as a shield against the attack.</p><p></p><p>Poof! As a result, his expression changed wildly again - this attack was also fake!</p><p></p><p>With the sudden changes and abrupt attack, in such a critical moment, how could he distinguish the power of the inversion formation?</p><p></p><p>As an intense crisis descended, Yan Long hurriedly twisted his body to dodge. A powerful energy shield also rose up around his body. However, a sharp blade pierced through the energy shield, penetrated his armor, and stabbed into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Swish! Blood gushed out. At this moment, Yan Long saw the attacker. It seemed the attacker had used some secret technique to instantly boost their strength.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The guards were terrified. One of them suddenly rushed forward to shield Yan Long's body.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The blade pierced through his body, but it blocked the truly fatal strike. The other guards hurriedly attacked.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Long took this opportunity to frantically retreat.</p><p></p><p>Song You felt somewhat regretful. His strength was ultimately a bit lacking. Even though he had burst out to his limit, he still failed to kill Yan Long in one strike. Now that he had missed the opportunity, it was too late for him to attack again.</p><p></p><p>The guards were already frantically attacking.</p><p></p><p>Song You let out a low roar and attacked madly, as if he didn't care about his life. Even as he was beaten until he coughed up blood, he still tried to assassinate Yan Long.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, quickly leave!"</p><p></p><p>One guard shielded Yan Long's front as they frantically retreated. Another guard shouted loudly: "Whoever captures the assassin will be heavily rewarded by our Myriad Treasures Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists who had been stunned before now became excited upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Several True King Venerables flew over.</p><p></p><p>"That's about it!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Song You showed a regretful expression. In the midst of the battle, the mask on his face suddenly shattered. His expression changed wildly as he waved his hand to pulverize the mask. He even endured a hit in order to tear off a sleeve to cover his face.</p><p></p><p>"Song You?"</p><p></p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>The former young master who had been expelled from the Song family, who was currently being hunted by the Song family? He actually tried to assassinate Yan Long?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not Song You. Assassinating Yan Long is due to a personal grudge between him and me!"</p><p></p><p>Song You's eyes showed a panicked look, but he quickly calmed down and frantically fled.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, capture Song You!"</p><p></p><p>A group of martial artists chased after him madly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many people had a thought - was the Song family going to betray Yan Shanhe? Although Song You had been expelled, who knew if it was just an act? Moreover, that mask Song You wore...</p><p></p><p>For most people, they had never imagined someone would seek revenge in this way. So their first thought was that this was a cunning scheme by the treacherous Song family - attempting to assassinate Yan Long and then disavowing any connection to the incident.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The aura of an Immortal Venerable descended.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable who had just been chasing Meng Chong immediately changed expression.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, although Yan Long's injuries were severe, at least his life wasn't in danger and his foundation wasn't damaged.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Meng Chong?" </p><p></p><p>Yan Long's face was extremely gloomy, filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, he had come so close to death.</p><p></p><p>It was also the first time someone dared to try to assassinate him!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong seemed to have just happened to appear here by coincidence. His target was the Myriad Treasures Alliance in this city, not the young master!" </p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Return to White Wood City!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Long said through gritted teeth: "Song family!"</p><p></p><p>Song You was frantically fleeing. Thanks to the burst of power from pills, he finally shook off his pursuers. At this moment, he almost wanted to laugh wildly - the plan had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>However, from now on he would face the pursuit of the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Flee, for as long as I can!"</p><p></p><p>Song You didn't dare stop for a moment and continued to flee, looking for a hidden place to heal his wounds. Afterwards, he would gather intelligence about the Song family.</p><p></p><p>White Wood City.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe received a secret intelligence report about the Song family, one of their subordinate forces.</p><p></p><p>"Song You's expulsion was just an act? The former Song family patriarch didn't actually die?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe frowned. Many people knew about the former Song family patriarch's death, after all, the death of an Immortal Venerable was a shocking major event.</p><p></p><p>"Could they have used some kind of fake death secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>However, Yan Shanhe couldn't understand what purpose the Song family had for doing this. Moreover, the new Song family patriarch had led the clan elders to pledge allegiance to him.</p><p></p><p>They had even killed many supporters of the former patriarch for this.</p><p></p><p>"Keep the Song family under secret surveillance."</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe pondered. The more it was like this, the more it showed the Song family had great schemes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable acknowledged and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a guard responsible for intelligence in the Myriad Treasures Alliance hurriedly entered, with a very solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, the Young Alliance Leader was ambushed and severely injured!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe's eyes flashed with a terrifying light, and a fierce killing intent spread out. That guard directly collapsed to the ground, unable to withstand the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Who dared to assassinate my son?!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Shanhe seemed ready to devour someone.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, it was Song You!"</p><p></p><p>Then, he reported the details of the assassination attempt to Yan Shanhe.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. Is the Song family's scheme to take my position as Alliance Leader? Do they really think the position of Alliance Leader is so easy to replace? The Song family must be exterminated!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe was extremely furious at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood that the Song family's scheme was aimed at the Myriad Treasures Alliance of the Long Cloud Realm, wanting to gain more influence from within.</p><p></p><p>"The Song family is already a force supported by the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow!"</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it was the Song family plotting for his position as Alliance Leader, but behind the scenes, it was Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow controlling everything.</p><p></p><p>"Do they really think my Myriad Treasures Alliance is so easy to infiltrate?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe was enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me to exterminate the Song family!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Shanhe was filled with killing intent, no longer showing any trace of his usual amiable demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The many forces and numerous experts in White Wood City were shocked to see Yan Shanhe leading many Immortal Venerables and powerful guards of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, descending on the Song family's location with murderous intent reaching the skies.</p><p></p><p>The news quickly spread - the Song family had great schemes, Song You had failed to assassinate Yan Long and exposed the Song family's plot! Everyone was shocked, and the Song family members were even more dumbfounded! What Song You did had nothing to do with the Song family, they were being wrongly accused!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

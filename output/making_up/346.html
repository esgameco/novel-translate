            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhe State was named for its abundance of mountains, rivers, and lakes. Many buildings were even constructed directly on the lakes.</p><p></p><p>One day, dozens of cultivator warriors rushed in from the Cloud State, bringing a shocking news to the Spiritual Sovereign of the Great Zhe State. </p><p></p><p>A disastrous flood was heading towards the Great Zhe State, the Cloud State had already been devastated with countless casualties!</p><p></p><p>The news shook the Great Zhe State. Many fled to the highlands in haste, while some remained skeptical.</p><p></p><p>That day, the rivers in the Great Zhe State suddenly swelled, and the flood arrived. Though weakened after passing through the Cloud State, the flood still submerged countless cities and towns, sweeping away those who couldn't escape in time.</p><p></p><p>The flood continued to spread, surging towards the Da Chuan State and Li State, but was significantly weakened after passing through the Cloud State and the Great Zhe State. The Da Chuan State, with its abundant mountains and rivers, was able to effectively block the flood's further advance.</p><p></p><p>Then, a shocking discovery was made - those who came into contact with the floodwaters, below the Patriarch realm, would experience symptoms of intense heat, reddened skin, and violent behavior. Even Patriarch realm cultivators afflicted would take days to recover.</p><p></p><p>In the Ice State, the snow had completely melted. Beautiful women, cultivators of the Quiet Snow Palace, were now walking in the rivers, their delicate figures barely covered by thin veils, occasionally revealing glimpses of their beauty.</p><p></p><p>These women were no longer themselves. A languid beauty lay on a couch, drifting downstream, emanating a soothing aura. This aura seemed to have a strange effect on the surrounding spiritual energy, as if disrupting the natural laws.</p><p></p><p>"Those who deceived me will meet a bad end," the beauty said coldly. "You think escaping the Ice State will save you?"</p><p></p><p>The black cave of the Quiet Snow Palace continued to expand, as if a black hole had appeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from the Cloud State encountered the women on the river and inquired about the changes in the Ice State. The women responded with coy laughter, luring the men onto their boats, where they began to... </p><p></p><p>The men were horrified to discover that the women were draining their spiritual energy and souls, growing stronger with each victim. One cultivator managed to break free, but the women's alluring voices continued to tempt him.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the Quiet Snow Palace had been corrupted, the cultivator fled to warn the higher authorities. More cultivators entered the Ice State, only to disappear as well.</p><p></p><p>The languid beauty reveled in her "hunting ground", eagerly awaiting the return of her "Wood Wood". The slaughter continued in the Cloud State, as all who encountered the Quiet Snow Palace women met a gruesome end, their bodies shriveled and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The witch muttered in her mouth. In front of the black cave where the Jingxue Palace was located, a cultivator of divine martial arts stood in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked, and his instinct told him that all these changes were related to this black cave-like cave.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm has never had such a cave before, I can't stay here, I must go to Hongzhou and report to the senior sect!"</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and he fled far away from the black cave, rushing towards Hongzhou without daring to stop for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Finally someone has discovered it, let more powerful people come, it will be more interesting to hunt them, these are still too weak."</p><p></p><p>The witch's figure suddenly appeared above the cave, and she smiled.</p><p></p><p>The changes in Bingzhou had not yet spread to Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>The communication system established by the Wanshi Alliance was still short in time and was blocked by the Superb Spiritual Sect, so it had not yet spread to Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the changes in Bingzhou, Yunzhou, and Dazhe State had not spread to Hongzhou quickly, and the Superb Spiritual Sect that ruled the Spiritual Realm was still unaware of the drastic changes that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from Yunzhou, Dazhe State, and Dachuan State were on their way to Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>Yunzhou had turned into a lake, and the martial artists who survived the great flood were facing a new disaster.</p><p></p><p>The battle of the genius cultivators was approaching its end.</p><p></p><p>The top hundred genius cultivators were about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Spiritual Sects all had gloomy expressions. After ruling the Spiritual Realm for countless years, in this battle of the genius cultivators, not a single genius from the Spiritual Sects entered the top five, and they were all crushed by the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance was in the limelight, especially the junior alliance master Fang Hao, whose martial arts and methods once again shocked the entire Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the scattered cultivators seemed to have found their backbone, their morale was high, and they were determined to change the pattern of the Spiritual Realm and overthrow the rule of the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>On the Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship, Xu Yan took out the divine object he had obtained in the Cyan Sea. He left behind enough spiritual essence for himself and gave the rest to Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his senior brother Xu Yan was so capable, making an indelible contribution to his martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The battle of the genius cultivators continued, and Xu Yan had already begun to accumulate more spiritual essence to prepare for the breakthrough to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu were striving to reach the Spiritual Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to end," Li Xuan sighed, the grand battle of the genius cultivators was about to come to a close.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance had truly stood up in the Spiritual Realm, completely breaking the pattern of the Spiritual Realm and shaking the rule of the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>But would the Superb Spiritual Sect just admit defeat? Li Xuan had some doubts, were they secretly preparing some moves? And would the other Spiritual Sects, including the Thousand Martial Hall, be willing to accept this humiliation and not seek revenge?</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the first layer of the Unextinguishable Body of the Great Sun and Stars, you have broken through the first layer of the Unextinguishable Body of the Great Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong finally comprehended the martial dao of the first layer of the Unextinguishable Body of the Great Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt the changes in his physical body, and his heart was filled with excitement, his strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>Both the orthodox martial dao and the physical martial dao had reached the Divine Manifestation Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the medicinal martial dao would probably not be far behind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already explained the martial dao of the Divine Manifestation Realm to Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Xuan felt that Xu Yan seemed to have some insights into the martial dao of breaking through the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through the Void Realm won't be too far away, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the final battle of the genius cultivators came to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Zhou, Fu Tianhai, the Sect Master of the Thunder Cloud Sect, the Lord of the Yuling Manor, the Sect Master of the Thousand Martial Hall, and the Sect Master of the Tai Miao Sect stood in the air and announced the results of this genius cultivator competition.</p><p></p><p>"The number one genius cultivator of the Spiritual Realm is Xu Yan, the second is Meng Chong..."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Emperor of the Great Zhou echoed far and wide.</p><p></p><p>"The top hundred genius cultivators of the Spiritual Realm have all obtained a spot, and in one month, they will all enter a treasure land in the Spiritual Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of treasure land, the Emperor of the Great Zhou did not specify.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Thousand Martial Hall had a cold expression, his gaze turning to the Thousand Martial Hall camp, and the Elder Wielding the Sword nodded, indicating that they were ready.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Great Zhou finished speaking and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>As for the matters of the Wanshi Alliance, they were unrelated to the Great Zhou, the territory of Shengzhou was directly ruled by the Great Zhou, and the Wanshi Alliance would not intervene.</p><p></p><p>As for the other territories ruled by the Spiritual Sects, he couldn't be bothered to care.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is ruled by the Spiritual Sects, and this pattern cannot be violated. Any person or force that wants to change this pattern will be wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon and the Blood God Cult were like this, and if the Wanshi Alliance is obstinate, they will also end up with the same fate.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanshi Alliance's methods are extraordinary, especially the junior alliance master Fang Hao's array techniques, which are shocking, but if they think they can act recklessly and violate the rules of the Spiritual Realm, they are only seeking their own destruction.</p><p></p><p>"However, considering the establishment of the Wanshi Alliance and its importance to the stability of the Spiritual Realm, we can discuss it, but there is one rule that cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is ruled by the Spiritual Sects, and if the Wanshi Alliance wants to exist, it can only become a Spiritual Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Thunder Cloud Sect looked at the Wanshi Alliance side and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm is ruled by the Spiritual Sects, and it cannot be violated!</p><p></p><p>But the Wanshi Alliance is indeed powerful, so if the Wanshi Alliance wants to exist, it must be promoted to a Spiritual Sect, not just a scattered force.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it will be promoted to the top-tier Spiritual Sect or the same level as the Superb Spiritual Sect, the Sect Master of the Thunder Cloud Sect did not mention, apparently leaving a space for the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This statement also gave the Wanshi Alliance a way out. As long as they become a Spiritual Sect, just like the others, their existence would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"What rule is it that the Spiritual Realm must be ruled by the Spiritual Sects?" Tan Wenlin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The rule is the rule, it's not something you or I can define, nor is it something our Superb Spiritual Sect can define, you Wanshi Alliance should take care of yourselves," the Lord of the Yuling Manor said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Rules are meant to be broken, and I, the Wanshi Alliance, will not join the Spiritual Sects, let's see how we can do it," Fang Hao said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>Before the Sect Master of the Thunder Cloud Sect could say anything else, more than a dozen figures rushed in frantically, their voices anxious and trembling:</p><p></p><p>"The senior sect master, a great disaster has occurred, Bingzhou and Yunzhou have suffered heavy casualties!"</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Bingzhou has melted, the great flood has swept through Yunzhou and Dazhe State, Yunzhou has already been submerged, the casualties are countless!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior sect master, please take charge quickly, a great disaster has befallen our Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Especially the cultivators from Yunzhou and Dazhe State, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Thunder Cloud Sect and the others hurried over, their expressions changing.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Are there any people from Bingzhou?"</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right, there are no cultivators from Bingzhou here, not even one from the Jingxue Palace?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were horrified to realize that in such a major event in the Spiritual Realm, there were no cultivators from Bingzhou present!

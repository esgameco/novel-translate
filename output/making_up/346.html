        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Daze State was named for its many mountains, rivers, and lakes. There were numerous buildings situated on lakes, even built directly on the water.</p><p></p><p>On this day, dozens of Spirit Realm cultivators hurriedly arrived from Yun State and found the spiritual leader of Daze State, bringing shocking news.</p><p></p><p>A world-ending flood was heading towards Daze State. Yun State had already fallen, with countless casualties!</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, Daze State was shaken. Countless people were anxious and uneasy. Some decisive individuals immediately fled to higher ground with their families.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who remained skeptical.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the rivers of Daze State suddenly swelled. The flood had arrived! Although it had weakened after passing through Yun State, Daze State already had many rivers and lakes. Under the flood's onslaught, it was as if the entire state had become one giant lake.</p><p></p><p>Countless cities were submerged. Countless people who couldn't escape in time disappeared into the floodwaters.</p><p></p><p>The flood continued to spread, surging towards Dachuan State and Li State. But after being buffered by Yun State and Daze State, the flood caused by Ice State's melting snow had greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Dachuan State had many mountains and rivers that effectively blocked the flood's continued spread.</p><p></p><p>Then, an even more shocking thing happened. The floodwaters seemed to contain something unusual. People who came into contact with the water, if they were cultivators below the Master realm, developed symptoms of fever, reddened skin, and became agitated.</p><p></p><p>Even in Yun State, even Master realm cultivators who were contaminated by this water would develop these symptoms, taking several days to recover.</p><p></p><p>Ice State was now as warm as spring.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful women were walking in the rivers formed by Ice State's melting snow, wearing only thin gauzy clothes. Their graceful figures occasionally revealed glimpses of spring scenery.</p><p></p><p>These beauties were all cultivators from the Silent Snow Palace, but they were no longer their original selves.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, a beauty lay languidly on a couch, drifting along the river out of Ice State. Behind her was a warm and moist aura.</p><p></p><p>The warm and moist aura spread, and the spiritual energy between heaven and earth seemed to become somewhat abnormal. The power of heaven and earth's laws continuously emerged, yet it seemed unable to find the source of the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"Those who deceive me never come to a good end."</p><p></p><p>"You think escaping Ice State means you're safe?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm coming!"</p><p></p><p>The beauty's eyes were full of coldness.</p><p></p><p>She looked back towards where the Silent Snow Palace was located. The black cave was still expanding, as if a black hole had appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally expanded. Now I can send more power through."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the beauty's lips.</p><p></p><p>After ten thousand years of erosion, a cave had finally opened successfully today, allowing power to be sent through.</p><p></p><p>"Friends from Silent Snow Palace, what changes have occurred in Ice State?" </p><p></p><p>Some Spirit Realm cultivators who had come from Yun State saw the beauties on the river and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>These were all cultivators from Silent Snow Palace, which was the ruling spiritual sect of Ice State.</p><p></p><p>Although they were puzzled about why the Silent Snow Palace members were dressed so revealingly, in the face of such a world-ending crisis, they had no mind to appreciate it. They hurriedly came forward to inquire.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, looking around, where was there any trace of ice and snow left in Ice State? They had an ominous thought - the melting of Ice State's ice and snow had formed the flood that swept towards Yun State and Daze State.</p><p></p><p>Why would Ice State's ice and snow melt? This was an unbelievable thing. For countless years, Ice State's snow had never melted.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... it's nothing. Come, I'll tell you!"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful women let out crisp, coquettish laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>Behind them, a Spirit Realm cultivator stopped in his tracks. He vaguely felt that something was off about the Silent Snow Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the Spirit Realm cultivators in front were completely dumbfounded. They were pulled onto the boat by the female cultivators from Silent Snow Palace, their clothes stripped off. They watched as the Silent Snow Palace beauties crouched down and opened their small mouths...</p><p></p><p>The men were utterly stupefied! Had the Silent Snow Palace beauties become so hungry for this?</p><p></p><p>In this moment, these Spirit Realm cultivators were torn internally between continuing to investigate the source of the crisis or enjoying themselves first. Yun State had nearly become hell on earth, yet they still had the mood to enjoy themselves?</p><p></p><p>What beasts! Many Spirit Realm cultivators cursed themselves silently, about to righteously rebuke the Silent Snow Palace women and push away the beauties who had crouched down with open mouths.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, looks of horror appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>That kind of outpouring ecstasy went straight into their souls. But more terrifying was that the outpouring seemed unstoppable. Not only was their essence blood pouring out, even their souls were pouring away.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, these Spirit Realm cultivators realized the danger.</p><p></p><p>Shocked, they were about to kill the women crouched below them, but were horrified to find they could no longer act! Thud! Their withered bodies, as if sucked dry, collapsed. Their sunken eye sockets were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Yet there also seemed to be an expression of dying in pleasure!</p><p></p><p>"What a wonderful taste. I can become stronger now. Wherever the water flows, I can go."</p><p></p><p>The languid beauty on the couch behind showed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>A faint blush appeared on her delicate white face.</p><p></p><p>All of the Spirit Realm cultivators had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm cultivator who had stopped behind now felt his scalp tingling, his eyes filled with fear!</p><p></p><p>Something had gone wrong with Silent Snow Palace! He turned and fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Don't run, come enjoy yourself!"</p><p></p><p>The enchanting voice behind him entered straight into his soul, arousing his primal desires, nearly making him lose his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>That Spirit Realm cultivator's eyes suddenly turned fierce. With a boom, he directly damaged part of his own soul.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain allowed him to break free from that soul-stirring voice.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the pain, he fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>"What a tough guy."</p><p></p><p>One of the Silent Snow Palace women spoke with an admiring tone.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly flee, notify the powerful cultivators of the upper sects. Silent Snow Palace has undergone a drastic change, Ice State's snow has melted..."</p><p></p><p>Enduring the intense pain in his soul, the Spirit Realm cultivator who had escaped Ice State encountered another group of cultivators coming to investigate the flood disaster. He roared out these words.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>That cultivator endured the soul pain and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a peak Spirit Realm cultivator said solemnly: "Quickly send a message to Hong State. I'll go investigate the location of Silent Snow Palace."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he hurriedly took a wide detour around this area, heading towards Silent Snow Palace's location.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, several groups of cultivators successively entered Ice State, and all eventually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Little brothers in the water, come up quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Silent Snow Palace women rode small boats out of Ice State and arrived in Yun State, seeing people in the water.</p><p></p><p>A slaughter unfolded in Yun State.</p><p></p><p>One withered corpse after another floated away in all directions with the water.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of gender, all who encountered the Silent Snow Palace women turned into withered corpses. Even spirit beasts ultimately could not escape this fate.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful, how great, this is my hunting ground, this is my treasure land!" </p><p></p><p>The languid beauty's jade face was flushed red, as if drunk on wine, muttering to herself.</p><p></p><p>"Completely occupy this place, no one can fight me for it. This is my unique hunting ground. But where has my Mumu gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Mumu, you're still the best. I will find you."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is this? What's going on?" he exclaimed in shock. His instincts told him that all these strange occurrences were related to this cave-like black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Such a cave has never existed in the Spirit Realm before. This won't do, I must go to Hong Province and report to the sect!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly moved away from the black cave and frantically fled towards Hong Province, not daring to stop for even a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Finally someone has discovered it. I hope more powerful people come - it will be more interesting to hunt them. These ones are still too weak," Mei Wu's figure suddenly appeared above the cave, smiling.</p><p></p><p>The upheaval in Ice Province and the great changes across the Spirit Realm had not yet reached Hong Province. </p><p></p><p>The communication system established by the Eternal Alliance was still new and had been obstructed by the Transcendent Spirit Sects, so it had not yet spread to Hong Province.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, news of the disasters in Ice Province, Cloud Province, and Great Marsh Province had not reached Hong Province so quickly. The Transcendent Spirit Sects that ruled the Spirit Realm were still unaware of the dramatic changes that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Heavenly Human realm from Cloud Province, Great Marsh Province, and Great River Province were on their way to Hong Province.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Province had turned into a lake, and the cultivators who survived the great flood were now facing new disasters.</p><p></p><p>The Battle of Geniuses was nearing its end. The top 100 geniuses were about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sect cultivators all looked extremely displeased. After ruling the Spirit Realm for countless years, not a single Spirit Sect genius had made it into the top five in this Battle of Geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Body geniuses should have displayed their might and demonstrated the prestige of the Transcendent Spirit Sects. But in the end, not one of them could enter the top five - they were all crushed by independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Alliance was in ascendance, especially the young alliance leader Fang Hao, whose martial arts and techniques had once again shocked the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the independent cultivators felt like they had found a leader to rally behind. Their fighting spirit was high as they vowed to change the structure of the Spirit Realm and overthrow the Spirit Sects' rule.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship of the Evergreen Pavilion, Xu Yan took out the divine objects he had obtained in the Blue Sea. After keeping enough to fully accumulate his foundation, he gave the rest to Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, thinking that Senior Brother Xu Yan was too dedicated, making an indelible contribution to his own martial path.</p><p></p><p>As the Battle of Geniuses continued, Xu Yan had already begun to accumulate more foundation in preparation for breaking through to the Divine Sense realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu were going all out to reach the peak of the Divine Element realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to end," Li Xuan sighed. The grand Battle of Geniuses was coming to a close.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Alliance had truly established itself in the Spirit Realm, completely breaking the existing structure and shaking the Spirit Sects' rule.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan wondered if the Transcendent Spirit Sects would really admit defeat just like that. He suspected they might be secretly preparing some kind of move. The other Transcendent Spirit Sects aside, would the Thousand Martial Palace really be content with failure? After being humiliated, wouldn't they want revenge?</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the first level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars. You have broken through to the first level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had finally comprehended the martial technique of the first level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt the changes in his physical body and was excited - his strength had increased once again.</p><p></p><p>Both his orthodox martial arts and physical martial arts had broken through to the Divine Form realm.</p><p></p><p>And his alchemy and medical martial arts likely weren't far behind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was already explaining Divine Form realm martial techniques to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Xuan sensed that Xu Yan seemed to have gained some insights into Void Breaking realm martial techniques as well.</p><p></p><p>"Void Breaking can't be too far off either, right?" Li Xuan thought expectantly.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the final battle of the Battle of Geniuses finally came to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou, Fu Tianhai, the Master of Thunder Cloud Manor, the Lord of Spirit Control Manor, the Master of Thousand Martial Palace, and the Sect Leader of Tai Miao Sect stood in mid-air to announce the results of this Battle of Geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"The number one genius of the Spirit Realm is Xu Yan, second is Meng Chong..." The Emperor of Great Zhou's voice boomed out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The top 100 geniuses of the Spirit Realm have all earned spots. In one month, they will enter a treasure land of the Spirit Realm together..."</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of treasure land it was, the Emperor of Great Zhou did not specify.</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thousand Martial Palace had a cold expression as he looked towards the Thousand Martial Palace camp. The Sword Elder nodded, indicating he was ready.</p><p></p><p>After finishing speaking, the Emperor of Great Zhou fell silent.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of the Eternal Alliance, it had nothing to do with his Great Zhou Kingdom. The territory of Victory Province was under the direct rule of Great Zhou, and the Eternal Alliance would not interfere there.</p><p></p><p>As for the other lands ruled by the Spirit Sects, he couldn't be bothered to manage them.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is ruled by the Spirit Sects. This is an inviolable structure. Any person or force that tries to change this structure will be reduced to ashes."</p><p></p><p>"It was so for the Blood Demon and Blood God Cult in the past. If the Eternal Alliance remains obstinate, they will ultimately meet the same fate."</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Alliance's methods are impressive, especially those of young alliance leader Fang. His mastery of formations is shocking. But if they think they can act recklessly because of this and violate the rules of the Spirit Realm, they are seeking their own destruction."</p><p></p><p>"However, in light of the Eternal Alliance's establishment and its importance for the stability of the Spirit Realm, we can discuss matters. But there is one rule that cannot be changed."</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is the domain ruled by the Spirit Sects. If the Eternal Alliance wishes to exist, it can only do so by becoming a Spirit Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thunder Cloud Manor looked towards the Eternal Alliance as he spoke sternly.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was ruled by the Spirit Sects - this could not be violated!</p><p></p><p>But the Eternal Alliance's strength was a fact. Therefore, if the Eternal Alliance wanted to exist, it had to be elevated to a Spirit Sect, rather than remain an independent cultivator force.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it would be elevated to a top-tier Spirit Sect or ranked equally with the Transcendent Spirit Sects, the Master of Thunder Cloud Manor did not specify, clearly leaving some room for the Eternal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>These words also gave the Eternal Alliance a way out.</p><p></p><p>By being elevated to a Spirit Sect, they would be the same as the others, all belonging to the Spirit Sects. This way, the existence of the Eternal Alliance would no longer be an issue.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of rule is it that the Spirit Realm must be ruled by Spirit Sects?" Tan Wenlin asked sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Rules are rules. They are not for you or me to decide, nor even for us Transcendent Spirit Sects to decide. Your Eternal Alliance had better be careful," the Lord of Spirit Control Manor said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Rules are meant to be broken. My Eternal Alliance will not join the Spirit Sects. Let's see what you can do about it," Fang Hao said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thunder Cloud Manor was about to say something when suddenly, over a dozen figures came flying in frantically, their voices anxious and trembling:</p><p></p><p>"Honored Sect Leaders, terrible news! Disaster has struck Ice Province and Cloud Province, with countless dead and injured!"</p><p></p><p>"The ice in Ice Province has melted, and a great flood has swept through Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province. Cloud Province has been submerged, with innumerable casualties!"</p><p></p><p>"Honored Sect Leaders, please take charge of the situation quickly! A great calamity has befallen our Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The entire gathering fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Especially the powerful cultivators from Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province - their expressions all changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>The Master of Thunder Cloud Manor and the others all changed expression and instantly went to meet the newcomers.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Are there any people from Ice Province?"</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. There are no cultivators from Ice Province here. Not a single person from Snow Palace came?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were horrified to realize that in such a grand event of the Spirit Realm, there wasn't a single cultivator from Ice Province present!</p>

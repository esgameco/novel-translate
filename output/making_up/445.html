        <h1>Chapter 445</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon's consciousness was destroyed, transforming into a giant web of flames that sealed off all directions. At this moment, the flames automatically gathered together, turning into a bright red flame that emitted a scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out his hand and directly absorbed the flame into his mouth. With a light tap of his finger, layers of restrictions fell, sealing away the flame.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not a practitioner of the esoteric arts, he was familiar with restrictions and knew how to seal treasures. After all, the art of sealing was not too profound and not difficult to learn, so Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu had all learned sealing techniques.</p><p></p><p>After being sealed, the flame became gentle and no longer emitted a scorching aura, appearing like just a bright red flower.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Duwu's expression changed repeatedly. After all, this flame contained a trace of the Flame Demon's primordial fire. What method did Xu Yan use to subdue the flame so easily?</p><p></p><p>He had thought that even with the Flame Demon's consciousness dispersed, it would take Xu Yan considerable effort to subdue this flame. He never expected Xu Yan to subdue the Flame Demon's primordial fire so easily.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu had encountered trouble and was preoccupied. The Flame Demon had also been defeated. Only the injured Duwu remained, and alone he was no match for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, I hope you truly rise to power. Otherwise, you will surely die one day!" Duwu said coldly.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, he self-destructed this avatar.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the three powerful beings who had sent avatars had all failed, especially Meiwu, who seemed to have been ambushed and suffered greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, both Duwu and the Flame Demon had taken note of Xu Yan. If given the chance, they would surely kill him!</p><p></p><p>"I'll meet your true selves sooner or later," Xu Yan said dismissively of Duwu's threat.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through the void, heaven and earth, establishing the Dao - once I break through to the Establishing the Dao realm, I should be able to deal with them, right?" Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time I broke through."</p><p></p><p>Now that he had obtained the treasure, it was time to prepare for breaking through to the Breaking Through the Void realm.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying, just you wait. Once I break through to the Breaking Through the Void realm, we'll take our time playing," Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Once he entered the Breaking Through the Void realm, Immortal Venerable Lords would no longer pose any threat to him. Even if surrounded by Immortal Venerable Lords, he would not fear them.</p><p></p><p>The power of Breaking Through the Void could easily shatter an Immortal Venerable Lord's control over heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough would be a significant leap forward.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan emerged from the celestial abyss and gazed out at the vast and deep Guangyou Realm. He decided to find a place to seclude himself and prepare for breaking through to the Breaking Through the Void realm.</p><p></p><p>It was also time to sort through the gains from this venture.</p><p></p><p>Especially that jade bamboo - it looked extraordinary and might be useful in comprehending the Establishing the Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan departed in an instant to find a suitable place for seclusion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, Li Xuan had not gone to see Tianzi for some time. He couldn't rush getting more secrets of heaven and earth from Tianzi for now.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan successfully ambushed a supreme being with your sword. You have obtained the Thousand Machinations Technique," came the sudden feedback from the Golden Book of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He had successfully ambushed Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Machinations Technique, that will be useful."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Machinations Technique was a special divine ability that could control power that had invaded an enemy's body from an infinite distance. It could also control this trace of power, constantly strengthening it and even hiding it.</p><p></p><p>As long as the enemy's strength was not vastly superior, they would be unable to eliminate the power of the Thousand Machinations Technique.</p><p></p><p>When fighting an enemy of similar strength, as long as the enemy was wounded by oneself, one could use the Thousand Machinations Technique to continuously invade the enemy, preventing their wounds from healing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it could also be used to secretly ambush enemies. Once an enemy was ambushed, even if only lightly wounded, the Thousand Machinations Technique could be used to continuously damage the enemy's body and worsen their injuries.</p><p></p><p>Anyone affected by the Thousand Machinations Technique, unless they had an absolute advantage in strength to instantly suppress and eliminate its power, would find it like a persistent parasite, impossible to get rid of.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. Let's try out the Thousand Machinations Technique," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind slightly and instantly sensed the power of his wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, Meiwu's strength is so formidable!" In that instant, Li Xuan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu's strength was even greater than his current level.</p><p></p><p>"Although stronger than me now, my sword is not so easily eliminated. And now with the Thousand Machinations Technique, Meiwu will never be able to get rid of this sword," Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his fingers moved slightly, and a mysterious aura appeared, seeming to connect across an infinite distance.</p><p></p><p>A sword chime rang out inside Meiwu's body. In an instant, that sword began to move within her, constantly refining external power to strengthen itself.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu's strength is impressive!" Li Xuan sensed the powerful force suppressing the sword and exclaimed again.</p><p></p><p>"However, you are completely unfamiliar with my sword dao. Trying to eliminate it is a foolish dream."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's fingers danced as he sensed that sword in the depths of consciousness. When faced with Meiwu's power, it suddenly dispersed, becoming formless and traceless, evading Meiwu's power and regathering into a sword somewhere else in her body.</p><p></p><p>"Although I've finished reading the Primordial Book, I won't be bored in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in high spirits. Fighting this powerful being Meiwu across space was truly fascinating.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the battlefield was inside Meiwu's body, which made it even more interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Meiwu's aura is fluctuating violently. Is she so angry she's about to go mad?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu's strength was truly formidable. If not for the Thousand Machinations Technique controlling that sword, with Meiwu's power and methods, she would be able to eliminate the sword given some time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that time might not be too short.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of this sword was not enough to pose a fatal threat to her, it constantly caused trouble inside her body. Meiwu had to divert some of her attention and power to control this sword and prevent it from growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Meiwu's strength would be diminished, putting her at a disadvantage when facing former powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>"This Thousand Machinations Technique is really interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was thoroughly enjoying himself.</p><p></p><p>He controlled the sword inside Meiwu's body, playing a game of hide-and-seek with her.</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu's strength is roughly equivalent to the Establishing the Dao realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had also made a judgment about Meiwu's strength - about equivalent to the Establishing the Dao realm. Of course, not his Establishing the Dao realm, but that of cultivators from the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Xuan's strength was a hundred times that of Xu Yan at the same level. Once he entered the Establishing the Dao realm, he would be able to crush Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>"The Establishing the Dao realm is still much, much stronger than the Heaven and Earth realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The further one progressed, the greater the power gap between each realm became.</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu is indeed outside this world, not within this heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Using the Thousand Machinations Technique to sense that sword, Li Xuan confirmed that Meiwu was not within the Taicang world, but outside it. However, she was constantly getting closer to the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"Driven mad with anger? But it's useless. You can't enter the Taicang world, and even if you could, you wouldn't be able to find me. I'm not afraid of you anyway."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm and continued to provoke Meiwu with the Thousand Machinations Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, who did Meiwu fight with?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan sensed that the energy fluctuations within Meiwu's body were extremely violent, as if she was battling an enemy.</p><p></p><p>However, the battle soon subsided, and Meiwu was moving away from the Cang realm.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!" Li Xuan looked up at the sky. There must be beings in this Cang realm that are not weaker than Meiwu, and they likely blocked Meiwu from entering.</p><p></p><p>"I should hide this sword for now, and not keep provoking Meiwu. Just occasionally letting it emerge to tease her a bit is enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a thunderous sound echoed through the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Things are getting more chaotic."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. The divine realm was truly entering an era of great turmoil. Some powerful beings, dissatisfied with the status quo, were tacitly approving the actions of Tianshadiying. Was their goal to try to become number one in the realm? Or perhaps to seize the position of ruler of the realm?</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch how things unfold." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan must be close to breaking through, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meiwu had been successfully tricked, which meant Xu Yan had obtained the treasure and was about to break through to the Poxu realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the Realm of Heaven and Earth method of medicine and martial arts. Your medicine and martial arts have broken through to the Realm of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao emerged.</p><p></p><p>His medicine and martial arts had also broken through to the Realm of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. When happy, his fingers would dance, using the Thousand Machines technique to tease the sword within Meiwu's body.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three years had passed.</p><p></p><p>For powerful beings, three years was but the snap of a finger.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was changing with each passing day. In just three short years, many new Immortal Venerable had emerged. Although the number of top-tier Immortal Venerable was still small, in terms of sheer numbers of Immortal Venerable, the Qinghua Sect could now rank in the top ten of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of overall strength, they still lagged behind quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Grand Formation was becoming more and more perfected. Once it was complete, the number of top-tier Immortal Venerable martial artists would also start to increase.</p><p></p><p>The three including Dayue Emperor even had a chance to break through to the realm above Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Heavenly Cave had almost transformed into a divine furnace of heaven and earth, producing an enormous number of pills every day.</p><p></p><p>The methods for cultivating spirit herbs and divine herbs were also becoming more refined. Under the enhancement of formations, they had even artificially cultivated a patch of low-grade divine herbs.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Qinghua Sect, there was an explosion of martial artists below the Heavenly Venerable realm. With the aid of pills, the cultivation speed of martial artists was getting faster and faster. Bottlenecks were easier to break through, and the time spent at each realm was greatly shortened.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to avoid relying solely on pills to increase cultivation level, which could lead to weak actual strength, the sect's council of elders issued pill usage guidelines.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through, one must spend a period of time tempering oneself and consolidating one's foundation. The sect would also regularly inspect disciples to ensure their martial foundation was solid and their strength was not hollow.</p><p></p><p>If one's foundation was not solid enough or their strength was found to be hollow, their cultivation resources would be reduced and their status in the sect could even be lowered.</p><p></p><p>With this series of sect rules issued, the problem of martial artists having hollow strength was avoided.</p><p></p><p>The number of Qinghua Sect martial artists below the Heavenly Venerable realm was entering a period of explosive growth. However, the Heavenly Cave was relatively peaceful, which meant there was a lack of opportunities for tempering.</p><p></p><p>To address this, various spirit cities began organizing arena battles to increase the tempering of martial artists, as well as actively provoking the Netherworld to initiate battles.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Two has broken through as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Stone Two was not far from the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this hurdle was still quite difficult and not something that could be broken through in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu and Zhou Ying had broken through even earlier.</p><p></p><p>The two were now consolidating their foundations, preparing to break through to the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger had already become a Heavenly Venerable. After activating her bloodline and receiving the legacy of the Sea Spirit Emperor, her cultivation speed had rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was preparing to break through to the Heavenly Venerable realm, and Yue'er was also beginning preparations for her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that Yue'er, who had been assisting Su Lingxiu, had an extremely good understanding of soul power. Her soul power was much stronger than Yue Changming's.</p><p></p><p>In terms of raw power, Yue'er was even slightly superior to Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>Of course, her combat experience was not as good as Yue Changming's. In a true life-or-death battle, Yue'er would likely lose.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Poxu realm. Your Realm of Heaven and Earth has reached small success."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>After three years of consolidation, Xu Yan had finally broken through to the Poxu realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering Poxu, one could stride across the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with the current chaos in the divine realm, there were likely beings above the Immortal realm in hiding. Even so, with Poxu realm strength, Xu Yan no longer feared them.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. He had reached small success in the Realm of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has undergone an ultimate transformation, evolving into a Mountain River Dao Body. You have obtained an Innate Dao Body."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Xuan felt his entire being undergo a transformation. Dao rhymes were naturally born, and his meridians and bones seemed to be like Dao principles, circulating within his body.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth within his body seemed to naturally generate Dao principles. Although it was not the Establishing Dao realm, it had a sense of establishing Dao.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. An Innate Dao Body!</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I'm not much weaker than Meiwu!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was elated.</p><p></p><p>With an Innate Dao Body and small success in the Realm of Heaven and Earth, his strength was not much weaker than Meiwu's.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan won't be able to undergo an ultimate transformation when he breaks through to the Realm of Heaven and Earth this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Mountain River Dao Body could transform again was no longer something that could be achieved through pre-breakthrough accumulation.</p><p></p><p>"However, given Xu Yan's monstrous talent, he still has a chance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of confidence about this.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Dao Body was already extremely powerful, enough to make Xu Yan's strength far surpass that of ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"When Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu break through and transform, how will my Innate Dao Body improve?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Poxu realm, the gains from realm advancement continued to come, such as improvements in divine abilities, sword intent, the myriad phenomena of mountains and rivers, and so on.</p><p></p><p>All of these caused his strength to continually leap forward.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally time to go on a killing spree."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's breakthrough, he would certainly seek revenge against Tianshadiying. Killing Immortal Venerables would be effortless for him, and his reputation would surely spread throughout the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is also close to breaking through, probably within the next two or three years."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the location of the Dayue Heavenly Cave. Su Lingxiu's arrangements were almost complete, and she was also close to breaking through.</p><p></p><p>His disciples were all beginning to greatly increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>"This realm has also undergone some changes."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky. With his understanding of the Cang realm, he could easily perceive the subtle changes in the realm.</p><p></p><p>First was in terms of fortune, then in terms of Dao principles, as well as changes in the realm's fundamental essence.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to find an opportunity to have Tianzi explain the secrets. Time waits for no one, and this realm needs to be properly planned for."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>But before that, he had to figure out exactly what kind of being Tianzi was.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan looked towards a certain part of the divine realm. A life-saving jade talisman he had bestowed had been activated.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

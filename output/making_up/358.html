        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Suling Xiu broke through, the flying ship continued towards the Zheng Kingdom in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzhou of today was no longer the same as when it first entered the Spiritual Realm. Three great cities stood tall in Yuzhou, and they had established teleportation arrays to connect them, making it the most prosperous region.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao and Shen Tai had become the strongest existences in Yuzhou, maintaining order there.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Kingdom still existed independently, maintaining its unique status, but now it not only belonged to the Superb Spiritual Sect's dominion, but also accepted the rule of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As for the disappearance of the Spiritual Realm's gate, only a small group of the Spiritual Realm's top experts knew about it. They had issued an order that no one was allowed to open the Spiritual Realm's gate without permission.</p><p></p><p>They had also falsely claimed that the strongest experts had sealed the method of opening the Spiritual Realm's gate, and that without the Jade Token, no one could open it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the Great Wilderness is doing now?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan missed his parents a little. After coming to the Spiritual Realm for so many years, the parent-child pearl he had left behind had not shattered, meaning his family had not encountered any uncontrollable dangers.</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Bridge was about to open, he would also go to the other side of the Divine Bridge. This time of parting, he did not know when he would be able to return to the Great Wilderness again.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that the Spiritual Realm's gate is closed, as it prevents some crises from occurring."</p><p></p><p>Since his parents were in the Great Wilderness and Spiritual Realm cultivators could not enter, they naturally could not threaten the Great Wilderness. His family members would also not encounter any dangers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, his parents' strength would continue to rise. If they broke through the Divine Enlightenment Realm, Spiritual Realm cultivators would no longer be able to threaten the Great Wilderness or his family's safety.</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual qi in the Great Wilderness was sparse, it was only a matter of cultivating a little slower, and it would not reach the point where they could no longer break through, as was the case for the Inner Realm and Spiritual Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Green Pavilion's flying ship arrived at the location of the Spiritual Realm's gate.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked down and saw that the formation was still there. Although the Spiritual Realm's gate was not open, in his eyes it was completely exposed, as if two forces of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws had closed together to seal the gateway.</p><p></p><p>With a slight wave of his hand, with his Void-Piercing Realm cultivation, he rearranged the formation covering the Spiritual Realm's gate. After this arrangement, even an Immortal Venerable would not be able to open the Spiritual Realm's gate.</p><p></p><p>The barrier between the Spiritual Realm and the Inner Realm was formed by the Heavenly and Earthly Laws. Even with an Immortal Venerable's strength, they might not need to go through the Spiritual Realm's gate to enter the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Xuan planned to strengthen this barrier, so that even an Immortal Venerable would not be able to cross it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will go open the Spiritual Realm's gate," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"No need!" Li Xuan shook his head, raised his hand and pointed forward, instantly shattering the spatial dimension. A pitch-black space appeared in midair, and the flying ship directly flew into it.</p><p></p><p>As the flying ship entered, the opened space was closing.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Void-Piercing Realm. Ponder it well!" Li Xuan said to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and Meng Chong were shocked. This was the Void-Piercing Realm? A simple gesture could shatter the void and traverse space!</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the Green Pavilion was greatly shocked and excited to see their senior briefly display his power. They realized that when he suppressed the Seductive Witch, he had not even used a millionth of his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The flying ship pierced through the void and emerged from a void opening, having crossed the barrier and entered the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>They immediately felt the sparse spiritual qi of the Great Wilderness, causing those accustomed to the abundant spiritual qi of the Spiritual Realm to involuntarily furrow their brows.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Void-Piercing Realm," Xu Yan said, still recalling the shattered void he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>"The Void-Piercing Realm is difficult to comprehend. Master only revealed this to me after I broke through the Divine Enlightenment Realm, allowing me to have a more direct understanding of the profundity of the Void-Piercing Realm," Xu Yan realized.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky. The spiritual qi in the Great Wilderness was a bit sparse, which was related to the separation from the Vast Heavens, but it was not impossible to change this situation.</p><p></p><p>When his strength was insufficient, he could not do it. But now, he could.</p><p></p><p>He had mastered the Heavenly and Earthly Laws and comprehended some of the Heavenly and Earthly Dao. Although it would be somewhat difficult, he could still raise the spiritual qi concentration in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Since this is the Great Wilderness, I shall take the opportunity to enhance the spiritual qi concentration here," Li Xuan decided.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Great Wilderness, the greater the benefits he would gain.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, we're back. Let's go to Canglan Island!" Xu Yan said excitedly, emerging from his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The Green Pavilion's flying ship transformed into a beam of light and flew towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, it was as peaceful and tranquil as always. Although Xu Yan had left the Great Wilderness, the deterrence remained, and with the strong cultivators from the Great Wilderness Academy, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and many other powerful figures supporting it, any disturbances would be quickly quelled.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had long since taken root in people's hearts. The term "Inner Realm" was no longer mentioned by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the children born in the last ten years or the youths who had just entered the martial path, they almost did not know the name "Inner Realm," only knowing the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the legends about the Great Wilderness were being passed down among these young people.</p><p></p><p>Some of the former Inner Realm cultivators stubbornly adhered to the Inner Realm's martial arts, while others tried every means to cultivate the Great Wilderness martial arts. Regardless, the Inner Realm had gradually been abandoned and was rarely mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had unified and established a unified order and laws. The most renowned was undoubtedly the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, where many talented youths aspired to enter and refine their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The current Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy was no longer the original Seven Star Academy. The requirements for enrolling martial arts students had been further raised, and it was difficult for non-geniuses to enter.</p><p></p><p>Starting this year, the Great Wilderness had implemented a new policy. In every town and city, academies were established to popularize education and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>These academies were clearly divided into different levels. From childhood enrollment, students could advance to higher-level academies through examinations, with the ultimate goal of entering the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Those who could enter the Great Wilderness Academy were undoubtedly the top geniuses of the entire Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts sects in the Great Wilderness still existed, but some weaker sects were already facing a crisis of inheritance. Since everyone was cultivating the Great Wilderness martial arts, why would they need to enter sects and be bound by so many restrictions? In order to survive, the sects had to research and develop Great Wilderness martial arts techniques with unique characteristics to attract disciples.</p><p></p><p>For example, some sects had created powerful palm techniques or fist arts.</p><p></p><p>The sects with deep foundations, using the Inner Realm martial arts as a reference, quickly developed martial arts techniques more suitable for the Great Wilderness martial arts based on their original sect techniques.</p><p></p><p>Some sects even defeated many Great Wilderness cultivators with the martial arts techniques they had developed, establishing their status.</p><p></p><p>As the major sects competed, the Great Wilderness martial arts quickly accumulated a wide variety of techniques, skills, and combat arts, becoming increasingly rich and diverse.</p><p></p><p>While the Great Wilderness as a whole was in a state of fervor, Canglan Island remained as peaceful as ever.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, aside from the Great Wilderness Academy, the other martial arts holy land was undoubtedly Canglan Island. But no one dared to rashly set foot on Canglan Island, except for...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A top-tier existence is qualified to visit Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Consciousness Realm is still quite difficult!" </p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Junhe sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the Penetrating Mystery Realm, but was stuck at the threshold of the Divine Consciousness Realm, unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>Although his current strength has already placed him among the top experts in the Great Wilderness, and the martial arts techniques he commands, be it sword arts, palm techniques, or body arts, far surpass other martial artists. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But without reaching the Divine Consciousness Realm, he could never achieve the ability to single-handedly dominate the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Consciousness Realm is indeed quite difficult!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi also let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>He too had reached the peak of the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Great Wilderness been peaceful of late?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's been less than a decade, the deterrence is still there, who dares to cause trouble? Even if someone wanted to do something, they wouldn't dare act rashly, they would have to weigh their own strength first."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded.</p><p></p><p>The top experts from the Inner Realm, even if they had some thoughts, dared not act.</p><p></p><p>The pinnacle experts all belonged to the Great Wilderness, following the orders of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"It's been over a decade, I wonder how the Spirit Realm is doing."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm gave the Inner Realm a very bad impression, which was one of the reasons why the top experts of the Inner Realm were willing to stay there instead of going to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, going to the Spirit Realm would be worse than being a pig or a dog.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, it's better to stay in the Inner Realm and continue being the superior ones.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when their lifespan is running out, they might develop a desire for a breakthrough, even if it means becoming a pig or a dog, but for now, those experts have not reached that point yet.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial dao of the Great Wilderness has given them hope.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe fell silent, as Xu Yan had entered the Spirit Realm and since then, there had been no news, no way to contact him.</p><p></p><p>Only in times of crisis could the parent-child pearl be crushed to convey a simple message.</p><p></p><p>But since there was no crisis, there was no need to crush the parent-child pearl.</p><p></p><p>"With the elders here, there won't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe smiled.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two discussed some of the recent new policies in the Great Wilderness, and after making some arrangements, Kou Ruozhi left for the capital of the Great Wilderness to assist Guo Rongshan in handling the affairs of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Only by breaking through the Divine Consciousness Realm can I truly be at ease."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan would return, or if he would return at all, was an unknown.</p><p></p><p>His son had grown up and wanted to roam this vast world, pursuing the martial dao in his heart, when he would return home to visit was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>If too much time passed, and some people were unable to continue their breakthrough, with their lifespan running out, they might develop some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At that time, only absolute strength could suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through the Divine Consciousness Realm would he have such strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Origin Realm, that was too far away, he didn't know when he could break through that.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could break through the Divine Consciousness Realm, he would be invincible in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, you should spend more time cultivating."</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Fruit Grove of Canglan Island, Xu Junhe looked at his wife with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>Over a decade had passed, his wife's appearance was still youthful, and her strength had also increased considerably, already reaching the peak of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in recent years, she had been in the Spiritual Fruit Grove, sketching some formation diagrams, actually researching formations.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like she had made some breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is so tiring, I'd rather continue researching the formations. The Innate Realm can live for a long time, and in a few years, I'll be able to break through anyway, why the hurry?"</p><p></p><p>Xu's wife glared at her husband dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe could only let her be, then asked, "My dear, have you made any breakthroughs in your formation research?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course there are, I just lack a few things, otherwise I could deploy it already."</p><p></p><p>Xu's wife said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Then she sighed, "I wonder when Yan'er will return, and Crimson Cat too."</p><p></p><p>"He should be back soon."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Xu's wife gave him a look, "You've been saying that for years."</p><p></p><p>Then she sighed again, "Yan'er is so focused on the martial dao, going to the Spirit Realm to roam, he might not come back for decades, even a hundred years who knows."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship was heading towards Canglan Island, and along the way, the changes in the Great Wilderness were tremendous.</p><p></p><p>Every ten thousand miles, there was a giant city standing tall, these were the major cities established by the Great Wilderness, each city ruling over a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>And every hundred thousand miles, there was an even larger city, ruling over ten of these major cities, each of these large cities was bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in the Great Wilderness are so great, apart from the sparse spiritual energy, in terms of prosperity, it's no less than the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Great Wilderness would continue to progress, the entire Great Wilderness was actually not small, it was extremely vast.</p><p></p><p>The major cities were built on strategic locations, interconnected and ruling over the land, and there were even more wilderness areas, rarely inhabited, those places were usually where spiritual herbs were harvested.</p><p></p><p>"That is a spiritual herb field."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pointed to the cultivated herb fields between the mountains.</p><p></p><p>"This time I return, I should impart more knowledge to the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying smiled gracefully.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was ultimately more prosperous than the Great Wilderness, and the martial dao was more flourishing, the cultivation of spiritual herbs was also more advanced, this return trip was a good opportunity to bring these things back to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér and Yue'er were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others seemed to be from the legendary Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm, actually produced such prodigies? Their gaze turned to Li Xuan, then they understood, where a great master resides, it is naturally a blessed land, producing prodigies is only natural.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm is not small, if each major city establishes a transportation formation, interconnecting them, it would be even more prosperous.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Brother Fang is not here, or I could have asked him for some formation plates."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Setting up formations was naturally not something he could bother the master with.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a faint blue light, speeding towards Canglan Island, deliberately slowing down to overlook the changes along the way.</p><p></p><p>In a certain commandery city, in the newly established Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy's branch school, the place was bustling with activity, top talents gathered, eagerly awaiting the assessment.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu sat at the head, personally overseeing this branch school, looking at the gathered talents, he was greatly gratified, among these talents, a small portion would be admitted into the Great Wilderness Academy, becoming members of the Great Wilderness Academy.</p><p></p><p>The students who graduated from the Great Wilderness Academy were the ones the Great Wilderness focused on cultivating, they were the true cornerstones of the Great Wilderness, bearing the responsibility of maintaining and strengthening the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze sharpened, his heart jolted.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a faint blue light was flashing by, this light was not ordinary! He discreetly nodded to the dean of the school, then left under the pretext of some matter, without alarming the others, his figure instantly soaring into the sky, chasing after that blue light.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

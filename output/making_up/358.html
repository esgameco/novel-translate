        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Su Lingxiu broke through, the flying ship continued towards Zheng Kingdom in Jade State.</p><p></p><p>The current Jade State was no longer like when they first entered the Spirit Realm. Three great cities now stood in Jade State, connected by teleportation arrays, and were the most prosperous cities in Jade State.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao and Shen Tai had become the strongest existences in Jade State, maintaining order there.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Kingdom still existed independently, still maintaining its unique status. However, now it was not only under the rule of the Transcendent Spirit Sect, but also accepted the governance of the Eternal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Only a small handful of the top experts in the Spirit Realm knew about the disappearance of the Spirit Realm Gate. </p><p></p><p>An order had been issued that no one was allowed to open the Spirit Realm Gate without permission.</p><p></p><p>They even falsely claimed that the strongest experts had taken action to seal the method of opening the Spirit Realm Gate, and that it could not be opened without obtaining a jade token.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the Great Wilderness is now?" Xu Yan was starting to miss his parents.</p><p></p><p>He had been in the Spirit Realm for so many years, but the mother-child bead he had left behind had not shattered, meaning no uncontrollable dangerous events had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The opening of the Divine Bridge was imminent, and he would be going to the other side of the Divine Bridge. After this parting, who knew when he would be able to return to the Great Wilderness again.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that the Spirit Realm Gate is closed, avoiding some potential crises."</p><p></p><p>With his parents in the Great Wilderness and Spirit Realm cultivators unable to enter, there naturally would be no threat to the pinnacle of the Great Wilderness, and his parents and family would not encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed and his parents and family's strength increased, if they broke through to the Divine Sense realm, Spirit Realm cultivators would no longer be able to threaten the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>They would also not be able to threaten the safety of his parents and family.</p><p></p><p>Although spiritual energy was sparse in the Great Wilderness, it merely meant cultivation would be slightly slower. Unlike cultivators in the Inner Realm and Spirit Realm, there was no issue of being unable to continue breaking through after reaching a certain level.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion flying ship arrived at the location of the Spirit Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked down. The formation was still there. Although the Spirit Realm Gate was not open, in his eyes it was completely exposed, as if two forces of heaven and earth's laws had closed together, shutting the doorway.</p><p></p><p>He lightly pointed with his hand. With his Void Breaking realm strength, he rearranged the formation covering the Spirit Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>After this arrangement, even if an Immortal Venerable came, they would not be able to open the Spirit Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>The barrier between the Spirit Realm and Inner Realm was formed by the laws of heaven and earth. With an Immortal Venerable's great power, they probably would not need to go through the Spirit Realm Gate to enter the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Xuan planned to reinforce this barrier so that even an Immortal Venerable could not cross it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go open the Spirit Realm Gate," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Li Xuan shook his head. He raised a hand and pointed forward. Instantly, space shattered and a black void appeared in midair. The flying ship directly flew into it.</p><p></p><p>As the ship entered, the opened space began to close.</p><p></p><p>"This is Void Breaking. Observe and comprehend it well," Li Xuan said to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and Meng Chong were shocked in their hearts. So this was Void Breaking? With just a light point, he broke open the void and directly traversed space!</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the Evergreen Pavilion was shocked and excited. They were honored to once again witness the senior slightly display his power.</p><p></p><p>Indeed! When suppressing the Charming Witch earlier, the senior had not even used a ten-thousandth of his power.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The flying ship passed through the void and emerged from a spatial rift, having crossed the barrier and entered the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>They instantly felt how sparse the spiritual energy was, causing everyone accustomed to the abundant spiritual energy of the Spirit Realm to frown involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Void Breaking," Xu Yan was still immersed in the shattering of space he had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>"Void Breaking is difficult to comprehend. Master saw that I had broken through to the Divine Sense realm, so he demonstrated it to let me see what Void Breaking is, allowing me to more intuitively understand the profundities of the Void Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his head to look at the sky. The spiritual energy in the Great Wilderness had become a bit sparser, which was related to the separation from the Cang Tian world, but this situation was not unchangeable.</p><p></p><p>When his strength was insufficient, he could not do it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could.</p><p></p><p>He already comprehended the laws of heaven and earth, and had gained insight into some of the Dao principles of heaven and earth. Although it would be somewhat difficult to raise the spiritual energy of the Great Wilderness by a level, it was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Since this is the Great Wilderness, I might as well take this opportunity to increase the spiritual energy concentration," Li Xuan decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Great Wilderness became, the more he would benefit.</p><p></p><p>"We're finally back. Let's go to Canglan Island!" Xu Yan came back to his senses and said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion flying ship turned into a beam of light, flying towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everything was as peaceful and tranquil as before.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had left the Great Wilderness, the deterrent still existed. With the support of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy's experts, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and many other powerful figures, even if there were occasional disturbances, they would quickly be quelled.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had now become deeply ingrained in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the term "Inner Realm" was no longer mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Especially children born in the past decade or youths who had only entered the martial path in the past decade, almost none of them knew the name "Inner Realm", only knowing the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, legends about the Great Wilderness were spreading among these youths.</p><p></p><p>Among the former Inner Realm cultivators, some adhered to Inner Realm cultivation methods, while others tried every means to convert to Great Wilderness martial arts. But regardless, the Inner Realm had gradually been abandoned and was rarely mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had unified and established uniform order and laws. The most renowned was undoubtedly the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy. Many young geniuses all wanted to enter the academy for intensive training.</p><p></p><p>The current Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy was no longer the former Seven Star Academy. The requirements for admitting martial arts students had been further raised, and only geniuses could enter.</p><p></p><p>Starting from this year, the Great Wilderness had implemented a new policy.</p><p></p><p>Academies were established in every town and city throughout the Great Wilderness to popularize education and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the academies were clearly classified into different levels.</p><p></p><p>Children would enter school and advance to higher-level academies through examinations, ultimately aiming to be admitted to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Those who could enter the Great Wilderness Academy were all among the top geniuses of the entire Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts sects still existed in various places, but some weaker sects had already faced inheritance crises.</p><p></p><p>Since everyone was cultivating Great Wilderness martial arts anyway, why would they need to join a sect and be bound by so many restrictions? In order to survive, sects with special strengths and appeal were racking their brains to research Great Wilderness martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>For example, certain powerful palm techniques, fist techniques, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Sects with deep foundations quickly researched techniques more suitable for Great Wilderness martial arts, using Inner Realm martial arts as reference and their original sect techniques as a basis.</p><p></p><p>Some sects even established their position by defeating one Great Wilderness cultivator after another with the techniques they had researched.</p><p></p><p>As the major sects became more competitive, this led to a rapid accumulation of various martial skills, secret techniques, and combat methods in Great Wilderness martial arts, becoming increasingly abundant with more and more martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere in the Great Wilderness was competitive, except for Canglan Island, which remained as before.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, apart from the Great Wilderness Academy, the other martial arts holy land was undoubtedly Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to rashly set foot on Canglan Island, except for those</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only top-tier existences are qualified to visit Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Intent realm is still quite difficult!" Xu Junhe sighed on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the peak of the Tongxuan realm, but was stuck before the Divine Intent realm, unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>Although his current strength placed him among the top in the Great Wilderness, and the martial arts techniques he mastered - whether sword techniques, palm techniques, or movement techniques - far surpassed other martial artists. But without entering the Divine Intent realm, he ultimately could not single-handedly suppress the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Intent realm is indeed difficult!" Kou Ruozhi also sighed.</p><p></p><p>He too had reached the peak of the Tongxuan realm.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Great Wilderness been peaceful lately?" Xu Junhe asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's only been a little over ten years, the deterrent is still there, who would dare cause trouble? Even if some of those guys want to do something, they wouldn't dare act rashly, they need to weigh their own capabilities," Kou Ruozhi said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded. </p><p></p><p>Even if some of those powerful figures from the inner domain had ideas, they wouldn't dare do anything. The top experts all belonged to the Great Wilderness and obeyed the orders of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"It's been over a decade, I wonder how the Spirit Domain is doing," Kou Ruozhi said with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Domain left an extremely bad impression on the inner domain, which was one reason why those inner domain experts were willing to stay in the inner domain rather than go to the Spirit Domain.</p><p></p><p>The reality was, going to the Spirit Domain was worse than being pigs and dogs!</p><p></p><p>That being the case, it was better to stay in the inner domain and continue being superior beings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when their lifespans were nearly exhausted, they would develop a desire for breakthrough, willing to be pigs and dogs if necessary? But for now, those experts had not reached that point.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial arts of the Great Wilderness gave them hope.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe fell silent. Ever since Xu Yan entered the Spirit Domain, there had been no news, no way to contact him.</p><p></p><p>Only in times of crisis could they crush the mother-child bead to transmit simple messages.</p><p></p><p>But since no crisis had occurred, there was no need to crush the mother-child bead.</p><p></p><p>"With the seniors there, naturally nothing will happen," Xu Junhe said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>After chatting about some recent new policies in the Great Wilderness and making some arrangements, Kou Ruozhi left for the capital city of the Great Wilderness to assist Guo Rongshan in handling government affairs and other matters.</p><p></p><p>"Only by breaking through to the Divine Intent realm can I truly be at ease," Xu Junhe muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan would return, or if he would return at all, was unknown.</p><p></p><p>His son had grown up and wanted to explore this vast world, pursue the martial way in his heart. When he would return home to visit was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Once too much time passed, if some people were unable to continue breaking through and their lifespans were running out, they might develop some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At that time, only absolute powerful strength could suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Only breaking through to the Divine Intent realm would provide such strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Element realm, that was too distant, who knew how many years it would take to break through.</p><p></p><p>Just breaking through to the Divine Intent realm would be enough to reign supreme and undefeated in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, you should spend more time cultivating," Xu Junhe said with a helpless expression as he looked at his wife in the spirit fruit forest of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen years had passed, but Madam Xu's appearance remained unchanged. Her strength had increased considerably, reaching the peak of the Innate realm.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, she had been in the spirit fruit forest, sketching some array diagrams, apparently studying formations.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have made some gains.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is so tiring, I'd rather continue researching array diagrams. The Innate realm allows for a very long life, and in a few years I'll be able to break through anyway, so what's the rush?" Madam Xu glared at her husband dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe could only let her be, and instead asked, "Has my wife made any progress in studying formations?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I have, I'm just missing a few things, otherwise I could set it up already," Madam Xu said proudly as soon as formations were mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Then she sighed, "I wonder when Yan'er will return, and Red Cat too."</p><p></p><p>"It should be soon, right?" Xu Junhe said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Madam Xu glared at him, "You've been saying that for years."</p><p></p><p>Then she sighed again, "Yan'er is focused on martial arts, adventuring in the Spirit Domain. How could he return so quickly? It might take decades or even a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship headed towards Canglan Island. Along the way, they saw that the Great Wilderness had changed tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Every ten thousand li there stood a huge city, these were the major cities established by the Great Wilderness in various regions. Each major city governed an area of ten thousand li in all directions.</p><p></p><p>And every hundred thousand li was an even larger city that governed ten major cities. Each city was extremely prosperous.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness has changed so much. Apart from the thinner spiritual energy, it's no less prosperous than the Spirit Domain," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Great Wilderness would continue. The Great Wilderness itself was not small, but extremely vast.</p><p></p><p>The major cities were all built in strategic locations, interconnected and governing. There were even more wilderness areas rarely visited by people. Those places were usually where spirit herbs were gathered.</p><p></p><p>"That's a spirit herb field," Meng Shushu said, pointing to a field cultivated between mountains ahead.</p><p></p><p>"This time we return, we should pass on more knowledge to the Great Wilderness," Du Yuying said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Domain was ultimately more prosperous than the Great Wilderness, with more advanced martial arts and spirit herb cultivation techniques. Returning this time was a good opportunity to bring these back to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er and Yue'er were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Xu Yan and the others came from the legendary inner domain?</p><p></p><p>To think the inner domain produced such prodigies? They glanced at Li Xuan, then understood. Naturally, where great masters resided was a place of good fortune, so producing prodigies was only normal.</p><p></p><p>"The inner domain is not small. With so many major cities, if we establish a teleportation array in each city to connect them, it would facilitate the movement of people and be even more prosperous.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity Junior Brother Fang isn't here. We didn't get any teleportation array discs from him," Xu Yan said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>Naturally they couldn't trouble Master with setting up arrays.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a faint cyan streak of light, flying towards Canglan Island. They deliberately slowed down to survey the changes in the Great Wilderness along the way.</p><p></p><p>In a certain prefecture city, at a subordinate academy of the newly established Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, voices clamored as powerful figures gathered. The talents of this prefecture had assembled, waiting excitedly for the assessment.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong sat at the head, personally attending this subordinate academy. Looking at the gathered talents, he was gratified. Among these talents, a small portion would be admitted to the Great Wilderness Academy and become members.</p><p></p><p>The students who came out of the Great Wilderness Academy were all carefully nurtured by the Great Wilderness. They were the true foundation, bearing the responsibility of maintaining and strengthening the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze sharpened and his heart jolted.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a faint cyan streak of light was shooting past. This streak of light was unusual! He nodded to the academy's principal without showing any change, then made an excuse to leave. Without alarming the others, his figure instantly soared into the sky, chasing directly after that streak of light.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

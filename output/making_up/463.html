        <h1>Chapter 463</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The various factions in the Divine Realm each had their own foundations and backgrounds. During this time of great changes in heaven and earth, they all obtained some information and found ways to continue growing stronger and passing on their legacies amidst the turmoil in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, the attention of the entire Divine Realm focused on the Wind River Realm, where an unprecedented great battle in the history of the Divine Realm was unfolding. </p><p></p><p>While most of the powerful experts in the Divine Realm had their eyes drawn to the Wind River Realm, no one noticed the subtle changes quietly taking place in the Earth Cloud Realm.</p><p></p><p>The clouds and mist on the ground grew thicker. In the center of the Earth Cloud Realm, the clouds and mist were especially dense, as if an invisible force was gathering and concentrating them.</p><p></p><p>In the Dragon Mountain Realm, above Dragon Abyss, the sky was covered by thick dark clouds. Silver-white chains descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The illusory form of a giant striped tiger gradually solidified. The tiger raised its head to look at the sky and let out a silent roar, its majestic aura shaking in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi silently observed, having once again moved away from Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Immortal Venerable experts of Dragon Mountain Realm had all gone to watch the excitement in Wind River Realm. As for the Immortal Realm spirit beasts, they had long since not dared to approach this place, and feeling uneasy, had quietly left Dragon Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even spirit beasts with only Tempering Truth Realm strength felt fear in their hearts, as if a great calamity was impending. They either went into hiding or fled Dragon Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the realm gates of Dragon Mountain Realm were already under the control of experts from Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow. These spirit beasts could only cross the wilderness to leave.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies in Dragon Mountain Realm had not yet drawn attention, and no powerful experts had come to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger, what a pity!" Tian Shiqi smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>With the death of Wind Spirit Tiger, there would be even fewer powerful tiger-type spirit beasts among the already scarce tiger population.</p><p></p><p>As for that striped fierce tiger in Nine Mountains Realm, its bloodline was ultimately inferior to Wind Spirit Tiger's. Its strength had already reached its peak and could not advance any further.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger wanted to devour that drop of Celestial Tiger essence blood, but it did not know that it was already trapped on the jade platform. It was a sacrifice, a catalyst to activate the power of the Celestial Tiger.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have activated the Celestial Tiger bloodline within its body, but in reality it would be consumed in the process of activation.</p><p></p><p>Even if Wind Spirit Tiger had an incredible stroke of luck and escaped with its life, it still would not be able to break through its shackles. That drop of essence blood could not be obtained by it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could Wind Spirit Tiger possibly survive with its level of strength?</p><p></p><p>Nine Mountains Realm had been in a state of turmoil. The Wan family was now facing a great crisis.</p><p></p><p>Hengfeng Mountain, Thousand Fold Mountain, and Cloud Pool Mountain had actually joined forces, preparing to invade Great Canopy Mountain and expel the Wan family. During this turmoil, the Wan family was able to unite more cohesively as members of the same clan to deal with external threats.</p><p></p><p>After a series of purges to eliminate internal hidden dangers, the Wan family was now united as one. Every member of the Wan clan understood that if the Wan family fell, they would lose everything they possessed.</p><p></p><p>Even if they surrendered or betrayed the family, they would not meet a good end.</p><p></p><p>Rather than becoming slaves to others, it was better to fight to the death to protect their own interests!</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as the Immortal Realm ancestors were still around, the Wan family could not be completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>However, three days ago, an Immortal Venerable expert of the Wan family was ambushed and severely injured, nearly losing all combat ability.</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Venerable experts who went to rescue him were also badly wounded, their strength greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the crisis facing the Wan family was now imminent. They had to seek help.</p><p></p><p>Hengfeng Mountain, Thousand Fold Mountain, and Cloud Pool Mountain were gradually closing in. The Immortal Venerable experts of the three mountains exuded imposing auras, constantly pressuring Great Canopy Mountain.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a striped fierce tiger arrived with majestic bearing, striding into the ancestral shrine of the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wan, your Wan family is in a precarious situation now. What have you decided?" Red Cat asked, looking at the Wan family ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Demon King Red Cat, my Wan family agrees to your conditions!" The Wan family ancestor's mouth twitched as he looked at this striped fierce tiger walking upright on two legs, with a precious saber at its waist and an imposing aura. He felt somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Veneration Mountain, King of Demons, Red Cat! It was clearly a striped fierce tiger, yet it was called Red Cat. Who knows what this great Demon King was thinking to choose such a name.</p><p></p><p>Nine Mountains Realm, Spirit Veneration Mountain, had now become demon territory.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the demon race was this striped fierce tiger, who called himself the Great Demon King. Under his command were the Second Demon King and Third Demon King. Moreover, this Red Cat Great Demon King possessed extremely powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family ancestor was no match for him!</p><p></p><p>Spirit Veneration Mountain had already become demon territory. The Immortal Venerable experts of Spirit Veneration Sect had quietly moved the sect away from Spirit Veneration Mountain and reached some kind of cooperation agreement with the demon race.</p><p></p><p>Now, Red Cat Great Demon King was preparing to officially emerge and unify Nine Mountains Realm, establishing it as the realm of the demon race and widely inviting spirit beasts from the Divine Realm to join.</p><p></p><p>Great Canopy Mountain would be left as human territory within Nine Mountains Realm, not just the domain of the Wan family alone. Red Cat would take action to deal with Hengfeng Mountain, Thousand Fold Mountain, and Cloud Pool Mountain, putting an end to the chaos in Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that this big tiger truly had lofty ambitions, actually wanting to pacify the turmoil in Nine Mountains Realm and establish the foundation for the demon race in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I knew you were a sensible person, Old Wan. It wasn't in vain that our demon race's supreme being had cooperated with your Wan family before!" Red Cat nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family ancestor looked confused. "The demon race's supreme being cooperated with my Wan family?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! He had some connection with Wan Tianlin of your Wan family. In light of that relationship, I, the Great King Red Cat, support your Wan family as the ruling power of Great Canopy Mountain. As for what happens afterwards, it depends on whether your Wan family has the ability to continue ruling." Red Cat nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family ancestor looked puzzled. The demon race's supreme being had some connection with Wan Tianlin? Suddenly, two figures appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>"Is it Meng Chong?" After all, with his towering physique, looking like a small giant when using martial arts, Meng Chong seemed more fitting for the title of demon race supreme being.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Second Supreme Being!" Red Cat said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family ancestor continued to be bewildered. Xu Yan was the demon race's supreme being? "Isn't Xu Yan human? Not a spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat gave him a disdainful look and said, "Who told you our demon race's supreme being must be a spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>After all, if the ancestor of the demon race was human, what was strange about the supreme being of the demon race also being human?</p><p></p><p>Red Cat turned to leave, saying: "We'll begin in three days. Here are three pills as a gift for your Wan family. Three days is enough time for three people in your Wan family to fully recover."</p><p></p><p>The time has finally come for me, Great Demon King Red Cat, to shock the Divine Realm with my name.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with the cultivation of great demon martial arts and the strengthening of demonic divine abilities, Red Cat's confidence had greatly increased. Killing an Immortal Venerable expert with one swipe of his paw would not be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Shiqi was very powerful and still not his match, he had his own trump cards and was not afraid at all!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha had also broken through. Killing Immortal Venerable experts would be no problem for them either.</p><p></p><p>Nine Mountains Realm was in chaos. It was time to pacify and unify it, establishing the foundation for the demon race.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Nine Mountains Realm faced its greatest turmoil. A striped fierce tiger stood upright on two legs, holding a precious saber, and charged into the ranks of the Immortal Venerable experts of Hengfeng Mountain and Thousand Fold Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A flood dragon coiled in mid-air, spewing out terrifying light to suppress the Immortal Lord of Cloud Pool Mountain.</p><p></p><p>A toad as large as a small mountain opened its huge mouth, like a dark abyss appearing. The Immortal Lord fell into the abyss and was reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>That was a mountain-swallowing toad!</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Nine Mountains were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Damn, how could a mountain-swallowing toad be so powerful? Looking at the storage bags they carried, they suddenly felt very uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Could they still raise mountain-swallowing toads in the future? Could they still use them to make storage bags? It was too terrifying! The Sect Master of Spirit Veneration looked on calmly. He had already experienced it and completely given up struggling. The Nine Mountains would belong to the demon race from now on.</p><p></p><p>The long-troubled Nine Mountains region underwent a massive change as the demon race was established! On this day, the Great Demon King Red Cat single-handedly fought several Immortal Lords, slaughtering them with overwhelming force!</p><p></p><p>He also rooted out the Heavenly Fiend and Earth Shadow strongholds in横峰 Mountain and Cloud Pool Mountain, as well as the long-hidden Seven Leaf Heavenly Fiend, killing them all one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family, Spirit Veneration Sect Master and other Immortal Lords also began to take action, eliminating the remaining Heavenly Fiend and Earth Shadow forces, as the chaos in the Nine Mountains was caused by their behind-the-scenes manipulation.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat used his authority as Great Demon King to intimidate the Nine Mountains region. He even entered the Heavenly Cave, sweeping through the Nine Mountains Heavenly Cave and killing many Netherworld Blood Scions.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the turmoil in the Nine Mountains ended. But now the Nine Mountains had become the domain of the demon race.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful cultivators began to leave the Nine Mountains. Only the Wan family's Great Canopy Mountain remained as a place for humans to gather, while the other eight mountains all belonged to the demon race.</p><p></p><p>The existence of Great Canopy Mountain became a channel for trade and exchange.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, news spread throughout the Divine Realm that Red Cat the Great Demon King had established the demon race and was widely inviting spirit beasts from the Divine Realm to come to the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Along with this, the demon race's cultivation method was also spreading. It could ignore bloodline restrictions and allow continuous strengthening of oneself like humans.</p><p></p><p>As the news spread, spirit beasts outside the Nine Mountains began flocking there. The power of the demon race started to gather. During this time of turmoil in the Divine Realm, the major forces had no energy to spare to target this newly created demon race.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also believed that the demon race was just a new force of spirit beasts and wouldn't be very powerful.</p><p></p><p>As for the demon race cultivation method that could allow spirit beasts to ignore bloodline restrictions and cultivate like humans, it was not credible enough. It must be a deception by Demon King Red Cat to trick spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>More were waiting to see whether those Immortal Realm spirit beasts who went to the Nine Mountains would be willing to submit and become subordinates of the three Demon Kings, or if they would join forces to force the Demon Kings to hand over the method.</p><p></p><p>Along with the establishment of the demon race, there was another major event that shook the Divine Realm - the battle in Wind River Territory finally came to an end.</p><p></p><p>A young man walked out of the Heavenly Cave holding a cold spear, killing his way into the encirclement of powerful cultivators. He killed Immortal Lords with each thrust of his spear as easily as swatting flies.</p><p></p><p>No matter what powerful soul techniques these cultivators had practiced or what defensive divine artifacts they used, none could withstand that cold spear. With one thrust, their souls were extinguished!</p><p></p><p>Without exception! Jiang Buping's spear had become even more powerful and irresistible. It seemed to be a spear specifically for attacking souls. It seemed his entire martial arts were focused on soul killing.</p><p></p><p>He killed until the crowd of powerful cultivators were terrified. He killed until they collapsed. In the late stages of the battle, they fled one after another in panic, no longer daring to fight.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Buping, filled with killing intent, did not stop there. Since they had already attacked, they were enemies. And for enemies, there was only killing!</p><p></p><p>Not a single powerful cultivator who had attacked was able to escape from Wind River Territory. They were all chased down by Jiang Buping and killed one by one!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was shaken. Countless major forces and powerful cultivators were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The name "Spear Demon" spread throughout the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>This was a bringer of death, with even more terrifying killing power than Sword God Xu Yan or Sky God Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>But this was not unexpected. Since Jiang Buping could ignore the Undissolved Qi and was hiding great secrets and opportunities, it naturally attracted the interest of countless forces and powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Especially with the secret promotion of some interested parties, the number of powerful cultivators trying to hunt down Jiang Buping increased, and naturally Jiang Buping's killing became even more severe.</p><p></p><p>Spear Demon Jiang Buping - all who heard the name trembled in fear!</p><p></p><p>With the end of the Wind River Territory battle, Jiang Buping had already announced that he would soon go to Taikun Territory to demand an explanation! At once, the gazes of many powerful cultivators gathered on Taikun Territory, and many rushed there to see what would happen.</p><p></p><p>Would the Jiang clan of Taikun, which had been passed down for countless generations, be destroyed?</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Jiang clan in Taikun Territory.</p><p></p><p>All the clan elders were silent, while the Grand Elder looked at the Clan Leader and said calmly, "Clan Leader, do you think we should use the entire clan's strength to protect Jiang Tianming and assassinate Jiang Buping?"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan Leader remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He knew that while the Grand Elder seemed to be waiting for his order, if he really gave the order, he would face impeachment from the Grand Elder's faction, forcing him to step down.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, this matter concerns the rise and fall of our Jiang clan. As the Clan Leader, you must make a decision on how to deal with the current situation," a clan elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan Leader looked calmly at the Grand Elder, then at the group of clan elders, and said calmly, "The grudge between Buping and Tianming is for them to resolve themselves. I will not interfere or intervene. For those involved with Tianming, their life and death are in Buping's hands. I will not intercede!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder and others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Tianming has done such a thing as harming his brother in secret, so he should bear the consequences himself. As his father, no matter how biased I am, there should be a limit!" </p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan Leader's expression was calm, but showed a hint of sorrow. "It's all because I failed to teach my son properly. This is a private matter of my family, unrelated to the Jiang clan. You all need not get involved."</p><p></p><p>"If Buping wants an explanation, then let him have an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder and others were all silent. Only now did they suddenly realize that Jiang Buping was the son of this Clan Leader. Although he was not favored before and even persecuted, this Clan Leader hadn't interfered much.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was extremely powerful, and there were suspicions that he had a Supreme powerhouse backing him. That being the case, abandoning Jiang Tianming and repairing relations with Jiang Buping seemed inevitable.</p><p></p><p>As for those in the Jiang clan who were involved, if they were killed then so be it. The Jiang clan could bear this small loss!</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard in Taikun Territory.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's eyes were bloodshot, his whole person in a state of frenzy. Beside him, Yun Yan'er covered her face with a wronged expression.</p><p></p><p>"Tianming, who would have thought he could survive? What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"What to do? How would I know? My father, he's already not managing this matter anymore. How can I fight against that bastard Jiang Buping? What about your Cloud Peak Sect? They also want to distance themselves. What do you think we should do?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming roared.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we run away?" Yun Yan'er said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Run? The Divine Realm is vast, but where do you think I can run to?" Jiang Tianming was like a madman.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

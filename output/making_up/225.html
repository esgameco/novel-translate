        <h1>Chapter 225</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not know the rules of the Spirit Realm, and seeing that the huge boulder was unoccupied, he immediately took possession of it. </p><p></p><p>To him, it was a matter of first come, first served - since he arrived first, this place belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>As for the rules? </p><p></p><p>Those were only followed by the weak. Although he was not considered particularly strong in the Spirit Realm, looking out at the Black Cloud Marsh, none of those present were his match.</p><p></p><p>He was the mightiest, and occupying this prime spot was perfectly reasonable! Gazing at the toxic miasma swirling in the Black Cloud Marsh, Xu Yan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"I have the detoxification pills and poison-resisting pills made by my shijie. These toxic miasmas should be able to be withstood. Should I go ahead and enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb first?"</p><p></p><p>These toxic miasmas may seem fierce, capable of corroding true essence. Within the miasmas, one would constantly have to consume true essence to resist them, unable to stay for too long.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if one encountered danger, they would have to resist the miasmas while also dealing with the peril, unable to fully unleash their strength.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the major powers would only enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb once the miasmas had dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had the detoxification pills and poison-resisting pills refined by Su Lingxiu, allowing him to resist the miasmas without consuming true essence. If he encountered danger, he could go all-out.</p><p></p><p>"I can't be reckless. As a newcomer to the Spirit Realm, I don't know what threats these precious lands hold, so I should wait a bit."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Xu Yan abandoned the idea of entering the Qingtianjiao Tomb ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the geniuses of the various powers in the Spirit Realm, almost all of them accompanied by peak Grandmaster-level experts. And these experts all had pale complexions, with an air of desperation about them.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingtianjiao Tomb must contain some dangers, with the most dangerous likely being the potent toxins, which is why they have people scout the way in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Going in with these people can avoid unnecessary trouble. And since no one is here, I can just take it for myself!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought this way and then sat down on the boulder to continue cultivating the Dao.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was arrogant - even if all those present joined forces, they still couldn't harm him! </p><p></p><p>A day later, the toxic miasmas in the Black Cloud Marsh had thinned out a bit more. </p><p></p><p>In another three to five days, the miasmas would temporarily dissipate, and that would be the time to enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Two figures flew over.</p><p></p><p>The leader was a round-faced, slightly chubby young man - Shen Haizhou, the genius from the top-tier Shen Family of Yuzhou. The other was his attendant.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!" </p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the various powers in the Black Cloud Marsh suddenly perked up, looking at the young man sitting cross-legged on the boulder with schadenfreude. Many had a look of seeing a dead man.</p><p></p><p>The genius sent by the Shen Family of Yuzhou, Shen Haizhou! That boulder was the Shen Family's spot!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou arrived arrogantly with his attendant, and surveying the entire Black Cloud Marsh, apart from the Yushen Sect, there was no power that could match the Shen Family!</p><p></p><p>Here, he was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Heading towards the spot that had already been tacitly claimed by the Shen Family, he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>On the boulder, a young man was sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Which sect or family does he belong to? Could it be that he's stronger than the Shen Family?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was taken aback. </p><p></p><p>Daring to occupy the spot originally belonging to him - the power he belonged to must be stronger than the Shen Family.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this was a blatant disregard of the rules and a show of arrogance!</p><p></p><p>But the young man on the boulder seemed to be just a wandering cultivator, and his strength didn't appear to be much.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou couldn't help but frown, a displeased expression appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>A mere wandering cultivator daring to occupy a spot belonging to a top-tier family? This was courting death!</p><p></p><p>"A wandering cultivator would have this much courage?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's cautious nature made him refrain from immediately resorting to forceful suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, let me kill him for daring to defile Young Master's spot!" </p><p></p><p>His attendant angrily said.</p><p></p><p>"First drive him away, don't kill him," Shen Haizhou pondered for a moment before instructing.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master... Understood." </p><p></p><p>The attendant wanted to say more, but thinking about the young master's timid and cautious nature, he could only obey the order.</p><p></p><p>The two descended onto the boulder.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was in the midst of cultivating the Dao, furrowed his brows and said, "There are people here now!"</p><p></p><p>"Boy, this is the Shen Family's place. You've overstepped the rules, so get out of here and find another spot," the Shen Family attendant spoke coldly, his aura surging with the might of a mid-stage Small Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up at him and coldly said, "Is this place engraved with the Shen Family's name? It's an unclaimed land, and it's first come, first served. Since I arrived first, it belongs to me! Those who don't want to die, scram. Otherwise, don't blame me for not holding back!"</p><p></p><p>The attendant was infuriated by Xu Yan's refusal to back down. He glanced at Xu Yan's attire, which clearly marked him as a wandering cultivator, yet he dared to be so arrogant. If he didn't use thunderous means to subdue him, where would the prestige of the top-tier Shen Family be?</p><p></p><p>"Boy, you dare to offend the might of a top-tier family. What crime shall you be punished with? Die!" </p><p></p><p>Abandoning any thoughts of just driving him away or being cautious, the attendant raised his hand and a claw print came crashing down, aiming to kill Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold. These Spirit Realm cultivators were truly arrogant and overbearing, looking down on wandering cultivators. He realized that wandering cultivators and low-level fighters in the Spirit Realm faced a very difficult situation.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death, so I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was intent on killing him, Xu Yan wouldn't hold back because of the power behind him.</p><p></p><p>Still sitting cross-legged on the boulder, Xu Yan didn't even bother to stand up. He simply raised his hand and slashed!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Sword Dao intent combined with the Gentle Wind Sword Intent unleashed a powerful strike.</p><p></p><p>When Shen Haizhou and his attendant descended on the boulder, all the geniuses of the various powers, including the young man from the Yushen Sect, turned to watch.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Xu Yan was doomed. He would surely be killed by thunderous means to demonstrate the might of the top-tier Shen Family.</p><p></p><p>"There are always some arrogant and presumptuous wandering cultivators who court death," Dai Jun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Like the wandering cultivator who had recently threatened to kill his sister Dai Yingying, thinking his strength was not weak, daring to provoke the Dai Family. He had met an inevitable death by the Dai Family's thunderous wrath.</p><p></p><p>The young man before them was likely the same, probably thinking his strength was not bad, so he dared to ignore the families and sects. This kind of thing happened almost every day in Yuzhou, and without exception, they all died.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Shen Haizhou was too lazy to act, and it was his attendant who took action.</p><p></p><p>On the boulder, as Xu Yan raised his hand to slash, the Shen Family attendant suddenly had a drastic change in expression, letting out a low roar as a layer of golden light emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, he only felt a piercing pain in his mind, and everything went dark. Terrifying power crashed into him.</p><p></p><p>Death had arrived!</p><p></p><p>Pu! The Shen Family attendant didn't even let out a single agonized scream before his body shattered and turned to ash, scattering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The closest one, Dai Jun, gulped down a mouthful of saliva, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>He died? And his remains were completely gone! </p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Black Cloud Marsh, all the geniuses were stunned, looking with shock at the young man sitting cross-legged on the boulder, who had casually waved his hand to slay the mid-stage Small Celestial Venerable attendant.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Despite his relatively weak strength, he was still a Xiao Tian Ren cultivator! What shocked the gathered geniuses even more was not the strength of Shen Family's attendant, but the fact that the young man dared to kill Shen Family's attendant.</p><p></p><p>Right in front of Shen Family's young master, Shen Haizhou! The Shen Family was a top-tier aristocratic family in Yuzhou, with not less than three Lian Shen Tian Ren guarding them! Not to mention a lone cultivator, even second-tier families or Ling Sects would not dare to kill Shen Family's attendant over a minor conflict, especially in front of the Shen Family's young master.</p><p></p><p>"This is a challenge to the dignity of the Shen Family!"</p><p></p><p>Many thought with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The moment Xu Yan acted, Shen Haizhou's expression changed drastically. He had just retreated to the edge of the giant rock when the attendant died without leaving even a speck of dust! Xu Yan's cold gaze swept over, and Shen Haizhou instantly felt a sense of impending death.</p><p></p><p>Although the attendant's strength was inferior to his own.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party had casually waved his hand and killed the person. It would not take much effort for him to kill Shen Haizhou as well.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, calm down, brother, you must stay calm! Don't be rash!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The chubby round face squeezed out an ugly smile that looked worse than crying.</p><p></p><p>"He was your person, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm not very familiar with him. He was a random attendant I recruited along the way. Who knew he would do such a despicable thing to curry favor with me? He deserved to die, but it has nothing to do with me!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hastily distanced himself.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun and the other geniuses of the forces were all dumbfounded, looking at Shen Haizhou, feeling that their faces were burning. This scion of the Shen Family had truly brought shame to his aristocratic family!</p><p></p><p>So completely cowardly!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and said, "But he was your attendant, right? He disturbed my cultivation, so you should give an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's face turned green, his heart trembling, wiping cold sweat with one hand while frantically waving the other, "Brother, stay calm, you must stay calm. It was my attendant's fault. I will definitely give you an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"I, Shen Haizhou, have always been kind to others and never oppressed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I'll compensate you, I'll compensate you. Brother, how about this?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun and the other geniuses all felt that their faces were being disgraced by Shen Haizhou. Shameful to be associated with him.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of a lone cultivator? "Compensation? What kind of compensation?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cowardly and panicked Shen Haizhou, without a trace of the arrogance and boldness of a scion of an aristocratic family, yet so tactful and willing to compensate, and not showing any hostility just now, Xu Yan momentarily didn't have the heart to strike him down.</p><p></p><p>"How about a bottle of my Shen Family's Gathering Spirit Pill?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The group of geniuses all drew a sharp breath. The Gathering Spirit Pill of the Shen Family was quite famous in Yuzhou, difficult to refine, and a single bottle was not cheap.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a whole bottle, many cultivators could not obtain even one or two Gathering Spirit Pills in their entire lives, which would be a great honor.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun couldn't help but speak up, "The Gathering Spirit Pill is not something that can be easily obtained. The Shen Family has Lian Shen Tian Ren, you better think it through."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled disdainfully, "The Gathering Spirit Pill, what a piece of trash, just wasting spiritual herbs. This compensation won't do!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned his head to look at Dai Jun and sneered coldly, "Lian Shen Tian Ren, who are you trying to scare? There's no place for you to speak here!"</p><p></p><p>The tone was arrogant beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun and the other geniuses were instantly startled. Not even afraid of Lian Shen Tian Ren? And at such a young age, this person had such powerful strength. How could a lone cultivator possess such strength at this age?</p><p></p><p>And he was not afraid of Lian Shen Tian Ren at all.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he came from a top-tier Ling Sect? Not wearing the sect's uniform, perhaps out of disdain? Thinking of this possibility, Dai Jun hurriedly shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled indifferently, he knew his advantage was his young age and strong strength. These people could not figure out his identity as a lone cultivator in the short term.</p><p></p><p>They would naturally suspect him to be from a powerful force, so now was the time to be forceful and arrogant!</p><p></p><p>"Hand over your storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Shen Haizhou and said.</p><p></p><p>As a genius from a powerful force, he must be very wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this, the storage bag, I still... Brother, you take it, you take it!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had a conflicted expression on his face. Seeing Xu Yan's expression darken, he hurriedly handed over the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"What, you're not satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the storage bag and casually stuffed it into his bosom, looking at the reluctant and conflicted Shen Haizhou, raising his eyebrows and saying.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm satisfied, brother, don't misunderstand!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hastily showed a smile, not daring to linger, and hurriedly left the giant rock.</p><p></p><p>He went directly to the area occupied by Dai Jun.</p><p></p><p>"Get out, this place belongs to me now!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>What the fuck!</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun's face turned green with anger, how dare this coward bully him?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Shen, this is my Dai Family's..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's face darkened, fully displaying the bearing of a scion of an aristocratic family, angrily shouting, "Your Dai Family is a second-tier family, what nerve do you have to be reckless in front of my Shen Family?</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten the hierarchy of the aristocratic families? What, do you think my Shen Family's Lian Shen Ancestor is not intimidating enough?"</p><p></p><p>Fuck!!! Dai Jun was almost about to explode with anger. Where was this arrogant Shen Haizhou just now?</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses of the forces were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Bullying the weak and fearing the strong, huh?</p><p></p><p>"Fine, I'll leave!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun gritted his teeth and left, his face gloomy.</p><p></p><p>As a second-tier family, he naturally did not dare to offend a top-tier family like the Shen Family, even though the Dai Family had connections with the royal family of Zheng Kingdom. The Shen Family's foundation was simply not something an ordinary top-tier family could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun left with his attendants.</p><p></p><p>However, Shen Haizhou reached out and grabbed the shoulder of one of the attendants, "Hand over the storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>His own storage bag was gone, and he needed something to store any gains from entering the Azure Sky Flood Dragon Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The Dai Family attendant's face turned green.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took the attendant's storage bag without any hesitation and stuffed it into his own bosom.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Haizhou, don't go too far!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun was so angry that his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's chubby face revealed an arrogant expression, raising his eyebrows and coldly saying, "What, you're not satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun almost exploded with anger, gritting his teeth and glaring at Shen Haizhou, but ultimately did not dare to make a move, and he might not even be Shen Haizhou's match!</p><p></p><p>"Leave!"</p><p></p><p>He left with his attendants.</p><p></p><p>The gathered geniuses in the Black Cloud Swamp all stared in dumbfoundment at Shen Haizhou. This bastard, where was the bearing of a scion of an aristocratic family? The previous moment, he was fawning and cowardly, not daring to show any dignity.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he went to bully Dai Jun of the Dai Family!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had witnessed the entire process of Shen Haizhou bullying Dai Jun, and he was also somewhat dumbfounded. At the same time, he also realized the severe hierarchy in the Ling Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Family was a top-tier aristocratic family, the Dai Family was numerous and powerful, if they really fought, Shen Haizhou might not necessarily have the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Even if he acted, occupying the place and refusing to leave, Shen Haizhou would not be able to do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>The result was that Dai Jun could only angrily give up the place.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the hierarchy rules in the Ling Domain were strictly observed, unless there was a complete falling out to the death, even in public, they would still follow these rules.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

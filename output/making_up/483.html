        <h1>Chapter 483</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every move Xu Yan made was closely watched. Outside Taimiao Sect, immortal heavenly lords from various major factions were secretly observing. When Meng Chong and Jiang Buping arrived, the powerful figures from each faction naturally discovered it immediately.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought a battle between geniuses would erupt, but everything remained calm. From this, the powerful figures from various factions made a shocking guess - Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping actually knew each other. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was highly likely they came from the same sect.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about this made them tremble in shock. What kind of powerful master could cultivate such monstrous talents, and three of them at that?</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao hadn't left, waiting to go with Xu Yan to meet that mysterious figure.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Meng Chong and Jiang Buping confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth could cultivate such monstrous talents? And it seems Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping all practice different martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was very shocked.</p><p></p><p>Based on his knowledge, there seemed to be only one person capable of cultivating Xu Yan and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Taicang!</p><p></p><p>However, Taicang was already dead!</p><p></p><p>But if not Taicang, who else could possibly have such ability? "The Immortal Palace?" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yet he felt the possibility was low. If the Immortal Palace could achieve this, they would have already invaded Taicang's realm.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, it won't be long before I can meet him," Old Man Xiao thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>That day, Xu Yan and his group came out of Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Xu Yan said with a smile, looking at Old Man Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Old Man Xiao nodded, secretly looking forward to it, even starting to ponder how to probe Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>The group left Taimiao's territory, heading towards Qinghua's territory.</p><p></p><p>"We're attracting too much attention!" Meng Chong frowned slightly and said.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they went, powerful figures from various factions appeared, checking where the group was going, not even trying to conceal their traces or intentions.</p><p></p><p>These powerful figures also knew that even if they wanted to conceal their traces, they couldn't hide from Xu Yan and the others. If they caused any misunderstanding, they might even be slain with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they openly revealed their traces and made their intentions very clear.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Sword light suddenly appeared from all directions in the world. Every blade of grass and every tree turned into sharp swords. Xu Yan's voice echoed in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"If you keep following, you'll be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>As the sword light appeared, the powerful figures from various factions immediately changed their expressions and fled far away.</p><p></p><p>After this, the powerful figures from various factions no longer appeared.</p><p></p><p>After all, they feared death!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao sighed inwardly, thinking this young man was truly domineering.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the profoundness of that sword technique was something even he had never heard of before. It had already surpassed his understanding of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Can all things in heaven and earth become swords? What kind of sword technique is this? Is this still a sword technique?" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was in awe.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan were at the same level as him, Old Man Xiao felt he would be no match for Xu Yan. Facing such a profound sword technique, he probably couldn't block more than a few sword strikes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood why Xu Yan could kill immortal heavenly lords as easily as squashing ants.</p><p></p><p>It was because immortal heavenly lords had absolutely no defense against such a sword technique.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Diyun territory, the huge sky cave had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The power of the heavenly and earthly principles had also faded away, but Tian Seventeen and the other four still hadn't left. News from various parts of the Divine Realm kept coming in.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan subdued a dragon, the Dao Realm's heavenly ladder collapsed, the sky cave was in chaos, the Netherworld warriors performed blood sacrifices, the demonic aura was raging, and so on.</p><p></p><p>And the turmoil in the world was still continuing.</p><p></p><p>One realm of the Dao Realm fell, merging with the Divine Realm, connecting the Dao Realm and Divine Realm, making the two realms become one.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy and principles of the Dao Realm were spreading from this fallen realm.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of the Immortal Realm would soon be broken through.</p><p></p><p>Powerful figures from the Dao Realm would also descend, including some Supreme Realm warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Seventeen, who exactly is Xu Yan, and who is behind him? He actually subdued a dragon!" One of the four masked Tianshas spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen said solemnly, "Xu Yan comes from the Qinghua territory and holds an esteemed position there. His sword technique is unprecedentedly strong, he's a great monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>"As for who is behind him, that's unknown."</p><p></p><p>"That was a true dragon! From what you say, Xu Yan's level should be inferior to that true dragon, but he still subdued it, and didn't use his sword technique. This means he has mastered a method to restrain true dragons."</p><p></p><p>Another masked Tiansha said with shock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Defeating a stronger opponent and subduing a true dragon was unprecedented. It was the first time in history!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could be called the first person in history to subdue a dragon!</p><p></p><p>"His level of monstrousness far exceeds my imagination!" Tian Seventeen also said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord has sent a message, we must obtain the dragon-subduing method!" Tian Seventeen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord sent a message?" The four masked Tianshas' eyes were excited.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's time to make a great contribution. If we obtain the dragon-subduing method, the Lord will be able to control the true dragon clan. Whoever makes this great contribution will have a chance at reaching the Supreme Realm!" Tian Seventeen said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Tian Seventeen, where is Xu Yan? We'll go capture him right away and wait for the Lord to descend!" The masked Tianshas were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has probably already returned to the Qinghua territory. If we want to capture him, we can only go to Qinghua territory." Tian Seventeen suddenly said with some regret, "This opportunity to make a great contribution can only be given to you. The Lord has another task for me!"</p><p></p><p>The four masked Tianshas were overjoyed, but they comforted him, saying, "Seventeen, since the Lord has given you another important task, I imagine this task's importance won't be inferior to the dragon-subduing method."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen nodded with a smile, "Of course. This task must be important. Otherwise, why don't we switch tasks? I'll go to Qinghua territory, and you go to welcome the Third Envoy's descent to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The four masked Tianshas hurriedly shook their heads when they heard this, "That won't do. Since the Lord has assigned this to you, if we overstep our bounds, we might displease the Lord. We four brothers will go to Qinghua territory to capture Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>A hint of regret flashed in Tian Seventeen's eyes, but he pretended to be solemn and said, "You're right. How can we transfer a task assigned by the Lord to someone else?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" The four masked Tianshas nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, I wish you four brothers good fortune. When you reach the Supreme Realm in the future, don't forget about me, Seventeen."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's tone became respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, no need to be so formal between us!"</p><p></p><p>The four had happy expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord's task is urgent, so we'll part ways here."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>The four masked Tianshas, with excited faces, instantly disappeared, heading straight for Qinghua territory.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's smile faded as he silently watched the four leave.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can come back alive."</p><p></p><p>Capturing Xu Yan and obtaining the dragon-subduing method seemed like a task with generous rewards, but the prerequisite was staying alive.</p><p></p><p>No news had come from Qinghua territory for a while. It seemed all members of Tiansha Diying had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it couldn't be ruled out that they had betrayed.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan being such a monstrous talent, how could the person behind him be weak? If you four fail, it would be understandable for me not to take action."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, to gather intelligence and stabilize the overall situation, the Lord would only praise me for adapting flexibly and understanding priorities. That's why he would entrust more important tasks to me.</p><p></p><p>"If you four somehow succeed, don't blame me for being ruthless. Such a great achievement is not something you can claim."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen revealed a cold smile. </p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm was too dangerous, he had to play it safe. He had not personally taken action out of caution. Tian Seventeen was very clear about his own positioning - he was the behind-the-scenes planner and executor, not the one charging into battle or risking his life recklessly.</p><p></p><p>The four masked Tiansha men headed straight for the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong the person behind Xu Yan is, they are at most at the Divine Lord realm. If there were a Supreme Being in the Divine Realm, how could our Lord not know? The four of us brothers joining forces is enough to kill the opponent, but we still need to be careful," the eldest of the four said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"We have divine weapons bestowed by our Lord. We can kill ordinary Divine Lords, and even top Divine Lords if we join forces. Capturing Xu Yan will be as easy as turning over our palms!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>The four were full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm seemed like a place outside the world. While the outside world was in turmoil, the Qinghua Realm remained calm and undisturbed. </p><p></p><p>There was no sense of the shaking earth, nor the chaos of the various realms of the Divine Realm. It presented a scene of peace and prosperity, with extremely active spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang was stunned the moment she entered the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was also somewhat surprised at how much the Qinghua Realm had changed. "That's right, this is the Qinghua Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Princess, something's not right about this Qinghua Realm!" </p><p></p><p>The old woman who accompanied Zhou Qingshuang said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy was too active, as if the Qinghua Realm had already broken through the limits of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find Sister Lingxiu, she can heal you!" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Qinghua Realm and about to see her senior and Su Lingxiu, Zi Yun was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>She decided she would never leave again. Nowhere else compared to being with Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong will be back soon too!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zi Yun's smile grew even brighter.</p><p></p><p>With the great changes in the world and the Divine Realm in turmoil, Zi Yun and Zhou Qingshuang had experienced some ups and downs on their journey from the Great Yan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou Qingshuang and the old woman were ultimately Immortal Heavenly Lords and could handle the situation.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping could kill Immortal Heavenly Lords as easily as crushing ants, Immortal Heavenly Lords were still top existences in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's strength was extremely high among Immortal Heavenly Lords, and her identity as the Great Yan Princess was enough to intimidate many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun is back."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun had sent a message before her return.</p><p></p><p>"And she's brought a patient."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's face was full of anticipation, as she was very interested in rare and difficult illnesses.</p><p></p><p>"Lingxiu, Yue'er!" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's figure flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zi Yun!" Yue'er's face was full of joy. "Sister Zi Yun, your strength has fallen behind!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun sighed and said, "Can't be helped, Great Yan is ultimately not Changqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Next, Zi Yun introduced Zhou Qingshuang, "This is the Great Yan Princess!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Medicine Immortal, Su Lingxiu!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang and her servant were greatly shocked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Lingxiu's aura was friendly and gentle, with a kind of ethereal quality, her strength was so great that it terrified the master and servant.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder she's Meng Chong's junior sister. With her strength, killing Immortal Heavenly Lords really is like killing chickens!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang marveled.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshuang pays her respects to Immortal Su!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang didn't dare put on any airs as the Great Yan Princess, and respectfully greeted her.</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities. Your condition, Second Senior Brother has already told me about. Since you're here, we shouldn't delay. Let me examine you!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's face was full of excitement, eager to begin.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since she had come, she would go along with it. If Su Lingxiu really had any ill intentions, she had no power to resist with Su Lingxiu's strength.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Yue'er examined Zhou Qingshuang to diagnose her illness.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun went to the backyard.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun pays her respects to Senior!"</p><p></p><p>She knelt down respectfully to salute.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile and nodded, saying, "No need for such formalities!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun stood up after respectfully saluting.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, does the Taicang Martial Way have no future?"</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Zi Yun couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's smile remained unchanged as he said, "The peak of the Taicang Martial Way is Taicang himself, but that doesn't mean it can't continue to improve. It's just that Taicang is dead, so there's no further progress.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang still has strength, but for you, it's still too far away. Don't be overly ambitious, just cultivate steadily.</p><p></p><p>"To explore the path ahead, the prerequisite is that you have already reached Taicang's height!"</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yun understands!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, cultivate well then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his finger, he instantly upgraded the jade talisman on Zi Yun's body.</p><p></p><p>With Zi Yun's return, the Medicine Immortal's院 became much livelier. After witnessing the art of medicine, Zhou Qingshuang and her servant were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's soul illness had also been cured.</p><p></p><p>Although the illness was cured, due to its long-term effects, Zhou Qingshuang still remained cool and aloof.</p><p></p><p>Though her illness was cured, Zhou Qingshuang did not return to the Great Yan Realm, but instead took up residence next to the Medicine Immortal's院. She also took out many divine medicines and treasures to purchase medicinal pills and so on.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she dispatched the old woman to return to the Great Yan Realm to bring back more divine medicines and other treasures.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan saw this and couldn't help but marvel at how generous this woman was, and how decisive, directly using money to pave the way and befriend Su Lingxiu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Even he had received valuable treasures from Zhou Qingshuang!</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to meet someone who understands how to seize opportunities as well as I do!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how hard Zhou Qingshuang tried, she was destined to never fully integrate like he had.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had started running errands diligently when Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were not yet strong enough, working very hard and doing a beautiful job, which allowed him to seize this great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his group had already entered the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>At Dagai Mountain, Xu Yan had a small gathering with his old acquaintance Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu's name shakes the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He was half a step away from the Immortal Realm, and was confident he could break through within half a year.</p><p></p><p>However, what did breaking through to the Immortal Realm matter?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had killed who knows how many top Immortal Realm experts, and even true dragons had submitted to him.</p><p></p><p>"That's because the Immortal Heavenly Lords are too weak. I've only made a false name for myself, it's not worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Wan Tianlin didn't know how to respond.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

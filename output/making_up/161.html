        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan successfully split his true qi and gained a profound understanding of the mysteries of true qi, he was not far from comprehending the cultivation method of the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cultivation methods of the Penetrating Mystery Realm were emerging one by one in his mind - how to refine the primal essence, how to harmonize with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and how to fathom the profound mysteries of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Everything was becoming increasingly clear and lucid.</p><p></p><p>The complete and genuine cultivation method of the Penetrating Mystery Realm appeared in Xu Yan's mind, and the path to the Penetrating Mystery Realm had been opened.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to break through the Innate Perfection realm, and he would be able to break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm! The third realm of the Martial Dao, the Penetrating Mystery!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Penetrating Mystery, I have finally grasped the Penetrating Mystery cultivation method that my master imparted."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The enlightenment of the Penetrating Mystery had opened the door to the third realm of the Martial Dao for him. </p><p></p><p>He only needed to take one step after another, approach the door, and then step into it.</p><p></p><p>"I must break through the Innate Perfection realm as soon as possible. Once I reach Innate Perfection, I can then break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm. Even peak Grandmaster cultivators will be easily slain once I enter the Penetrating Mystery Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to head back."</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island was now his domain. He had just slain two Grandmaster cultivators, and no one dared to covet Canglan Island, not even peak Grandmaster cultivators, as they would have to carefully consider the consequences.</p><p></p><p>"I should also complete the purchase of the medicinal herbs on Sister Ling's list and bring them back to her. With the medicinal pills, my parents' cultivation will advance rapidly. </p><p></p><p>Especially for my grandfather, since he is already advanced in years. With the medicinal pills to nourish him, his strength will steadily increase as well."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was well aware that his parents and family members could not remain in the remote border region forever. The inner domain was vast and abundant in resources, far surpassing the border region.</p><p></p><p>Only by increasing their strength could they better protect their own safety.</p><p></p><p>He could not always stay by his parents' side.</p><p></p><p>"I should also try to investigate the forces behind Sister Ling's enemies. They seem to be quite formidable and are determined to capture her at all costs."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>He had already incurred the enmity of the Black-Robed Faction. </p><p></p><p>Since they had become sworn enemies, he naturally had to completely eradicate their forces! But the Black-Robed Faction was mysterious, and it would not be an easy task to investigate their whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Ling Xiu were to come to the inner domain and reveal herself, they would come seeking her out on their own. </p><p></p><p>In that case, he would need to possess formidable strength to deal with the Black-Robed Faction.</p><p></p><p>As for his master, Xu Yan had never considered relying on his master to handle the Black-Robed Faction. His master was an exceptional figure, and for him to personally intervene against the Black-Robed Faction would be beneath his status.</p><p></p><p>As a disciple, how could he create trouble and then rely on his master to resolve it? </p><p></p><p>He, Xu Yan, would handle his own problems. His master's transition from seclusion to re-entering the world was all because of him. He could not disturb his master's tranquility over such minor matters!</p><p></p><p>"Once I enter the Penetrating Mystery Realm, no matter how many peak Grandmaster cultivators come, I will slay them all. Let's see how many peak Grandmaster cultivators you have!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly chuckled to himself.</p><p></p><p>He descended from the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Feng, Hu Shan, I'm leaving, let's head back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan called out.</p><p></p><p>"Has your strength advanced even further, Brother Xu?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng remarked with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that easy!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, carrying a box on his back, the three of them left Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Canglan Island, Xu Yan did not immediately return to the border region, but instead went to the Tianbao Pavilion to retrieve the stored spiritual herbs and purchase all the spiritual herbs on Ling Xiu's list.</p><p></p><p>The quantity of spiritual herbs he purchased was massive. Even the Tianbao Pavilion in a small city would likely be unable to gather all the herbs, so Xu Yan purchased them at the Tianbao Pavilion in the capital city of Lanping Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual herbs he had previously stored were also kept at the Tianbao Pavilion in the capital city of Lanping Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Two large bags full of spiritual herbs, with Xu Yan carrying one and Xie Lingfeng helping to carry the other, it was as if they were carrying a small mountain on their backs.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual crystals, I really spent a fortune!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>This trip had nearly exhausted all his spiritual crystals, just to purchase these two large bags of spiritual herbs, completing the entire list for Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Each type of spiritual herb was purchased in multiple copies.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiu's herb list was predominantly composed of ninth and eighth-grade spiritual herbs, with only a few seventh-grade herbs, and not a single sixth-grade herb.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, when Ling Xiu compiled this list, she had considered the rarity of sixth-grade herbs and the difficulty in obtaining them, so she did not include any sixth-grade herbs.</p><p></p><p>Even the seventh-grade herbs were only a few types.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because the herbs on the list were of relatively low grades that Xu Yan was able to purchase such a large quantity. Otherwise, with his current spiritual crystal reserves, he would not have been able to buy so many spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was carrying a large box, and of the three, he was carrying the least.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng each had a massive package on their backs, towering over their own heights.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the streets of Lanping Prefecture, they attracted many curious gazes, especially when they exited the Tianbao Pavilion, it was obvious they had purchased a significant amount of items there.</p><p></p><p>"I somehow feel like we might be targeted," </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The manager at the Tianbao Pavilion had even asked Xu Yan if he wanted to leave through the side door to avoid drawing attention.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had declined, choosing to exit through the main entrance directly.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for them not to attract attention.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the ones eyeing us aren't just a bunch of paupers," </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although they were carrying a large bag of spiritual herbs, as long as no Grandmaster cultivators attacked, there was no need to worry about the herbs being damaged in battle.</p><p></p><p>Mere sect disciples would be easily dispatched with a flick of the finger, posing no threat at all.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's mouth twitched, suspecting that Xu Yan had just about exhausted his spiritual crystals and was now desperately trying to lure someone to rob them, hoping to recoup some of his losses.</p><p></p><p>As the three of them left Lanping Prefecture, Hu Shan revealed his aura as a sect disciple, immediately intimidating many of the lurking observers, causing them to retreat and abandon their plans.</p><p></p><p>In this way, all the martial artists below the sect disciple realm were effectively filtered out.</p><p></p><p>Anyone daring to attempt a robbery would have to be a sect disciple at least.</p><p></p><p>"If someone tries to rob us, as long as they hand over their money pouch, I'll let them go. After all, I'm the one who lured them here to rob us, so there's no need to kill them. I'm not a bloodthirsty person."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded, indicating he understood.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan rolled his eyes, muttering to himself: "You really have your principles!" Since ancient times, wealth has been the driving force for human hearts. The three of them had not even left the capital city for long when they were ambushed by martial artists.</p><p></p><p>And they were six sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>All of them were wearing masks, presumably well-known sect disciples in Lanping Prefecture who did not want to be recognized.</p><p></p><p>"Sect disciples, so poor that you have to resort to robbery?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, we have so many spiritual herbs on us that we won't need to worry about herbs for the next ten-plus years. Not all sect disciples are wealthy," </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his previous statement about sect disciples being at the pinnacle and living in luxury had given Xu Yan the wrong impression.</p><p></p><p>"Six against three, the odds are in our favor. You three should know how to make the right choice. Put down your belongings, and we won't harm you," </p><p></p><p>the blocking sect disciples said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and slapped out, and a golden giant dragon coiled and circled around the six sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The master chuckled and said, "So you've come to rob me, how fortunate! Hand over your money pouches, or else you die!"</p><p></p><p>The intercepting masters were almost scared out of their wits. A golden giant dragon palm strike? This was the exclusive martial art of the Sword Deity Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Taking a closer look, the one carrying a large bundle was actually a young man...</p><p></p><p>"Sword Deity, please spare us!" </p><p></p><p>They immediately knelt down.</p><p></p><p>They had actually tried to rob Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a glance at the six money pouches in his hand and nodded, "Leave, and don't let my identity be revealed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan warned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>The six masters fled in a sorry state. As for whether they would leak Xu Yan's identity, of course not. They were the ones who had suffered misfortune, and they naturally wished to see others suffer as well. If the news got out, they would only become a laughing stock - how could they have been so blind as to try and rob the Sword Deity Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>If others also suffered misfortune, even if the matter was eventually exposed, it wouldn't be just them being mocked.</p><p></p><p>The six masters kept their mouths shut, absolutely refusing to say that they had tried to rob Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I, a mighty master, how could I possibly do such a despicable thing as roadside robbery!" Xu Yan and the others had encountered several waves of robbers, but after leaving the Blue Peace Prefecture, they didn't encounter any more master-level robbers. After all, there were only so many master cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And not all master cultivators would come to rob.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, why are you buying so many spiritual herbs?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan seemed particularly fond of spiritual herbs, and he earned spirit crystals mainly to purchase spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"I'm bringing them back for my junior sister to refine pills with," Xu Yan replied openly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister?" Xie Lingfeng's eyes widened. Had his senior taken on another disciple?</p><p></p><p>How envious!</p><p></p><p>"What is pill refining?" Xie Lingfeng asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Medicinal pills! It's a technique my master passed down to my junior sister. You'll understand when you go there. It's nothing like the ordinary pills in the inner realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were moving faster and faster, and their tracks were starting to be hidden, avoiding being tracked.</p><p></p><p>Once they crossed the mountains, they would enter the borderlands.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had drawn up the step-by-step pill refining method, outlining the entire process on a piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>The most critical and difficult step in the entire pill refining process was the final stage of condensing it into a pill.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think?" Su Lingxiu unfolded the diagram of the pill refining process and showed it to her master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at it and inwardly praised her. His disciple Su Lingxiu truly had an extraordinary talent for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>He had only provided a few pointers, and she had already figured it out.</p><p></p><p>"The issues are not major. Just go through the actual operation a few times, and make adjustments if any problems arise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go prepare. I'll select some talented individuals and teach them the pill refining steps."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>She must make preparations in advance for entering the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Medicinal pills were the foundation of the Eternal Green Hall.</p><p></p><p>She immediately notified Kou Ruozhi, instructing him to select a group of people and prepare a batch of medicinal ingredients. Once she had the time, she would impart the pill refining steps to the members of the Eternal Green Hall.</p><p></p><p>With abundant spiritual herbs, naturally there would be no shortage of medicinal pills. With the aid of medicinal pills, the cultivation speed would naturally increase rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that troubled Su Lingxiu was that she still hadn't comprehended anything from the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>She lacked a powerful body cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask my eldest brother for guidance when he returns."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>She refined a batch of Golden Body Pill and went to the small mountain peak outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, this is the Golden Body Pill."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the Golden Body Pill and said, "Junior sister, you have enough medicinal pills for now. You should spend more time on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, refining pills is also a form of cultivation for me."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought about it and nodded. His junior sister's cultivation was in the Alchemist Martial Dao, so refining pills was indeed part of her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, how much longer until you break through?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It won't be too long now."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled. He was currently using the Golden Body Pill to nourish his apertures, and each aperture had a profound mystery that he had yet to fully comprehend.</p><p></p><p>One of the apertures, he was cultivating the Dao of the Blade, accumulating a trump card that he could unleash to surpass his limits in a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Li Xuan used his bamboo staff to point out the acupoints on the Crimson Cat, repeating the Great Demon Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat would leave, seemingly half-understanding, and lie down at the manor gate, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>The failed medicinal pills from the herb refining had amazing effects, causing the Crimson Cat's body to grow even larger, forcing Shi Er to replace the golden chain again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a great master, increasing your Sword Dao experience and enhancing your Annihilation Sword Intent."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled. Xu Yan had killed another great master?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has destroyed a great master with a single palm strike, increasing your Dragon Palm experience and enhancing your Dragon Might."</p><p></p><p>The golden light continued to appear.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath. So Xu Yan had encountered an ambush?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the forces of the Black-Robed One?"</p><p></p><p>Currently, the ones attacking Xu Yan would either be the forces of the Black-Robed One or the forces of the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, there was no further feedback from the golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Could it have been just two great masters?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head. Two great masters daring to ambush Xu Yan, they must be courting death.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan should be returning soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had been gone for almost a month.</p><p></p><p>The next day, just as Li Xuan was about to go guide Su Lingxiu in her Bagua comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Penetrating Mystery Realm cultivation technique you created, and he has broken through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had comprehended the Penetrating Mystery Realm technique!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Li Xuan felt a earth-shattering transformation occurring within his body. His massive true qi was gradually transforming into true essence.</p><p></p><p>His strength was rapidly surging.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he felt that with a single thought, his true essence could merge with the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, unleashing the might of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm!</p><p></p><p>His dantian sea of qi, boundless and vast, had now transformed into a great ocean. The massive true qi had become true essence, surging like tidal waves within his dantian.</p><p></p><p>As he circulated it, it flowed through his body like a river.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Penetrating Mystery Realm, truly powerful beyond measure!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The martial technique he had created was indeed powerful. Even though it was only the third realm of the martial path, it could already seemingly control the might of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy in the sky above the manor condensed into a sword, floating in midair and containing a terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to embody the grandeur of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The mysteries of heaven and earth, the initial touch of the might of heaven and earth, this is the Penetrating Mystery Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a joyful smile.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy he had controlled dissipated, and the sky above the manor returned to its peaceful state, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

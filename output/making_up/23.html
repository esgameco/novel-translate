            <p>Chapter 23: Breaking Through the Barrier, Becoming Jade-like Bones</p><p></p><p>The fire-maned wolf was extremely powerful, far exceeding the capabilities of ordinary wild beasts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the pressure, and at this moment, he felt his qi and blood boiling, his entire being in a state of sublimation.</p><p></p><p>The circulation of qi and blood throughout his body was increasing, and his strength was constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He charged up again and engaged in a fierce battle with the fire-maned wolf.</p><p></p><p>As the battle raged on, his qi and blood became increasingly turbulent. At a certain moment, he grappled with the fire-maned wolf and they rolled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how many times the fire-maned wolf had kicked him with its powerful legs, but he grabbed the wolf's huge jaws with his hands and kicked its body with his legs.</p><p></p><p>The man and the beast rolled on the ground, kicking and struggling with each other.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan was slammed into a large tree, and he let out a roar of anger, grabbing the fire-maned wolf's two fangs and forcefully throwing it towards the tree.</p><p></p><p>The battle had reached a critical point, and it was at this moment that Xu Yan felt the barrier of his jade-like bones begin to loosen.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, it was as if there was a cracking sound, and the barrier shattered.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged instantly, and his bones continued to be tempered.</p><p></p><p>"Can only you bite?" Xu Yan grabbed the fire-maned wolf's fangs and slammed it to the ground, allowing it to thrash its limbs against his body. His eyes turned blood-red, and he opened his mouth to bite the exposed neck of the fire-maned wolf.</p><p></p><p>Plop!</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of fur.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spat out the fur and continued to bite.</p><p></p><p>The fire-maned wolf was now panicked, struggling violently, its limbs pounding Xu Yan's body, the sound of which made Xu Yan feel as if his entire skeleton was trembling.</p><p></p><p>He pressed the fire-maned wolf down firmly, changing his position, using his legs to firmly restrain the wolf's forelegs, and continued to open his mouth to bite the wolf's throat.</p><p></p><p>Bite after bite, at a certain moment, there was a popping sound as he tore open the skin of the fire-maned wolf's throat, and fresh blood gushed out.</p><p></p><p>A thread of fresh blood entered his stomach, and in an instant, Xu Yan felt his qi and blood boiling, as if it were a tonic, and his entire being became comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The speed of tempering his bones at this moment increased.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, and he lay on top of the fire-maned wolf, pinning it to the ground, and continued to tear and bite the wolf's throat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the fire-maned wolf's limbs were flailing in the air, its body twisting and struggling, emitting terrified roars, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>As the bone tempering began, Xu Yan's qi and blood further strengthened, and his strength became even greater.</p><p></p><p>After biting and tearing for an unknown number of times, at a certain moment, the fire-maned wolf's throat suddenly let out a popping sound, and fresh blood gushed out, piercing the major artery.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan greedily continued to consume the blood of the fire-maned wolf, like sweet dew, his eyes revealing an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>The blood entered his mouth and quickly transformed into qi and blood, and the speed of tempering his bones continued to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>His entire body's bones became increasingly translucent, and he was one step closer to flawless jade-like bones.</p><p></p><p>The fire-maned wolf, on the brink of death, suddenly burst forth with a desperate struggle and broke free from Xu Yan's control, trying to flee.</p><p></p><p>How could Xu Yan let his prey escape? He pounced on it again, punching, kicking, tearing, and biting, and the fire-maned wolf ultimately collapsed on the ground, barely alive, covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"I can't waste this, this is a treasure for bone tempering!" Xu Yan pounced on it and greedily continued to absorb the blood of the fire-maned wolf. His qi and blood boiled, and the speed of bone tempering increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>The blood was almost completely drained, and Xu Yan was now in a stage of transformation.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly stood up and began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood coiled around his bones like a dragon, and his bone marrow actually became translucent, his bones undergoing a certain transformation.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were now a seamless whole, without any gaps.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, and Xu Yan felt that a layer of sticky old blood was gushing out from his entire body, covering him in a blood-stained mess.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crystalline luster radiated from within, manifesting an extraordinary phenomenon around his body.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like bones were formed!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's entire skeletal structure had become as pure and flawless as jade, with a smooth and lustrous sheen. On the unblemished jade-like bones, there seemed to be intricate natural patterns, profoundly mystical.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, becoming even more refined, which could be described as immaculate qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, new qi and blood were constantly being generated, continuously growing stronger. The consumption from the fierce battle had already been fully replenished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, if Xu Yan were to encounter the Fire-Maned Wolf again, he would not struggle as intensely and arduously as before. Perhaps just a few punches and kicks would be enough to slay the Fire-Maned Wolf.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I have been elevated, as if I have transcended the realm of ordinary mortals!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clenched his fists, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Upon the formation of his jade-like bones, he deeply experienced their immense power and profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"My martial dao foundation has surpassed the ancient prodigies. I have attained the jade-like bones!"</p><p></p><p>Flawless jade-like bones, unbreakable for eternity!</p><p></p><p>Even if he were to perish now, his skeletal structure, having weathered countless years, would not decay but instead become ever more crystalline, and could even become a precious treasure in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This is the formidable power of the jade-like bones, truly transcending the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>With the refinement of his jade-like bones, the path of his martial dao lies wide open, unrivaled within his realm.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement subsided, Xu Yan looked at the mangled remains of the Fire-Maned Wolf, and a pained expression crossed his face.</p><p></p><p>"The fur and hide of the Fire-Maned Wolf have been torn and shattered by me. I can no longer present them as a gift to my master."</p><p></p><p>"My master must already know the catalyst for my breakthrough to the jade-like bones was the Fire-Maned Wolf. My master had already paved the way for my martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more deeply moved he felt.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood stains all over himself, Xu Yan decided not to return to the small mountain village, but to go home instead, and also find another exquisite jade ruyi for his master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the tattered remains of the Fire-Maned Wolf and placed them on the horse's back. However, the horse was terrified by the beast's lingering aura, its legs trembling. Only after Xu Yan infused his refined qi and blood to suppress the aura did the horse finally obey and start moving.</p><p></p><p>"The flesh and blood of the Fire-Maned Wolf are highly nourishing, perfect for refining my dantian. Now that I have attained the jade-like bones, the refinement of my dantian will soon be completed as well.</p><p></p><p>"I will strive to complete the dantian refinement within three months!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with determination, the gateway to the martial dao not far ahead.</p><p></p><p>He will truly become a genuine cultivator of the martial dao, and all the previous ridicule and disdain will be swept away.</p><p></p><p>He will make those people understand that the frog in the well knows not the vastness of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>While they remain trapped in their well, he has already stepped into that boundless realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood on the hilltop, gazing at Xu Yan's path, letting out a sigh. His foolish disciple had been gone for five days.</p><p></p><p>He did not know if Xu Yan had managed to safely pass through the Malevolent Forest without being devoured by a ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had fabricated the cultivation method to deceive Xu Yan, after such a long period of interaction, it was impossible for him to have no feelings towards this disciple.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quite satisfied with Xu Yan as a disciple. </p><p></p><p>Alas, he was not a reclusive high cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This was a deception, destined to not end well, even though Xu Yan had remained oblivious so far. Li Xuan dared not continue the deception indefinitely, for there is no unbreakable lie in this world.</p><p></p><p>His only hope was that after a year, without any mishaps, they could part ways amicably.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could leave Xu Yan with the regret of having had the opportunity, but failed to grasp it due to insufficient talent.</p><p></p><p>And Li Xuan would remain the revered master in Xu Yan's heart.</p><p></p><p>This would be the best possible outcome for this teacher-disciple relationship.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 27: Entering the Martial Path, Known as the Qi and Blood Realm</p><p></p><p>"The Fire-Maned Wolf is indeed quite powerful for you. In fact, if you were to give up, I as your master would not blame you. But you have remained steadfast and broken through the barrier, refining your jade-like physique, which has made me very pleased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expressed his recognition of his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"However, disciple, you must remember that while facing difficulties head-on is indeed commendable, we martial cultivators are not reckless brutes or mindless fools. Reckless brutes only know how to charge forward, and they cannot last in the long run."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke carefully.</p><p></p><p>He had to give his disciple a reminder, not to do anything too dangerous!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if this foolish disciple were to misinterpret his words and fearlessly and foolishly engage in dangerous acts, resulting in the loss of his life, Li Xuan would be devastated.</p><p></p><p>The ability to become invincible rests on this foolish disciple, after all.</p><p></p><p>He cannot afford for him to perish midway!</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's tendency to self-interpret, and his extraordinary ability to self-enlighten, Li Xuan did not need to be too blunt with his words, leaving room for his disciple to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully said, "Master's teachings, I will engrave them in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind raced as he carefully continued, "We cultivators must emphasize enlightenment and the discernment of blessings and calamities. When it is time to retreat, we retreat; when it is time to advance, we advance. We must have a flexible mind and keen perception of crises...</p><p></p><p>"We must be adept at utilizing wisdom and seizing opportunities... Those who only have victory and defeat in mind are reckless brutes; those without resolute courage are also mediocre people.</p><p></p><p>"In short, do not be rigid. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied, "Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, "Master's words are profoundly esoteric. This is the path of the martial dao. I have only grasped the surface meaning - to be flexible in facing enemies, and to also have resolute courage. </p><p></p><p>"My martial realm is still too low.</p><p></p><p>"I have too little experience, but I will remember Master's words - to be flexible, not rigid. I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at his disciple, muttering to himself, unsure if the foolish disciple had truly comprehended the deeper meaning of his words or had simply self-interpreted them.</p><p></p><p>But he was likely to have understood, for this young man had a nimble mind and was not rigid.</p><p></p><p>What should he do next?</p><p></p><p>Continue imparting cultivation methods to Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>He had not finished designing them yet!</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan could cultivate successfully, and Li Xuan could receive feedback, he could not just randomly make things up from now on. It had to be systematic and sound, with an air of mystery and power.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet decided on the martial realms either.</p><p></p><p>As for the current realm of martial entry, he would call it the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since he was making it up anyway, he could name the realms as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Next, how should one cultivate? What realm is this?</p><p>Li Xuan needed to ponder a bit, ensuring the realms were clearly defined and the theories were sound and substantial. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, as a former online novelist, fabricating cultivation settings was not too difficult for him.</p><p>It was just a matter of spending some time on it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Xuan spoke, "Take some time to stabilize your breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is boundless. You must remember that entering the path is just the beginning."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan assumed a stern teacher's demeanor as he continued, "Martial entry is called the Qi and Blood Realm. You have just entered the Qi and Blood Realm. When you reach the state of Qi and Blood that I just displayed, that will be the Qi and Blood Realm's completion."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was greatly inspired.</p><p></p><p>"So the martial entry is called the Qi and Blood Realm! And I have only just entered it. The terrifying power Master displayed just now, that is the completion of the Qi and Blood Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about his own strength, which was a hundredfold greater than this realm. Even if Xu Yan cultivated to the completion of the Qi and Blood Realm, he would still be far inferior to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, the surging qi and blood had already reached a hundred zhang high, which meant the qi and blood had reached the peak.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>He then said, "Of course, my master's strength is ultimately too high. Even if you have reached the peak of qi and blood, you still cannot achieve what I have. Qi and blood reaching a hundred zhang, burning brightly like flames, yin and yang clearly differentiated - that is the pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied, "Disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>Qi and blood reaching a hundred zhang, that was the peak of the qi and blood realm!</p><p></p><p>To be able to kill enemies from a hundred zhang away, what an incredible power that was!</p><p></p><p>In terms of the martial artists' strength in the Qi Kingdom, Xu Yan was confident that he could sweep through the entire jianghu, even those legendary supreme experts would not be a match for his single punch.</p><p></p><p>He felt that with his current strength, he might even be able to disregard the Qi Kingdom's emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, he still needed to remain low-key. Who knows if there were martial dao experts like his master hidden away?</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan asked, "Master, how is the martial dao world? In the Qi Kingdom where I'm from, the martial prowess is too low. Even the supreme experts, I feel that with a single breath I could kill them!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly surprised, the martial strength in the Qi Kingdom was this low?</p><p></p><p>A single breath could kill the jianghu's supreme experts?</p><p></p><p>But looking at the fierce wolf spirit in the evil forest, the martial power in this world shouldn't be this low.</p><p></p><p>As for whether there was a martial dao world, Li Xuan naturally didn't know. Seeing Xu Yan's expectant gaze, he said, "Since your strength has improved, you'll naturally be able to come into contact with it. Don't aim too high, if your strength is too lacking and you go to places with many strong experts, you'll just be cannon fodder."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered this and nodded, "Master is right!"</p><p></p><p>He then curiously asked, "Master, what realm are you at?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled mysteriously, slightly lifting his head to look up at the sky, and said in a pensive tone, "Realm? That is far too distant a matter..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned, the realm was too distant a matter?</p><p></p><p>"Does Master mean that he has already transcended all the existing realms?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was the master, a hidden supreme expert who had already transcended the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand now!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit bewildered, this foolish disciple, what did he understand now?</p><p></p><p>Standing up, with his hands behind his back, he walked with a leisurely pace towards the house, saying, "Disciple, continue to consolidate your strength."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned to the house, calming his excited heart, and began to ponder how to fabricate a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The entry-level of the martial dao is the qi and blood realm, and the cultivation of the qi and blood realm is qi and blood. The stronger the qi and blood, the stronger the physical body and the greater the power. Then what would be the reasonable cultivation method after the qi and blood realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I'm making it up, there has to be a framework, a theoretical basis for the disciple to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>"Aha!</p><p></p><p>"Above the qi and blood realm is the innate realm, where the qi and blood are refined into innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>"The innate, soaring through the air, traveling hundreds of li in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>"But how should one cultivate to reach the innate realm?"</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Li Xuan determined that the realm above the qi and blood was the innate realm, where one refines the qi and blood into true qi. And the first step would be to open the dantian sea of qi...</p><p></p><p>"Open the dantian sea of qi, refine the true qi, transform the post-heaven into the pre-heaven... How to open the dantian?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, just establish a theory, and let the disciple comprehend it. It shouldn't be too difficult, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ren and Du meridians... Opening the Heavenly-Earth Bridge... That's a bit not mysterious enough. Let's call it the Heavenly-Earth Bridge, open the Heavenly-Earth Bridge, lay the foundation to control the mighty powers of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

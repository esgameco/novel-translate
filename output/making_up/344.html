        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd of martial artists watched with their mouths slightly twitching. This huge old tiger, as big as a small mountain, had a large gold chain around its neck. Its legs were slightly apart, standing on the ground, with its paws resting on the armrests of the chair.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were wide open, exuding an aura of might without anger.</p><p></p><p>There was an air of outlaw about it!</p><p></p><p>"Demonic King, why have you come to the arena of the clash of celestial talents?" the Sovereign of the Spirit Realm asked with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>"As the King, I have naturally come to participate in the clash of celestial talents. Since this is the clash of celestial talents in the Spirit Realm, how can my demonic clan be excluded?" the mighty voice of the Red Cat resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic King, you have quite a thick face. This is the clash of celestial talents, and you, at your age, still dare to participate?" the Sovereign of the Spirit Realm said, laughing bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"I, the King, have not yet reached thirty years since my birth. By age, I am also among the celestial talents!" the Red Cat said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned. This Demonic King was not yet thirty years old? Impossible!</p><p></p><p>"Master, is the Red Cat really not thirty years old?"Su Ling Xiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched as he said, "Possibly, it's true."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat they had caught in the mountains, although already an adult cat, might indeed not have reached thirty years old by now.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the Red Cat is also a celestial talent," Su Ling Xiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic King, don't joke around!" the Lord of the Thunder Cloud Sect said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Who's joking? My age is as I've said, and you can verify it. I have come today to participate in the clash of celestial talents!" the Red Cat snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was icy as he swept across the Spiritual Sect faction, saying, "What, do you look down on my demonic clan?"</p><p></p><p>Behind the Red Cat, a group of powerful demonic cultivators let out furious roars, indicating that if the Spiritual Sect did not allow the demonic clan to participate, they would cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Since the demonic clan is also a tribe of the Spirit Realm, they cannot be excluded. My Myriad Worlds Alliance has no objection," Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Spirit Realm's face was gloomy. The Demonic King's strength was extremely powerful, already surpassing the celestial talents. Could they really let it take the first place?</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Demonic King truly abides by the rules, there is no problem with him participating," the Great Zhou Emperor said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Red Cat successfully joined the competition.</p><p></p><p>After the arrangements were finalized, the figure of the Red Cat disappeared into the demonic clan camp and appeared on the Long Qing Pavilion's airship, meowing and currying favor with Li Xuan, its master.</p><p></p><p>"You are an interesting cat," Li Xuan smiled, tapping the Red Cat's head with his Jade Talisman.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's strength had already grown very powerful, having cultivated many Demonic King arts. If it were to fight the Sovereign of the Spirit Realm again, the Sovereign might no longer be the Red Cat's match.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tian Heng and his son arrived from the Cloud Sky Blue Sea City.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, looking at Xie Tian Heng's wife, Fu Yun, with some surprise in his heart, wondering how Xie Tian Heng had managed to marry Fu Yun back then in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun also curiously looked at Li Xuan a few times, wondering if this was the mysterious expert.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng also participated in the clash of celestial talents. There were some celestial talents from the Cloud Sky Blue Sea City this time, including Li Shao and Hai Bo'er.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Xu Xiong?" Xie Ling Feng asked after greeting Meng Chong and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The eldest brother hasn't returned yet, but he'll be back soon," Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The day of the clash of celestial talents had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A rainbow light flashed across the sky, illuminating the azure sea in a dazzling display, and several figures took their positions in the four directions.</p><p></p><p>"Today, the final battle of the clash of celestial talents has begun. The top hundred will receive one quota, the top ten will receive five quotas, and the top three will receive ten quotas.</p><p></p><p>"Do not ask what the quotas are for, you will know after the battle.</p><p></p><p>"The clash of celestial talents, life and death, victory and defeat are determined by the celestial talents themselves. In this battle, life and death cannot be avenged..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor announced the rules of the clash of celestial talents.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't the eldest brother returned yet?" Su Ling Xiu wondered.</p><p></p><p>"He's back," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>They looked up, and a faint blue light shot across the sky, and a figure descended onto the Long Qing Pavilion's airship.</p><p></p><p>In his palm, he was carrying a faint blue airship.</p><p></p><p>"Master, second brother, third sister... Xie Xiong!" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to the Mist State and learned that the battlefield was in the Rainbow State, so he had hurried back in time for the final battle.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Zhou Emperor announced the rules of the clash of celestial talents, he finally said, "The clash of celestial talents has begun. You can challenge according to the rankings, or you can directly challenge any celestial talent on the list."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a young man from the Thousand Martial Palace camp stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>He held a long sword, which was a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>As he stepped forward, spiritual light emerged from within him, merging with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and the aura of the laws of heaven and earth continuously converged upon him.</p><p></p><p>A Spiritual Body Celestial Talent!</p><p></p><p>This young man was clearly the true celestial talent of the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>"His strength is not weak!" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>As the Thousand Martial Palace's celestial talent stepped out, the other celestial talents all had solemn expressions. They had thought that Xu Yan would block the mountain gate and challenge them, and the Thousand Martial Palace had no celestial talent worthy of attention.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was such a powerful celestial talent, whose strength was definitely not inferior to the Thousand Martial Palace's master!</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Palace is indeed lucky this time!" the Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the Lord of the Cloud Sky Blue Sea City, Fu Tian Hai, nodded enviously, "Indeed, they have five core celestial talents, while we in the Cloud Sky City only have three."</p><p></p><p>"Does the Sea Spirit Tribe only have one?" the Great Zhou Emperor asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Only Hai Bo'er's bloodline is comparable to the Spiritual Body," Fu Tian Hai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think he will challenge?" the Great Zhou Emperor asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!" Fu Tian Hai smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor nodded. As the clash of celestial talents had just begun, the core celestial talent of the Thousand Martial Palace had come out, and he was definitely aiming for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this one also cultivated the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"How much chance do you think Xu Yan has?" the Great Zhou Emperor asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"You're asking the wrong question," Fu Tian Hai shook his head and smiled. "You should ask how many moves it will take for Xu Yan to defeat him!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor was stunned, looking at Fu Tian Hai in disbelief and exclaiming, "Is Xu Yan that strong in your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is the supreme in the way of the sword under the heavens, no need to doubt it!" Fu Tian Hai smiled and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Great Zhou Emperor and Fu Tian Hai, the other strong ones had also realized that the celestial talent of the Thousand Martial Palace was aiming for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan?"</p><p>"Has he come?"</p><p>"Of course he has come. In such a clash of celestial talents, as the one revered as the celestial talent of the Spirit Realm, how could he not come?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding youth walked to the center of the arena and coldly said, "I am Niu Qian Sheng of the Thousand Martial Palace. Where is Xu Yan? Come out and fight!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Concealed Genius?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked disappointed as he said, "Too weak."</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent was weak, he was very arrogant and confident. Since he had specifically called out Xu Yan, if Xu Yan didn't show up, wouldn't that make him look down on them? Xu Yan stepped forward, and his figure instantly appeared on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak. Have the Qianwu Hall send someone else... Forget it, all of you from the Qianwu Hall can come at me together."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed, full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan really lived up to his reputation. It had only been a few years, but he had become even more arrogant than when he had blocked the entrance of the Qianwu Hall.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even take the Qianwu Hall seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall's leader and the others had gloomy expressions. Xu Yan was too arrogant! "Xu Yan, don't try to use your eloquence. Back then, we were in seclusion cultivating, unable to respond. Otherwise, how could we have allowed your arrogance!"</p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng pointed his sword and coldly said, "You, Xu Yan, claim to be the supreme of the sword dao in the world. That's because you haven't met me yet. Today, I'll let you experience the true sword dao of the Qianwu Hall!"</p><p></p><p>All the Lingzong martial artists had a look of sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, the Qianwu Hall is above the Lingzong, how could they have been blocked at their door without a genius to fight back? It turns out they were in seclusion cultivation, unable to come out and fight."</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of the Qianwu Hall is extremely powerful, especially their sword dao, which is unparalleled. Xu Yan has finally met his match, let's see how he will still be so arrogant."</p><p></p><p>For the Lingzong martial artists, the Qianwu Hall was a lofty and supreme Lingzong sect. Their strength was deeply rooted, and if they were defeated by a scattered cultivator, they would be very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Niu Qiansheng's powerful display, they couldn't help but feel energized, about to witness the Qianwu Hall's grand display of might.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, had a disdainful expression as he shook his head, "The Qianwu Hall doesn't have the sword dao, only sword techniques. In front of me, your so-called sword dao is nothing but a facade.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, just look at the sword in your hand. Is it still your sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" </p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng raised his sword, and the sword qi surged, the power of the laws of heaven and earth converging, majestic and boundless.</p><p></p><p>The fierce sword light illuminated the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the core genius of the Qianwu Hall that we've heard about?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the spiritual body talent?"</p><p></p><p>Among the spectating martial artists, those who had refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, or even the aura of the laws of heaven and earth, were now exclaiming in amazement at Niu Qiansheng's display.</p><p></p><p>Even the elders of the Qianwu Hall were the same.</p><p></p><p>The power of the spiritual body, at this moment, they truly recognized its greatness.</p><p></p><p>The same in refining the laws of heaven and earth, the same in converging the power of the laws of heaven and earth, yet the power converged by the spiritual body was stronger and more smooth in its operation.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the power of the laws of heaven and earth could be wielded more freely.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of the Lingzong is for the sake of the spiritual body geniuses, to discover and cultivate the spiritual body geniuses. That's why they are called the Lingzong, but these scattered cultivators, the Wanshi Alliance, and even most of the Lingzong, don't know this."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai smiled, the secrets of the Lingzong all revolved around the spiritual body geniuses, existing to discover and nurture them.</p><p></p><p>"If the spiritual body genius of the Qianwu Hall were to perish, how do you think they would react?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Probably the Qianwu Hall would go mad," the Great Zhou Emperor thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Would the divine bridge be activated prematurely then?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai pondered and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. You know the divine bridge has a fixed time for activation, but there's also a temporary virtual bridge that can be opened to receive or summon the spiritual body geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"If the Qianwu Hall's spiritual body genius is killed, the Qianwu Hall will probably open a virtual bridge."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Then there will be a good show to watch."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, all the martial artists' gazes were focused. When Niu Qiansheng made his move, the momentum was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed and struck towards Xu Yan. </p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan remained calm and indifferent, not even drawing his sword, with one hand still behind his back, showing the utmost disdain towards Niu Qiansheng's attack.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't even entered the gate of the sword dao, yet you dare to wield a sword against me, the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and gestured with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom! To everyone's astonished gaze, the sword light that was originally striking towards Xu Yan stopped in its tracks, and then reversed, attacking Niu Qiansheng.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the sword in Niu Qiansheng's hand lost control.</p><p></p><p>It trembled, wavered, and then flew out of his hand, falling into Xu Yan's grasp.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" </p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng's expression was horrified.</p><p></p><p>The sword light swept towards him, but stopped in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the sword in his hand. Although it was a divine weapon, it was nothing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation in the dao of the sword, especially his understanding of the sword, Niu Qiansheng, who had not even entered the gate of the sword dao and not grasped the essence of the sword, how could he be qualified to wield a sword against Xu Yan? In a single thought, Niu Qiansheng's sword had become Xu Yan's sword!</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the realm of the mind, how could those who had not entered the gate of the sword dao understand?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is the Sword Immortal, even I would find it difficult to wield a sword against Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a clear sword heart and had grasped the essence of the sword, he would still find it difficult to strike against Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall's leader and the others suddenly stood up, their expressions filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng was already the number one in sword dao within the Qianwu Hall.</p><p></p><p>He was a spiritual body genius, yet he was not even a match for Xu Yan? "No, Xu Yan's sword dao is extremely peculiar. Any sword dao cultivator would find it difficult to defeat him!"</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall's leader said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no matter how unwilling he was, he had to admit that Xu Yan was indeed the supreme of the sword dao in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not continue his attack, his gaze turning towards the Qianwu Hall's side, directly throwing Niu Qiansheng's sword back.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a divine weapon, it was nothing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Qianwu Hall has always wanted to trample me, Xu Yan, under their feet and regain the face they lost back then. Today, I, Xu Yan, will give you an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"All of you from the Qianwu Hall can come at me together, not limited to just the geniuses."</p><p></p><p>With an indifferent tone, he spoke the most arrogant words.</p><p></p><p>Silence! All the martial artists were dumbfounded. Xu Yan's arrogance had always been legendary, but the legend was one thing, and seeing it with their own eyes was another.</p><p></p><p>One person challenging the entire Qianwu Hall? Not limited to the geniuses, which meant that all the powerful experts of the Qianwu Hall could join in?</p><p></p><p>Where did Xu Yan get the confidence?</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! All eyes turned towards the Qianwu Hall's side.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the Qianwu Hall's decision, whether to join forces to kill Xu Yan, or to send out an even stronger genius. Niu Qiansheng was obviously no longer an option, he couldn't even unleash a single move.</p><p></p><p>He was just a grand display of momentum.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall's leader and the others had gloomy expressions, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Join forces to attack? Although the Qianwu Hall was known as the most shameless Lingzong, it didn't mean they had no face at all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could boldly issue such a challenge, but the Qianwu Hall couldn't truly rush in with a swarm of attacks.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, where would the face of the supreme Lingzong be?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

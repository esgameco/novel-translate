        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The martial artists watched with twitching mouths as the giant tiger, as big as a small mountain, wore a large gold chain around its neck. Its legs were slightly spread as it stood on the ground, with its paws resting on the armrests of the chair. </p><p></p><p>Its eyes were wide open, exuding an intimidating aura without even being angry.</p><p></p><p>It had a roguish air about it!</p><p></p><p>"Great Demon King, why have you come to this place of competition for outstanding talents?" asked the Master of the Spirit Possession Palace with a dark expression.</p><p></p><p>"I have naturally come to participate in the competition for outstanding talents. Since this is a competition for outstanding talents in the spirit realm, how could we demons be excluded?" The Red Cat's majestic voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Great Demon King, you really have some nerve. This is a competition for outstanding young talents. How old are you now, old man? You have the audacity to participate?" The Master of the Spirit Possession Palace said with an angry laugh.</p><p></p><p>"From my birth until now, it has not yet been 30 years. Counting by age, I am also among the ranks of outstanding young talents!" The Red Cat said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Everyone was stunned. This Great Demon King was not yet 30 years old? Impossible!</p><p></p><p>"Master, is the Red Cat really not 30 years old?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched as he said, "It's possible that it really isn't!"</p><p></p><p>When he had caught the Red Cat in the mountains back then, although it was already a full-grown adult cat, counting from its birth until now, it probably really hadn't been 30 years!</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Red Cat to also be an outstanding young talent," Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Great Demon King, don't joke around!" said the Master of Thunder Cloud Manor sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Who's joking with you? My age can be easily verified. I came here today to participate in the competition for outstanding talents!" The Red Cat snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Its gaze was cold as it swept over the spirit sect's side, saying, "What's the matter? Do you look down on us demons?"</p><p></p><p>Behind the Red Cat, a group of powerful demons let out angry roars, as if ready to cause trouble if the spirit sect didn't allow demons to participate.</p><p></p><p>"Since demons are also part of the spirit realm, naturally they cannot be excluded. My Eternal Alliance has no objections," said Fang Hao with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Spirit Possession Palace had a gloomy expression. The Great Demon King was extremely powerful, already surpassing the level of outstanding young talents. Would they let it take first place?</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Great Demon King truly meets the rules, there's no harm in letting it participate," said the Great Zhou Emperor with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Red Cat successfully joined the competition.</p><p></p><p>After it was confirmed, the Red Cat's figure disappeared from the demon camp and appeared on the Changqing Pavilion's flying ship, meowing and trying to curry favor with its master Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite an interesting cat," Li Xuan said with a smile, tapping the Red Cat's head with his jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's strength was already very formidable, having cultivated many great demon techniques. If it were to fight the Master of the Spirit Possession Palace again, the latter probably would no longer be a match for the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" Xie Tianheng and his son arrived from Cloud Sky Azure Sea City.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, looking at Xie Tianheng's wife Fu Yun with some surprise, wondering how Xie Tianheng had managed to marry Fu Yun back when he was in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun also looked at Li Xuan curiously a few times, wondering if this was the mysterious expert.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also participated in the competition for outstanding talents. Cloud Sky Azure Sea City had brought some outstanding talents this time, with Li Shao and Hai Bo'er naturally among them.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Brother Xu?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously after catching up with Meng Chong and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother hasn't returned yet, but he should be back soon," Meng Chong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The day of the competition for outstanding talents arrived.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a beam of rainbow light stretching across the sky, illuminating the azure sea with a dazzling glow, several figures appeared in different directions.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the final battle of the competition for outstanding talents. Those who rank in the top 100 will receive one spot, those in the top 10 will receive five spots, and the top 3 will receive 10 spots.</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask what the spots are for. You will know after the final battle.</p><p></p><p>"In this competition for outstanding talents, life and death, victory and defeat are determined by the talents themselves. No revenge shall be sought for deaths in this battle..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor announced the rules of the competition.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't Big Senior Brother returned yet?" Su Lingxiu wondered.</p><p></p><p>"He's back," Li Xuan said calmly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>They looked up to see a pale blue light shooting across the sky, then a figure descended onto the Changqing Pavilion's flying ship.</p><p></p><p>In his palm, he held a pale blue flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Second Junior Brother, Third Junior Sister... Brother Xie!" Xu Yan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to Mist Province only to learn that the final battle location was in Rainbow Province, so he hurried back again, finally arriving just as the final battle was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Zhou Emperor finished announcing the rules of the competition, he finally said, "The competition for outstanding talents begins. You can challenge according to rankings, or directly challenge anyone on the list of outstanding talents."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a young man walked out from the Thousand Martial Temple camp.</p><p></p><p>He held a long sword in his hand, which was a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>As he stepped forward, spiritual light appeared within his body, merging with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, merging with the aura of the laws of heaven and earth. Strands of the power of heaven and earth's laws continuously gathered.</p><p></p><p>A spirit body outstanding talent!</p><p></p><p>This young man was clearly the true outstanding talent of the Thousand Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Not weak in strength!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>As the Thousand Martial Temple's outstanding talent walked out, the other outstanding talents all had solemn expressions. They had thought that after Xu Yan's challenge at their gates, the Thousand Martial Temple no longer had any outstanding talents worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, they had such a powerful outstanding talent. Judging by his strength, he was definitely not weaker than the Master of the Thousand Martial Temple!</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Temple has quite good luck this time!" The Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Fu Tianhai, the City Lord of Cloud Sky Azure Sea City, nodded enviously and said, "Indeed, they actually have five core outstanding talents. My Cloud Sky City only has three."</p><p></p><p>"The Sea Spirit Clan only has one?" The Great Zhou Emperor asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Only Hai Bo'er's bloodline is comparable to a spirit body," Fu Tianhai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think he will challenge?" The Great Zhou Emperor asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!" Fu Tianhai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor nodded. As soon as the final battle of the competition began, the Thousand Martial Temple's core outstanding talent had appeared. He was definitely aiming for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this one also practiced the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think are Xu Yan's chances of winning?" The Great Zhou Emperor asked after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"You're not asking the right question," Fu Tianhai shook his head with a smile. "You should ask, in how many moves will Xu Yan defeat his opponent!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor was stunned, looking at Fu Tianhai in disbelief, exclaiming, "Is Xu Yan so powerful in your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"In the world's sword dao, Xu Yan reigns supreme. There's no need for doubt!" Fu Tianhai smiled, saying nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan alone had suppressed the outstanding talents of the Azure Sea. Even Li Shao and Hai Bo'er together were no match for him. Compared to back then, Xu Yan must be even stronger now.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Great Zhou Emperor and Fu Tianhai, the other powerful figures also saw that the Thousand Martial Temple's outstanding talent was aiming for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Has he come?"</p><p></p><p>"He must have come. For such a battle of outstanding talents, he who claims to be the supreme outstanding talent of the spirit realm, how could he not come?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding young man walked to the center of the arena and said coldly, "Niu Qiansheng of the Thousand Martial Temple. Where is Xu Yan? Come out and fight!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Thousand Martial Temple's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A hidden prodigy concealing themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a disappointed look.</p><p></p><p>"Too weak."</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent was weak, they appeared very arrogant and confident. Since they had called him out by name, if he didn't show up, wouldn't that make people look down on him? Xu Yan took a step forward, instantly appearing in the battle arena.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak. Let your Thousand Martial Hall send someone else... never mind, all of you from Thousand Martial Hall can come at once."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed, speaking with utter disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>As expected of Xu Yan. It had only been a few years, but he was even more arrogant than when he had blocked Thousand Martial Hall's gates before.</p><p></p><p>He clearly didn't take Thousand Martial Hall seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master and others had gloomy expressions. This Xu Yan brat was too brazen! "Xu Yan, don't just show off with words. Back then we were in secluded cultivation and couldn't respond to your challenge. Otherwise, how could we have allowed your arrogance then!"</p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng pointed his sword and said coldly: "You Xu Yan claim to be the supreme swordsman in the world, but that's only because you haven't met me yet. Today, let me show you the true sword dao of our Thousand Martial Hall!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit realm martial artists all had looks of sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"I thought so. How could the transcendent Thousand Martial Hall have no prodigies to respond when Xu Yan blocked their gates? So they were in secluded cultivation and couldn't come out to fight."</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Martial Hall's martial arts are incredibly powerful, especially their sword techniques which are one of their specialties. Xu Yan has met his match now. Let's see how arrogant he can be."</p><p></p><p>For the spirit realm martial artists, Thousand Martial Hall was one of the lofty transcendent spirit sects. Their strength was deeply rooted in people's minds. If they were defeated by a rogue cultivator, it would be hard for them to accept.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing Niu Qiansheng's dominance, their spirits were lifted. They were about to witness Thousand Martial Hall display its might.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan had a look of disdain and shook his head: "Your Thousand Martial Hall has no sword dao, only sword techniques. Before me, your so-called sword dao is nothing but a show.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, just look - is the sword in your hand still your sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng raised his sword, sword energy crisscrossing, gathering the power of heaven and earth's laws, as if connecting heaven and earth, with an overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>Sharp sword light illuminated in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the rumored core prodigy of Thousand Martial Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of a spirit body talent?"</p><p></p><p>Among the watching martial artists, even those who had condensed spiritual energy or even the aura of heaven and earth's laws couldn't help but exclaim in admiration when they saw Niu Qiansheng make his move.</p><p></p><p>Even the elders of Thousand Martial Hall felt the same.</p><p></p><p>The might of a spirit body - only now did they truly recognize its power.</p><p></p><p>Although they both condensed the aura of heaven and earth's laws and gathered its power, the laws gathered by a spirit body were stronger and operated more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the power of heaven and earth's laws could be wielded at will.</p><p></p><p>"The purpose of spirit sects is for spirit body prodigies, to discover spirit body prodigies. That's why they're called spirit sects. These rogue cultivators, the Eternal Alliance, and even 99% of spirit sects don't know this point."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai smiled. The secrets of spirit sects all revolved around spirit body prodigies, existing to discover and nurture them.</p><p></p><p>"If Thousand Martial Hall's spirit body prodigy were to fall, what do you think would happen?" Fu Tianhai suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid Thousand Martial Hall would go mad," the Great Zhou Emperor said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Would that divine bridge be opened ahead of schedule?" Fu Tianhai pondered and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. You know the divine bridge has fixed opening times, but a temporary virtual bridge can be opened to bring spirit body prodigies away or invite respected beings to descend.</p><p></p><p>If Thousand Martial Hall's spirit body prodigy is killed, they would probably open a virtual bridge," the Great Zhou Emperor said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"As long as there's a good show to watch," Fu Tianhai said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, all eyes were focused. As soon as Niu Qiansheng made his move, it was an intimidating sight.</p><p></p><p>Sword light flashed in an instant, attacking towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan still had a calm expression. He hadn't even drawn his sword, and even had one hand behind his back, showing utter contempt for Niu Qiansheng's attack.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't even entered the gate of sword dao, yet you dare to use a sword before me, the Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and pointed forward with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom! To everyone's shock, the sword light that was attacking Xu Yan suddenly stopped in mid-air, then turned back to attack Niu Qiansheng.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying, the sword in Niu Qiansheng's hand lost control.</p><p></p><p>It trembled and shook, then flew out of his hand and into Xu Yan's grasp.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Niu Qiansheng's expression was one of horror.</p><p></p><p>The sword light swept towards him and stopped in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the sword in his hand. Although it was a divine weapon, it didn't impress him.</p><p></p><p>With his current level of martial arts, especially his cultivation in sword dao, how could Niu Qiansheng, who hadn't entered the gate of sword dao or comprehended sword intent, have the qualifications to use a sword against him? With a single thought, Niu Qiansheng's sword became his sword!</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the mind realm was not something those who hadn't entered the gate of sword dao could understand.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Sword God. Even I would find it difficult to use a sword against Xu Yan!" Xie Tianheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although he had achieved sword heart clarity and comprehended sword intent, and wouldn't be as pathetic as Niu Qiansheng, using a sword against Xu Yan would still be a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master and others suddenly stood up with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Niu Qiansheng was already the number one swordsman in Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>He was a spirit body prodigy, yet he wasn't even a match for one move from Xu Yan? "No, Xu Yan's sword dao is very strange. Any sword dao practitioner would find it hard to defeat him!" the Thousand Martial Hall Master said gravely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no matter how unwilling he was, he had to admit that Xu Yan was indeed supreme in the world's sword dao!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't continue to attack. He turned his gaze towards Thousand Martial Hall's side and threw Niu Qiansheng's sword back.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a divine weapon, it didn't impress him.</p><p></p><p>"Your Thousand Martial Hall has always wanted to trample me, Xu Yan, underfoot to regain your lost face. Today, I, Xu Yan, will give you a chance.</p><p></p><p>All of you from Thousand Martial Hall can come at once, not limited to prodigies."</p><p></p><p>He spoke the most arrogant words in the calmest tone.</p><p></p><p>Silence! All the martial artists were dumbfounded. There had always been rumors about Xu Yan's arrogance, but hearing rumors was one thing, seeing it with their own eyes was another.</p><p></p><p>One man challenging the entire Thousand Martial Hall? Not limited to prodigies meant that all of Thousand Martial Hall's experts could attack together?</p><p></p><p>Where did Xu Yan get such confidence from?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Everyone's gazes turned towards Thousand Martial Hall's side.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for Thousand Martial Hall's decision - would they attack together to kill Xu Yan, or send out stronger prodigies? Niu Qiansheng clearly wasn't up to the task, unable to even make a single move.</p><p></p><p>It only looked impressive on the surface.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master and others had extremely gloomy expressions, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Attack together? Although Thousand Martial Hall was renowned as the most shameless spirit sect, it didn't mean they had no face at all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could make outrageous challenges, but they couldn't actually swarm to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, where would the face of a transcendent spirit sect be?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

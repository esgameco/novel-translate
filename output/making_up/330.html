        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was on his way to Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, he wanted to see that gentle woman one last time, and he wanted to die outside the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The strange woman in the Quiet Snow Palace was too terrifying - he was even afraid to die within the Spirit Realm, fearing that even after death, she would still be able to find and crush him.</p><p></p><p>"You deceived me, you dared to deceive me, you deserve to die, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Crazed, furious, boundless hatred echoed through the Quiet Snow Palace mountains.</p><p></p><p>"I loved you so much, I liked you so much, I sacrificed so much for you, even though I absorbed some of your spiritual essence, you were happy too.</p><p></p><p>"Yet you deceived me, you tried to escape, I hate you, I hate you, you deserve to die, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>The ice and snow of the mountains where the Quiet Snow Palace was located were continuously melting. The black cave was slowly expanding, and the scarlet glow was gushing out more and more.</p><p></p><p>It did not seem very intense, yet the ice and snow were constantly melting.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what disaster the changes in the Ice State would bring. Even Mu Qianliu himself was unaware of the severity, as he saw it as nothing more than the Ice State being occupied.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Ice State could now be considered to have been occupied.</p><p></p><p>As long as one did not enter the Ice State, there would be no crisis. The Spirit Realm's eighteen states, including the Ice State, were not receiving much attention.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu's letter, due to his changed appearance, had not been taken seriously and took some time to reach the recipient, who was busy preparing to go to the Evergreen Pavilion and had not noticed the letter.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu and the others were still in the Great Zhou capital, and under Ziyun's guidance, they had gone to visit Prince Qing's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Prince Qing was overjoyed, never expecting that the Evergreen Pavilion had such a connection with Ziyun.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had sold Prince Qing a few pills, including one refined with the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity for Prince Qing, allowing him to greatly improve his strength in a short time, and his status as Prince Qing would also be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Prince Qing sighed inwardly, thinking that taking Ziyun as his adopted daughter was the best decision he had made in his life.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was preparing to set out and explore the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun was reluctant to part with him, wanting Meng Chong to stay, but she knew he would not listen to her, so she could only see him off with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan leisurely returned to the Evergreen Pavilion from the Imperial Treasure Vault of the Great Zhou, having seen the most core treasures there. The Great Zhou Imperial House was indeed comparable to a supreme spiritual sect, with many secrets and legends recorded, including the names of past renowned geniuses.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan was somewhat disappointed that he could not find the secret of the Divine Bridge, which was likely passed down only among the highest echelons, without being recorded in the Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu and the others returned to the Evergreen Pavilion, planning their next destination.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the crowd parted, and a graceful, beautiful woman with a majestic bearing approached, accompanied by two beautiful maids carrying boxes.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Crown Princess!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Princess of the Great Zhou, Xiang Wei, was once the dream goddess of countless geniuses in the Spirit Realm, who had tried their utmost to gain her favor. However, she suddenly decided not to marry, and there were even rumors that she had taken a lover, much to the resentment of those geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Wei had come to bid farewell, representing the Xiang family in establishing a friendship with the Pill Immortal Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He muttered.</p><p></p><p>A man with a gaunt figure, already in a critical condition, was silently standing in the queue.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu was indifferent to the surrounding noise, looking ahead. There were still more than ten people, and it would soon be his turn. He was not here to seek medical treatment, but to see Xiang Wei.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to go to the Inner Realm, but the gate to the Spirit Realm would not open unless he had a token from the Transcendent Sect. For this reason, he could only come to find Xiang Wei.</p><p></p><p>For Mu Qianliu, he did not want to see his lover in this state, but he had no choice but to come.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method of refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth was obtained from Xiang Wei.</p><p></p><p>"Has she seen the letter? "</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu wondered. If Xiang Wei had seen his letter, she should not be so calm and still have the mood to come to the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"I hope, other than her, no one else knows about me."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself silently.</p><p></p><p>He dared not mention the incident in Ice State to Xiang Wei, for fear that she would want to avenge him and get caught up in it.</p><p></p><p>That strange woman was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He even dared not die in the Spirit Realm, but wanted to die in the Inner Realm, to take a last look at that gentle woman, without disturbing her, lest he brings calamity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Mu Qianliu's turn.</p><p></p><p>He looked up, about to tell someone to inform Xiang Wei that an old friend had come to visit, but he was shocked to find that the one attending was - Meng Shushu!</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his eyes, even afraid that he was hallucinating or that it was just a similar appearance, but found that it was indeed Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu was excited, but also incredulous.</p><p></p><p>He did not know about the opening of the gate to the Spirit Realm, so he was so shocked to see Meng Shushu in the Spirit Realm. Could it be that the gentle woman was also here?</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was attending when he suddenly heard someone calling him, and the voice seemed somewhat familiar. He looked up puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In front of him stood a man with a gaunt figure, sunken cheeks, withered hair, and sunken eye sockets, as if he had been drained dry, almost like a mummy.</p><p></p><p>This injury had already damaged his source, and his source had even dried up.</p><p></p><p>It was more serious than the injury of Yue Changming back then, and what was more bizarre was that Meng Shushu always felt that this person seemed to have overindulged, directly emptying himself.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, who was this person? He did not know him.</p><p></p><p>And this person seemed very excited, which puzzled him. He looked carefully and vaguely saw a familiar outline.</p><p></p><p>"It's me, Shushu, is Waner here? How did you come to the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu asked in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression suddenly changed, his eyes widened, with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He could not associate this person with the graceful and handsome man he knew before.</p><p></p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p></p><p>However, the person in front of him was indeed the original Mu Qianliu!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Meng Shushu became furious. He pulled Mu Qianliu out of the Long Qing Pavilion and closed the consultation, using the formation that spread from the Long Qing Pavilion to envelop the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Qianliu, how dare you come?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu opened his mouth, but Meng Shushu did not let him explain, and angrily said, "I respected you so much, and Sister Su loved you so much, you said you had an urgent important matter, and you just left and never came back.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that everything you said was a lie, you deceived Sister Su's feelings.</p><p></p><p>"You are in the Spirit Realm, and you even have so many lovers, flirting all over the place, the famous playboy of the Mu family!</p><p></p><p>"What happened to you now? Have you played yourself to waste? Serves you right!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu became angrier and angrier, raining down a barrage of scolding.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu remained silent, and when Meng Shushu had finished scolding, he said painfully, "Yes, I hid the fact that I have many lovers, but there is one thing I did not lie about.</p><p></p><p>"Waner is indeed the one I love the most!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you say that? Mu Qianliu, you're talking nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was furious.</p><p></p><p>Another barrage of scolding, pouring out all the pent-up anger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"How is Waner doing?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu asked after he had finished scolding.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu fell silent, and after a long while, he said, "Sister Su has already passed away!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu's body swayed, grabbing Meng Shushu's arms and asking, "How could that be? How could Waner have passed away?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu gritted his teeth and said, "After Sister Su gave birth to Lingxiu, her body was severely depleted, and her health deteriorated, and she eventually passed away."</p><p></p><p>"What about the spirit medicines I gave? "</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu asked angrily.</p><p></p><p>"They were used up, otherwise how could Lingxiu have been born."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu fell silent, and the sunken eye sockets could not even shed tears.</p><p></p><p>"What about the old master?"</p><p></p><p>"He's dead! Killed by someone!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu was startled.</p><p></p><p>"It was the people of the Hidden Tower, and Lingxiu has already avenged him."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu briefly explained the whole story.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu's eyes suddenly flashed with anger, gritting his teeth and growling, "Tang Jinyan!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Lingxiu?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu suppressed the anger in his heart and asked in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about her, Lingxiu has caring teachers and senior brothers, a famous pill master, and is doing well. But your appearance has left me conflicted."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression was complex.</p><p></p><p>Should he tell Lingxiu that this is her biological father? Would Lingxiu's carefree and worry-free life still be the same?</p><p></p><p>"As long as she's doing well, as long as she's doing well, I, a damned person, won't bother her anymore."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then, he trembled as he took out a pale blue token from his pocket and handed it to Meng Shushu, saying, "This is the most precious thing in my life. I left the Inner Realm in a hurry because of this.</p><p></p><p>"Find an excuse to give it to Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, this token hides some unknown secrets, don't explore it rashly, when the right time comes, it will give a hint.</p><p></p><p>"Also, remember, remember, don't go to Ice State, don't go to Ice State at all costs. That is an extremely dangerous place.</p><p></p><p>"The current Ice State is no longer the original Ice State, remember!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu did not want to take the blue token, but seeing Mu Qianliu's current state and his pain, he still took it.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his instructions, Mu Qianliu was about to leave, but he turned back and said solemnly, "Shushu, remember not to mention me to anyone, treat this as if it never happened, and you've never seen me.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, no matter what, don't mention me, don't let anyone know that you've seen me, that you know me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was puzzled. What had Mu Qianliu encountered that made him so fearful?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

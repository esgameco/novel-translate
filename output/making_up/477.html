        <h1>Chapter 477</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds rolled, dragon might surged, and scarlet dragon eyes filled with violence and killing intent as the true dragon dove down to attack.</p><p></p><p>Although the Tai Miao Sect Master and others were exerting their full power, under such overwhelming dragon pressure, the aura around them was on the verge of collapse. Their eyes were filled with despair and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that by joining forces, they would still have some power to resist. </p><p></p><p>However, now facing the might of a true dragon head-on, they felt utterly powerless, realizing their own fragility and insignificance.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts trembled and their faces turned pale as the crisis of death descended upon them.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying were still hesitating, unsure what to do, their hearts extremely nervous. If they truly faced a life-or-death crisis, even if they didn't actively trigger the jade talisman, it would activate to protect them.</p><p></p><p>And would the final result be the true dragon getting killed as well?</p><p></p><p>Would they cause trouble for their senior and possibly incur Xu Yan's displeasure because of this?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a dragon's roar rang out.</p><p></p><p>This dragon's roar echoed through heaven and earth, a clear and resonant sound containing a sense of masculinity and majesty.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat different from the previous true dragon's voice.</p><p></p><p>But without a doubt, this dragon's roar was equally shocking, equally resounding through heaven and earth, stirring up wind and clouds with its majestic dragon might.</p><p></p><p>Another immense aura suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>This was a vast dragon's might, yet it was also different from the jade-white true dragon's aura.</p><p></p><p>A golden giant dragon suddenly appeared, blasting apart the thick dark clouds. Its masculine and fierce aura even melted away the icy cold!</p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon that had been diving down to attack suddenly raised its head to look at the suddenly appearing golden giant dragon. Even though it had lost its rationality, it seemed somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Roar! It then let out a dragon's cry that seemed angry, yet also confused, and even had an indescribable sense of astonishment?!</p><p></p><p>The Tai Miao Sect Master and others were stunned by now.</p><p></p><p>Where did this second true dragon come from?!</p><p></p><p>"Quickly retreat!" the Tai Miao Sect Master hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The group of Tai Miao Sect experts hastily withdrew their auras and frantically retreated backwards.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The jade-snow true dragon let out another roar at this moment, lowering its head to look at the fleeing Tai Miao Sect experts. With one dive, it attacked again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Tai Miao Sect experts realize in shock that the golden true dragon from earlier had already dissipated and disappeared!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the true dragon attacking again, despair reappeared on everyone's faces.</p><p></p><p>Only Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying had expressions of utter joy, their jade faces flushed red as they looked around eagerly, wanting to find that handsome and elegant figure.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, the golden giant dragon blasted through the dark clouds again, charging towards the jade-white true dragon and letting out a majestic dragon's roar.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon that was about to attack the Tai Miao Sect experts again paused in its movements, letting out an angry growl. It suddenly swiped out with a claw - bone-chillingly cold, lightning flashing, wind and clouds swirling - a fierce attack clawing towards the golden dragon!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon spiraled, spitting out a beam of light from its mouth. Its claws also swiped out, meeting the attack with a forceful and domineering strike.</p><p></p><p>Poof! However, as soon as the two attacks collided, the golden giant dragon's claws shattered and then dissipated.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Tai Miao Sect experts realized that the golden giant dragon was not a real true dragon, but some kind of powerful martial technique in dragon form.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone was puzzled as to why this dragon-shaped attack was so similar to a true dragon, and even exceeded their understanding of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Roar! At this moment, the true dragon's scarlet gaze looked beyond the dark clouds and let out an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Miao Sect experts frantically fled out from within the dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>And as they emerged from the clouds, they saw the person who had intervened from outside.</p><p></p><p>It was a handsome young man, with a wheel of swords revolving around him. His aura was incredibly powerful, and he even had a sharp edge about him like a peerless divine sword.</p><p></p><p>The moment they saw the young man, a name flashed through the minds of the Tai Miao Sect experts! Sword God Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were extremely excited at this moment, their gazes fixed intently on that figure.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth shook as the flawless jade-white true dragon spiraled out from the dark clouds, its raised head staring fiercely at that figure.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The dark clouds spun like a vortex, continuously rotating but also contracting. In the end, the clouds disappeared, leaving only a flawless jade-white true dragon coiled in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>However, the dragon's might was now even more substantial and more violent.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon's aura had also become somewhat stronger, as if it had been thoroughly enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?" The Tai Miao Sect Master's gaze turned towards Old Man Xiao not far away, secretly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Had this person been watching the battle the whole time earlier, prepared to sit by and watch as they were slaughtered by the true dragon?</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was dumbfounded by now. From the moment Xu Yan's figure appeared in the world, raising his hand to strike out a golden dragon that blasted into the dark clouds, he had been stunned.</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial technique was that? Striking out a true dragon?</p><p></p><p>If it were merely dragon-shaped palm power, there would be nothing special about it. Any expert with decent control over their power could shape it into a dragon form.</p><p></p><p>But such dragon-shaped palm power wouldn't increase the power, and because it was unnecessarily flashy, it would actually prevent one from displaying their true strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the golden giant dragon struck out by this youth was not simple dragon-shaped palm power, but like a real true dragon! Those majestic and awe-inspiring eyes, that overwhelming dragon might, that dragon form and dragon intent - although there were differences from a true dragon, it still belonged in the category of true dragons.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with this divine realm, how does it keep producing such freakish talents?" Old Man Xiao muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan could be considered half a freak of nature, with his almost ridiculous good fortune.</p><p></p><p>And then there were Meng Chong and Jiang Buping, freaks among freaks, making him wonder if the world was about to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>"This young man, he couldn't be here to subdue dragons, could he?" Old Man Xiao clicked his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>However, although Xu Yan's strength was formidable, especially the sharp might of his sword dao which was incredible, no matter how you looked at it, his strength was still weaker than this true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Snow True Dragon, it should be that old dragon's precious descendant, a freak of nature among true dragons, and because of the special nature of its true dragon power, it's even stronger than ordinary true dragons."</p><p></p><p>"For this young man to want to defeat a stronger opponent and subdue this true dragon, I'm afraid that's wishful thinking!" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao did not have high hopes for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's expression was extremely solemn, but also full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a true dragon, its strength is indeed incredibly powerful. Now that I've seen a true dragon with my own eyes, I can better sense the vastness of dragon might, which is extremely significant for my Dragon Subduing Palm."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Yan also discovered the differences and similarities between the dragon might and dragon intent of his Dragon Subduing Palm and those of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"My Dragon Subduing Palm is about to truly reach great completion. This is the palm technique for subduing dragons. Although my strength is weaker than hers, the Dragon Subduing Palm can still subdue her, for this is the palm that subdues dragons."</p><p></p><p>"Master said the Dragon Subduing Palm uses dragons to subdue dragons, so I need to make the Dragon Subduing Palm evolve and improve. I need to make the Dragon Subduing Palm imitate and even learn the true dragon's combat techniques, using true dragon techniques to subdue true dragons!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an epiphany at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He felt he had understood the essence of the Dragon Subduing Palm</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>True meaning.</p><p></p><p>"After subduing this dragon with my Dragon Subduing Palm, it will truly reach great accomplishment, even perfection!"</p><p></p><p>This referred to the great accomplishment or perfection of the Dragon Subduing Palm martial art as a whole, not just a single level of it.</p><p></p><p>After personally seeing a true dragon and engaging it, Xu Yan's Dragon Subduing Palm had already advanced to the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful experts of the Tai Miao Sect no longer planned to flee, but watched from afar. </p><p></p><p>"What realm is the Sword God Xu Yan actually in? Why is he neither in the Immortal realm nor the Heaven Unity realm, yet so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>While puzzled, the Tai Miao Sect Master and others were also extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Only by seeing with their own eyes could they understand that Xu Yan was even more powerful than the rumors suggested.</p><p></p><p>The most revered swordsman in the world, the name of Sword God was well-deserved!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was like a peerless divine sword, his brilliance fully revealed. This sword power had already surpassed their understanding, an unprecedented and unheard of sword technique!</p><p></p><p>Not just the Immortal Lords of the Tai Miao Sect, even Old Man Xiao was shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Is this swordsmanship?"</p><p></p><p>Such a sharp and brilliant sword technique was something he had never seen in his life.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The true dragon howled, its jade-white flawless body and crimson eyes looking at Xu Yan, its violent intent growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The true dragon suddenly attacked Xu Yan, raising a dragon claw and swiping forward. In midair, bone-chilling thunder appeared, as if freezing the void of heaven and earth, instantly clawing down towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A sword chime rang out, huge sword lights stood upright all around, with an imminent sense of annihilation. In an instant, the sword lights transformed into a sword formation, enveloping the true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>A layer of silvery-white light appeared on the jade-snow true dragon's body, as if its scales were covered by a layer of hard ice. It raised its claw and swiped, waves of ripples spread out, gathering wind and clouds to form a powerful defense.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In just a short time, the sword formation had collapsed. The true dragon dove out, its tail sweeping out, a freezing bolt of lightning like a sharp blade slashing diagonally.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The Yin-Yang Undying Sword was endlessly reborn, constantly cycling, but was also in the process of annihilation. Xu Yan's expression was solemn. The power of this true dragon technique was so strong that even his Yin-Yang Undying Sword could barely withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon immediately dove down, intending to rely on its powerful true dragon body to kill its enemy.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao's hearts were in their throats, staring intently. With each strike of the true dragon, the two women's nerves were taut.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Xu Yan's form instantly changed position, once again slashing out with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The true dragon, encountering an enemy it could not overwhelm for the first time, became increasingly agitated, its killing intent growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fought with the true dragon, observing its attacks and understanding its techniques. As the battle grew more intense, Xu Yan felt tremendous pressure.</p><p></p><p>If not for his ability to shift positions and his extreme speed, he likely would have already been defeated.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a true dragon, truly incredibly powerful. With my current level, it's ultimately too difficult to defeat a true dragon."</p><p></p><p>"However, to subdue the dragon, I'm not using swordsmanship, but the Dragon Subduing Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt it was about time to use the Dragon Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>"If Xu Yan is defeated, we'll flee immediately!" </p><p></p><p>The Tai Miao Sect Master said solemnly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The balance of power on the battlefield was already very clear - Xu Yan was at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>The other Tai Miao Sect experts all nodded.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't fled yet simply because they couldn't resist watching the Sword God battle a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Phew, I thought this young man might be able to subdue the dragon. Gave me quite a scare."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao also sighed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was ultimately no match for the true dragon.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true dragon's strength was inherently greater than his. For the weaker to fight the stronger, especially facing a true dragon, to be able to battle for so long was already enough to shock the world.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Xu Yan, whose sword power had been illuminating heaven and earth, suddenly had his sword aura disappear in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, flee quickly!" </p><p></p><p>The Tai Miao Sect Master's expression changed drastically as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they began to move, another majestic dragon aura suddenly appeared, upright and dignified, fierce and domineering, divinely imposing.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this dragon aura was even more pure.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, Xu Yan, will subdue the dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The Tai Miao Sect experts who were about to flee all looked towards the battlefield with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>A majestic dragon aura surged around Xu Yan's body, growing stronger and stronger, giving people a sense of uprightness, unrivaled dominance, and divine majesty.</p><p></p><p>It was as if his dragon aura was the pure dragon aura.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was also dumbfounded, even unconsciously rubbing his eyes, staring intently at Xu Yan again and again, confirming that this was indeed a person, not a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Golden dragons coiled around Xu Yan's body. He raised his hand and struck out, a golden dragon roaring forth, charging towards the jade-white true dragon. As soon as the golden dragon attacked, it raised its claw and struck out.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't seen with their own eyes that this golden dragon was struck out by Xu Yan, everyone would have mistaken it for a real true dragon!</p><p></p><p>Roar! The jade-snow true dragon let out a surprised and even more agitated roar, fiercely attacking the golden dragon. The two golden dragons fought together, but in an instant, the golden dragon was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as he struck out another palm.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, I'll use this true dragon to hone my Dragon Subduing Palm!"</p><p></p><p>A golden giant dragon charged towards the jade-white true dragon. The two dragons fought again, but in just a moment, the golden giant dragon was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, another golden giant dragon charged forth, fighting with the jade-white true dragon. At this moment, Old Man Xiao was shocked to discover that this golden giant dragon seemed more agile, and had imitated the true dragon's fighting style.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden giant dragon was unsurprisingly destroyed again, but as before, a new golden giant dragon appeared and fought once more.</p><p></p><p>Fighting again and again continuously, even the Tai Miao Sect Master and others noticed that as the golden giant dragons fought more and more times, their fighting style became more and more like the true dragon's.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the close combat similar, even the true dragon techniques were seven or eight tenths similar.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young figure on the battlefield, everyone was incomparably shocked.</p><p></p><p>The battle here attracted more and more martial artists. Even Immortal Lords from outside the Tai Miao Realm rushed over just to witness the true dragon battle.</p><p></p><p>The news that Sword God Xu Yan was subduing a dragon in the Tai Miao Realm spread like wildfire, shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>"Using a dragon to subdue a dragon, this is using a dragon to subdue a dragon. Subduing both the dragon's body and mind; attacking both its body and will... Today, I finally understand."</p><p></p><p>"This true dragon has lost its mind and reason. Attacking its mind is somewhat difficult, since it has already lost its reason and mind."</p><p></p><p>"But I can subdue its body and subdue its will!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die! All of you die!"</p><p></p><p>The jade-snow true dragon became more and more agitated, more and more angry, its eyes growing increasingly crimson.</p><p></p><p>Howling, it smashed the golden giant dragon and killed towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan clapped his hands together, his expression solemn. "Since one dragon can't subdue you, then two dragons, three dragons..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

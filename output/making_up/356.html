        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This is a speed-based divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Thunder Flash that Xu Yan cultivated was already an extremely powerful movement technique, with speed so fast it could transcend realms.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Divine Ability realm and given birth to the divine ability 'Traceless in a Thought'. You have obtained the divine ability 'Traceless in a Thought'!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, this was a speed-based divine ability. </p><p></p><p>Traceless in a Thought! In a single thought, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>"That's five divine abilities now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to observe, hoping in his heart that Xu Yan might unexpectedly give birth to a sixth divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The aura around Xu Yan continued to strengthen, then slowly subsided.</p><p></p><p>With this, Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Divine Ability realm was complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew his attention.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the Divine Ability realm and given birth to five divine abilities. How many would Meng Chong give birth to when he broke through? Li Xuan estimated that Meng Chong likely wouldn't be too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only given birth to three divine abilities when his physical body broke through to the Divine Ability realm, this was because he had already given birth to divine abilities before, so the number of new ones was reduced.</p><p></p><p>Besides Meng Chong, there was also Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very much looking forward to seeing what divine abilities Su Lingxiu would give birth to when she broke through to the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother has already broken through."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a shocked expression on his face. Facing his Senior Brother now, he felt as weak as an ant.</p><p></p><p>"The improvement from the Divine Ability realm is too strong."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed, then his whole body began to burn with excitement. He couldn't wait to accumulate enough foundation and break through to the Divine Ability realm himself.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that Senior Brother is no weaker than Mei Wu!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what divine abilities Senior Brother has given birth to."</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Divine Ability realm, Xu Yan's strength was incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>Even against the previous Mei Wu, Xu Yan would not fear at all.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner, providing a full English version of the Chinese text without summarizing or omitting any content.]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was the same for him. He stopped seeing patients and devoted all his thoughts to accumulating foundation, preparing to break through to the Mystical Power realm.</p><p></p><p>"I also need to break through to the Mystical Power realm soon. Within five years... ten years, I must break through to Mystical Power!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also motivated.</p><p></p><p>Even Meng Shushu, Shi Er, and Zhou Ying, though their abilities were low, were full of passion. For the sake of Mystical Power, they must work hard to cultivate!</p><p></p><p>"Is it too late to switch to cultivating martial arts now?" Yuer asked with an envious look.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late to switch now. We should just focus on improving our abilities quickly and hope we can cultivate Mystical Power," Du Yuying sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship stopped taking patients and floated aimlessly among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Everyone devoted themselves to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Xuan focused his attention on the great endeavor of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now that Xu Yan had broken through to the Mystical Power realm, the Mystical Power Martial Canon he had compiled could be put to use.</p><p></p><p>Although the compiled Mystical Powers were not yet sufficient, they could be used for now.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also consolidating his realm, organizing his martial arts, and comprehending Mystical Power. Li Xuan was in no hurry to pass on the Mystical Powers compiled in the Mystical Power Martial Canon.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and the opening of the Divine Bridge drew closer.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the Spirit Realm had basically been determined. The Eternal Alliance became the hegemon of the Spirit Realm, the status of independent cultivators was elevated, and great cities were established in the eighteen provinces.</p><p></p><p>Each great city began to set up teleportation arrays to facilitate travel for Spirit Realm martial artists and the exchange of resources.</p><p></p><p>The sky cave of the Blue Sea Black Pool was successfully sealed, preventing it from expanding further or causing disasters to the Blue Sea like the sky cave in the Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao occasionally returned to Changqing Pavilion to receive guidance from his master. His path of Qimen martial arts grew broader, and he was not far from condensing Mystical Power runes.</p><p></p><p>Notably, the Beast Clan was truly established, with Tianling Province becoming their territory.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat passed down the Great Beast martial arts, greatly enhancing the strength of the Beast Clan in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Spirit Realm, the Blue Sea belonged to the Sea Spirit Clan, while the Tianling Mountains were inhabited by the Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>In Changqing Pavilion, Xu Yan was reading through a small booklet containing Mystical Power martial arts given by his master, divided into Greater Mystical Powers and Lesser Mystical Powers.</p><p></p><p>Lesser Mystical Powers were more numerous, while there were only a few Greater Mystical Powers.</p><p></p><p>According to his master, this was part of the Mystical Power Martial Canon.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already comprehended two Lesser Mystical Powers suitable for himself. Although called Lesser Mystical Powers, their power was not weak.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest Mystical Power was still a Mystical Power!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very pleased. Although the Mystical Power Martial Canon was not yet complete and only a small part had been compiled, it was enough to meet Xu Yan's cultivation needs at this stage.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, Xu Yan had already cultivated two of the Lesser Mystical Powers from it.</p><p></p><p>"Although they are only Lesser Mystical Powers, their power is not weak. Greater Mystical Powers are indeed a bit more difficult, but it's just a matter of spending more time to comprehend them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's only regret was that he had not yet compiled Mystical Powers like Blood Rebirth or White Bone Transformation. He needed to further improve and elevate the level of Mystical Powers.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat, the Great Beast King, had returned to Changqing Pavilion a few days ago and was trying to curry favor every day.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, your Great Beast Mystical Power is still lacking. You need to work harder," Li Xuan said, tapping Red Cat's head with the jade ruyi in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was still some distance from developing a Great Beast Mystical Power and needed to make double the effort.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat nodded, finished acting cute in front of its master, then went to familiarize itself with Xu Yan, who was after all the Beast Clan's supreme being and one of its backers.</p><p></p><p>As for Shi Er, he could only groom and massage it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was speechless. This big cat was truly clever.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu are also close to breaking through to the Mystical Power realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Once Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu broke through, he would gain new Mystical Powers and his strength would further increase.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of being invincible is truly wonderful."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan also knew that there were still very powerful beings in the Taicang world. The Immortal Venerable was definitely not the strongest.</p><p></p><p>He could crush the Immortal Venerable, but he was definitely no match for the master of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't get too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>He had to stay steady and low-key, and not get carried away.</p><p></p><p>Only after truly transcending heaven and earth would he have the confidence to defeat the master of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicang Book was left in the borderlands. Perhaps the master of this book has already perished?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship was drifting towards Jade Province.</p><p></p><p>There was only half a year left until the Divine Bridge opened. The next stage of the martial path would be to cross to the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>This departure meant not knowing when they would return.</p><p></p><p>So it was time to return to the Inner Realm, or rather the Great Wilderness, for a look.</p><p></p><p>"This time returning to the Great Wilderness, I should travel more and see more. Perhaps there will be some discoveries," Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Why would a supreme treasure like the Taicang Book, which recorded the laws and principles of the Taicang world, appear in the borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"The sky caves, holes in heaven and earth, come from enemies beyond the sky. The Taicang world must have encountered something in the past to result in the current separation of Inner Realm and Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship had already drifted to Luo Province, not far from Jade Province.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's aura surged. He had finally accumulated sufficient foundation and was ready to break through to the Mystical Power realm.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship stopped among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to break through to the Mystical Power realm!" Meng Chong was excited.</p><p></p><p>What Mystical Power would he develop? Once he entered the Mystical Power realm, he could cultivate the Mystical Power Martial Canon from his master.</p><p></p><p>Among the clouds, Meng Chong was breaking through to the Mystical Power realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"The Indestructible Golden Body of the Great Sun at the Mystical Power realm can transform into an eighteen-zhang golden body, a true small giant. When using Mystical Powers, the strength of the physical body martial arts is fully displayed."</p><p></p><p>At this stage of the Mystical Power realm, the formidable nature of physical body martial arts was further revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, cultivating the martial arts method you compiled, breaks through to the Mystical Power realm. Your physical body strength increases a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao arrived.</p><p></p><p>With his physical strength increased a hundredfold, Li Xuan was excited. He clenched his fist, feeling that he could crush the Immortal Venerable with just his physical body alone.</p><p></p><p>"Can't get carried away. My physical body martial arts are currently only at the first level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, merely at the Divine Appearance realm. Although increased a hundredfold, it would still be a bit strenuous to crush the Immortal Venerable with just physical strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmed his inflated heart and continued to stay steady. He couldn't get carried away.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, breaking through to the Mystical Power realm, undergoes ultimate transformation into Golden Vajra Sacred Bones. You obtain Innate Mountain River Golden Vajra Sacred Bones."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's transformation during his breakthrough was all within expectations. Li Xuan was no longer excited about this.</p><p></p><p>Based on previous experience, when Su Lingxiu broke through and underwent ultimate transformation into Sacred Bones, he would receive feedback of Innate Indestructible Sacred Bones.</p><p></p><p>"What Mystical Power will Meng Chong develop? Will it be something like Rebirth in One Thought? This Mystical Power unique to physical body martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched Meng Chong's breakthrough with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The first Mystical Power was about to be born.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

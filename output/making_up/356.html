        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is a speed-type divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Thunder Flash that Xu Yan cultivated was already incredibly powerful in terms of movement technique, with a speed that could transcend realms.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the divine ability realm and attained the divine ability 'Disappearance in a Thought'. You have gained the divine ability 'Disappearance in a Thought'!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, this was a speed-type divine ability. </p><p></p><p>Disappearance in a Thought! In the blink of an eye, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>"Five divine abilities now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to observe, feeling somewhat expectant - would Xu Yan unexpectedly give rise to a sixth divine ability?</p><p></p><p>The aura around Xu Yan kept intensifying, then gradually receded. </p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Yan's breakthrough to the divine ability realm was complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned his attention back. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the divine ability realm and attained five divine abilities. How many divine abilities would Meng Chong attain upon his own breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Although when Li Xuan had broken through to the divine ability realm in the martial dao, he had only given rise to three divine abilities, this was because he had already possessed divine abilities beforehand, so the number he could newly attain was reduced.</p><p></p><p>Besides Meng Chong, there was also Su Lingxiu. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very curious to see what divine abilities Su Lingxiu would give rise to upon her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"The senior disciple has already broken through."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a look of shock on his face, now feeling utterly insignificant before his senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The advancement to the divine ability realm is too powerful."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed, his blood boiling with the desire to quickly accumulate his foundation and break through to the divine ability realm himself.</p><p></p><p>"I feel the senior disciple won't be weaker than the Bewitching Witch."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what divine abilities the senior disciple has attained."</p><p></p><p>After entering the divine ability realm, Xu Yan's strength was incomparable to before. Even the former Bewitching Witch held no fear for him now.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the clouds, Xu Yan vanished in an instant. Before Meng Chong and the others could react, there was suddenly another person beside them - Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Senior disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly shocked, his senior disciple had suddenly appeared without him even sensing it.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. </p><p></p><p>"Only by breaking through to the divine ability realm can one truly comprehend the wondrous nature of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the divine ability realm, he finally understood that the true strength and profundity of the martial dao lay in the divine abilities. The cultivation before the divine abilities was merely the foundation, the preparation for attaining the divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>And the divine abilities were just the starting point of a new path in the martial dao. The martial dao was boundless! Now Xu Yan grasped this meaning more deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Senior disciple, what divine abilities have you attained?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I've only attained five divine abilities, nothing too impressive."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. </p><p></p><p>He looked towards his master, wondering what his master thought of his attainment of five divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, giving a middling evaluation. He couldn't let his disciple get complacent - he had to always make Xu Yan feel his performance wasn't good enough, so that he would strive even harder.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt relieved, but also a bit disappointed. </p><p></p><p>"I'm still quite far from the level my master was at back then. At least I didn't disappoint him too much!"</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's heart, his master's neutral evaluation meant he hadn't completely failed, but also hadn't reached the heights his master had.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to work harder, strive to reach at least half of what my master accomplished in the next realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan inwardly resolved.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt great pressure - his senior disciple was so strong, yet only received a "not bad" evaluation from their master. He would have to redouble his efforts.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he might not even get a "not bad" evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior disciple, please demonstrate your divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu called out excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, and in an instant, Su Lingxiu and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion remained the Long Qing Pavilion, yet it seemed to be in a completely different world, with a sense that it could be annihilated at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is my sword dao divine ability, 'Sword Encompassing Mountains and Rivers'. Within my sword, the mountains and rivers exist, life and death are in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Disciples like Dyu Yuying and Yun Miaoiao who cultivated the Vast Martial Dao were greatly shocked - the divine abilities were truly wondrous and inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The power of the divine abilities exceeded all imagination!</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi's expression was grave. She knew her own strength was near the limits of the Spirit Realm, yet faced with this divine ability, she had no resistance at all. </p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan hadn't reminded them, if they hadn't known in advance that Xu Yan would unleash a divine ability, they might not have even realized they had already entered his divine ability.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan withdrew his divine ability, two sword lights appeared around him, constantly rotating.</p><p></p><p>"Sworn brother, attack me with your full strength!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood with his hands clasped behind his back, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Golden light surged from Meng Chong's body as he unleashed a powerful thunderous fist strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This was Meng Chong's full-force punch, shocking Cai Lingyi and the others with its ferocious power.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this punch, Cai Lingyi couldn't help but sigh that she would be unable to withstand such a violent attack.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>However, this violent punch entered the whirlpool of sword lights surrounding Xu Yan, as if it had entered a vortex. It didn't harm Xu Yan, and the power of the punch didn't dissipate either.</p><p></p><p>"Sworn brother, continue!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained standing with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong unleashed punch after punch, over twenty in the blink of an eye. </p><p></p><p>These powerful, violent punches seemed to enter a vortex of sword lights, with no effect.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is my other sword dao divine ability, 'Yin Yang Inextinguishable Sword'!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, and with a single thought, the sword lights rotated, and a terrifyingly powerful thunderous fist strike shot out into the air. </p><p></p><p>This fist strike contained the accumulated force of Meng Chong's twenty-plus punches - its power was so great that even Meng Chong would be unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>That's why Xu Yan had directed it into the air.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wiped the sweat from his brow, utterly shocked. The combined force of his twenty-plus punches had been gathered into a single strike of such astonishing power.</p><p></p><p>"This sword dao divine ability is too strong."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Meng Chong understood the incredible power of this divine ability of his senior disciple's. </p><p></p><p>It could return the enemy's attacks, and if faced with a group assault, it could even redirect the enemies' attacks to strike each other.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Yang Inextinguishable Sword, yin and yang never extinguished, endlessly cycling.</p><p></p><p>"I must cultivate, I must break through to the divine ability realm as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the power of the divine abilities, Meng Chong's blood burned with excitement, eager to quickly accumulate his foundation and break through.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine abilities will my martial dao of the physical body give rise to?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He left to cultivate, determined to break through to the divine ability realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was the same, he no longer accepted patients, as all his thoughts were focused on accumulating his foundation, preparing for the breakthrough to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to break through to the Divine Realm as soon as possible, within five years... ten years, I must break through to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also stimulated.</p><p></p><p>Even Meng Shushu, Shi Er, and Zhou Ying, although their strength was low, were filled with passion. For the sake of the Divine Realm, they must diligently cultivate! "Is it too late to switch to cultivating the Martial Dao now?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked at them enviously.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late to switch now, we can only focus on quickly improving our strength, hoping to cultivate the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Qingcheng Pavilion airship no longer accepted patients, but instead drifted in the clouds above.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had immersed themselves in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Xuan had devoted his thoughts to the great cause of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the Divine Realm, and the Divine Martial Classics he compiled could now be put to use.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Realms he had compiled were not enough, they could still be temporarily used.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also consolidating his realm and refining his own Martial Dao, comprehending the Divine Realms. Li Xuan was also not in a hurry to pass on the Divine Realms he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and the opening of the Divine Bridge was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>The pattern of the Spiritual Realm had basically been determined. The Wanshi Alliance had become the overlord of the Spiritual Realm, the status of the scattered cultivators had been elevated, and large cities had been established in the Eighteen States.</p><p></p><p>Each large city began to set up transmission formations, convenient for the movement of Spiritual Realm cultivators and the exchange of resources.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave in the Black Abyss of the Cyan Sea had been successfully sealed, and would not continue to expand or cause a disaster like the Ice State Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao occasionally returned to the Qingcheng Pavilion, receiving guidance from his master. The path of the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao was becoming wider and wider, and the refinement of the Divine Runes was not far away.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that the Demon Clan had truly established itself, and Tianliang State had become the territory of the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat passed down the Great Demon Martial Dao, causing the strength of the Demon Clan to increase greatly in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Spiritual Realm, the Cyan Sea belongs to the Sea Spirit Clan, while the Tianliang Mountains are the dwelling place of the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingcheng Pavilion, Xu Yan was flipping through a small booklet, which contained the Martial Dao Divine Realms given to him by his master, divided into Greater Divine Realms and Lesser Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Divine Realms were more numerous, while the Greater Divine Realms were only a few.</p><p></p><p>According to his master's explanation, this was a part of the Divine Martial Classics.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already comprehended two Lesser Divine Realms that were suitable for himself, and although they were called Lesser Divine Realms, their power was not weak.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest Divine Realm is still a Divine Realm! Li Xuan was very pleased, although the Divine Martial Classics were not yet complete, with only a small part compiled, it was enough to meet Xu Yan's cultivation needs at this stage.</p><p></p><p>It had been such a short time, and Xu Yan had already cultivated two of the Lesser Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Although they are just Lesser Divine Realms, their power is not weak. The Greater Divine Realms are indeed more difficult, but it's just a matter of spending more time on comprehension."</p><p></p><p>What Li Xuan regretted was that he had not yet compiled Divine Realms like Blood Rebirth and Bone Transformation, and needed to further improve and raise the level of the Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat, the Demon King, had returned to the Qingcheng Pavilion a few days ago and was constantly currying favor.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, your Demon Divine Realm is still lacking, try harder."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tapped the Red Cat's head with the jade talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat still lacked something to give birth to the Demon Divine Realm, and needed to redouble its efforts.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded, displayed its cuteness in front of its master, and then went to get close to Xu Yan, as he was the Demon Clan's supreme being and one of its pillars.</p><p></p><p>As for Shi Er, it could only be assigned to groom and massage him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was speechless, this big cat was truly clever.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu are also about to break through to the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Once Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu broke through, he would gain new Divine Realms, and his strength would further increase.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of being invincible is truly wonderful."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan also knew that the Great Heavenly Earth still had very powerful existences, and the Immortal Venerable was definitely not the strongest.</p><p></p><p>He could defeat the Immortal Venerable, but he was absolutely not a match for the owner of the Great Heavenly Book.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could not be too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>He must remain stable and survive, not become complacent.</p><p></p><p>Only after truly transcending the Heavens and Earth would he have the confidence to defeat the owner of the Great Heavenly Book.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Heavenly Book was lost in the Borderlands, perhaps its owner has already perished?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Qingcheng Pavilion airship was drifting towards Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>There was only half a year left before the Divine Bridge opened, and the next path of the Martial Dao would be to go beyond the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not know when he would return.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he should go back to the Inner Realm, or even the Great Wilderness, to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"This time when I return to the Great Wilderness, I should walk around more and see if I can make any discoveries."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Why would the Great Heavenly Book, such a precious treasure that recorded the laws and principles of the Great Heavenly Earth, appear in the Borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Cave, the hole in the Heavens and Earth, came from an enemy from outside the Heavens. The Great Heavenly Earth must have encountered something, causing the separation of the Inner Realm and the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Qingcheng Pavilion airship had drifted to Luozhou, not far from Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's aura surged, he had finally accumulated a complete foundation and was ready to break through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The airship stopped in the clouds above.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to break through to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>What new Divine Realm would he give birth to? After entering the Divine Realm, he could cultivate the Divine Martial Classics his master had compiled.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, Meng Chong was in the process of breaking through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body of the Divine Realm can transform into an eighteen-zhang golden body, a true small giant. When using Divine Realms, the invincibility of the Martial Dao physique will be fully displayed."</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Realm stage, the might of the Martial Dao physique would be further revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, cultivating the Martial Dao methods you compiled, has broken through to the Divine Realm, and his physical strength has increased a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book came.</p><p></p><p>A hundredfold increase in physical strength, Li Xuan was extremely excited, clenching his fists, feeling that with just his physical strength, he could crush the Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I can't be complacent, my Martial Dao physique is currently only at the first layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body, just at the Divine Manifestation Realm. Although it has increased a hundredfold, to rely solely on physical strength to crush the Immortal Venerable would still be a bit difficult."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmed his swelling heart and remained steadfast, not allowing himself to become complacent.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, upon breaking through to the Divine Realm, has undergone the ultimate transformation and metamorphosed into the Sacred Bone of the Golden Immortal. You have obtained the Primordial Mountain and River Golden Immortal Sacred Bone."</p><p></p><p>The transformation of Meng Chong during his breakthrough was within Li Xuan's expectations, and he was no longer excited about it.</p><p></p><p>According to his previous experience, when Su Lingxiu broke through, she would undergo the ultimate transformation and metamorphose into the Sacred Bone, and he would receive the feedback of the Primordial Indestructible Sacred Bone.</p><p></p><p>"What Divine Realm will Meng Chong give birth to? Will there be something similar to the One Thought Rebirth Divine Realm? This is a Divine Realm unique to the Martial Dao physique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched expectantly as Meng Chong was in the midst of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The first Divine Realm was about to be born.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan emerged from the ruins of the Heavenly Cave and began to organize his insights into the Dao of Breaking the Void. By now, he had almost finished organizing them.</p><p></p><p>The insights into Breaking the Void gradually became clear to him - how to step from the Divine Manifestation Realm into the Breaking the Void Realm, and how to possess the power to Break the Void.</p><p></p><p>From the insights gained in the small Heavenly Cave of the Cyan Sea's Black Pool, to the insights gained in the Ice State's Heavenly Cave, he had comprehended how to pierce the heavens and earth, how to break open the void of heaven and earth, how to not be constrained by the space of heaven and earth, and how to not be bound by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, a clear path had already emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Dao techniques of the Breaking the Void Realm were gradually revealed - the first step of transcending heaven and earth had been opened.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Dao techniques of Breaking the Void that you compiled. You have broken through to the Breaking the Void Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not have to wait long, the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Breaking the Void Realm! Boom! In that instant, the Dao techniques of Breaking the Void appeared in his mind, and the profundities of the Breaking the Void Realm were also revealed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the heavens and earth appeared different in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in a single thought, he could cross the void and reach the other end of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth, the Dao of heaven and earth, all appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not transcend heaven and earth, he was no longer constrained by the space of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With a single punch, he could traverse space!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Breaking the Void Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. Only after truly breaking through did he deeply understand the power of the Breaking the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he had compiled it himself and thought it was already very powerful, but after the breakthrough, he realized that the true Breaking the Void Realm was far beyond his simple description.</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities are even stronger!"</p><p></p><p>What terrifying power would the divine abilities of the Breaking the Void Realm possess? Li Xuan could hardly imagine it.</p><p></p><p>"Can I punch and destroy an Immortal Venerable with one blow?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan's confidence surged, and he itched to find an Immortal Venerable to fight.</p><p></p><p>Raising his head to look towards the Inner Realm, the barrier between the Spirit Realm and the Inner Realm now clearly appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I see now!"</p><p></p><p>The barrier between the Inner Realm and the Spirit Realm was formed by the laws of heaven and earth, like a grid self-formed by the Great Heavens.</p><p></p><p>And the gate of the Spirit Realm was the door formed by the laws. By following certain methods, the power of the laws could be dispersed, and the door would naturally open.</p><p></p><p>"And how is it to cross the Divine Bridge? Is the Divine Bridge also formed by the laws of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Great Heavens Book, the Dao principles now became easier to remember.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, only by advancing one's realm can one more easily remember and comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly exhilarated. He had broken through to the Breaking the Void Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The next realm should also be prepared. Xu Yan is not far from the Divine Abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a while. After breaking through the Breaking the Void Realm, he had more ideas about the cultivation of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, the higher the realm, the clearer the direction of Dao cultivation, and the easier it would be to compile even stronger Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and had a general direction for the upcoming Dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He should compile the Dao realms after the Breaking the Void Realm, as well as the subsequent cultivation of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>The further development of the Mysterious Gate Dao should also be compiled, although the direction of the Mysterious Gate Dao had already been determined, new ideas could be added to explore the path of the Mysterious Gate Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Dao should also be pondered upon when time allows."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities compiled in the Divine Abilities Canon are still not enough, the next effort should be focused on the Divine Abilities Canon, including how to cultivate divine abilities using the Unperishing Qi."</p><p></p><p>After determining the direction and goals, Li Xuan, while seemingly carefree, was actually busy at work.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the situation in Cloud State gradually stabilized. A huge lake appeared in the center of Cloud State, with the former mountains now becoming islands on the lake. This huge lake was named Cloud State Heaven Lake.</p><p></p><p>As the waters of Cloud State converged into the Heaven Lake, the ruined great cities were revealed, in a miserable state.</p><p></p><p>In this great calamity, the casualties in Cloud State were beyond count. The Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families of Cloud State suffered heavy losses, and the pattern of the Spirit Realm had also changed, no longer under the firm control of the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Many new great cities were established in Cloud State, and cultivators from other states also began to settle down in Cloud State.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the Myriad Worlds Alliance and the Transcendent Spiritual Sect was still ongoing, but a general consensus had been reached - the status of the unaffiliated cultivators had been elevated, on par with the Spiritual Sect cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The order, or rules, of the Dao cultivation world of the Spirit Realm was still being formulated.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had set out to the Cyan Sea's Black Pool to seal the Heavenly Cave there.</p><p></p><p>The Long Green Pavilion's flying ship was drifting on the Cloud State Heaven Lake, with a long queue of people waiting every day to seek medical treatment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was accumulating his foundation, preparing to break through to the Divine Abilities Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu were doing the same, though they still lacked sufficient foundation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu was finally about to break through to the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Zhou Ying were envious, but they were also close to breaking through to the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although breaking through to the Divine Will Realm would greatly increase their strength, in the Spirit Realm, it was still insignificant, far from being able to compare to Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was compiling the Divine Abilities Canon, racking his brain for the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>And the powerful cultivators of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect had begun their preparations and were waiting for the Divine Bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, your Heart Sword Realm is perfected, and your Wise Sword Realm has made progress."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally perfected the Heart Sword Realm and was one step closer to the Wise Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao realms after the Wise Sword Realm should also be prepared."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the Great Dao Golden Book brought more feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the cultivation direction of the Bright Saber Realm, and has awakened to the path of the Bright Saber Realm, entering the Bright Saber Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, the Saber Dao had also been elevated.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong has finally found the cultivation path of the Bright Saber Realm, it was not easy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Saber Dao realm had broken through to the Mastery of the Hidden Saber.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall enter the Divine Abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was calm, but his heart was somewhat excited. Finally, he had accumulated enough foundation to break through to the Divine Abilities Realm. Upon entering the Divine Abilities, how powerful would he become?</p><p></p><p>The Long Green Pavilion temporarily stopped receiving patients, and the flying ship rose into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the clouds, with a divine light emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>His aura was growing stronger, the divine light shining in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Abilities Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed, Xu Yan was about to break through to the Divine Abilities Realm, which was still too far away for him. He was only at the initial stage of the Divine Source Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also had an expectant expression. Upon breaking through to the Divine Abilities Realm, what divine abilities would Xu Yan manifest? Sword Dao divine abilities were sure to appear, and perhaps more than one.</p><p></p><p>"How many divine abilities will Xu Yan manifest upon breaking through to the Divine Abilities Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Divine Abilities Realm, the self-manifested divine abilities would continue to improve with the advancement of the realm, without any upper limit. They could be called the cultivator's innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities cultivated through practice were different from the self-manifested ones in certain aspects.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to break through to the Divine Abilities Realm, on the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above, the wind and clouds were surging, and even before breaking through, there was already a powerful momentum gathering.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's thoughts moved, and all the commotion of the breakthrough was sealed.</p><p></p><p>"What divine abilities will the senior brother cultivate?" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It must be a very powerful divine ability," </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine abilities are you talking about?" </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, and the others also looked over, as they had never seen the divine abilities of the martial dao before. The martial dao they cultivated did not have the concept of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they must be extremely powerful!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun rolled her eyes, as that was just stating the obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities are countless, with varying degrees of strength," </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, can we cultivate divine abilities as well?" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It depends on your own comprehension," </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not give a definitive answer.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Du Yuying and the others were intrigued. If they could also cultivate divine abilities, wouldn't their strength be even greater? However, divine abilities were no small matter, being the core cultivation methods of the martial dao, so they did not dare to ask directly for the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>They could only wait for a suitable opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"He's about to break through!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became excited, "I wonder how Xu Yan will transform after breaking through the divine ability realm?"</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, divine light was gathering around Xu Yan, gradually contracting within his body, and a more mysterious radiance was faintly visible within.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, cultivating the martial dao you compiled, has broken through the divine ability realm, and your divine ability power has increased a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Dao Scriptures of Immortality came.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Venerable, which of my divine abilities can the Immortal Venerable take on?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited, as his divine abilities were already incredibly powerful, and with a hundredfold increase in power, even the Immortal Venerable would be easily defeated by a single divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"I shall continue to be invincible!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt extremely satisfied, as the joy of increasing one's strength was indeed the greatest pleasure in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, during his breakthrough to the divine ability realm, has reached the utmost state of refinement and transformed into a Saint Bone of the Mountains and Rivers. You have obtained the Innate Saint Bone of the Mountains and Rivers!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt a sense of sacred radiance, and the image of the mountains and rivers appeared within his body, with a profound and sacred meaning permeating.</p><p></p><p>It was as if with a single thought, the mountains and rivers could be manifested from within.</p><p></p><p>"The Saint Bone of the Mountains and Rivers!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited, as Xu Yan's next level of breakthrough would surely be to become a Saint Body.</p><p></p><p>"I roughly understand now, and as he continues to transform, what kind of constitution will he become?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>"It should be time for him to give birth to a divine ability, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently observed Xu Yan's breakthrough, and at this moment, a divine ability would surely be born.</p><p></p><p>A sword light appeared on Xu Yan's body, and the mountains and rivers enveloped him, turning the surrounding area into mountains and rivers in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Only the mountains and rivers could be seen, and not a single person.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the divine ability realm and given birth to the divine ability 'Sword Containing the Mountains and Rivers'. You have obtained the divine ability 'Sword Containing the Mountains and Rivers'!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's first divine ability was indeed related to the sword dao, as expected.</p><p></p><p>Sword Containing the Mountains and Rivers!</p><p></p><p>"It's similar to the Sword Containing the Cosmos, just a little weaker, but still very powerful," </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's divine ability was in line with Li Xuan's expectations, as the Mountains and Rivers Sword Dao was Xu Yan's own comprehension of the sword dao, so it was only natural for it to manifest as a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's martial dao comprehension, the Mountains and Rivers Sword Dao can continue to be strengthened, which means that the Sword Containing the Mountains and Rivers divine ability will also be continuously enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, knowing that Xu Yan's keen insights would undoubtedly lead to the continuous improvement of his sword dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers disappeared, and Xu Yan's figure reappeared, and then two mysterious sword lights surged forth from within him.</p><p></p><p>"Another sword dao divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had given birth to a second sword dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the divine ability realm and given birth to the divine ability 'Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword'. You have obtained the divine ability 'Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword'."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked and delighted.</p><p></p><p>"This sword dao divine ability is not bad, with the cyclic rotation of yin and yang, it can turn the enemy's attacks back against them... It's a bit like the Diversion of the Stars, but the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword has more changes and is more profound."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's second sword dao divine ability was clearly derived from his Sword of Life and Death Wheel.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword not only could return the enemy's attacks, but it could also empower its own attacks. It could even continuously accumulate the enemy's attacks as the defense force of the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, and then instantly counterattack with the accumulated power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword was eternal and unceasing, and to instantly break through it, one's strength must be at least three times greater than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible to shatter the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword!</p><p></p><p>With this divine ability, even when facing enemies stronger than oneself, one could still handle them with ease.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his breakthrough, and the birth of divine abilities had not yet stopped.</p><p></p><p>The yin-yang sword lights disappeared, and then a fierce and ruthless sword intent, capable of annihilating heaven and earth, appeared faintly, with the sword light being extremely sharp and tinged with a faint dark red color.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked, this was a pure sword dao divine ability of slaughter and destruction!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the divine ability realm and given birth to the divine ability 'Absolute Heaven-Extinguishing Sword'. You have obtained the divine ability 'Absolute Heaven-Extinguishing Sword'!"</p><p></p><p>The Absolute Heaven-Extinguishing Sword! A single sword strike could annihilate heaven and earth. Of course, to truly annihilate heaven and earth would require extremely powerful strength, far beyond what the divine ability realm could achieve, but it showed the sheer destructive power of this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is my martial dao pioneer, this divine ability is powerful enough!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His eldest disciple had never disappointed him.</p><p></p><p>"Three sword dao divine abilities have been born, will more divine abilities continue to be born?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through the divine ability realm, he had given birth to five divine abilities, so Xu Yan should also give birth to five divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>After all, each time Xu Yan gave birth to a divine ability, Li Xuan would also gain an additional divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities he possessed were far beyond what his disciple could.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the divine ability realm and given birth to the divine ability 'Fury of the True Dragon'. You have obtained the divine ability 'Fury of the True Dragon'!"</p><p></p><p>The divine ability, Fury of the True Dragon! This came from the Subduing Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>The fury of the true dragon could change the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this divine ability is also very powerful, only second to my Divine Dragon Descent!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Divine Dragon Descent, the Fury of the True Dragon was weaker, but its aura of savage fury was stronger than the Divine Dragon Descent.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Dragon Descent had a majestic and supreme dragon aura, while the Fury of the True Dragon had a violent and rampant nature, the two were different.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth divine ability has been born, will the fifth divine ability continue to be born?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched the breakthrough of Xu Yan, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After the savage Fury of the True Dragon disappeared, a fleeting lightning flash appeared on Xu Yan's body.</p><p></p><p>The lightning flash was almost imperceptible, just a momentary flicker, as if it had merged into the heavens and earth, leaving no trace or sign.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

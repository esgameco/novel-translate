        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan emerged from the Heavenly Cave Ruins, he began to organize his martial arts insights from the Void-Breaking realm. By now, he had almost finished sorting through them.</p><p></p><p>The Void-Breaking insights all surfaced in his mind one by one - how to advance from the Divine Phase realm to the Void-Breaking realm, how to possess Void-Breaking power - everything gradually became clear.</p><p></p><p>From the insights gained in the small Heavenly Cave of the Azure Sea Black Pool, to the insights from the Ice Province Heavenly Cave, piercing through heaven and earth, breaking open the void of heaven and earth, how to be unrestrained by the space of heaven and earth, how to be unrestrained by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, there was now a clear path forward.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts methods of the Void-Breaking realm were revealed one by one. The first step to transcending heaven and earth had been opened.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Void-Breaking martial arts methods you created. You break through to the Void-Breaking realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't have to wait long before receiving feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Void-Breaking realm! Boom! In that instant, the martial arts methods of the Void-Breaking realm appeared in his mind, and the mysteries of the Void-Breaking realm were revealed one by one.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth appeared different in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in a single thought, he could cross the void and reach the other end of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth, the principles of heaven and earth, all appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not transcend heaven and earth, he was no longer bound by the space of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With a single punch, he could traverse space!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Void-Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited. Only after truly breaking through did he more deeply understand the power of the Void-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he had created it himself, and thought he had made it very powerful,</p><p></p><p>Only after breaking through did he realize that the true Void-Breaking realm was beyond his simple description.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities are even stronger now!"</p><p></p><p>How terrifying would the power be when using divine abilities in the Void-Breaking realm?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could hardly imagine!</p><p></p><p>"Could I defeat an Immortal Venerable with one punch?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan's confidence surged, and he itched to find an Immortal Venerable to fight.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards the Inner Realm, the barrier between the Spirit Realm and Inner Realm now clearly appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>The barrier between the Inner Realm and Spirit Realm was formed by the laws of heaven and earth, like a grid naturally formed by the primordial heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And the gate to the Spirit Realm was a gate formed by laws. By manipulating the laws in a certain way, the power of the laws could be dispersed to the left and right, naturally opening the gate.</p><p></p><p>"How does one cross to the other shore of the Divine Bridge? Is the Divine Bridge also formed by the laws of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Primordial Book, it now became easy to memorize and comprehend the principles at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, only by raising one's realm can one more easily memorize and comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the Void-Breaking realm!</p><p></p><p>"The next realm should also be prepared. Xu Yan is not far from divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a while. After breaking through to the Void-Breaking realm, he had more ideas about martial arts insights.</p><p></p><p>After all, the higher the realm, the clearer the direction of martial arts cultivation becomes, making it easier to create even stronger martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, and had a general direction for the martial arts to come.</p><p></p><p>He should create the martial arts realms after the Void-Breaking realm, as well as the subsequent cultivation of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body for physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The further development of the Extraordinary martial arts should also be created. Although the direction of the Extraordinary martial arts had been determined, new ideas could continue to be added to expand the path of Extraordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth martial art should also be pondered when there's time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities created by the Divine Ability Martial Canon are not enough. The next direction of effort will be the Divine Ability Martial Canon, including how to cultivate divine abilities using immutable qi."</p><p></p><p>After determining the direction and goals, Li Xuan appeared leisurely on the surface, but had actually begun to busy himself.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the situation in Cloud Province gradually stabilized. A huge lake appeared in the center of Cloud Province, with islands that were once great mountains.</p><p></p><p>This huge lake was named Cloud Province Heavenly Lake.</p><p></p><p>As the waters of Cloud Province converged into the Heavenly Lake, the ruins of the great cities appeared before their eyes, a scene of devastation.</p><p></p><p>In this catastrophe, the casualties in Cloud Province were innumerable. The Spirit Sects and great clans of Cloud Province suffered heavy losses, and the structure of the Spirit Realm also changed, no longer under the powerful rule of the Spirit Sects.</p><p></p><p>Great cities were established one after another in Cloud Province, and martial artists from other provinces also began to settle in Cloud Province.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Alliance and transcendent Spirit Sects were still in progress, but had basically reached a general consensus that the status of independent cultivators was elevated to be equal with Spirit Sect martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The order, or rules, of the martial world in the Spirit Realm was in the process of being established.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had already set out for the Azure Sea Black Pool to seal that Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion flying ship floated on Cloud Province Heavenly Lake, with long queues forming every day, waiting for consultations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was accumulating foundation to prepare for breaking through to the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu were doing the same, but they were still far from accumulating enough foundation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was finally about to break through to the Divine Will realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Zhou Ying were envious, but they were also close to breaking through to the Divine Will realm.</p><p></p><p>Although breaking through to the Divine Will realm greatly increased one's strength, it didn't count for much in the Spirit Realm. After all, their strength could not compare to Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was creating the Divine Ability Martial Canon, racking his brains for his great martial arts cause.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the powerful experts of the transcendent Spirit Sects began to prepare and wait for the opening of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has perfected the Heart Sword realm. You have reached small success in the Wisdom Sword realm."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally perfected the Heart Sword realm, taking another step closer to the Wisdom Sword realm.</p><p></p><p>"The sword realms after the Wisdom Sword realm should also be prepared."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, feedback came again from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the cultivation direction of the Bright Blade realm, understood the path of the Bright Blade realm. You have entered the Bright Blade realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, his blade dao had also improved.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong has finally found the cultivation path of the Bright Blade realm. It wasn't easy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's blade dao realm had also broken through to great success in the Hidden Blade realm.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I enter the Divine Ability realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was calm, but his heart was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He had finally accumulated enough foundation to break through to the Divine Ability realm. Once he entered the Divine Ability realm, how powerful would he become? The Evergreen Pavilion temporarily stopped consultations, and the flying ship rose into the air, hovering in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the clouds, with a hazy divine light emanating from his entire body.</p><p></p><p>His aura was growing stronger, divine light illuminating in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Divine Ability realm."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had a look of admiration. Xu Yan was about to break through to the Divine Ability realm, while he was still far from Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>He was only at small success in the Divine Element realm now.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also had an expectant look. What divine abilities would Xu Yan develop when breaking through to the Divine Ability realm? Sword dao divine abilities were certain to develop, and possibly more than one sword dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"How many divine abilities will Xu Yan develop when breaking through to the Divine Ability realm?"</p><p></p><p>The self-developed divine abilities when breaking through to the Divine Ability realm would continuously improve as one's realm increased, with no upper limit. They could be called a martial artist's innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>There was a certain difference between cultivated divine abilities and self-developed divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was breaking through to the Divine Ability realm in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above, the winds and clouds surged, and even before the breakthrough, a powerful aura was already gathering.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan focused his thoughts, sealing off all signs of the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"What divine ability will Senior Brother develop?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It must be a very powerful divine ability," Meng Chong said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine ability are you talking about?" Zi Yun asked curiously. </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao and the others also looked over. What exactly were martial arts divine abilities? They had never seen them before! The martial arts they practiced did not have the concept of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's something very, very powerful!" Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun rolled her eyes. Wasn't that stating the obvious?</p><p></p><p>"There are myriad divine abilities, each different, with varying levels of strength," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, can we cultivate divine abilities?" Du Yuying asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It depends on your own insights," Li Xuan replied, not giving a definitive answer.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Yuying and the others couldn't help but feel tempted. If they could also cultivate divine abilities, wouldn't their strength increase even more? However, divine abilities were no small matter, being core techniques of martial arts. They felt too embarrassed to ask outright for methods to cultivate divine abilities. They could only wait for a suitable opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"The breakthrough is coming!" Li Xuan grew excited inwardly. "I wonder how Xu Yan will transform when breaking through to the Divine Ability Realm?"</p><p></p><p>In the clouds, divine light swirled around Xu Yan's body, gradually contracting inward. Faintly, an even more mystical radiance flickered within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, cultivating the martial arts you created, breaks through to the Divine Ability Realm. Your divine ability power is amplified a hundredfold!" came the feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Venerable, who can withstand one of my divine abilities?" Li Xuan was elated. His divine abilities were already incredibly powerful, and now with their power amplified a hundredfold, couldn't he easily destroy an Immortal Venerable with a single divine ability? His confidence soared!</p><p></p><p>"I continue to be invincible!" Li Xuan felt utterly euphoric. Indeed, the greatest joy in the world was the joy brought by increasing one's strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, reaching the pinnacle during his breakthrough to the Divine Ability Realm, transforms into Sacred Mountain River Bones. You obtain Innate Sacred Mountain River Bones!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt a sense of sacred radiance. The image of mountains and rivers appeared within his body, permeated by an ineffable sacred intent. It was as if with a single thought, the mountains and rivers within his body could give birth to all living things.</p><p></p><p>"Sacred Mountain River Bones!" Li Xuan was elated. Xu Yan's breakthrough to the next realm would surely result in becoming a Sacred Body!</p><p></p><p>"I roughly understand now what kind of physique will result from further transformation," Li Xuan had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability should be born now, right?" Li Xuan silently observed Xu Yan's breakthrough. At this point, the divine ability was about to manifest.</p><p></p><p>A sword light appeared on Xu Yan's body, enveloped by mountains and rivers. In an instant, the area where he stood transformed into a landscape of mountains and rivers. Only mountains and rivers could be seen, not the person!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan breaks through to the Divine Ability Realm, giving birth to the divine ability Mountains and Rivers Within the Sword. You obtain the divine ability Mountains and Rivers Within the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, Xu Yan's first divine ability was related to the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and Rivers Within the Sword!</p><p></p><p>"Similar to Universe Within the Sword, just slightly weaker, but still very powerful," Li Xuan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability of Xu Yan's was within Li Xuan's expectations. After all, the Mountain River Sword Dao was the sword dao Xu Yan had comprehended, so it was only natural for it to transform into a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's martial insights, the Mountain River Sword Dao can continue to strengthen, which means the Mountains and Rivers Within the Sword divine ability will also continuously grow stronger," Li Xuan pondered. With Xu Yan's comprehension ability, he would surely keep improving his sword dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers disappeared, and Xu Yan's figure reappeared. Then, two mysterious sword lights emerged from within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Another sword dao divine ability!" Xu Yan was giving birth to his second sword dao divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan breaks through to the Divine Ability Realm, giving birth to the divine ability Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword. You obtain the divine ability Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked and delighted.</p><p></p><p>"This sword dao divine ability is not bad. The yin and yang cycle and rotate, able to turn an enemy's attack back on them... It's a bit like Star-Shifting, but the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword has more variations and is more profound."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's second sword dao divine ability clearly came from his Life and Death Sword Wheel.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword could not only return an enemy's attack but also enhance one's own attacks. It could even continuously accumulate the enemy's attacks, transforming them into defensive power for the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword, and in an instant, send the accumulated attacks back as a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword was endless and cyclical. To break through the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword in an instant, one's strength would need to exceed Xu Yan's by at least three times. Otherwise, it would be impossible to shatter the Indestructible Yin-Yang Sword!</p><p></p><p>With this divine ability, even when facing stronger enemies, one could handle them with ease.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his breakthrough, and the birth of divine abilities had not stopped.</p><p></p><p>The yin-yang sword light disappeared, and then a sharp, killing intent that seemed to annihilate heaven and earth faintly appeared. The sharpness of the sword light carried a hint of dark red color.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked. This was a pure killing sword dao divine ability!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan breaks through to the Divine Ability Realm, giving birth to the divine ability Heaven-Severing Sword. You obtain the divine ability Heaven-Severing Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Severing Sword! With one sword strike, heaven and earth could be severed! Of course, to actually sever heaven and earth would require immense strength, far beyond what the Divine Ability Realm could achieve, but this demonstrated the powerful killing intent of this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the pioneer of my martial way, this divine ability is strong enough!" Li Xuan was gratified.</p><p></p><p>His eldest disciple never disappointed him.</p><p></p><p>"Three sword dao divine abilities now, three divine abilities have been born. Will there be more?" Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to the Divine Ability Realm, he had given birth to five divine abilities. Xu Yan should also give birth to five divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>After all, every time Xu Yan gave birth to a divine ability, he would also gain one.</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities he possessed far exceeded those of his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan breaks through to the Divine Ability Realm, giving birth to the divine ability True Dragon's Fury. You obtain the divine ability True Dragon's Fury!"</p><p></p><p>The divine ability, True Dragon's Fury! This came from the Dragon-Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>When a true dragon is enraged, heaven and earth change color!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this divine ability is also very powerful, second only to my Divine Dragon Descends!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to Divine Dragon Descends, True Dragon's Fury was naturally somewhat weaker, but the wild and violent power of True Dragon's Fury surpassed that of Divine Dragon Descends.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Dragon Descends divine ability had a vast dragon might and supreme majesty, while True Dragon's Fury was a state of wild violence. The two were different.</p><p></p><p>"That's the fourth divine ability. Will there be a fifth?" Li Xuan watched the breakthrough of Xu Yan, full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>After the violent true dragon might disappeared, a flash of lightning surged from Xu Yan's body.</p><p></p><p>The lightning, almost imperceptible, flashed for just an instant, extremely weak, as if merged with heaven and earth, without trace, impossible to find.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

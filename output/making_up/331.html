        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Before I die, I had wanted to see Waner one last time from afar. Since I can't see her, I no longer have any wishes left."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu's expression became calm.</p><p></p><p>"Please never tell Lingshou that I ever existed. It's as if I never existed at all!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu said, then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression was complex, and he sighed inwardly before speaking up, "Wait."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu turned back with a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know why you've become this way, since we've met, here are some pills for you. Take them and recover as much as you can."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu handed several pill bottles to Mu Qiuliu.</p><p></p><p>"They may not be able to restore you to your peak, but they can definitely help you recover to about 70-80% of your former self."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu shook his head and said, "It's useless, I know my own situation."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, these pills were refined by Lingshou. Even if your foundation is damaged or your spiritual body is collapsing, you can still recover with them. Your injuries are more severe, but you can still recover."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu sneered and continued, "If Lingshou personally treats you, your injuries would be nothing, and you'd be able to fully recover in just a few days."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu looked incredulous. "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Meng Shushu sneered. "Do you want to go find Lingshou for treatment? She hasn't seen you before, so she won't know you're her father."</p><p></p><p>"No need!" Mu Qiuliu shook his head and took the pills, saying, "If I see her, I'll only end up harming her. Let's part ways here, and may we never meet again!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu fell silent. Mu Qiuliu's response had caught him off guard. He had expected Mu Qiuliu to express a desire to reveal his identity and ask Lingshou for treatment after learning he could recover to his peak.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu left, disappearing into the crowd, never to return.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu didn't know what to make of it. He admitted that he had softened at the last moment, which was why he gave Mu Qiuliu the pills.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the jade token in his hand, with its delicate patterns, Meng Shushu wondered what it was.</p><p></p><p>"This is what?" He shook his head, deciding to find an opportunity to give it to Lingshou.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Qingqing Pavilion, Lingshou was still catching up with Princess Xingwei. The trip to the Great Zhou capital had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>"We can't go to Bingzhou," Meng Shushu remembered Mu Qiuliu's warning, puzzled about what had happened in Bingzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Then we won't go," Lingshou said, and Meng Shushu was relieved, as Bingzhou was sparsely populated, and there was no need to go there. If Lingshou wanted to go, he would find an excuse to dissuade her, not because he feared danger in Bingzhou, but because he was worried that going there might uncover something about Mu Qiuliu, thus exposing Lingshou's and his own identities.</p><p></p><p>"Am I doing the right thing?" Meng Shushu was conflicted.</p><p></p><p>After all, Mu Qiuliu was Lingshou's biological father, but Meng Shushu didn't want Lingshou to bear any sadness or anger because of her father's existence, especially if Mu Qiuliu was not a womanizer.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, Meng Shushu would have told Lingshou the truth.</p><p></p><p>"So be it," Meng Shushu sighed, holding the jade token as he went to the pavilion on the top of the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" Meng Shushu respectfully greeted Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Li Xuan had seen and heard everything about him and Mu Qiuliu.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, am I doing the right thing?" Meng Shushu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Right or wrong, it's in your heart. Let things take their course," Li Xuan said, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>If Lingshou learned the truth about her father, she might be troubled and her carefree, happy life of cultivating alchemy and martial arts could be disrupted.</p><p></p><p>Since Mu Qiuliu had chosen to withdraw, he obviously didn't want to disrupt Lingshou's peaceful life with his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what is this?" Meng Shushu asked, placing the jade token on the table.</p><p></p><p>"I will give it to Lingshou," Li Xuan said simply, looking at the token.</p><p></p><p>As for what it was, he had no idea. He just avoided answering, as if telling Meng Shushu that his cultivation was too low to know such things.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Meng Shushu didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>If the token was given to Lingshou by the Senior, it would be taken more seriously than if he gave it to her himself. Otherwise, it might just be forgotten by Lingshou one day.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Shushu left, Li Xuan picked up the jade token and examined it closely. He was puzzled, wondering what this item was. The material of the token was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>In terms of material alone, it was not inferior to the divine artifacts of the Spiritual Realm. But it was not a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>The patterns on the token seemed to have no special meaning, just decorative.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, then infused a wisp of spiritual energy into the token.</p><p></p><p>The jade token emitted a faint blue glow, and three words appeared on it: "Heavenly Vault Token!"</p><p></p><p>Along with these words, Li Xuan also saw a few lines of small text inside the token:</p><p></p><p>"When the token is activated, the Heavenly Vault will appear; the holder of the Heavenly Vault Token can enter the Heavenly Vault, and can also command the Heavenly Vault!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew his spiritual energy, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Vault? Some kind of secret realm? This is the key to enter the Heavenly Vault, or the token to command it?"</p><p></p><p>He wondered. </p><p></p><p>What was the Heavenly Vault? As far as he knew, there was no such place in the Spiritual Realm, and he had never seen any records of it in the Great Zhou's archives.</p><p></p><p>"It's probably some kind of secret realm. When the Heavenly Vault appears, the token will activate and allow entry?" Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just give it to Lingshou. Whenever the Heavenly Vault appears, we'll find out then."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, not dwelling on the Heavenly Vault token any further. </p><p></p><p>Even if it was a secret realm, it didn't hold much appeal to him, as he cultivated his own unique martial dao, not the martial arts of this world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue my grand martial dao endeavor."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and immersed himself in editing his martial arts scriptures and contemplating the Dao principles of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off Princess Xingwei, the Qingqing Pavilion also prepared to depart.</p><p></p><p>Zihui was reluctant to leave and returned to the Qing Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Where's our next destination?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Tianling State and find the Red Cat. I've missed that chubby cat after all this time!"</p><p></p><p>Lingshou thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then let's go to Tianling State!"</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Pavilion's manor contracted, transforming into a flying ship that soared into the sky and vanished in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The onlooking powerful cultivators of the Great Zhou couldn't help but marvel at the Qingqing Pavilion's divine artifact, an unprecedented sight.</p><p></p><p>On the walls of the Great Zhou capital, Mu Qiuliu watched the flying ship depart, catching a glimpse of the young girl's figure in the distance. He was content.</p><p></p><p>Then his expression turned to anger.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tang Jinyan!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Meng Shushu mentioned the assassination of the Hidden Pavilion, he realized that there must be some hidden reason behind this matter. The first person he thought of was his own principal wife, Tang Jinyan.</p><p></p><p>"You deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qiuliu turned and left, not going to see Xiang Wei or any of his other lovers. In the end, he went to see Tang Jinyan, to send her to her death!</p><p></p><p>After taking the elixir given by Meng Shushu, although Mu Qiuliu had not fully recovered, he had regained most of his former handsome appearance.</p><p></p><p>In the Water Star Palace, Tang Jinyan closed the door and no longer received guests. After returning from the Thousand Martial Palace, she had a lingering fear in her heart, realizing that something must have happened, for the Thousand Martial Palace Master to warn her so.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan could only stay in the Water Star Palace, not caring about anything else, just quietly cultivating.</p><p></p><p>She even temporarily abandoned the plan to kill Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>What she didn't expect was that the long-disappeared Mu Qiuliu actually came to the Water Star Palace to find her. Tang Jinyan was overjoyed and hurriedly came out to welcome her husband.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>When an elder of a prominent family came to visit the Water Star Palace on behalf of the family, wanting to curry favor with the Water Star Palace and gain the opportunity to get close to the Thousand Martial Palace, he was shocked to find that the Water Star Palace had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked, as this was a subordinate spiritual sect of the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Who would have the audacity to destroy the Water Star Palace? Could it be the Myriad World Alliance? But if it was the Myriad World Alliance, they didn't seem to have the need to act so stealthily.</p><p></p><p>The news spread, shaking Luozhou, and the Mu family was also shocked. They sent an elder to investigate, after all, Tang Jinyan was officially Mu Qiuliu's principal wife.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough investigation, they found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Since Tang Jinyan was dead and Mu Qiuliu had no news, the Mu family elders discussed and made Mu Feiming's mother the new principal wife of Mu Qiuliu.</p><p></p><p>Mu Feiming became the legitimate young master! The destruction of the Water Star Palace naturally caused the Thousand Martial Palace to dispatch a powerful elder to investigate. The elder even released the news that he would definitely capture the perpetrator who dared to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to destroy the Water Star Palace so silently without being noticed by outsiders, the one who struck must be an extremely powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Master, has the news of the Spiritual Domain Gate been leaked?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether it has or not, just find a scapegoat to set an example, and the matter of the Water Star Palace can be glossed over. As long as the other transcendent spiritual sects show no signs of activating the Spiritual Domain Gate, it means the news has not been leaked yet."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master sneered.</p><p></p><p>If the news was leaked, the shocking fact that the Spiritual Domain Gate had disappeared, the other transcendent spiritual sects would definitely go to investigate and confirm if it was true.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a renowned cultivator at the peak of Refining the Spirit realm was captured by the Thousand Martial Palace and executed in front of the martial artists at the Water Star Palace. His flesh and blood were splattered on the sect gate, declaring that they had avenged the Water Star Palace. The reason given was that this wandering cultivator had plotted for decades to seize the resources of the Water Star Palace, secretly poisoning the powerful members of the sect, and then silently destroyed the Water Star Palace.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of Luozhou were all greatly shocked. This wandering cultivator had such a huge audacity.</p><p></p><p>The other spiritual sects and prominent families were immediately terrified and conducted a thorough internal investigation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The boundless azure sea, its end unknown.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Eighteen States of the Spiritual Domain, martial artists are relatively scarce in the vast azure sea, and spiritual sects are also sparsely scattered. Only some famous islands have places where martial artists gather.</p><p></p><p>Centered around the Azure Sky Coastal City, spiritual sects and prominent families are scattered in all directions. This area is known as the Azure Sky Sea Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Sea Domain is undoubtedly the most prosperous sea domain in the azure sea. Both human martial artists and sea spirit race dwell mainly in the Azure Sky Sea Domain.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Azure Sky Sea Domain, there are also some spiritual sects and prominent families, as well as wandering martial artists.</p><p></p><p>A large ship was sailing on the azure sea, heading to the Azure Sky Coastal City to trade and obtain the necessary supplies.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this sea area is not peaceful, everyone be careful."</p><p></p><p>A martial artist on the ship said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The azure sea is vast, and even Refining the Spirit Celestials prefer to travel by ship, as relying solely on their own strength to fly is too tiring. Moreover, if they consume too much energy, they would be in danger if ambushed.</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? We have more than twenty Refining the Spirit Celestials here, do we still fear those bandits?"</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists scoffed.</p><p></p><p>In the azure sea, outside the Azure Sky Sea Domain, there are pirates who plunder the passing martial artists.</p><p></p><p>These pirates are either fierce martial artists who have fled from the Eighteen States, or the remnants of fallen spiritual sects and prominent families who have gathered together.</p><p></p><p>There are even sea spirits who become pirates.</p><p></p><p>Anywhere in the azure sea, except for the Azure Sky Sea Domain, there is a possibility of encountering pirates.</p><p></p><p>"Having more than twenty Refining the Spirit Celestials gives you the confidence? Have you forgotten the incident three months ago when Stone Vine Island was plundered? How many martial artists on that island managed to escape?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't scare us, we won't be that unlucky to encounter the ones who wiped out Stone Vine Island."</p><p></p><p>"Still, better to be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the martial artists on the ship became more vigilant and alert, ready to flee immediately if the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the pirates are attacking!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone on the ship shouted.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up to see figures appearing from all directions, rapidly surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>The attackers all wore black masks and held blood-red long sabers, with a sinister aura emanating from them.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Blood Saber Bandits who destroyed Stone Vine Island!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists on the ship exclaimed in horror.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, jump!"</p><p></p><p>A Refining the Spirit Celestial flickered and tried to flee from the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! A blood-red saber light came crashing down, forcing the martial artist back onto the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Stand still, we only want to rob, not kill. Whoever resists, dies!"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Saber Bandits sneered.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists below Refining the Spirit on the ship all turned pale, handing over their storage bags and throwing them onto the deck.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Celestials stand over there, the Lesser Celestials stand here, and the Refining the Spirit Celestials crouch down!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Bandits commanded, and the martial artists on the ship arranged themselves as instructed. The twenty-odd Refining the Spirit Celestials had grim expressions, but could only crouch down in humiliation.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Bandits were too powerful, all of them at the peak of Refining the Spirit. And there were more of them.</p><p></p><p>Fighting was out of the question, and even the chance of escaping was slim.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"I, the Blood Saber Bandit, love it when people cooperate."</p><p></p><p>"Hand over all your storage bags, don't hide anything... This girl is not bad, you don't need to hand over your storage bag, just give me your beauty, I'll take your body! As a Blood Saber Bandit, I have principles, either rob the wealth or rob the beauty, since I'm robbing the beauty, I won't rob the wealth!"</p><p></p><p>The female martial artist turned deathly pale, trembling as she pleaded, "Big brother, please spare me, can I just hand over the wealth?"</p><p></p><p>"You have no choice! Go lie down in the corner obediently, or else I'll rob your wealth and your body!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Bandit slapped the woman's face with his saber, and she went to the corner, lying down in despair.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Bandit walked over, satisfied, "You've cooperated well, I'll even pay you some spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>How outrageous! The woman was almost enraged, feeling utterly humiliated.</p><p></p><p>At the back of the ship, a azure-blue small boat was speeding towards them across the sea.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

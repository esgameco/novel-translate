        <h1>Chapter 267</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Domain ultimately belonged to the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families. They had completely erased the history of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy from the ranks of the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong continued, "This is what the senior elders of our Wanshi Alliance said. According to them, after the calamity of the Blood Demon, the fierce competition among the geniuses of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy shattered the Wanxing. For a period of time, the scattered cultivators in the Spiritual Domain suffered a tragic fate.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Sect issued an order that no one was allowed to spread or publicize the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, nor could they possess anything belonging to the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, including its symbols and the like. If discovered, they would be killed without mercy.</p><p></p><p>"There were rewards for those who reported on others, and those who actively assisted the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families in rebuilding the order of the Spiritual Domain and widely spreading the slogans issued by them would be rewarded.</p><p></p><p>"If one made a significant contribution, they would be granted the honor of joining the ranks of the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families as one of their martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"That was a dark period. Many scattered cultivators with integrity and unyielding spirit were killed. Even more tragic were the scattered cultivators who betrayed their friends and even their own family members."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others fell silent. The plight of the scattered cultivators in the Spiritual Domain was vastly different from that of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>They also understood why the martial artists of the Spiritual Sect looked down on the martial artists of the Inner Domain as mere pigs and dogs - it was all because of their lofty, arrogant, and distorted mentality.</p><p></p><p>"The guiding principle of our Wanshi Alliance is to break the existing order and strive for a place in the world for all the scattered cultivators. Some of our senior elders have experienced that dark period in the past. Some have even witnessed the calamity of the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>As a low-level scattered cultivator in the Spiritual Domain, Fang Hao could better understand the plight of the bottom-tier scattered cultivators and how the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families looked down upon them from their lofty positions.</p><p></p><p>"As the Alliance Master of the Yuzhou Alliance, I will surely lead the Yuzhou Alliance to stand on equal footing with the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families in Yuzhou!" Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I, Wen Yong, will wholeheartedly assist the Alliance Master in creating great achievements!" Wen Yong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Xu Yan with gravity, "Brother Xu, you should understand the impact that this clash of geniuses will bring. Even the once mighty Wanxing Martial Arts Academy was shattered. The resurgence of the clash of geniuses is by no means a good thing. Two fists cannot defeat four hands!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been listening quietly. He was also amazed at the strength of the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families. Even the powerful Wanxing Martial Arts Academy had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Surely there won't be dozens of Refining Spirit Realm experts, or even beings beyond the Spiritual Sect, coming to suppress my Master Xu Yan, right?" Li Xuan thought anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong was right, two fists cannot defeat four hands. But Li Xuan was not alone, with his Divine Martial True Body, he was not fighting alone. Moreover, the Great Wilderness martial artists were continuously increasing, and his second Divine Martial True Body would not be too far away.</p><p></p><p>After evaluating his own strength, Li Xuan calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry. With my four martial arts combined, formations, the Heavenly and Earthly Extraordinary Formations, sword formations... When I unleash my full strength, no matter how many Refining Spirit Realm experts come, I can kill them all. I'm much more formidable than the former Demon Lord. Even if they are beyond the Refining Spirit Realm, they are not invincible. If they provoke me, I'll set up a grand formation to annihilate a Spiritual Sect beyond the Refining Spirit Realm, and let the entire Spiritual Domain know that I'm even more ruthless than the Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan became carefree.</p><p></p><p>"If I can attain the Divine Dao Realm, I'll truly have nothing to fear."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself, wondering when Xu Yan would be able to comprehend the martial arts of the Divine Dao Realm. Once he reached the Divine Dao, he would be completely fearless, and even beings beyond the Refining Spirit Realm would be easily crushed by him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then said solemnly, "Brother Wen's concerns are understandable, but I, Xu Yan, have never feared any so-called geniuses. I have surpassed the ancient geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely accept this challenge. As for the saying that two fists cannot defeat four hands, that is only because they are not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"True masters can dominate the world alone. What do four hands, eight hands, or sixteen hands matter? They are nothing but insignificant."</p><p></p><p>His master's realm was so high, beyond imagination. What were Refining Spirit Realm or Heavenly Immortal Realm experts? No matter how many came, they would only be sending themselves to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"To reach the peak of the martial dao, one must step on the backs of countless strong ones."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Darkness True Transmission, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body, his reputation as the Sword Immortal Xu Yan was not yet renowned enough in the Spiritual Domain. Since the other party had come to him to showcase his might and fame, he would naturally oblige them.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong looked at Xu Yan in silence for a moment. He was also a genius in the Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance, but he found that he lacked the self-confidence and pride that Xu Yan possessed.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Xu is confident, then let's fight. Showcase your might in the Spiritual Domain and suppress the Spiritual Sect's True Transmission!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong took a deep breath and voiced his support.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Since I, Xu Yan, have agreed to it, I naturally have confidence. I never do anything without being sure of success.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're here, Brother Wen, take these medicinal pills. They can assist you in your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and handed two bottles of medicinal pills to Wen Yong.</p><p></p><p>After the reunion, Wen Yong and Yu Gao left to investigate the movements of the Yuzhou Spiritual Sect and Luo Xinting.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, a message spread throughout Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xinting, the True Transmission of the Crimson Darkness, had initiated the clash of genieres, challenging the Yuzhou scattered cultivator genius Xu Yan to a life-and-death battle.</p><p></p><p>He arrogantly proclaimed that he would let the scattered cultivators of the Spiritual Domain know what true geniuses were, and that they were nothing but insignificant in the eyes of the Spiritual Sect's geniuses.</p><p></p><p>He even stated that if Xu Yan did not dare to accept the challenge, he should consider himself a waste and henceforth worship and revere Luo Xinting's name.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the Yuzhou Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families, they directly tied Xu Yan and the scattered cultivators together, claiming that if he did not dare to fight, the scattered cultivators of Yuzhou would be seen as spineless.</p><p></p><p>They even threatened that if he did not fight, he must withdraw from the martial dao world, and if he ever dared to act against the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families again, he would be ostracized.</p><p></p><p>All these actions were simply to ensure that Xu Yan could not avoid the challenge.</p><p></p><p>On that very day, the news of Xu Yan accepting the challenge spread.</p><p></p><p>He directly told Luo Xinting to choose the time and place, and he would be there!</p><p></p><p>The martial dao world of Yuzhou was shaken. After a long time, the legendary clash of geniuses had resurfaced! The news spread, and even martial artists from other states came to witness this rare clash of genieres.</p><p></p><p>"Three days from now, outside the capital city of Zheng, a life-and-death battle!" Luo Xinting set the time and location.</p><p></p><p>Outside the capital city of Zheng, this showed that he would not rely on his advantage in power and would follow the rules of the clash of geniuses. In Yuzhou, except for Zheng which had a special status and did not participate in martial dao conflicts, any other place belonged to the territory of a certain Spiritual Sect or Aristocratic Family.</p><p></p><p>"Then it shall be a battle three days from now!" Xu Yan accepted the challenge.</p><p></p><p>The capital city of Zheng was flooded with martial artists from all directions, eager to witness the clash of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Kingdom had no choice but to set up rules - martial artists below the Heavenly Realm were not allowed to participate or enter the city.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the capital of the Zheng Kingdom was still bustling with people. Cultivators at the Spirit Refining Heavenly Realm, who were rarely seen, occasionally appeared in the capital.</p><p></p><p>"Another Genius Battle, the final Genius Battle in the Spirit Realm, when will it be?" </p><p></p><p>On the path leading to the Zheng Kingdom's capital, an old man leaning on a cane had a reminiscent look on his face.</p><p></p><p>The young girl by the old man's side excitedly clutched the hem of her clothes and asked in a crisp voice, "Grandpa, were you also a genius back then? Did you participate in the Genius Battle?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandchild, I was not a genius, not a genius at all," the old man said affectionately as he patted the girl's beautiful hair.</p><p></p><p>"But Grandpa, if you weren't a genius, how do you know so much about those former geniuses? You've told me how powerful and brilliant they were in the Genius Battle."</p><p></p><p>The girl blinked her eyes as she asked.</p><p></p><p>"I was just a follower of those geniuses," the old man chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it, Grandpa must have also been a powerful genius, otherwise why would I be a genius too?" </p><p></p><p>The girl pouted as she said.</p><p></p><p>"You, my child, are the genius, not me," the old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, Lu Xingtian is very powerful, right? Can I challenge him? Can I arrange a battle with him?" </p><p></p><p>The girl was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>"Not so fast, not so fast, you're still young, don't get involved in these genius battles. Moreover, these Spirit Clan families are lawless and have no integrity, they are treacherous."</p><p></p><p>The old man patted his granddaughter's head as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, when I become powerful, I'll be even more treacherous than them!" </p><p></p><p>The girl raised her delicate fists.</p><p></p><p>"This Genius Battle, just watch and see. Who knows, these Spirit Clan families might be luring people out."</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in the old man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The grandfather and granddaughter continued on their way to the Zheng Kingdom's capital at a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>At the border between Yuzhou and Luozhou, a spiritual bird took flight, its sixth-rank spirit beast aura not at all concealed.</p><p></p><p>On the back of the spiritual bird was a small palace, with pink gauze curtains covering the windows, and a clear singing voice coming from within.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pink palace, on a soft couch, a young man in colorful feathered robes, his face pale with a red mole on his chin, was reclining, with two beautiful women cuddled up to him on either side. The woman on the left was softly singing, while the one on the right had a flushed face and slightly heavy breathing.</p><p></p><p>"Have we arrived in the Zheng Kingdom yet?" </p><p></p><p>The young man asked lazily.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual bird flying through the clouds turned its head back and replied with a voice that resonated with spiritual power, "Not yet, but we've already entered Yuzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, just don't miss the excitement," </p><p></p><p>the young man replied lazily, his head tilting to bury himself in the bosom of the beautiful woman, as if he had already fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a Spiritual Refining cultivator was hurrying along, and suddenly he looked towards the spiritual bird flying through the clouds and the palace on its back. His expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"That's... the Azure State Spiritual Palace, what is it doing in Yuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>His face kept changing, and he hastily lowered his profile, moving away from the flight path of the spiritual bird.</p><p></p><p>The Azure State Spiritual Palace, one of the supreme Spirit Clans, why would it come to Yuzhou? Could it be because of the Genius Battle, because of Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, cultivators had gathered, the Spiritual Refining experts from the major Spirit Clan families had all assembled.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Su Clan were already in the Zheng Kingdom's capital, currently discussing something with the Spiritual Refining experts from the other Spirit Clan families.</p><p></p><p>"If Xu Yan appears, Meng Chong will certainly appear as well, and even the people behind him. This time, no matter what, we must capture all of them!"</p><p></p><p>Su Zheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou is our Spirit Clan and family's Yuzhou, all of you must be clear about this. If the other side occupies a foothold in Yuzhou, it means a portion of the resources will be lost to us."</p><p></p><p>The other Spirit Clan and family cultivators all nodded in agreement, showing their recognition of this action.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this common interest that the Spirit Realm was firmly controlled by the Spirit Clans and families.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace of the Zheng Kingdom, the Zheng Emperor's expression changed, and he hurriedly led a group of imperial family members, powerful experts, to stand solemnly in the imperial palace square, waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a spiritual bird descended from the sky. </p><p></p><p>The huge spiritual bird had a small palace on its back, and now the small palace flew down from the spiritual bird's back, landing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, Grand Elder!"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor and the others hurriedly bowed and greeted respectfully.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual bird descending on the Zheng Kingdom's imperial palace could not be hidden from the present Spiritual Refining experts. They couldn't help but wonder, where did this spiritual bird come from, and what business did it have in the Zheng Kingdom's imperial palace?</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, is that just a Piercing Cloud Sculpture? A sixth-rank Piercing Cloud Sculpture?" </p><p></p><p>The girl asked.</p><p></p><p>The old man by her side had a solemn expression as he said, "Yes, a Piercing Cloud Sculpture, the people of the Azure State Spiritual Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The Azure State Spiritual Palace, one of the supreme Spirit Clans, actually had someone come to Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Was the impact of this Genius Battle so far-reaching?</p><p></p><p>"The Azure State Spiritual Palace, I also want to raise a spirit beast."</p><p></p><p>The girl had an expectant look on her face.</p><p></p><p>But the old man was deep in thought, not answering.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the colorful feathered robe walked out of the palace, supported by the two beautiful women. Although he was a powerful expert, he had a delicate and weak appearance.</p><p></p><p>When the Zheng Emperor and the others saw the young man, their hearts sank, and they lowered their heads even further, becoming anxious and cautious, afraid that the slightest carelessness would displease the young man.</p><p></p><p>This person was known for his unpredictable temper and strange personality.</p><p></p><p>He was Cui Huayu, one of the true inheritors of the Azure State Spiritual Palace!</p><p></p><p>At not even thirty years old, he had already reached the Spiritual Refining Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beast he commanded was also a sixth-rank spirit beast!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Young Master Cui!"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor respectfully spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, old Zheng, you've worked hard," </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, not at all, your humble servant should do this!" </p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor was almost sweating with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that any wrong response would displease the other party and result in a slap that could kill him.</p><p></p><p>Supported by the two women, Cui Huayu walked into the Zheng Emperor's personal palace, instead of the luxurious residence specially built for the Grand Elders in the Zheng Kingdom's imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zheng, your personal palace is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said as he sat down.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor bent over and stood by, hastily saying, "To be recognized by Young Master Cui is the greatest blessing of my life!"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so nervous, I, Cui Huayu, don't eat people."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu reached out a hand and patted the Zheng Emperor's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor almost died of fright. Rumor had it that this person liked to speak the opposite of what he meant. Did he actually want to eat people? The Zheng Emperor could only smile obsequiously and say, "Your humble servant is not nervous, not nervous at all!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

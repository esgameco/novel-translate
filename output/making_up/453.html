        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Princess looked at Meng Chong's departing figure, her expression still cold. However, deep in her eyes there was some complexity. She then returned to her beast-drawn carriage.</p><p></p><p>The convoy continued moving forward. </p><p></p><p>But among the entourage, one person did not follow the convoy, but instead chased after in the direction Meng Chong and Zi Yun had left.</p><p></p><p>Sister Ping in the crowd was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>That was the divine Meng Chong, and Zi Yun actually had such an intimate relationship with him.</p><p></p><p>When Meng Chong appeared, how domineering and mighty he was, single-handedly making the Princess bow her head and causing all the immortal heavenly venerable experts to not dare breathe.</p><p></p><p>The divine one's reputation was truly awe-inspiring!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Zi Yun had already left East Yang Prefecture city. A respectful voice came from behind: "Young Master Meng, please wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun looked back and saw it was an attendant from the Princess's entourage. She became alert, remembering that Meng Chong had said the Princess was thinking about his body.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Meng Chong asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Her Highness the Princess wishes to meet with Young Master Meng alone," the person said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"No way!" Zi Yun jumped up and said. "Meet alone? What does she want to do? She wants to exclude me, that's absolutely not allowed!"</p><p></p><p>The corner of the attendant's mouth twitched. He said, "If Young Master Meng has no objections, Miss Zi Yun can naturally come along as well."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun looked up at Meng Chong, her expression extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and asked, "When? Where?"</p><p></p><p>"Tonight!" The attendant gave the address and then respectfully departed.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're going to meet her?" Zi Yun wrung the hem of her clothes with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? We'll go meet her tonight and that's it. That woman has some problems with her cultivation, we'll see if she has any treasures worth my guidance to offer up." Meng Chong chuckled and added, "You'll come with me to meet her tonight, maybe we can get some benefits."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yun immediately relaxed. Then she curiously asked, "What problems does she have with her cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll find out when we see her tonight. For now, tell me about what you've been up to these years."</p><p></p><p>"I spent most of my time in bitter cultivation..." </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun recounted her experiences, though there wasn't much to tell, since after coming to East Yang Martial Academy she had spent most of her time cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, quickly tell me how you offended the Myriad Treasures Alliance, and how you went on a killing spree," Zi Yun said excitedly after finishing her own story, hanging off Meng Chong's body curiously.</p><p></p><p>"That's a long story..." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong started from the Qinghua Realm, all the way to how he was framed by Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, how he was hunted by the Myriad Treasures Alliance, to breaking through and then slaughtering all the Myriad Treasures Alliance experts who came to hunt him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm. Past the wilderness was an endless sea, with waves crashing like thunder and occasional huge waves slapping against the shore.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of islands dotted the azure sea like stars. The islands were inhabited by humans, while the sea was the domain ruled by the Sea Spirit race. There was an unspoken understanding between them and they coexisted harmoniously. </p><p></p><p>In fact, there were even marriages between humans and Sea Spirits. Within the Azure Sea Realm, people with Sea Spirit bloodlines were not uncommon.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sky Island was the largest island in the Azure Sea, as well as the most powerful force, ruling over the vast azure waters.</p><p></p><p>Among the thousands of islands in the Azure Sea, almost every island was home to a sect or clan. But strong islands ruled over weak ones, and Cloud Sky Island ruled over all the islands.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sky Island was not exclusively human, but jointly governed by humans and Sea Spirits. They established the Azure Sea Elder Council, with every elder being an immortal heavenly venerable expert.</p><p></p><p>The Elder Council was also responsible for nurturing talented youths of the Azure Sea and mediating conflicts between various forces. Once the Elder Council made a decision, no one in the entire Azure Sea could or dared to defy it.</p><p></p><p>This meant it was the collective decision of all the immortal heavenly venerable experts in the Azure Sea Realm. No force or individual dared to challenge the will of all the immortal heavenly venerable experts of the Azure Sea Realm!</p><p></p><p>On the sea, there were large ships sailing towards Cloud Sky Island or trading between various islands. The shipping routes were mostly fixed and were the safest routes.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Sea, besides Sea Spirits, there were naturally also sea beasts. But the sea beasts' strength was ultimately limited. There were no sea beasts that surpassed true king heavenly venerable experts, and they were all suppressed by the Sea Spirits.</p><p></p><p>However, the Azure Sea was not safe.</p><p></p><p>Because of the existence of sky rifts.</p><p></p><p>Within the Azure Sea Realm, there were three major sky rifts. The largest one was in the Azure Sea 100,000 miles from Cloud Sky Island, like a huge black abyss.</p><p></p><p>Besides the three major sky rifts, there were some other minor sky rifts, but they were not enough to pose a threat.</p><p></p><p>However, over the long years, with the sky rifts' periodic disturbances, no one knew how many otherworldly true spirits or enemies had escaped from the sky rifts and were lurking in the vast Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Even though immortal heavenly venerable experts would jointly patrol the Azure Sea at regular intervals, they still could not guarantee that they could root out and annihilate all the hidden foreign enemies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, apart from the established routes, large ships would not easily venture into unfamiliar waters unless there were immortal heavenly venerable experts on board.</p><p></p><p>The realm gate of the Azure Sea Realm was not on Cloud Sky Island, but on a small island between the seventeen large islands near Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>The realm gate was at some distance from Cloud Sky Island and other islands. Even for an immortal heavenly venerable expert, it would take two quarter hours to reach it from Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>However, the realm gate was guarded by dozens of peak true king heavenly venerable experts and one immortal heavenly venerable expert sent by the Elder Council, rotating every ten years.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm did not have very frequent exchanges with other realms. Usually only one person would cross the realm gate every three to five days.</p><p></p><p>As for martial artists from the Azure Sea Realm venturing to outer realms, they were relatively fewer.</p><p></p><p>On this day, figures crossed over the Azure Sea Realm gate one after another. They were all immortal heavenly venerable experts, but wore black robes enveloped in a special aura that blocked their aura as immortal heavenly venerable experts.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm immortal heavenly venerable expert guarding the gate looked at the group, his gaze finally landing on one of them with a somewhat complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Finally he sighed and said, "I'm repaying the life-saving favor you did for me back then. You only have a quarter hour, otherwise people from Cloud Sky Island will surely come."</p><p></p><p>"A quarter hour is enough!" That person nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm immortal heavenly venerable expert waved his hand, wrapping up the already unconscious true king heavenly venerable experts and instantly disappearing to the nearest small island to the gate.</p><p></p><p>He gazed towards the waters where the realm gate was located, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Who are they ambushing? Twenty immortal heavenly venerable experts joining forces, that's quite a lineup. Could they be ambushing an expert above the immortal realm? But when did such an expert come from the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also alarmed. "What kind of force is Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow? Twenty immortal heavenly venerable experts came at once, truly incredibly powerful. And many of the immortal heavenly venerable experts seem unfamiliar."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to think of something.</p><p></p><p>"Could they be from the Grand Unity Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He frowned, pondering something, his gaze heavy.</p><p></p><p>"If the celestial ladder of the Grand Unity Realm appeared, we would surely have sensed it. But we didn't sense any movement. Could it be that last time..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When he appeared, entering the divine realm...</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Tianshadying's hidden strength in the divine realm was likely extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the small island, silently gazing at where the boundary gate was located. Once a great battle erupted, the powerful experts of Yuntiandao would surely sense it and rush over immediately. </p><p></p><p>The other side only had a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>Twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords taking action was enough in a quarter hour.</p><p></p><p>Outside the small island where the boundary gate was located, twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords had completely surrounded the area around the boundary gate.</p><p></p><p>Hidden figures were in the sea and clouds.</p><p></p><p>Another four Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords each arranged a divine artifact in the four directions of the sea. Once activated, they could enhance the power of the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords, lock down this area of heaven and earth, seal people in, and make the opponent only able to exert 50% of their strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also cut off any possibility of escape.</p><p></p><p>"Capture alive if possible, but if not feasible, attack with full force and kill him!" the leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" </p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Their figures disappeared, not revealing any aura. Even if other Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords arrived, they would not be able to discover in an instant that this place had already been surrounded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords had laid out a tight encirclement, preparing to surround and kill the enemy.</p><p></p><p>As long as the opponent crossed over from the boundary gate, they would fall into the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing the boundary gate leads to the Blue Sea Realm. I wonder how Brother Xie is doing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gazed at the boundary gate.</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu's jade bamboo is indeed a treasure. My insights into the Realm of Establishing the Dao have increased again. It shouldn't be too far from fully comprehending it."</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo contained profound patterns, like some kind of rules, or similar to dao principles. If the hollow inside the jade bamboo was seen as a world, then the profound patterns would be the dao principles operating that world.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this special nature, and because the jade bamboo itself was a special treasure, that Xu Yan often observed it and gained insights into its dao rhythms, which greatly helped in comprehending the Realm of Establishing the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He had been targeting Tianshadying's actions all along, and had also sensed that Tianshadying seemed to want to lure him somewhere, but Xu Yan didn't bother with that and directly killed them.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother also doesn't know much about the Blue Sea Realm, so we can only go to Yuntiandao to inquire after arriving in the Blue Sea Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked towards the boundary gate while sending a message.</p><p></p><p>"Second junior brother, you said the Great Yan Princess was cultivating some kind of ice-cold technique that had some problems, with the cold invading her divine soul, causing her to be cold and icy, and she actually wanted to have divine intercourse with men of vigorous blood qi to dissolve the cold? You exchanged a bottle of divine soul pills for some of her treasures? As long as it's not a loss, that's fine, but those few pills won't be able to cure her problem fundamentally..."</p><p></p><p>In the message, Meng Chong talked about what he saw in the Great Yan Realm, including the situation with the Great Yan Princess, the camp of Spirit Realm martial artists, and so on.</p><p></p><p>After ending the message, Xu Yan also arrived in front of the boundary gate.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Sea Realm, here I come. How is Brother Xie's strength now?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped into the boundary gate.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Sea Realm, Xu Yan came out of the boundary gate and looked up to see the vast, endless blue sea.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Then he revealed a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>"What a grand setup! I thought Tianshadying was nothing special, but I didn't expect so many powerful experts to come this time. It's beyond my expectations, but unfortunately there's no one above the Immortal Realm, and that Tian Seventeen didn't personally take action."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a bit disappointed inside.</p><p></p><p>He was fearless as he stepped into the blue sea.</p><p></p><p>"Attack then, why hide?"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Twenty figures appeared, their auras shaking heaven and earth. In four directions, divine artifacts emitted light, connecting to each other like a giant net covering the area where Xu Yan was.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>The auras of the twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords connected, their momentum fused, jointly controlling this area of heaven and earth. With the help of the sealing divine artifacts, any top Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord who fell into this trap would meet their doom.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, surrender!" </p><p></p><p>The leader spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"With just you all?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Sword light appeared, the sword grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I've always wanted to know how many Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords I can handle with my current strength. Today I can try it out!"</p><p></p><p>The leader's gaze was cold as he said in a deep voice, "Attack, we must finish him within a quarter hour!"</p><p></p><p>"A quarter hour? That's enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward. With a boom, the originally frozen space of heaven and earth instantly shook at this moment, like a giant dragon breaking free of its shackles. The frozen heaven and earth shattered.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Attack with full force, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The leader shouted.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack! Crack! As Xu Yan moved, the giant net formed by the divine artifacts actually cracked. The freezing power of heaven and earth had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Huge waves rose in the blue sea, rolling towards them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed, "Blue sea waves, become my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rolling huge waves suddenly transformed into a ten-thousand-zhang sword, spanning across the sky, slashing down directly.</p><p></p><p>In the four directions of the blue sea, pillars of water shot up to the sky, turning into giant swords standing between heaven and earth, radiating sharp killing sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of each giant sword was different, yet they intertwined with each other.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Even the small island with the boundary gate behind Xu Yan turned into a giant sword at this moment, standing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The boundary gate of the Blue Sea Realm now floated suspended in the sea.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of Tianshadying's Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords sank at this moment.</p><p></p><p>What terrifying technique was this? What sword dao was this? Had Xu Yan already become so terrifyingly powerful? In the far distance, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord of the Blue Sea Realm was completely stunned, feeling his scalp tingle and his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was Tianshadying trying to deal with? At this moment, he only saw giant swords standing in the sea where the boundary gate was located, emitting powerful killing intent. Even across such a great distance, it still made him feel shocked and terrified.</p><p></p><p>"What sword dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>It's too frightening!</p><p></p><p>"A quarter hour? In a quarter hour, the ones who die will be the ambushers, right?"</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, the more he thought about it the more shocked he felt. Twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords, could they not withstand it? Were the brains of Tianshadying's Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords broken? Ambushing such a terrifying expert, confidently thinking a quarter hour would be enough?</p><p></p><p>It was indeed enough! In a quarter hour, you'll be the ones annihilated, not the opponent!!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord of the Blue Sea Realm thought in shock. At this moment, a clear voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll use you to test out the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword that I've recently comprehended!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, giant swords could be seen interweaving in the sea area where the boundary gate was located. Sword light had already engulfed that area of heaven and earth. The intent of annihilation surged in all directions. Even across such a great distance, there was still a feeling of being in the midst of a great calamity of heaven and earth, about to be annihilated at any moment!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's explanation of supernatural abilities, by the end, he himself had gained new insights and actually comprehended another supernatural ability.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a minor supernatural ability, it still added another ability to the martial arts of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others also gained something, and each went to digest what they had learned.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu returned and came again to express gratitude for saving his life. He brought precious spiritual medicines, materials and other treasures, and also asked Fang Hao to forge new divine weapons for him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao readily agreed, and even custom-made a set of divine weapons for Sui Hongwu. The materials for forging the divine weapons were naturally provided by Sui Hongwu, and the compensation was not low either.</p><p></p><p>It was foreseeable that the Immortal Celestial Lords of the Qinghua Realm would all be rushing to request divine weapon forging.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feng Yan, thank you for coming to my aid this time. This is a small token of my appreciation," Sui Hongwu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It was nothing," Feng Yan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"Has the turmoil in the Nine Mountains Realm subsided? When will Brother Feng Yan return to the Nine Mountains Realm? Do you need me to go provide support?" Sui Hongwu asked again.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, no rush. The Nine Mountains Realm doesn't have major issues. If there were real problems, they would have come asking for help long ago," Feng Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu could see that Feng Yan was planning to stay here and take this opportunity. Following the disciple of a great master seemed no different from following the great master himself? Feng Yan eagerly went to assist Fang Hao, leaving Sui Hongwu with a helpless expression. Where was the pride of an Immortal Celestial Lord? He looked like a fawning sycophant.</p><p></p><p>Little did Sui Hongwu know that Feng Yan was itching to learn supernatural abilities, so he was working hard to perform well in hopes of earning rewards of supernatural ability techniques sooner.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for the great master to teach personally, as Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu already possessed supernatural ability techniques.</p><p></p><p>So he was putting in great effort in his work.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind this either. Having an Immortal Celestial Lord following along was not bad. He couldn't personally deal with everyone his disciples couldn't handle, could he? Having an Immortal Celestial Lord as muscle could make up for this deficiency.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat mixed in at the Qimen Institute and Medicine Institute, occasionally even sneaking into the imperial palace of the Great Yue Kingdom. He was living quite freely, and even brought Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha along to inquire about where spirit beasts could be found, preparing to establish a demon race in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and other powerful figures all knew this fat cat was the great master's pet, so they turned a blind eye, and even occasionally fed it some treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat is really getting better at utilizing its advantages," Li Xuan thought. This cultured tiger was quite clever.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally finished," Li Xuan looked at the Golden Book of the Great Dao and felt his whole body relax.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts techniques above the Void-Breaking Realm were finally completely compiled, and the theoretical framework for martial arts techniques beyond that had also been established.</p><p></p><p>The second and third levels of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars had also been written.</p><p></p><p>It was just in time to pass on the martial arts techniques to Xu Yan and Meng Chong before they set out on their adventures.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth martial art is also about to be completed," Li Xuan was most excited about this.</p><p></p><p>This was a martial art created for Jiang Buping, tailored to Jiang Buping's talents. And since Jiang Buping's strength was already not low, once Jiang Buping comprehended and began cultivating this fifth martial art, his power would not be low.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate have come to pay respects to the great master!" A respectful voice came from outside the Medicine Institute.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The visitors were the sect masters of the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate, each bringing an Immortal Celestial Lord from their sect to visit.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair, while Cai Ling'er stood by his side serving tea, her beautiful eyes wide as she watched the people enter.</p><p></p><p>One of them gave off a sense of strength and power, with a muscular build almost rivaling Meng Chong's.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Martial Gate sect master! The other had lightning seemingly hidden within him, giving a sense of explosive power.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Thunder Sect master.</p><p></p><p>Behind each of them followed an Immortal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura flickered around Li Xuan, with the illusory image of the Great Wilderness God occasionally appearing behind him. When the four visitors laid eyes on him, their hearts immediately trembled.</p><p></p><p>A great master! </p><p></p><p>Unfathomably deep!</p><p></p><p>Their demeanor became even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the great master. Thank you for resolving the crisis in the Qinghua Realm," the four visitors bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>They also presented lavish gifts.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two stepped forward to receive them, then silently retreated to the side.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this visit by the Ten Thousand Thunder and Heavenly Martial sect masters, besides paying respects to the mysterious great master and making their presence known, was to seek Fang Hao's arrays and Su Lingxiu's pills.</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to the great master, they went to find Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, agreed on terms of cooperation, obtained the needed pills and array discs, and left satisfied.</p><p></p><p>With these arrays, the Qinghua Realm would surely become as solid as a fortress in the future, greatly reducing the threat from the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Great Yue Emperor suddenly left and descended upon the Great Yue Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A powerful being from the Netherworld, no weaker than Blood Child Ji, was attempting to enter the Abyss. The Immortal Celestial Lord stationed there could not hold out much longer, so the Great Yue Emperor had to personally intervene.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, two Immortal Celestial Lords were arranged to be stationed in the Great Yue Abyss, and Fang Hao carefully set up nine layers of grand arrays.</p><p></p><p>With the nine layers of arrays, plus two Immortal Celestial Lords stationed there, it was enough to resist a powerhouse at the Great Yue Emperor's level for at least a day and night without issue.</p><p></p><p>It might even be able to completely resist such an attack.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still a bit weak, the arrays I set up are not strong enough," Fang Hao sighed to himself. But he would soon be able to increase his strength. With sufficient resources, his power would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair, his eyes slightly narrowed, appearing to be resting comfortably, but his mind was actually focused on the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally complete."</p><p></p><p>The fifth martial art was finally fully compiled, including the theoretical framework, martial arts techniques, and even the fusion of immutable qi to transform it into part of the soul.</p><p></p><p>What happened next would depend entirely on Jiang Buping himself.</p><p></p><p>"This Jiang Buping, a genius who fell to become useless, a discarded pawn, born with a divine soul, has the makings of one blessed by fate. He should have no major issues comprehending and cultivating this," Li Xuan was quite confident in Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head and woke up from his slumber once again. This time he breathed a sigh of relief - there were no more of those bizarre visions.</p><p></p><p>However, he was immediately startled.</p><p></p><p>Where was he? Had someone rescued him? He stood up listlessly.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake," Stone Two appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for saving me, brother," Jiang Buping said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not the one who saved you. Come with me," Stone Two led Jiang Buping to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao and the others, hearing that Jiang Buping had awakened, all came over curiously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was a bit dazed, but he gratefully said, "I am Jiang Buping. Thank you all for saving my life!"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, the discarded pawn of Taikun?" Feng Yan muttered, looking quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's mouth twitched. It was only then that he noticed Feng Yan, this Immortal Celestial Lord. Suddenly, he realized that all these people, including Feng Yan the Immortal Celestial Lord, were standing beneath that young man, looking very respectful.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gazed at Jiang Buping, sighing inwardly. As expected of one blessed by fate, even though he was contaminated by the Immutable Qi, he only appeared listless and had difficulty concentrating, but had not lost his intelligence or become muddleheaded.</p><p></p><p>Today, he was going to take on a disciple, so outsiders were no longer needed. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, he glanced at Feng Yan, who tactfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, only Xu Yan remained as a disciple, along with Shi Er, Zhou Ying, Meng Shushu and the red cat - none of them were outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was in secluded cultivation and had not yet emerged.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was comprehending divine abilities, so he was not here.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping," Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, it's me!" Jiang Buping forced himself to be alert and responded.</p><p></p><p>"You were born with a divine soul and exceptional talent. However, you've been contaminated by the Immutable Qi, causing your soul to be heavy, often listless, and your consciousness difficult to focus.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that you've been contaminated by the Immutable Qi yet haven't lost your intelligence or become muddleheaded shows that your soul is extraordinary." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke slowly, word by word.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was startled. Apart from his mother, only he knew about his innate divine soul, and his mother had long since passed away. No one else in this world knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Could this elder have seen through it at a glance?</p><p></p><p>How was that possible?!</p><p></p><p>Whether a soul was innate or not, once one broke through to the Soul Refinement realm and condensed their soul, outsiders would be unable to detect it.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he was ambushed and contaminated by the Immutable Qi, he pretended to be muddleheaded and lose his intelligence. The Jiang clan had an Immortal Venerable who examined his soul but didn't detect anything.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have successfully deceived them and escaped from the Taikun Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Elder, how do you know I was born with a divine soul?" Jiang Buping took a deep breath and asked.</p><p></p><p>If it's a blessing, it's not a curse; if it's a curse, it can't be avoided! He simply admitted it directly.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing that can escape my eyes." Li Xuan smiled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>This was preparation for passing on the Minor Heavenly Eye technique later.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is outstanding, and your will is extraordinary. Your soul being contaminated by the Immutable Qi is both a tribulation and an opportunity. I have a martial art here that can allow you to be reborn through nirvana, surpass your peak, and cleanse the discontent in your heart. Are you willing to take me as your master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was stunned. This elder wanted to take him as a disciple?</p><p></p><p>The contamination by Immutable Qi was both a tribulation and an opportunity? Could the elder resolve the effects brought by the Immutable Qi?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, this was a chance. </p><p></p><p>It was an opportunity for him to rise again. If there was a chance to rise again, how could he be content to sink into obscurity? However, the soul being contaminated by Immutable Qi was an unsolvable problem. He was already fortunate not to have lost his intelligence or become muddleheaded - how could he dare to hope for recovery? Now, the opportunity to return to his peak had appeared! Jiang Buping fell to his knees with a thud, respectfully kowtowing and saying, "Disciple Jiang Buping pays respects to Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may rise." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping stood up excitedly and asked, "Master, can you really resolve the Immutable Qi contaminating my soul?"</p><p></p><p>"That depends on you. If you can comprehend it, you can resolve it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't make any definitive statements.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his four disciples including Xu Yan, he said, "This is your senior brother Xu Yan, second senior brother Meng Chong, third senior sister Su Lingxiu, and fourth senior brother Fang Hao."</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother Jiang Buping pays respects to senior brother, second senior brother..." </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother is too polite!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Master had the thought of taking on another disciple - Jiang Buping actually had an innate divine soul.</p><p></p><p>After the brothers and sisters familiarized themselves with each other, Jiang Buping looked at his master with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"I have a martial art here called the Extreme Soul Martial Art... With your innate divine soul, it's most suitable. As the name suggests, this martial art focuses on the word 'extreme'.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Soul uses the soul as the foundation and the physical body as a furnace. All cultivation is centered on the soul, taking the path of the soul to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"For Extreme Soul martial artists, the physical body is no longer important. They use the soul as their body and root, so they won't be like duckweed without support if the physical body ceases to exist.</p><p></p><p>"Nor will they need to reconstitute a physical body or even seize another body to be reborn if their physical body is destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"For Extreme Soul martial artists, the physical body is just a furnace for cultivating the Extreme Soul, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a body of flesh and blood..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expounded on the theory of the fifth martial art.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Martial Art!</p><p></p><p>Using the soul as the foundation and root, it was an extreme form of martial arts that could also be seen as a form of the Dao of Extremes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was excited in his heart and listened respectfully, afraid of missing even the slightest detail.</p><p></p><p>The more he listened, the more excited he became. The Extreme Soul Martial Art was perfect for his cultivation! If he had been cultivating the Extreme Soul Martial Art from the beginning, his current strength probably wouldn't be weaker than an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also listening. Xu Yan in particular seemed lost in thought. Although the Extreme Soul Martial Art wasn't suitable for his cultivation, he could still take useful parts from it and incorporate them into his own martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also pondering. He cultivated the Physical Body Martial Art, which was the extreme of the physical body, while the Extreme Soul Martial Art was the extreme of the soul or primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>They were two martial arts at opposite extremes.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Master's explanation of the Extreme Soul Martial Art, the four disciples including Xu Yan finally understood why Master wanted to take Jiang Buping as a disciple. It was because Jiang Buping was too suitable for cultivating this martial art.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan explained the theory of the Extreme Soul Martial Art, he was also secretly looking forward to what feedback he would receive once Jiang Buping successfully cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>Would his primordial spirit transform?</p><p></p><p>Currently, his primordial spirit was already very strong, not much weaker than his physical body.</p><p></p><p>If it transformed again, how much stronger would it become? Fortunately, he had also created the Physical Body Martial Art, which similarly pursued the extreme of the physical body. Once Meng Chong comprehended it, his own strength would see another significant increase.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Physical Body Martial Art, the Medicine Martial Art, the Extreme Soul Martial Art, or the Extraordinary Martial Art, they are all based on the Pure Martial Art. Only with a strong Pure Martial Art can one display the strongest power."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan, as the pioneer of his martial arts, would surely draw what he needed from the Extreme Soul Martial Art to further improve, making the Pure Martial Art even purer and stronger!</p><p></p><p>On the Great Dao Golden Book, the information for the Extreme Soul Martial Art read:</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul Martial Art:</p><p>Completeness of technique: Above average</p><p>Difficulty of comprehension: High</p><p>Difficulty of cultivation: High</p><p></p><p>The main reason for the high cultivation difficulty was that Jiang Buping needed to successfully resolve the Immutable Qi in his soul to enter the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Jiang Buping's innate divine soul, the cultivation difficulty wouldn't have reached a high rating.</p><p></p><p>"...The Extreme Soul Martial Art focuses on cultivating an immutable soul. Only by cultivating an immutable soul can one truly reveal the power of the Extreme Soul Martial Art.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating an immutable soul normally requires step-by-step cultivation, experiencing multiple extreme soul transformations. This process may involve enduring some suffering.</p><p></p><p>"Because of this, the Extreme Soul Martial Art is difficult to cultivate and not something ordinary people can cultivate. Only those with great willpower can do it.</p><p></p><p>"However, your soul being contaminated by the Immutable Qi is actually an opportunity. By completely integrating the Immutable Qi into your soul, making it a part of your soul, you can directly transform your soul into an immutable soul.</p><p></p><p>"This directly skips the long and arduous cultivation process, allowing you to become a true Extreme Soul martial artist in one step. But the prerequisite is that you can successfully resolve the Immutable Qi."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan finished speaking, he looked at Jiang Buping solemnly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

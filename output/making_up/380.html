        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan expounded the methods of divine abilities, and in the end, he also gained new insights and mastered a new divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a minor divine ability, it still added another divine ability to the Great Wasteland Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others also gained some harvests and went into seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu returned and came to thank him again for saving his life, and even brought precious divine medicines and materials as gifts, and also requested Fang Hao to forge a new divine artifact for him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao readily agreed, and even custom-made a divine artifact for Sui Hongwu. The materials for forging the divine artifact were naturally provided by Sui Hongwu, and the remuneration was also not low.</p><p></p><p>It can be expected that the Immortal Venerable masters of the Qinghua Realm will all come knocking on the door to request the forging of divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feng, thank you for coming to help this time. This is a small token of my gratitude."</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter," Feng Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The turmoil in the Nine Mountains Realm is not yet settled. When will Brother Feng return to the Nine Mountains Realm? Do you need my assistance?"</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu asked again.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, no hurry. The problem in the Nine Mountains Realm is not big. If there were any real problems, they would have come to seek help long ago."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu seemed to have figured it out - Feng Yan was preparing to take this opportunity to stay and follow the disciple of the senior. There didn't seem to be much difference between following the senior and following the disciple. Feng Yan was scurrying around to assist Fang Hao, making Sui Hongwu feel helpless. Where was the pride of an Immortal Venerable? He looked like a sycophant.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that Feng Yan was itching to learn the methods of divine abilities, so he was working hard to try to earn the reward of the divine ability teachings.</p><p></p><p>Since Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu already possessed the methods of divine abilities, he didn't need the senior to teach him.</p><p></p><p>So he was working diligently on his tasks.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind it either. Having an Immortal Venerable following them was not bad. It's not like they would encounter enemies that the disciples couldn't handle, and they would have to step in themselves. Having an Immortal Venerable as a henchman could make up for this shortcoming.</p><p></p><p>Chicat was mingling in the Qimen Academy and the Elixir House, occasionally even sneaking into the imperial palace of the Great Yue Kingdom. He was living a carefree life, even bringing Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha to inquire about where there were spiritual beasts, preparing to establish a demon clan in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and other powerful experts all knew that this fat cat was the pet of a senior, so they turned a blind eye, and occasionally even gave him some treasures to feed.</p><p></p><p>"Chicat is really getting better at utilizing his own advantages."</p><p></p><p>This cultural tiger Chicat was being quite shrewd.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally finished it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Great Dao Golden Book, heaving a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao techniques beyond the Void Realm have been completely compiled, and the theoretical framework for the subsequent martial dao techniques has also been established.</p><p></p><p>The second and third layers of the Endless Body of the Great Sun Star have also been compiled.</p><p></p><p>It's just in time to pass on the martial dao techniques to Xu Yan and Meng Chong before they set out to explore.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Martial Dao is also about to be completed."</p><p></p><p>What excited Li Xuan the most was that the Fifth Martial Dao was about to be completed.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial dao created for Jiang Buping, tailored to Jiang Buping's talents. And Jiang Buping's strength was already not low, so once he comprehends and cultivates the Fifth Martial Dao, his strength will not be weak.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanlei Sect and the Tianwu Gate have come to pay respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>A respectful voice came from outside the Elixir House.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The visitors were the sect masters of the Wanlei Sect and the Tianwu Gate, each accompanied by an Immortal Venerable disciple.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat calmly in the chair, and Caili'er was serving tea beside him, staring with her big beautiful eyes at the incoming guests.</p><p></p><p>One of them gave a sense of powerful and mighty, with a physique almost on par with Meng Chong - the Tianwu Gate Sect Master. The other one had a aura of hidden thunder, giving a sense of fierceness - the Wanlei Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Behind the two of them were their respective Immortal Venerable disciples.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious aura around Li Xuan, occasionally revealing the vague silhouette of the Great Wasteland Divine Appearance, made the Wanlei Sect Master and the Tianwu Gate Sect Master tremble inwardly at first glance.</p><p></p><p>A senior! Unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>Their attitude became even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the senior. Thank you, senior, for resolving the crisis in the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Wanlei Sect Master and the Tianwu Gate Sect Master respectfully paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>And they also presented generous gifts.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er stepped forward to receive them and quietly retreated to the side.</p><p></p><p>The Wanlei Sect Master and the Tianwu Gate Sect Master came not only to pay respects to the mysterious senior, to show their presence, but also to negotiate with Fang Hao for his formations and with Su Lingxiu for her elixirs.</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to the senior, the two of them went to find Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, negotiated the cooperation matters, obtained the needed elixirs and formation plates, and left satisfied.</p><p></p><p>With the formations, the Qinghua Realm will be as strong as a fortress in the future, and the threat of the Underworld will be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Great Yue Emperor suddenly departed and descended upon the Great Yue Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>There was a powerful expert in the Underworld, not weaker than Blood Exterminator, trying to enter the Celestial Cave. The Immortal Venerable guarding the cave could not hold out for long, so the Great Yue Emperor had to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, two Immortal Venerables were arranged to guard the Great Yue Celestial Cave, and Fang Hao also carefully laid out a nine-layered grand formation.</p><p></p><p>With the nine-layered grand formation and the two Immortal Venerables guarding, it would be no problem to withstand an expert at the level of the Great Yue Emperor for a day and a night.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it would be able to completely resist him.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still a bit weak. The formations I laid out are not strong enough," Fang Hao sighed inwardly, but he would soon be able to improve his strength. With sufficient resources, his strength would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat leisurely in the chair, his eyes slightly narrowed, seemingly resting comfortably, but his mind was actually focused on the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally completed."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Martial Dao has been fully compiled, from the theoretical framework, the martial dao techniques, to the integration of the Unalloyed Qi, turning the Unalloyed Qi into a part of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Now it all depends on Jiang Buping himself.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, this kid, from a genius to a waste, a discarded child, but with a naturally divine soul and the aura of a child of destiny. As long as he can comprehend and cultivate it, there shouldn't be any major problems."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan still had confidence in Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head and woke up from his slumber again. This time he heaved a sigh of relief, without those bizarre visions.</p><p></p><p>However, he was immediately startled again.</p><p></p><p>Where was he? Was he rescued by someone? He stood up wearily.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother, for saving me."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't save you. Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er led Jiang Buping to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and Fang Hao, hearing that Jiang Buping had woken up, all came over curiously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was a bit dazed, but he said gratefully, "I, Jiang Buping, thank you all for saving my life!"</p><p></p><p>"The discarded child Jiang Buping?" Feng Yan muttered, looking quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's mouth twitched a bit, only now noticing this Immortal Venerable Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he realized that all these people, including Immortal Venerable Feng Yan, were standing respectfully under that young man, showing great reverence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Jiang Buping and sighed inwardly, "Indeed, he is the child of fate, tainted by the unrefined qi. He is just a bit listless and has difficulty concentrating, but he has not lost his intelligence or become muddled."</p><p></p><p>Today, he was going to take on a disciple, so there was no need for outsiders to remain.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Feng Yan, who tactfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, only Xu Yan was his disciple, while Shi Er, Zhou Ying, Meng Shushu, and the Red Cat were not outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was in seclusion cultivating, not having emerged yet.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was contemplating divine abilities, and thus was not present.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping," Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's me!" Jiang Buping responded, forcing himself to focus.</p><p></p><p>"You were born with an extraordinary spiritual root, but you have been tainted by the unrefined qi, causing your spiritual mind to be heavy and often listless, making it difficult to concentrate. However, you have not lost your intelligence or become muddled, which shows the excellence of your spiritual mind."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was startled. Apart from his mother, no one else knew about his innate spiritual root. His mother had already passed away, so there was no one else in this world who knew.</p><p></p><p>How could this senior have seen through it at a glance? That was impossible! Once one's spiritual mind was refined after breaking through the Refine Spirit Realm, its innate nature could not be detected by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>When he had previously encountered an ambush and been tainted by the unrefined qi, he had pretended to be muddled and have lost his intelligence. Even the Immortal Patriarch of the Jiang Clan had examined his spiritual mind and found nothing.</p><p></p><p>How could this senior have seen through it?</p><p></p><p>"Master, how did you know about my innate spiritual root?" Jiang Buping took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"There is nothing that can be hidden from my eyes," Li Xuan said with a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>This was his preparation for imparting the Small Heaven Dao Eye.</p><p></p><p>"You have exceptional talent and extraordinary will. The taint of the unrefined qi on your spiritual mind is both a tribulation and an opportunity. I have a martial art here that can let you be reborn, surpass the peak, and eliminate the injustice in your heart. Are you willing to become my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was stunned. This senior wanted to take him as a disciple? The taint of the unrefined qi was both a tribulation and an opportunity? Could the senior resolve the impact of the unrefined qi?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, this was an opportunity. It was a chance for him to rise again. If he had the chance to regain his former glory, how could he be content with sinking into oblivion? Although the taint of the unrefined qi on his spiritual mind was an unsolvable problem, and he did not dare to hope for a full recovery, now the opportunity to reach the peak had appeared!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping immediately knelt down and kowtowed respectfully, "Disciple Jiang Buping pays respects to the Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may rise," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping stood up excitedly and asked, "Master, can you truly resolve the unrefined qi that has tainted my spiritual mind?"</p><p></p><p>"It depends on you. If you can comprehend it, you can resolve it," Li Xuan did not give a definitive answer.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xu Yan and the other four disciples, "This is your eldest brother Xu Yan, second brother Meng Chong, third sister Su Lingxiu, and fourth brother Fang Hao."</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping pays respects to the eldest brother, second brother..." Jiang Buping greeted them respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother, no need to be so formal!" Xu Yan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>After some familiarity, Jiang Buping looked at the master expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"I have a martial art here called the Extreme Soul Dao. Since you were born with an extraordinary spiritual root, it suits you perfectly. This Extreme Soul Dao focuses on cultivating the soul to the ultimate, using the soul as the foundation, the physical body as the furnace. All cultivation is centered on the spiritual mind.</p><p></p><p>"For Extreme Soul cultivators, the physical body is no longer important. It is merely the furnace for cultivating the extreme soul, and it does not necessarily have to be a flesh and blood body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expounded on the theory of the Fifth Martial Dao - the Extreme Soul Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Dao! Centered on the soul, with the soul as the root, it was an ultimate martial art, a supreme Dao.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping listened with great reverence, afraid of missing even a single word.</p><p></p><p>The more he heard, the more excited he became. The Extreme Soul Dao was perfectly suited for him. If he had started cultivating the Extreme Soul Dao from the beginning, his current strength might not be weaker than the Immortal Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also listened attentively. Especially Xu Yan, who had some thoughts. Although the Extreme Soul Dao was not suitable for his own cultivation, he could still learn from it and integrate it into his own martial art.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also pondering. He cultivated the Martial Dao of the Physical Body, which was the ultimate in the physical realm, while the Extreme Soul Dao was the ultimate in the spiritual or soul realm. They were two extremes of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the master's explanation of the Extreme Soul Dao, Xu Yan and the others finally understood why the master wanted to take Jiang Buping as a disciple - Jiang Buping was perfectly suited for this martial art.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the theory of the Extreme Soul Dao, inwardly anticipating what kind of feedback he would receive once Jiang Buping succeeded in cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Transformation?</p><p></p><p>His spiritual root was already extremely powerful, surely far surpassing his physical body. If it underwent another transformation, how powerful would it become?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had also created the Martial Dao of the Physical Body. Once Meng Chong comprehended it and reached the ultimate, his own strength would also see a significant increase.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Martial Dao of the Physical Body, the Alchemy Martial Dao, the Extreme Soul Dao, or the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao, they are all based on pure martial arts. The strength of the pure martial arts is the foundation to unleash the ultimate power."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. And Xu Yan, as his martial art pioneer, would surely draw from the Extreme Soul Dao, further refining and strengthening the pure martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Scripture provided the following information about the Extreme Soul Dao:</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul Dao:</p><p>Perfection of the technique: Medium-High.</p><p>Difficulty of comprehension: High.</p><p>Difficulty of cultivation: High.</p><p></p><p>The high difficulty of cultivation was mainly due to the fact that Jiang Buping must first resolve the unrefined qi in his spiritual mind to succeed in entering the path.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Jiang Buping's innate spiritual root, the difficulty of cultivation would not reach such a high level.</p><p></p><p>"...The Extreme Soul Dao is about cultivating the unrefined spiritual mind. Only by cultivating the unrefined spiritual mind can the true power of the Extreme Soul Dao be revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the unrefined spiritual mind requires step-by-step cultivation, going through multiple soul transformations. The process may involve some suffering.</p><p></p><p>"That is why the Extreme Soul Dao is difficult to cultivate and not something ordinary people can practice. It requires great determination.</p><p></p><p>"However, the fact that your spiritual mind is tainted by the unrefined qi is an opportunity. You can completely integrate the unrefined qi into your spiritual mind, transforming it directly into an unrefined spiritual mind.</p><p></p><p>"This would allow you to skip the long and arduous cultivation and directly become a true Extreme Soul cultivator, but the prerequisite is that you can successfully resolve the unrefined qi."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Jiang Buping solemnly as he said this.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hongzhou was named after the frequent appearance of rainbows in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat descended upon a mountain peak where the decisive battle would take place. Li Xuan gazed at the distant azure sea, wondering if Xu Yan would soon return.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, Xu Yan had broken through to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Meng Chong had also broken through to the peak of the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had refined the fourth Heaven and Earth Talisman, his cultivation reaching the level of the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>His Mysterious Door Martial Dao had become increasingly refined. His array formations, weapon forging, forbidden techniques, and Heaven and Earth Mysteries had all seen tremendous improvements.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan respectfully paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This clash of geniuses would determine the victory or defeat of the Wanshi Alliance and the Spirit Sect, as well as the final pattern of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan naturally came to stand guard for the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet broken through to the next realm, he was still subject to certain restrictions. However, his strength had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>He had vaguely grasped the threshold of the next realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Meng Chong had not yet comprehended the first layer of the Unextinguishable Body of the Great Sun and Stars, but he seemed to have gained some insights and was likely not far from comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong found a spot to sit cross-legged and continued to ponder the Martial Dao, awaiting the arrival of the clash of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao came to pay his respects, carrying the Mysterious Door Armory on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the eldest disciple?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"The eldest disciple has not returned yet."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>"I would like to request the assistance of the eldest disciple and the second disciple for my Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao spoke up.</p><p></p><p>To ensure victory in this battle, Fang Hao decided to request the assistance of the eldest disciple and the second disciple. As long as the eldest disciple and the second disciple lent their strength, even if the Spirit Sect had many geniuses, they would only be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the pattern of the Spirit Realm would be determined, and he would succeed the position of the Wanshi Alliance's leader.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened his eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, second disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hummed and said, "Little brother, why didn't you ask your senior sister to lend a hand? Is it because you think your senior sister is weak?"</p><p></p><p>"How could I dare, little sister? It's just that you don't like fighting, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"That's true. I'll just fight once to secure the fourth place."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do, senior sister. You must be ranked third."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I am the senior sister after all."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became delighted upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Spirit Realm were gathering. </p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Spirit Sect had also arrived, but their core geniuses had not yet revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, many were also looking towards the Qianwu Palace, wondering if they could regain their reputation in this battle.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was Xu Yan who had previously blocked their genius at the sect gate and defeated him, even taking away a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the elder who had been chasing Xu Yan had disappeared without a trace. </p><p></p><p>Most likely, he had perished. </p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether he was killed by Xu Yan or if some unexpected incident had occurred.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Black Abyss of the Azure Sea, a pale blue small boat was slowly descending into the pitch-black sea, a formation protecting it and parting the seawater as it continued to dive deeper.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already explored the Azure Sea Abyss and had to admit the dangers within. He had lost two divine element avatars in the Azure Sea Abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, he had also gained some rewards, finally obtaining the Azure Sea Spiritual Treasures.</p><p></p><p>And not just one.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he came to the Black Abyss and had been exploring it for nearly half a year.</p><p></p><p>There was once a time when he almost lost his bearings, only managing to return to the surface with the help of the Directional Pearl.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the several spiritual pearls in his hand. These were all found in the Black Abyss. In addition to the Azure Sea Spiritual Pearl, he had also unexpectedly discovered a remnant object.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the remnant of some kind of weapon, but different from any known weapons, with a rather special material. </p><p></p><p>But he could be certain that its grade was not inferior to the Spirit Realm's divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>And this was in its damaged state. If the weapon was complete, it would likely be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had discovered some traces of ancient battles in the Black Abyss, as if this had once been a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I have enough spiritual treasures now. With a little more, I should be able to accumulate enough foundation to break through to the Divine Dao Realm after the clash of geniuses is over."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had been preparing to leave the Black Abyss and return to the Eighteen States to participate in the clash of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, one of his divine element avatars had discovered a peculiar phenomenon in a certain area of the Black Abyss. When it approached to investigate, the avatar suddenly lost all sensation, as if the distance had abruptly expanded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but become curious, and so he went to the location where the divine element avatar had disappeared, but due to the pitch-black darkness of the Black Abyss, it was not easy to pinpoint the location. It took him some time before he finally found the place where the divine element avatar had vanished.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the place."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became more cautious, slowing his pace as he approached.</p><p></p><p>After all, the divine element avatar had suddenly lost all sensation, as if it had been snatched away, so there was likely some danger present.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan sensed the location of the divine element avatar.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that the divine element avatar was in a strange cave, which seemed to appear in the seabed, yet was not a typical underwater cave, as there was no surrounding soil.</p><p></p><p>It gave the impression of being a self-contained space, as if a hole had opened up in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to approach, connecting his consciousness with the divine element avatar. What he saw before him was a small cave less than three feet wide, and the divine element avatar had been drawn into this cave.</p><p></p><p>The strange thing was that the cave seemed to be rippling, as if slowly expanding, and there was a peculiar force constantly surging up from the bottom of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the laws of heaven and earth, and another force permeating in, seems to be pushing open the laws of heaven and earth, forming a cave. This is not a normal underground cave."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, sensing the power of the laws of heaven and earth around the cave. It was as if they had been pushed open, surrounding the cave, while within the cave, the laws of heaven and earth seemed to not exist.</p><p></p><p>But there was an unknown force invading, pushing open the laws of heaven and earth and forming this cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan carefully approached the cave, following the connection to his divine element avatar.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black darkness, he could barely see the cave, only able to discern its location by the peculiar force emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cave is this? Is the source of the Black Abyss this cave that has broken through the laws of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of his divine element avatars was inside the cave, while he was outside, allowing him to observe the cave from both perspectives.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of heaven and earth have been pushed open, as if forming a self-contained space... like a hole has been punched through the heavens and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight struck his mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the realm above the Divine Physiognomy Realm, the Breakthrough Realm!</p><p></p><p>Although this cave is unrelated to the Breakthrough Realm, the existence of the cave is like a hole that has pierced through the heavens and earth, leaving behind a remnant cave.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan had a moment of enlightenment, perhaps he could use this peculiar cave as a reference to comprehend the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the Submerge Sea Boat, his divine will spreading out to envelop the cave, instantly feeling a sense of his divine will being about to be pierced open or even drawn in.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the divine entity incarnation within the cave was also carefully comprehending the cave, reaching out to caress the cave walls, allowing the unknown power of the cave to pull its hand into the cave wall.</p><p></p><p>The divine entity was shattering, yet continuously coalescing, but in doing so, the divine entity incarnation was constantly weakening.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he might have found the direction to comprehend the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black cave, Xu Yan's divine entity incarnation had one hand exploring the peculiarities within the cave wall.</p><p></p><p>The hand of the divine entity incarnation kept disintegrating, constantly being destroyed by the unknown power seeping into the cave, but it would reform after each disintegration.</p><p></p><p>However, the hand of the divine entity incarnation would weaken a little with each cycle of disintegration and reformation.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Yan simply let the divine entity incarnation shatter, turning it into a stream of divine essence that surged throughout the entire cave, even clashing with the permeating power of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave, Xu Yan was constantly contemplating the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm, gradually becoming clearer, as if he was about to comprehend what it means to break through the void, how to shatter the void of heaven and earth, and how to be unbound by the constraints of the spatial dimensions.</p><p></p><p>"This power, though it does not seem strong, can actually prop open the laws of heaven and earth, carving out a hole, revealing its peculiarity. But where does this power come from?"</p><p></p><p>"The bottom of the cave is not made of soil, but an unknown power, seemingly the foundation of the laws of heaven and earth, or perhaps a spatial foundation."</p><p></p><p>"How was this cave formed? How does it exist?" Moreover, it is slowly expanding, and at this rate, the cave might become enormous in the future.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if there is another small space within the cave."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan contemplated, he had more questions about the mysterious appearance of this cave, but he also had more insights into the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he was puzzled - how did this cave come about? Was it due to some change in the heavens and earth that led to the formation of this cave? Was it a natural occurrence? Regardless of how the cave appeared, it allowed Xu Yan to gain some enlightenment and touch upon the threshold of the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm.</p><p></p><p>The divine essence within the cave had completely dissipated, so Xu Yan once again manifested a divine entity incarnation and entered the cave to continue his contemplation and observation of the changes within.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and half a month had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes from his contemplation, looking at the pitch-black cave, which had expanded slightly, but now seemed to have stagnated, suppressed by the spatial dimensions and unable to expand further.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little more, and I would have been able to fully comprehend the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed regretfully.</p><p></p><p>He had not been able to fully grasp the Dao of the Breakthrough Realm, but he was only a step away. As long as he spent some time organizing his insights and contemplating further, he should be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"I should head back now, the battle of the geniuses is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and two navigation pearls flew out, one entering the cave and the other sinking into the seabed dozens of yards outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>With the navigation pearls to mark the location, he wouldn't have to worry about losing the cave.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the divine entity incarnation from the cave, Xu Yan looked around, seeing only pitch-blackness, with his vision and divine will restricted.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald Sea Black Pool was a place of certain dangers - aside from the risk of losing one's bearings, there were also some ghostly-like existences.</p><p></p><p>These ghostly-like existences were rather peculiar, possessing a sense of resentment and intense malice, attacking any living beings they encountered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had once witnessed a sea beast being torn apart and devoured by one of these ghostly-like existences, which were incredibly savage and cruel, as if harboring a deep grudge against the sea beast.</p><p></p><p>He had also slain one of these ghostly-like existences, but did not know how they came to be.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat emitted a beam of light, illuminating the dark sea, and Xu Yan controlled the boat to leave the Emerald Sea Black Pool.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Xu Yan's departure, the bottom of the cave suddenly began to ripple, and a vague eye-like thing appeared, peering out from the depths of the cave.</p><p></p><p>The eye seemed to be filled with a sense of confusion, unable to see anything in the pitch-black darkness. Blinking, it tried to look out of the cave, but the laws of heaven and earth that had been propped open suddenly began to tremble and press back towards the cave.</p><p></p><p>The cave shook and shrank by a circle, and the eye disappeared from the bottom of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan controlled the Submerge Sea Boat and had reached the outskirts of the Emerald Sea Black Pool. He suddenly looked back, a look of surprise on his face - had the black pool just experienced some disturbance? He vaguely sensed the trembling power of the laws of heaven and earth, but it had disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, I should just head back to the Eighteen Realms."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, suppressing the urge to go back and take a look.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat shot out of the sea, turning into a faint blue light that vanished into the heavens, and the Emerald Sea Black Pool appeared as calm as ever, without any changes.</p><p></p><p>But the mysterious cave within had once again begun to slowly expand.</p><p></p><p>In the Radiant Realm, the geniuses had gathered, and many powerful figures from the Spiritual Sects had assembled. This was different from the previous competitions between the Spiritual Sects' geniuses, as this time, the emergence of the Myriad World Alliance had also drawn in the wandering cultivators and geniuses from across the Spiritual Domain.</p><p></p><p>It was an event known to almost everyone in the Spiritual Domain.</p><p></p><p>However, even for such a grand event, cultivators outside the Radiant Realm would need to have at least the strength of a Refined Spirit Celestial to safely make the long journey.</p><p></p><p>The day of the Genius Battle was only three days away.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed through the sky, and a swirling mass of demonic clouds appeared, carrying an aura of demonic might. Within the clouds, several massive spirit beasts were carrying a golden throne.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Crimson Cat!" Suli Xiu exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched - his own pet cat was learning to show off more and more!</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators looked up, exclaiming, "It's the Demon Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Clan is making such a grand display, are they here to provoke us?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Beast Clan had been rarely mentioned these days, ever since their clash with the Spiritual Sovereign Palace, and the name "Demon Clan" had spread throughout the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Domain, there was no longer talk of the Spirit Beast Clan, only the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>"That is the Demon King!" Someone recognized the figure seated on the golden throne.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that the Demon King was the founder of the Demon Clan, but aside from the Demon King, the Demon Clan also had an extremely powerful and mysterious Demon Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Below the Demon Ancestor were the Demon Clan's Supreme and Holy Mother, who were also incredibly formidable.</p><p></p><p>But no one had ever seen the Demon Clan's Supreme or Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hongzhou, named for the frequent appearance of rainbows in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship landed on a mountain peak at the battleground. Li Xuan gazed at the azure sea in the distance, wondering if Xu Yan would return soon.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, Xu Yan had broken through to the peak of the Divine Origin realm. </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Meng Chong had also broken through to the great achievement stage of Divine Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had condensed his fourth Heaven and Earth Wonder Mark, equivalent to the Divine Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>His Qimen martial arts were becoming increasingly pure. His skills in formations, artifact refining, restrictions, and Heaven and Earth Qimen had all greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" Wu Tiannan bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This final battle of the Genius Competition would determine the victory between the Eternal Alliance and the Spirit Sects, as well as the ultimate structure of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan naturally came to preside over the Eternal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet broken through to the next realm and was still under some restrictions, his strength had increased significantly. </p><p></p><p>He was vaguely touching the threshold of the next realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Meng Chong returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Meng Chong had not yet comprehended the first level of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, but he seemed to have made some gains. Perhaps he was not far from comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong found a place to sit cross-legged, continuing to contemplate martial arts while waiting for the final battle of the Genius Competition to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Fang Hao came to pay respects to his master, carrying the Qimen weapon box on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Big Senior Brother?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother hasn't returned yet," Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother to assist our Eternal Alliance," Fang Hao said.</p><p></p><p>To ensure victory in this battle, Fang Hao decided to ask his Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother for help. As long as they took action, no matter how many geniuses the Transcendent Spirit Sects had, they would only be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the structure of the Spirit Realm would be set, and he would take over as the leader of the Eternal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Meng Chong said, opening his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Second Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu snorted twice and said, "Junior Brother, why don't you ask me, your Senior Sister, for help? Do you think I'm weak?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare I, Senior Sister? It's just that you don't like fighting," Fang Hao said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"That's true. I'll just fight one battle to secure fourth place," Su Lingxiu said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"How can that be? Senior Sister, you must be ranked third," Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I am the Senior Sister after all," Su Lingxiu said happily.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Spirit Realm were gathering.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Spirit Sects were also arriving one after another, but their core geniuses had not yet revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, many people were looking towards the Thousand Martial Palace, wondering if they could regain face in this battle.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had been challenged by Xu Yan at their gates before, their geniuses defeated, and their divine artifact taken away.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there had been no news of the Blade Elder who had pursued Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He had likely perished.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether he was killed by Xu Yan or if some unexpected event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Black Pool of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>A light blue small boat was moving through the black sea, with a formation defense parting the seawater, continuously descending.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already explored the Abyss of the Azure Sea. He had to admit the dangers of the Abyss - he had lost two Divine Origin avatar bodies there.</p><p></p><p>But he had also gained something, finally obtaining the divine objects of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>And not just one.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he came to the Black Pool of the Azure Sea, and had been exploring it for half a year.</p><p></p><p>Once, he had almost lost his way, relying on the navigation pearl to return to the surface.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the few divine pearls in his hand. These were all found in the Black Pool. Besides the Azure Sea divine pearl, he had unexpectedly discovered a fragmentary object.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the remnants of some weapon, but different from known weapons, with a rather special material.</p><p></p><p>But it could be determined that its grade was no less than the divine artifacts of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was still in a fragmented state. If it were a complete weapon, it would likely be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the Black Pool, he discovered some traces that seemed ancient and from long ago, appearing to be remnants of a great battle.</p><p></p><p>This place truly might have been a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I have enough divine objects. Just a little more and I'll have accumulated enough foundation. After the Genius Competition ends, I should be able to break through to the Divine Power realm," Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had been preparing to leave the Black Pool and return to the Eighteen States to participate in the Genius Competition.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, one of his Divine Origin avatar bodies discovered a strange phenomenon in a certain part of the Black Pool. When approaching to investigate, he suddenly lost contact with it, as if the distance had suddenly expanded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became curious and went to the location where the Divine Origin avatar had disappeared to investigate. However, because the Black Pool was pitch black, it was not easy to distinguish locations. It took some time before he found the place where the Divine Origin avatar had vanished.</p><p></p><p>"It should be here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became cautious, slowing his speed and slowly approaching.</p><p></p><p>After all, suddenly losing contact with the Divine Origin avatar, as if it had been sucked away in an instant, likely meant some danger existed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan sensed the location of the Divine Origin avatar.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that the Divine Origin avatar was in a strange cave. This cave was very peculiar - it seemed to appear on the seabed, yet it was not a submarine cave, with no soil around it.</p><p></p><p>It gave the feeling of being a self-contained space.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a hole had opened up between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to approach. His consciousness connected with the Divine Origin avatar. What he saw before him now was a small cave less than three feet in diameter, and the Divine Origin avatar had been sucked into this cave.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the cave was rippling like waves, as if slowly expanding, and a special force was constantly emerging from the bottom of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"The power of Heaven and Earth laws, and a permeating force that seems to be stretching open the Heaven and Earth laws, forming a hole. This is not a normal underground cave."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, sensing around the cave. He sensed the power of Heaven and Earth laws, but they seemed to be stretched open around the cave. The Heaven and Earth laws made it seem as if they did not exist inside the cave.</p><p></p><p>But inside the cave, there was also an unknown force eroding outwards, stretching open the Heaven and Earth laws to form a cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan carefully followed the mental connection with his Divine Origin avatar, slowly approaching the location of the cave.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch darkness, the cave was almost invisible. He could only discern the specific location of the cave through the special force emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cave is this? Is this cave the source of the Black Pool of the Azure Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was astonished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was outside the cave, with one Divine Origin avatar inside. Observing from both internal and external perspectives made it easier for him to see the specific appearance of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth laws are stretched open, as if forming a self-contained space, like piercing through the space of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration struck his mind. He</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the realm above the Divine Phase realm, the Void Breaking realm!</p><p></p><p>Although this cave had nothing to do with the Void Breaking realm, its existence seemed as if it had pierced through the space of heaven and earth, like a cave left behind.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan had some insights. Perhaps he could use this peculiar cave as a reference to comprehend the martial arts methods of the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the sea-traversing boat. His divine consciousness spread out, enveloping the cave. Instantly, he felt as if his divine consciousness was about to be pierced open, or perhaps sucked away.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the divine element avatar inside the cave was also carefully perceiving the cave. It reached out to touch the cave wall, allowing the unknown power of the cave to pull its hand into the wall.</p><p></p><p>The divine element was shattering, yet constantly regathering. However, in this process, the divine element avatar was continuously weakening.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he seemed to have found a direction for comprehending the martial arts methods of the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black cave, Xu Yan's divine element avatar had one hand exploring inside the cave wall, carefully investigating its special properties.</p><p></p><p>The hand of the divine element avatar kept shattering and being destroyed by the unknown power permeating from the cave. After each destruction, it would reform.</p><p></p><p>However, each time the avatar's hand shattered and reformed, it would weaken a bit.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Yan simply let the divine element avatar shatter completely, turning into a stream of divine element that swept through the entire cave, even clashing with the permeating power of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave, Xu Yan had been comprehending continuously. The martial arts method of the Void Breaking realm gradually became clearer. It seemed as if at any moment he would understand what it meant to break the void, how to shatter the empty space of heaven and earth, how to be unbound by the space of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This power, though seemingly not strong, can prop open the laws of heaven and earth, opening up a hole. This shows its special nature. But where does this power come from?"</p><p></p><p>"The bottom of the cave is not soil, but composed of an unknown force. It seems to be the laws of heaven and earth, or perhaps some kind of spatial foundation."</p><p></p><p>"How was this cave formed? How does it exist?" Moreover, it was continuously expanding slowly. Although this speed was very slow, it hadn't stopped. If this trend continued, the cave would likely become very large.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if there's another small space inside the cave."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan comprehended, he had more questions about the appearance of this mysterious cave, and more insights into the martial arts method of the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he was very puzzled. How exactly did this cave appear? Was it due to some change in heaven and earth, resulting in the formation of the cave? Was it naturally formed? Regardless of how the cave appeared, it gave Xu Yan some insights, allowing him to touch the threshold of the Void Breaking realm's martial arts method.</p><p></p><p>The divine element in the cave had completely disappeared. Xu Yan once again divided out a divine element avatar and entered the cave, continuing to comprehend and observe the changes in the cave.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes from his comprehension and looked towards the pitch-black cave. It had expanded a little bit, but at this stage, it seemed to have stagnated, suppressed by the space of heaven and earth, unable to expand further.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little bit more, and I would have been able to fully comprehend the method of the Void Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed with regret.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he hadn't been able to fully comprehend the method of the Void Breaking realm, but he was only a little bit away. As long as he spent some time organizing his insights and comprehending a bit more, he should be able to understand it.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back. The battle of geniuses should be starting soon."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and two navigation pearls flew out. One entered the cave, while the other fell into the seabed tens of zhang outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>With the navigation pearls for positioning, there was no need to worry about being unable to find the location of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the divine element avatar from the cave, Xu Yan looked around. It was pitch black, with vision obstructed and even divine consciousness limited.</p><p></p><p>The Black Pool of the Azure Sea had certain dangers. Besides getting lost, there were also some existences similar to remnant souls.</p><p></p><p>However, these soul-like existences were somewhat special. They possessed a kind of resentment, with extremely strong malice, and would rush over upon encountering living beings.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had personally seen a sea beast being torn apart and devoured by these strange soul-like existences. It was extremely violent and cruel, as if they had a deep grudge against the sea beast.</p><p></p><p>He had also killed one of these soul-like existences, but Xu Yan didn't know how they were formed.</p><p></p><p>The sea-traversing boat emitted light, illuminating the dark sea area. Xu Yan controlled the boat and began to leave the Black Pool of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Xu Yan left the cave, there was suddenly a ripple at the bottom of the cave. Something resembling an eye vaguely appeared at the bottom, looking out from inside the cave.</p><p></p><p>In the eye, there was a hint of confusion. Why was it pitch black outside, unable to see anything? The eye blinked, seemingly trying hard to look outside the cave. The laws of heaven and earth that had been propped open suddenly began to vibrate, starting to squeeze towards the cave.</p><p></p><p>The cave shook, shrinking a circle as it was squeezed. That eye disappeared from the bottom of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, controlling the sea-traversing boat, had already reached the outskirts of the Black Pool of the Azure Sea. He suddenly looked back, showing a surprised expression. Had there just been some disturbance in the black pool? Vaguely, he sensed the vibrating force of the laws of heaven and earth, but it disappeared in just a brief moment.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's just return to the Eighteen States."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, suppressing the thought of going back to take a look.</p><p></p><p>The sea-traversing boat burst out of the sea surface, turning into a light blue beam that disappeared into the sky. The Black Pool of the Azure Sea seemed to be as it always was, without any changes.</p><p></p><p>But that mysterious cave had once again begun to slowly expand.</p><p></p><p>Hong State.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses gathered, and many powerful figures from the Spirit Realm converged! Unlike previous competitions between geniuses of the Spirit Sects, this time, due to the sudden emergence of the Eternal Alliance, geniuses from unaffiliated cultivators across the world also participated, spreading throughout the entire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was a martial arts grand event known to almost everyone.</p><p></p><p>However, even for such a grand event, cultivators from outside Hong State who wanted to come and watch needed at least the strength of a Spirit Refinement Heavenly Human.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, just the long journey itself would pose many dangers.</p><p></p><p>On this day, there were only three days left until the Battle of Geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed across the sky. Demonic clouds rolled, and a majestic demonic aura spread. Within the demonic clouds, several huge spirit beasts were seen carrying a golden chair as they flew over.</p><p></p><p>"It's Red Cat!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. This big cat he raised was getting better and better at showing off!</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists looked up, exclaiming, "It's the Demon Race!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Race is making such a grand entrance. Are they here to provoke?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Beast Clan was rarely mentioned anymore. Since the confrontation with the Beast Taming Manor, the name of the Demon Race had spread throughout the martial world.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, there was no longer talk of a Spirit Beast Clan, only the Demon Race!</p><p></p><p>"That's the Great Demon King!"</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized that the one sitting on the golden chair was the Great Demon King of the Demon Race.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Great Demon King was the founder of the Demon Race. But besides the Great Demon King, the Demon Race also had an immensely powerful and mysterious Demon Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Below the Demon Ancestor, there were also incredibly powerful beings like the Demon Supreme and the Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>But no one had ever seen the Supreme or Holy Mother of the Demon Race.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is this a spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was very curious about spirit beasts and couldn't help but carefully examine Yu Xiaolong. The red cat was even more curious, widening its eyes and moving closer.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because it had been pretending to be a cat for so long, it naturally developed a cat's curiosity and some feline personality traits. Unable to resist, it raised a paw and patted Yu Xiaolong on the head.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was stunned. </p><p></p><p>How annoying was this cat's paw? In an instant, its body grew larger as it stuck out its tongue and glared at the red cat, saying: "You cat, get out of my way!"</p><p></p><p>The red cat's eyes widened - this snake could talk? It began writing on the ground with its paw: "Even stupid snakes can talk?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was a bit confused. It could speak human language, but didn't know many written characters...</p><p></p><p>The red cat immediately showed a look of disdain, writing on the ground: "So it's an illiterate snake that can't even read!"</p><p></p><p>"Illiterate?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong recognized these two characters. It raised its head and asked Xu Yan: "Is it insulting me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others all had amused expressions, even hoping this tiger and snake would fight it out to see whether the 4th rank spirit beast Yu Xiaolong was more formidable, or the newly transformed great demon red cat.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of my way!" Yu Xiaolong became angry.</p><p></p><p>With a swish, its tail swept out, knocking the red cat off balance.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the red cat became furious. It pounced forward, raising both paws in a rapid series of attacks, so fast only blurs of its paws could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was smacked a few times, the whole snake dazed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched with amusement, as if watching a cat scratching at a snake. The red cat was agile and swift, striking out like a cat batting at a snake, smacking Yu Xiaolong several times.</p><p></p><p>"Stinky cat, how dare you!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was extremely angry. Since Xu Yan and the others weren't stopping this, they must want to see its abilities, right?</p><p></p><p>Red cat, is it?</p><p></p><p>Just a cat, even if it's some great demon, it dares to fight me?</p><p></p><p>I, Yu Xiaolong, have the bloodline of a flood dragon!</p><p></p><p>One day, I will transform into a flood dragon, and then from flood dragon to true dragon!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The spirit beast's aura erupted as Yu Xiaolong instantly returned to its true form, transforming into a giant snake over 30 meters long. It raised its head, flicking its tongue, looking down at the red cat from on high.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red cat seemed so tiny beneath its massive body, small enough to swallow in one bite.</p><p></p><p>The red cat let out a roar, unwilling to back down. With a thunderous sound, an enormous striped tiger appeared, its mountainous body even taller than Yu Xiaolong with its raised head.</p><p></p><p>The might of a great demon was revealed, demonic energy roiling, exuding the aura of the king of beasts.</p><p></p><p>A pair of tiger eyes looked down upon Yu Xiaolong's raised head.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was shocked. It turned its head to look at Xu Yan and asked in confusion: "Isn't it a cat?"</p><p></p><p>"More or less," Xu Yan said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The red cat was usually just a cat. Not long ago, it had even been carried over by his mother, held by the tail.</p><p></p><p>So saying the red cat was a cat wasn't wrong.</p><p></p><p>It was a very sensible cat that knew how to please people. Otherwise, with its great demon body, Xu Yan's mother might not have been strong enough to carry it.</p><p></p><p>The red cat had voluntarily allowed itself to be carried.</p><p></p><p>Smack! The red cat struck out with its paw. Yu Xiaolong didn't back down either, transforming into a beam of light and vanishing from its spot, then shooting towards the red cat.</p><p></p><p>It had always excelled in speed.</p><p></p><p>The red cat's form was nimble, and it was also extremely fast. For the first time, it displayed its power as a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Opening its mouth, it roared out a blast of demonic energy, forcing Yu Xiaolong to hurriedly dodge.</p><p></p><p>The snake and tiger rose into the air, beginning to battle in the skies above Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The red cat had only recently transformed into a great demon, but its strength was increasing daily, especially its demonic body which was incredibly powerful. Even if not quite as strong as Meng Chong's Golden Sun Body, it wasn't far behind.</p><p></p><p>In the air, demonic energy roiled and demonic power clashed. The red cat swung its paws, striking out with claw attacks, its body twisting and turning nimbly, occasionally spitting out demonic energy from its mouth.</p><p></p><p>There was even a wind swirling around its body, as if riding the wind.</p><p></p><p>Its tail was like a steel whip. Taking advantage of Yu Xiaolong's unpreparedness, its tail suddenly extended to over 300 meters long, smacking the charging Yu Xiaolong and sending it flying.</p><p></p><p>This was a contest between a spirit beast and a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was silently observing, as were Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong's attacks seemed somewhat monotonous. Its tail strikes couldn't match the red cat's, and even its sword-like extreme speed didn't give it much advantage. Moreover, the red cat's physical body was so tough that Yu Xiaolong couldn't severely wound it with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>The red cat's paws struck out with claw marks, and as it leapt about there seemed to be some method to its movements.</p><p></p><p>When its paws swung, one could even see traces of martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Under their divine sense, Li Xuan and Xu Yan both detected that several acupoints in the red cat's body were accumulating demonic might, ready to unleash at any moment. Those were the red cat's great demon killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>They were hunting techniques from when it was the king of tigers before becoming a great demon, now transformed and enhanced into great demon killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yu Xiaolong's body grew even larger, its whole form shining with crystalline light, the protrusion on its head radiating a sharp light over 3 meters long...</p><p></p><p>The red cat let out a low growl. A fiery red light surged over its striped tiger body. It crouched slightly, then suddenly pounced forward.</p><p></p><p>The sharp light on Yu Xiaolong's head slashed out.</p><p></p><p>As the red cat leapt forward, the image of a fierce tiger suddenly appeared before it.</p><p></p><p>The fierce tiger image's paws struck down, colliding with a boom against the light slashed out by Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>Both of their attacks shattered simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>However, the red cat's true body had already pounced towards Yu Xiaolong from the side, concealed by the fierce tiger image. A massive paw print smacked the unprepared Yu Xiaolong, sending it flying.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The red cat opened its mouth and spat out a blast of demonic energy, directly blasting Yu Xiaolong into the Cang River.</p><p></p><p>The victor was decided!</p><p></p><p>The red cat returned proudly, with the air of not having disgraced Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The red cat has already become this strong," Su Lingxiu sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Although her own strength was still greater than the red cat's, subduing it would now be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was even more upset. The red cat had already become so strong, no matter how hard he tried he could never catch up.</p><p></p><p>In the future he would have to try to get on the red cat's good side, otherwise things would be tough.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of realm, the red cat should be lower than that snake, right?" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. The red cat was at the Penetrating Void realm, but it ate pills every day. As a great demon, it had started by eating waste pills, so taking pills was its path to rapid improvement.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't suffer indigestion no matter how many pills it ate.</p><p></p><p>The methods of great demons had their own special aspects. The red cat's cultivation method involved opening great demon acupoints and continuously transforming, with great demon techniques even contained within the acupoints.</p><p></p><p>After all, the red cat was the first great demon, possessing special fortune. Naturally its strength would be greater.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't surprising that it could defeat Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong's attack methods were related to its nature as a spirit beast, and were relatively simple in comparison. The red cat had many more great demon techniques at its disposal.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong flew back from the Cang River. It had already shrunk its body and was looking at the red cat with disbelief, unable to believe it was no match for this fat cat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this fat cat's techniques seemed to have traces of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Was this the great demon technique Xu Yan spoke of? The clash between the red cat and Yu Xiaolong could only be considered minor skirmishes, just for amusement.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan took out all the storage bags on his body. He had looted an entire treasury from the Dai family, which hadn't even been inventoried yet.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began recounting his experiences in the Spirit Realm. </p><p></p><p>He focused on the Blue Sky Flood Dragon's tomb, and brought out the flood dragon's corpse. Looking at the enormous dragon corpse, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Regarding being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and Su family, Xu Yan didn't mention it because his parents were present and he didn't want them to worry. </p><p></p><p>However, he did talk about raiding the Dai family treasury.</p><p></p><p>"My junior disciples shouldn't lack for spiritual items and resources now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan divided up the storage bags looted from the Dai family treasury, and everyone excitedly began taking inventory of the gains.</p><p></p><p>"This is a spiritual herb, a first-grade spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>"So many second-grade spiritual herbs?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this—a spirit tool from the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, worthy of a noble family's treasury, there were many first-grade spiritual herbs, and countless fifth and sixth-grade herbs.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is spirit tea from the Spirit Realm, try some."</p><p></p><p>While inventorying the Dai family treasures, they discovered a large jar of spirit tea that was clearly no ordinary spirit tea. At least third-grade or higher.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, how thoughtful!" Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Spirit Realm had yielded enormous gains for Xu Yan. With so many treasures, Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu would not lack for resources to build their foundation, and could break through to the Divine Intent realm faster.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Junhe and the others could also break through to the Profound Connection realm with the aid of higher grade pills.</p><p></p><p>The next few days were very lively on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>The many spiritual herbs were all piled up for Su Lingxiu to organize. There were too many herbs, and only Su Lingxiu could determine how to use them and what effects they had.</p><p></p><p>For Su Lingxiu, she didn't recognize most of this vast quantity of spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with her Wondrous Heart Divine Intent, she could perceive the effects and properties of each herb, and then categorize them and record the uses of these herbs one by one.</p><p></p><p>She could even use this to formulate more miraculous pill recipes.</p><p></p><p>For example, pills needed for the Divine Intent realm to restore divine intent, strengthen divine intent, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Organizing the herbs would take some time, but Su Lingxiu was busy and happy.</p><p></p><p>After reuniting with his parents, Xu Yan and his fellow disciples stood at the peak of Canglang Island. Only then did Xu Yan recount his full experiences in the Spirit Realm, including being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and Su family.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect and Su family are truly outrageous. When we go to the Spirit Realm, we'll settle accounts with them," Meng Chong said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"So the Spirit Realm is so rigidly hierarchical, with spirit sects and noble families high above," Su Lingxiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>The plan to establish the Evergreen Pavilion in the Spirit Realm would need to be delayed, otherwise it would attract the covetous eyes of spirit sects and noble families, and might even draw the attention of transcendent spirit sects.</p><p></p><p>"Every martial arts expert at the peak has stepped on countless stepping stones to reach the top, step by step. Whether in the Inner Realm or Spirit Realm, the strong are ultimately revered. It's just that the hierarchy in the Spirit Realm is more rigid," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others nodded silently, agreeing with their master's words.</p><p></p><p>Weren't low-level martial artists in the Inner Realm also struggling?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Inner Realm wasn't as extreme as the Spirit Realm, with such a rigid hierarchy. In the Inner Realm, as long as an independent cultivator was strong enough, they could stand as equals with experts from major factions, without distinctions of status.</p><p></p><p>But in the Spirit Realm, even Refined Spirit Heavenly Humans who were independent cultivators could not stand as equals with Heavenly Humans from spirit sects and noble families. They would still feel looked down upon by the spirit sects and noble families.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can spirit beasts cultivate the great demon martial way?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, yes," Li Xuan nodded and said, "That snake does have some talent. If it cultivates the great demon method, it shouldn't be a problem for it to transform into a flood dragon. Whether it can become a true dragon depends on its own fate."</p><p></p><p>"Then let it settle in for now and get familiar with the red cat before we decide," Xu Yan said with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan said so, Li Xuan also didn't use the point demon technique to transmit the great demon martial way to Yu Xiaolong. They would let the snake familiarize itself first before deciding.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Canglang Island continued as usual. Xu Yan was consolidating his insights after his breakthrough to further improve his strength, and summarizing his experience in killing Refined Spirit Heavenly Humans.</p><p></p><p>He also gave some guidance to Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu on how to transform and elevate themselves when breaking through to the Divine Intent realm, fulfilling his responsibility as senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Xu Yan also occasionally gave some guidance on the red cat's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The great demon martial way was still a martial way. Xu Yan was the true martial pioneer, with monstrous talent and extremely strong comprehension ability. After mastering the great demon martial way, he could naturally give the red cat some pointers.</p><p></p><p>As for Yu Xiaolong, it was feeling very discouraged and curled up somewhere questioning its life as a snake.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the red cat pondering over array diagrams, Xu Yan stared for a while, looking thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed anything?" Li Xuan asked expectantly. </p><p></p><p>His eldest disciple was undoubtedly the most monstrous. Although his talent might not be focused on esoteric martial arts, arrays were a system within esoteric martial arts. Perhaps Xu Yan could gain some insights?</p><p></p><p>"I have some insights, but need time to digest them before I can understand," Xu Yan said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and didn't ask further. Since Xu Yan said he had some insights, he would surely gain something after digesting them for a while.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu also studied the array diagrams for a few days.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they gained any insights, they probably had some?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was consolidating his martial way. Although he was still some distance from breaking through to small success in the Divine Intent realm, his strength was increasing every day.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu were also building their foundation and increasing in strength.</p><p></p><p>Even the red cat was doing the same.</p><p></p><p>One day, Xu Yan was eating with his mother. The red cat was lying next to Xu Yan's mother like a fat orange cat, with an array diagram and some writing in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then said, "Red cat, pondering the array diagram like this is useless. You won't gain any insights. Your talent is only so-so. If you want to gain something, you might as well draw the array into one of your acupoints. If you succeed, you might understand something."</p><p></p><p>The red cat was stunned, then immediately looked thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then added, "Of course, you don't need to completely replicate the array diagram. Follow your own intuition and draw in the array patterns you can. Don't worry about the patterns you can't draw in. After drawing in all the patterns you can into your acupoint, then take time to connect them into a complete array."</p><p></p><p>The red cat was overjoyed upon hearing this, meowing twice in thanks.</p><p></p><p>After giving guidance to the red cat, whether it could succeed depended on its own talent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had seen that his mother was really treating the red cat like a pet cat, and the red cat was also very affectionate towards his mother, which is why he gave extra guidance.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm storyline was starting to wrap up, preparing for the Spirit Realm storyline to unfold. Feeling a bit of writer's block~~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is this the spiritual beast?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was very curious about the spiritual beast, and couldn't help but carefully examine the Jade Little Dragon, and the Red Cat was even more curious, staring with wide eyes as it approached.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it had been pretending to be a cat for too long, it naturally had the curiosity of a cat, and some of the cat's personality, and couldn't help but raise a paw to pat the Jade Little Dragon's head.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>How daring was this cat's paw? It instantly grew its body, hissing and glaring at the Red Cat, saying, "You cat, get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's eyes widened, this snake can actually talk? It started writing on the ground with its paws: "Can the stupid snake talk too?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was a bit confused, it could speak human language, but it didn't know many characters...</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat immediately showed a disdainful look, writing on the ground, "So it's an illiterate snake, it can't even recognize characters!"</p><p></p><p>"Illiterate?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon recognized these two words, it raised its head and asked Xu Yan, "Is it cursing me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others all had an amused expression, even hoping that the tiger and the snake would fight, to see whether the fourth-stage spiritual beast Jade Little Dragon or the newly formed great demon Red Cat was more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was furious.</p><p></p><p>With a slap, its snake tail swept the Red Cat, causing it to stagger.</p><p></p><p>The unprepared Red Cat immediately became enraged, pouncing forward, raising its paws and launching a series of rapid attacks, the speed so fast that only the afterimages of the paws could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was hit a few times, the entire snake was dazed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, as if watching a cat pounce on a snake, the agile and swift Red Cat struck the Jade Little Dragon several times like a cat slapping a snake.</p><p></p><p>"Foul cat, how dare you!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was extremely angry, since Xu Yan and the others didn't stop it, they must be wanting to see its abilities, right?</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat, huh?</p><p></p><p>A mere cat, even if it's some great demon, dares to fight with me?</p><p></p><p>I, the Jade Little Dragon, have the bloodline of the flood dragon!</p><p></p><p>One day, I will molt into a flood dragon, and then transform into a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The spiritual beast's aura burst forth, the Jade Little Dragon instantly recovered its true form, transforming into a giant snake over ten zhang long, raising its head and hissing, looking down upon the Red Cat from above.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Red Cat seemed so small under its massive body, as if it could be swallowed whole in one bite.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat let out a roar, not backing down, with a rumbling sound, a huge, spotted tiger appeared, its size like a small mountain, even taller than the Jade Little Dragon's raised head.</p><p></p><p>The great demon's might was revealed, demonic energy surging, the aura of the king of beasts also emerged.</p><p></p><p>A pair of tiger eyes looked down upon the Jade Little Dragon's raised head.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon was stunned, turning back to look at Xu Yan, bewildered, "Isn't it a cat?"</p><p></p><p>"More or less," Xu Yan thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was just a cat normally, and not long ago, it had even been picked up by the tail by its mother.</p><p></p><p>So the Red Cat is a cat, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a very sensible cat, knowing how to curry favor with people, otherwise with its great demon physique, its mother's strength would not necessarily be able to pick it up.</p><p></p><p>This is the Red Cat, willingly letting itself be picked up.</p><p></p><p>Slap! The Red Cat struck out with its paws, and the Jade Little Dragon didn't back down either, turning into a beam of light and disappearing from the spot, then shooting towards the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>It was known for its speed.</p><p></p><p>The agile Red Cat, with its speed as a great demon, revealed its power for the first time. </p><p></p><p>Opening its mouth, it roared out a demonic force, forcing the Jade Little Dragon to hastily dodge.</p><p></p><p>The snake and the tiger took to the sky, battling in the air above Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat had just molted into a great demon, but its strength was growing every day, especially its demonic physique, which was extremely formidable, not weaker than Meng Chong's Golden Body of the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, demonic energy surged, demonic forces clashed, the Red Cat swung its claws, unleashing a series of demonic claw strikes, its form twisting and turning, occasionally spitting out demonic energy from its mouth.</p><p></p><p>There was also a wind that seemed to be circling around it, as if it was riding the wind.</p><p></p><p>Its tail was like a steel whip, taking advantage of the Jade Little Dragon's unpreparedness, the tail suddenly extended to hundreds of zhang, slapping the flying Jade Little Dragon away with a crack.</p><p></p><p>This was a contest between a spiritual beast and a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was silently watching, Xu Yan and the others were also watching.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon's attacks seemed a bit monotonous, its tail couldn't beat the Red Cat, and its lightning-like speed also didn't give it much of an advantage, and the Red Cat's physique was too sturdy for it to severely injure.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's paw strikes left imprints, and in its leaps, one could even see the shadows of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Under the divine sense, Li Xuan and Xu Yan both sensed that the Red Cat had several acupoints filled with demonic might, ready to be unleashed at any time, the great demon's killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Inherited from its previous status as the king of tigers, the predatory techniques it had before molting into a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Jade Little Dragon's body grew larger again, its body shining with a crystalline light, and the protrusion on its head emitting a dazzling light over a zhang long...</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat let out a low roar, a scarlet light surging from its spotted tiger body, it slightly crouched down, then suddenly pounced forward.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon's head-mounted beam of light slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The pouncing Red Cat, suddenly, a fierce tiger's shadow appeared in front of it.</p><p></p><p>The tiger's shadow brought its paws down with a boom, colliding with the Jade Little Dragon's slashing light beam.</p><p></p><p>Both attacks were dispersed.</p><p></p><p>However, the Red Cat's true body, hidden behind the tiger's shadow, had already pounced towards the Jade Little Dragon from the side, a huge paw print slamming the unprepared Jade Little Dragon away.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Red Cat opened its mouth and spewed out a demonic force, directly blasting the Jade Little Dragon into the Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>The victory was decided!</p><p></p><p>The proud Red Cat returned, not having disgraced Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat's strength has become this powerful, huh," Suli sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although her strength was still superior to the Red Cat's, it had become difficult to suppress the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was even more depressed, the Red Cat had become so strong, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch up.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he must curry favor with the Red Cat, or else he would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of realm, the snake should be higher than the cat, right?" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, the Red Cat was at the Penetrating Mystery realm, it was just that it had been eating elixirs every day, and as a great demon, it had started from eating waste elixirs, so taking elixirs was its path to rapid advancement.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't suffer from indigestion from eating too many elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method of great demons had its own peculiarities, the Red Cat's cultivation method was in opening the great demon acupoints, constantly undergoing metamorphosis, and even having great demon techniques contained within the acupoints.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was the first great demon, with a special fate, so its strength would naturally be stronger.</p><p></p><p>Being able to defeat the Jade Little Dragon was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon's attack methods were related to its spiritual beast nature, relatively simple, while the Red Cat's great demon techniques were more varied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the red cat even displayed its martial arts techniques with its claws.</p><p></p><p>Jade Dragon had just returned from the Cangjiang River, but now it had shrunk in size, looking at the red cat in disbelief, realizing that it was not a match for this chubby cat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the red cat's methods had a hint of martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Was this the great demonic technique that Xu Yan had mentioned? The clash between the red cat and Jade Dragon was just a minor skirmish, merely for entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan took out all the storage bags on his body, plundering the Dai family's treasure trove, not even finished counting them yet.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to recount his experiences in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The key point was the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's tomb, and he also took out the Flood Dragon's corpse, causing everyone to be greatly shocked by the massive Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family, because of his parents' presence, Xu Yan did not want his parents to worry, so he did not mention it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he talked about the matter of emptying the Dai family's treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother and junior sister, you should not lack spiritual resources and cultivation foundation now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan divided the storage bags he had plundered from the Dai family's treasure trove, and everyone began to excitedly count the gains.</p><p></p><p>"This is a high-grade spirit medicine, a Grade One spirit medicine!"</p><p></p><p>"So many Grade Two spirit medicines?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a spiritual artifact from the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the Dai family's treasure trove was indeed impressive, with not a few Grade One spirit medicines, and even more numerous Grade Five or Six spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is a spiritual tea from the Spirit Realm, you should try it."</p><p></p><p>While counting the Dai family's treasures, they found a large jar of spiritual tea, which was clearly not ordinary spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>At least Grade Three or above.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, well done!" Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xu Yan's harvest in the Spirit Realm was huge, with so many treasures. Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu would not lack spiritual resources and cultivation foundation, and could break through the Divine Sense Realm faster.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Junhe and the others, with the help of higher-grade elixirs, they could also break through the Penetrating Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Canglan Island became very lively.</p><p></p><p>Many spirit medicines were piled up and handed over to Su Ling Xiu to organize. There were so many spirit medicines that only Su Ling Xiu could understand their uses and effects.</p><p></p><p>For Su Ling Xiu, most of these numerous spirit medicines were unfamiliar to her.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she had the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, so she could discern the effects and characteristics of each spirit medicine, and then categorize and record the uses of these spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>She even combined them to create more miraculous elixir formulas, such as those that could restore and enhance the Divine Sense.</p><p></p><p>Organizing the spirit medicines required some time, but Su Ling Xiu was busy and happy.</p><p></p><p>After reuniting with his parents, Xu Yan and his disciples stood on the peak of Canglan Island, and Xu Yan finally recounted the full experience of his trip to the Spirit Realm, including the pursuit by the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect and the Su family are truly unreasonable. When we go to the Spirit Realm, we'll settle the score with them," Meng Chong said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"So the Spirit Realm has such a strict hierarchy, with the spirit sects and great families standing high above," Su Ling Xiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>The matter of establishing the Evergreen Pavilion in the Spirit Realm needed to be postponed for now, otherwise it might attract the coveting of the spirit sects and great families, or even the attention of the Transcendent Spirit Sects.</p><p></p><p>"Every martial dao peak expert has stepped on countless stepping stones to reach the summit, be it the Inner Realm or the Spirit Realm, the strong will always be respected in the end. The hierarchy in the Spirit Realm is just more severe," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others nodded silently, their master's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>The lower-level martial artists in the Inner Realm also struggled, after all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Inner Realm was not as severe as the Spirit Realm, where the hierarchy was so strict. In the Inner Realm, as long as the scattered cultivators had sufficient strength, they could stand on equal footing with the powerful figures of the major forces, without the distinction of superiority and inferiority.</p><p></p><p>But in the Spirit Realm, even if one was a Refined Spirit Celestial, as long as they were a scattered cultivator, they could not stand on equal footing with the spirit sects and great families, and could still feel the condescension from them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can spirit beasts cultivate the Great Demonic Martial Dao?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"In theory, it is possible," Li Xuan nodded and said, "That snake has some talent. If it cultivates the Great Demonic Martial Dao, it should not be difficult for it to transform into a Flood Dragon. Whether it can become a true dragon depends on its own fate."</p><p></p><p>"Then let it settle down and get familiar with the red cat first before we consider it," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan said so, Li Xuan did not use any demonic techniques to teach the Jade Dragon the Great Demonic Martial Dao, letting the snake get accustomed to things first.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Canglan Island was as usual. Xu Yan was in seclusion, consolidating his comprehension and further improving his strength, summarizing the experience of killing Refined Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>He also occasionally guided Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu on how to transform and sublimate themselves when breaking through the Divine Sense Realm, fulfilling the responsibilities of a senior brother.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Xu Yan also occasionally guided the red cat's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demonic Martial Dao was also a martial dao, and Xu Yan was the true pioneer of martial dao, with a monstrous talent and keen insight. After mastering the Great Demonic Martial Dao, he could naturally give the red cat some guidance.</p><p></p><p>As for Jade Dragon, it was currently suffering a blow and had gone somewhere to doubt its snake life.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the red cat contemplating the formation diagram, Xu Yan stared at it for a while, seeming to have some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Have you figured something out?" Li Xuan asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan's talent might not be focused on the esoteric martial arts, formations were part of the esoteric martial arts system, so perhaps Xu Yan could gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>"There are some insights, but they need time to settle before I can understand them," Xu Yan said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, not asking further. Since Xu Yan said he had some insights, he would surely gain some harvests after settling them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu also studied the formation diagram for a few days.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they had any insights, they probably did have some, as Xu Yan was constantly consolidating his own martial dao, and although he was still far from breaking through the Divine Sense Realm, his strength was growing every day.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu were also accumulating their cultivation foundation, and their strength was also improving.</p><p></p><p>Even the red cat was the same.</p><p></p><p>One day, Xu Yan was having a meal with his mother, and the red cat was lying next to Xu's mother like a fat orange cat, with a formation diagram and some writing in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and said, "Red cat, your contemplation of the formation diagram is useless, you won't gain anything from it, your talent is just like that.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to gain something, you should try to draw the formation diagram into one of your acupoints. If you succeed, you might be able to understand something."</p><p></p><p>The red cat was stunned for a moment, then became pensive.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and continued, "Of course, you don't need to completely copy the formation diagram. Follow your own spiritual inspiration to draw the formation patterns that you can draw into the acupoint, and don't bother with the ones you can't draw.</p><p></p><p>"After drawing all the formation patterns you can draw into the acupoint, then take the time to connect them into a complete formation diagram."</p><p></p><p>The red cat meowed excitedly, indicating its gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Whether the red cat could succeed or not depended entirely on its own talent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan just treated the red cat like a cat since he saw his own mother, and the red cat was also very close to his mother, so he gave it some more guidance.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm storyline was beginning to wrap up, preparing to unfold the Spirit Realm storyline, and Xu Yan was a bit stuck in writing...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

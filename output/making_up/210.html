        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's spiritual energy consumption was not small, and it took him a long time to painstakingly write one-third of the patterns into the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>As he stopped writing the patterns, the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book came.</p><p></p><p>Laws of Heaven and Earth (Incomplete):</p><p>Perfection Degree: Comprehension Difficulty:</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan saw the feedback information given by the Great Dao Golden Book, he was immediately shocked.</p><p></p><p>Laws of Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>On the Great Dao Golden Book, the perfection degree and comprehension difficulty of the Laws of Heaven and Earth were blank, without any evaluation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, the Great Dao Golden Book did not give an evaluation because these Laws of Heaven and Earth were not created by him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Great Dao Golden Book only gave feedback on the patterns, but did not give an evaluation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew his spiritual sense from the Great Dao Golden Book, his eyes filled with shock as he looked at the ancient Taiyang leather book in his hand. The patterns drawn on it were actually the Laws of Heaven and Earth? No wonder they were so profound, he couldn't understand them at all, his realm was too low, how could he understand? This also explained why the patterns gave people a sense of constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Taiyang leather book contained the Laws of Heaven and Earth, if he could comprehend them, it would directly point to the profound mysteries of the origin of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining the ancient leather book, he had been studying the patterns on the first page, occasionally gaining some insights. Each time he focused on studying them, he would have a sense of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The patterns depicted the Laws of Heaven and Earth, so it was not difficult to understand why the patterns had the outlines of landforms, environments, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The Laws of Heaven and Earth naturally encompass everything in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The ancient leather book could contain the Laws of Heaven and Earth, which meant that the leather used must not be ordinary animal skin, but probably the skin of an extremely powerful beast.</p><p></p><p>"Taiyang."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan looked at the two characters "Taiyang" on the ancient leather book, he suddenly had some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Borderlands or the Inner Domain, including the Spiritual Realm, they were actually just a part of the Taiyang world. The heaven and earth he was in was called the Taiyang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"This Taiyang book records the Laws of Taiyang Heaven and Earth, but it is unknown who authored it. Such a precious treasure, whether it was deliberately hidden or not, the signs all indicate that the martial arts power of the Taiyang world is absolutely strong, and may have declined for some reason.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Domain, the Spiritual Realm... the gate of the Spiritual Realm is the portal between the Inner Domain and the Spiritual Realm, separating the two realms.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the original state of the Taiyang world, or was it deliberately done by someone?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's emotions were in turmoil, and various doubts and mysteries surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Laws of Heaven and Earth, if comprehended, could one wield the Laws of Heaven and Earth? What a realm, what a powerful expert would be able to do that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed as he looked at the Taiyang book.</p><p></p><p>After his spiritual energy recovered, Li Xuan opened the Great Dao Golden Book again and wrote the first pattern of the Taiyang book into it, obtaining all the information of the first page of the Taiyang book.</p><p></p><p>Last time he wrote in one-third, the Great Dao Golden Book gave feedback on the incomplete Laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>If the complete patterns were written in, would it mean the complete Laws of Heaven and Earth? The first page was the Laws of Heaven and Earth, what were the patterns on the following pages? Writing the patterns consumed a lot of his spiritual energy, so Li Xuan had to write them in slowly, resting and recovering his consumed spiritual energy after each session.</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Great Dao Golden Book was open, and Li Xuan's spiritual form seemed to stretch out a hand, drawing something on it.</p><p></p><p>It took him three days to finally write all the patterns on the first page into the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>As he stopped writing the patterns, the Great Dao Golden Book glowed with golden light.</p><p></p><p>Laws of Heaven and Earth (Partial):</p><p>Perfection Degree: Comprehension Difficulty:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the feedback information from the Great Dao Golden Book, Li Xuan let out a breath. The first page was the complete part of the Laws of Heaven and Earth, which meant the following patterns in the Taiyang book were also the Laws of Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>"I have a book that records the Laws of Heaven and Earth in my hands, I must make use of it. I can start from the Laws of Heaven and Earth and create a new martial art."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The mystery of the Taiyang book had finally been solved.</p><p></p><p>However, the Laws of Heaven and Earth were too profound, even though he had reached the Spiritual Sense Realm, he could not comprehend the subtleties within.</p><p></p><p>But with the Great Dao Golden Book, he could do some creation.</p><p></p><p>"I have the Pure Martial Dao, the Flesh Martial Dao, and the Alchemy Martial Dao, and I've even created some elixirs. What's missing now is the Weapon Forging Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Weapon Forging Dao? How to forge weapons? I want to incorporate the Laws of Heaven and Earth into it and make use of it. But merely forging weapons is not enough.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to forging, I'm also missing formations and seals..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Forging, formations, seals... these were what he was currently lacking. How could he create them?</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Domain, there were forging masters who could forge precious weapons, but it was not a martial dao, and not powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>As for formations and seals, the Inner Domain had never heard of them.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Spiritual Realm had them, he did not know. At least for now, they did not exist in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>As for the art of military formations, the formations in the Inner Domain were also very ordinary, far from the Dao of Formations he had in mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Martial Dao can be considered the fourth martial dao, it is not a cultivation path for humans, but for beasts. Once the Crimson Cat completes its transformation, this martial dao will emerge."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, "'Weapon Formation Martial Dao'? 'Array Weapon Martial Dao'? That sounds a bit ordinary. Just forging weapons cannot display great power, but the Laws of Heaven and Earth can be used in the Dao of Formations.</p><p></p><p>"No, forging weapons can also be useful, like forging storage bags, storage rings, and so on. In addition to materials, the Laws of Heaven and Earth can also be utilized.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Laws of Heaven and Earth are too high-level, how can I apply them in a way that even those with low cultivation can use?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more Li Xuan felt troubled. Forging weapons without integrating it with formations would not be powerful enough, but if he integrated it with the Dao of Formations, the two did not seem to be of the same nature.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time without any breakthrough, Li Xuan sighed and turned his attention back to the Taiyang book, flipping to the second page.</p><p></p><p>He decided to memorize all the patterns in the Taiyang book.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit difficult, and he could only remember the forms of the patterns without grasping their true profundity, once his realm was elevated, and he could truly comprehend the Laws of Heaven and Earth, he would naturally gain insights into their mysteries.</p><p></p><p>The patterns on the second page had a slightly different feeling compared to when he first saw them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was seeing a formation, or perhaps a trap formed by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Li Xuan seemed to see some changes in the patterns.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, array..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured a few words, and suddenly a flash of inspiration struck his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Bizarre Celestial Techniques."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Li Xuan thought of the Bizarre Celestial Techniques, with 4,320 formations...</p><p></p><p>"I've found the new martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became excited.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found a way to utilize the Laws of Heaven and Earth to create a new martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's forging weapons or formations, using oneself as the formation, using oneself as the array, with weapons as the auxiliary... Forging, Formation, and the Great Celestial Array.</p><p></p><p>"Using all things as the array, using heaven and earth as the formation - the Bizarre Celestial Martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was invigorated in his heart. He had finally found the way to create a new martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The direction and name of the new martial art had been determined.</p><p></p><p>Qimen Martial Arts! It includes forging weapons, array formations, and more.</p><p></p><p>"Qimen Martial Arts, taking an unconventional approach, harnessing the great momentum, setting up strange formations... Since it's Qimen, we can't take the normal path. The tempering of the skin, bones, and organs in martial arts can all be discarded.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, my fourth disciple will certainly not be one without any martial arts foundation, so we must abandon the conventional path and not walk the common road.</p><p></p><p>"Use the weapon as the body? Or fuse the weapon with oneself? Or we can integrate the weapon into one's own body, allowing it to be changed and upgraded...</p><p></p><p>"Use the weapon to set up formations, with the great momentum of heaven and earth as the battlefield... One move, one scheme, every step full of killing intent?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan followed this line of thought, he became more and more excited, as if a new door had been opened, revealing a different landscape.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts don't necessarily have to be done step-by-step, nor do they have to be limited to cultivating one's own body. We can cultivate other things and then feed back into our own body, taking an unconventional path.</p><p></p><p>"Though the paths may differ, they will eventually converge. But in the initial stage, they can be different."</p><p></p><p>After determining the name of the new martial art and the direction of its compilation, Li Xuan was greatly excited and began to prepare the creation of Qimen Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Compiling Qimen Martial Arts will take a lot of time, even though I have the Great Dao Golden Book to assist me, gradually filling in and correcting it until I'm satisfied with the martial arts method.</p><p></p><p>"But using the Great Dao Golden Book requires consuming spiritual will, and the daily usage time is limited. Moreover, I don't know where to find disciples who can cultivate Qimen Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath. Qimen Martial Arts should be put on the agenda and gradually perfected.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not the most urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not yet found a suitable disciple.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate Qimen Martial Arts, the disciple must have exceptional comprehension, as well as keen insight into forging weapons and terrain formations, which are the necessary talents for the array formations and schemes of Qimen Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Among the three disciples, Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu were not suitable for Qimen Martial Arts and could not cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he was a prodigy, but he was cultivating the pure martial dao, the true great way of martial arts, and his martial foundation had already been determined.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason to have him cultivate Qimen Martial Arts as well.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a fourth disciple yet, so I need to compile Qimen Martial Arts, but I should first compile the next stage of the physical martial arts cultivation method for Meng Chong."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, the main focus would be on Meng Chong's physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He would compile the subsequent cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already reached the Penetrating Profound realm, so it was time to pass on the next martial arts cultivation method to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the Taicangshu, withdrawing the spiritual will from the Great Dao Golden Book, and began to recover the consumed spiritual power while contemplating the issue of the subsequent cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"The physical martial arts must maintain uniqueness in order to appear powerful."</p><p></p><p>Above the Penetrating Profound realm is the Spiritual Will realm, refining spiritual will, refining the will of heaven and earth as one's own.</p><p></p><p>Opening the Mud Pill Palace, nurturing the Spiritual Platform.</p><p></p><p>As for physical martial arts, they ultimately focus on the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"The physical martial arts will also open the Mud Pill Palace, but unlike the pure martial dao, the Mud Pill Palace of the physical martial arts is the dwelling place of the physical divine treasure..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, being a Spiritual Will realm martial artist, and the physical martial arts having already reached the Penetrating Profound realm with the Great Sun Golden Body fully mastered, quickly found the direction for the subsequent cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not about compiling a completely new martial art. With a solid foundation, the subsequent cultivation method would be relatively easier to compile.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the assistance of the Great Dao Golden Book, he could write the cultivation method and then, based on the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book, make gradual corrections to make it more complete.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Body is divided into two cultivation stages, corresponding to the Innate Realm and the Penetrating Profound Realm. The subsequent cultivation method can also be compiled in this way.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation direction of the physical martial arts is roughly determined - the Great Sun Golden Bell will be advanced to the Great Sun Golden Body, and the Great Sun Golden Body will be advanced to the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>After the thought process was opened up, Li Xuan had determined the name for the advancement of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>The advanced version of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body will be divided into three stages, with each stage being a layer. The first layer corresponds to the Spiritual Will realm, and the second and third layers correspond to realms above the Spiritual Will realm..."</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet determined the martial arts above the Spiritual Will realm, this did not hinder him from compiling the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the Great Dao Golden Book, he could completely compile it, making the cultivation method more complete, with a seamless connection between the realms, allowing for a smooth cultivation progression.</p><p></p><p>"The first layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body will naturally be the refinement of spiritual will, but the spiritual will of the physical martial arts is different from the pure martial dao. The spiritual will form resides within the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Without breaking the physical defense, one cannot harm the spiritual will. And if one injures the physical body but lacks the means to attack the spiritual will, one cannot harm the spiritual will either..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's thoughts became increasingly active.</p><p></p><p>The first layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body will be the refinement of spiritual will, refining the will of heaven and earth, but the spiritual will of the physical martial arts is not in the Spiritual Platform, but in the Golden Body acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Golden Body can transform into a three-zhang (about 10 feet) giant, and the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body will naturally have some mysteries as well.</p><p></p><p>"Indestructible Divine Armor? That's it, once activated, the physical body will refine the Indestructible Divine Armor."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's thoughts became more and more expansive, and the theoretical framework of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body was gradually being constructed and perfected.</p><p></p><p>Once the theory was compiled, he would write it into the Great Dao Golden Book, obtain feedback, and make corrections based on the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Strive to make the cultivation method reach an above-average level of completeness.</p><p></p><p>This would also reduce the difficulty of cultivation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>In this way, there would be no need to worry about the disciples being unable to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Compiling martial arts cultivation methods is truly exhausting. The creators of martial arts must all be prodigies. I wonder how the first person who cultivated a powerful martial art managed to do it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed deeply in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor, he deeply recognized how difficult it was to create martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He could only rely on his disciples to cultivate the martial arts he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>While Li Xuan was compiling the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body cultivation method, Xu Yan and Meng Chong in the Seven Star Academy were filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Their master had single-handedly dominated the world? The peak great masters above the Inner Domain had gathered the great momentum of the world, intimidating Canglan Island and even forming the Overthrow Heaven Alliance, intending to rebel against the Martial Dao Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Yet their master did not use his realm to oppress others, but with the Penetrating Profound realm, swept away the invincible, suppressing the world.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the Inner Domain martial arts circle, the rumor was that the Overthrow Heaven Alliance was an evil force, and the Martial Dao Celestial elders were upright and wise, slaying the Overthrow Heaven Alliance and restoring order and righteousness to the martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>"Master is truly unrivaled within his realm!" Xu Yan admired with praise.</p><p></p><p>He knew that with his current strength, he could never achieve what his master had done, casually overpowering so many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>And his master had not even used any martial arts divine arts of the Extinguish Deity level!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

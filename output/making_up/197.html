        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The place Du Yuying went to was the Tomb of the Celestial Warriors. Li Xuan couldn't help but think that the place Ziyun went to might also be the Tomb of the Celestial Warriors.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the Inner Realm did not have any Celestial Warriors.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the conditions to become a Celestial Warrior were not met. The specific reasons were unknown.</p><p></p><p>"If it really is the Tomb of the Celestial Warriors, then when Xu Yan goes there, he should be able to find out why there are no Celestial Warriors in the Inner Realm," Li Xuan thought.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan left, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, following Li Xuan's guidance on the Dao of the Sword, also took their leave and returned to Mount Sword Sovereign to continue their arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>They also brought back some medicinal pills needed for the refinement of the Heaven and Earth Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Mount Sword Sovereign specialized in the Dao of the Sword, and they did not have any conflicts with the martial arts of the Inner Realm or the Great Desolation. As long as the cultivation could enhance their sword dao and aid their comprehension of the sword, they would cultivate whichever martial art.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the genius of Mount Sword Sovereign, Xie Lingfeng, had no psychological burden in switching his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods of Mount Sword Sovereign were born for the Dao of the Sword. After being passed down through generations, the cultivation techniques were no longer the original ones, but had been continuously refined to be more suitable for the sword dao and to better unleash the power of the sword.</p><p></p><p>With Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan's departure, Canglan Island became tranquil, except for the occasional liveliness in the alchemy house.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan would occasionally sail on the Cangjiang River, fishing until night, enjoying the leisurely time.</p><p></p><p>But in the Inner Realm, a storm was brewing.</p><p></p><p>In the Zi Yun Kingdom, high up in the mountains, in the center of a lake, stood a crystal-clear ice palace.</p><p></p><p>The ice palace was translucent, exuding a chilling aura. The people residing in the ice palace were dressed lightly, with graceful figures, walking amidst the icy frost, their snow-white skin contrasting beautifully with the crystalline ice.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the ice palace, a bewitching woman in thin gauze lay on an icy chair. On her left and right were two young maidens, completely naked, curled up on the woman's body, their delicate frames shivering in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>The bewitching woman's hands caressed the bodies of the two young girls. Her enchanting face had an unhealthy reddish glow, and her eyes held a near-frenzied fervor.</p><p></p><p>A figure slowly approached, and even while walking, his hands were still carving wood, with wood shavings constantly flying out.</p><p></p><p>"Ice Maiden, you're still the same as always," the Demon Child sighed as he stood atop the ice palace.</p><p></p><p>"You old thing, what are you here for?" the Ice Maiden coldly asked, withdrawing a hand dripping with liquid.</p><p></p><p>As she withdrew her hand, the small, curled-up figures on her body suddenly became flushed and began to convulse violently. Gradually, their delicate frames shriveled up.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden, on the other hand, became even more bewitching. Her skin grew even purer white, and the fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes disappeared, making her seem ten years younger.</p><p></p><p>The other curled-up figure trembled more and more violently, opening her mouth as if wanting to beg, but unable to make a sound. Slowly, her skin flushed red, her body convulsed, and she too shriveled up.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child silently watched this scene. The Ice Maiden had grown old and needed to devour the essence of young girls to maintain her youthful and delicate appearance.</p><p></p><p>Two women in white gauze robes came up to the ice palace and took the lifeless bodies away.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden lay on the chair in an indecent pose, facing the Demon Child, a mocking flush on her bewitching face.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Child, have you become useless?" she sneered.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child's carving hand paused, his facial muscles twitching. Looking at the Ice Maiden's barely covered form, he was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He had already approached the realm of the Celestial Warriors, yet he was useless? </p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was useless now.</p><p></p><p>She had truly grown old, and he didn't feel the slightest bit of desire, not even a tiny bit.</p><p></p><p>"Waste!" the Ice Maiden mocked.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child reached into his robe and took out a scroll, placing it on the Ice Maiden's bosom. He spoke softly, "Ice Maiden, when you learn of my death, burn this scroll and use your martial arts to activate the jade pearl hidden within."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden looked at the scroll in silence.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child turned to leave, saying, "If I don't die, we both have a chance to enter the Spiritual Realm. If I do die, you should follow my instructions, burn the scroll, activate the jade pearl, and find a way to enter the Spiritual Realm yourself."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden suddenly stood up. "What are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't get involved. In the end, someone needs to avenge us, and that scroll is for you to keep safe," the Demon Child shook his head and left.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Demon Child's aging figure disappear into the distance, the Ice Maiden looked at the scroll in her hand, silent for a long time, before suddenly speaking, "Bring me two tender young girls."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, mistress!" a woman's voice responded from within the ice palace.</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace of the Great Yue Kingdom, in the imperial study, the Great Yue Emperor looked at the red-robed, blue-faced man with a changing expression, hoarsely saying, "I do not want the Great Yue Kingdom to be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed, blue-faced man smiled and said, "Great Yue Emperor, don't you want to break through beyond the Grand Master realm? This time, it is not just about the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spiritual Realm, the realm of the Celestial Warriors, the opportunity lies on Canglan Island, in Suling Xiu."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor abruptly stood up, shocked, "What did you say? The gate to the Spiritual Realm? The realm of the Celestial Warriors?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master realm was already the pinnacle of the martial arts in the Inner Realm, a widely recognized fact.</p><p></p><p>Even being half a step away from the Celestial Warriors was still considered within the Grand Master realm, just having taken a half-step forward.</p><p></p><p>However, that was the end of the road. </p><p></p><p>No further progress could be made.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spiritual Realm, the legends of the Celestial Warriors, the Great Yue Emperor had never heard of them, and most likely the countless powers and Grand Masters of the Inner Realm had not heard of them either.</p><p></p><p>The elusive Grand Masters at the peak, the common understanding was that they were in search of the path of martial arts, and that was why their whereabouts were so difficult to find, with them rarely making a move.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Grand Master realm lies the realm of the Celestial Warriors, and to enter the realm of the Celestial Warriors, one must pass through the gate to the Spiritual Realm. The Inner Realm has no way to break through, the path is blocked.</p><p></p><p>"The path lies within the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"On Canglan Island, that person is most likely a true Celestial Warrior, and Suling Xiu is the opportunity to enter the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The various Grand Masters of the Inner Realm, how can they allow a Celestial Warrior to block their path forward?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed, blue-faced man spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Warrior?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was greatly shaken. No wonder dozens of peak Grand Masters had been killed without any escaping.</p><p></p><p>"Gather the might of all the Grand Masters, force the Celestial Warrior to make way, or evenâ€”kill the Celestial Warrior to open the gate to the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed, blue-faced man's eyes burned with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>"A Celestial Warrior, no matter how strong, cannot suppress the entire world alone. We half-step Celestial Warriors will all join the fight!"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed, blue-faced man said somewhat crazily.</p><p></p><p>"Good! The Great Yue Kingdom will go all out!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Spread the news of the gate to the Spiritual Realm and the Celestial Warrior far and wide, let the powers of the Inner Realm gather, and let's see how the Celestial Warrior will fare!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in the red robe and blue face spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, many powerful factions and great masters had received news that there was a path beyond the realm of great masters.</p><p></p><p>To open the gate to the spiritual domain and enter the realm of celestial beings!</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion's master, Su Lingxiu, was the key to opening the gate to the spiritual domain. On Canglan Island, a celestial being of the Dao was controlling Su Lingxiu, wanting to monopolize the gate to the spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>Seize Canglan Island, hand over Su Lingxiu, and the entire world can share the gate to the spiritual domain, opening the path beyond the great masters!</p><p></p><p>The gate to the spiritual domain, a legendary event of celestial beings, was spreading more and more within the inner domain under the push of various factions. More and more great masters learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island had become the center of attention in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was seen as the key to opening the gate to the spiritual domain!</p><p></p><p>Many powerful factions gathered, the great masters of the inner domain gathered, and at this time, those who were half-step celestial beings emerged. One after another, some peak great masters who were thought to have died appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they all showed themselves.</p><p></p><p>The notorious Devil Cult's Devil Child, the remaining Devil Sovereigns, also appeared one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Dowager Empress of the Great Yue Kingdom, although extremely old and with little life left, also came out of the imperial mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>The imperial family of the Yan Kingdom also produced a half-step celestial being.</p><p></p><p>The Taishang Huang of the Purple Cloud Kingdom also emerged, one after another, the once mighty and renowned experts appeared.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao world of the inner domain was shaken! Countless great masters were both shocked and exhilarated, vowing to force Canglan Island to hand over the person and share the opportunity of the gate to the spiritual domain! One powerful faction and clan after another emerged, the great situation in the inner domain seemed to have converged, wanting to use the great momentum of the world to suppress Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, Bai Yunxu sat quietly under an ancient tea tree, sipping tea.</p><p></p><p>Two figures approached.</p><p></p><p>"Academy Master, the gate to the spiritual domain, the matter of celestial beings, how should our Seven Star Academy handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu coldly said, "Hasn't our Seven Star Academy's principle of not interfering in the disputes of the martial dao world been forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>"This is not a dispute in the martial dao world, this is about the future path of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>One person said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The path has always been there, the gate to the spiritual domain is elusive and difficult to find. Who can enter it? If one enters, can they become a celestial being? Can a first-rank martial artist become a master? Can masters become great masters?</p><p></p><p>"The principle of the Seven Star Academy cannot be violated."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Academy Master, taking a gamble still has a chance, if we don't take a chance, we'll have no chance at all. I'm not satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if we don't take a chance, we'll be unsatisfied!"</p><p></p><p>The two people said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu looked at the two of them, sighed and said, "The opportunity is not far, and celestial beings are not the only path. I've said enough, do as you will!"</p><p></p><p>"Academy Master, you are too stubborn. This opportunity, I will not miss!"</p><p></p><p>"Academy Master, stubbornly guarding the principle, that is your choice!"</p><p></p><p>The two people turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu tapped his fingers on the table, as if hesitating to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair and a youthful face, except for his pitch-black eye sockets, came over holding a fan.</p><p></p><p>"Fussing and fretting, what is there to hesitate about? The principle of our Seven Star Academy cannot be violated. Those who violate the principle are no longer part of our Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxu gave a bitter smile, "It's easy for you to say, as you are not the Academy Master. Alright, those who do not adhere to the heart do not need to stay."</p><p></p><p>That day, Seven Star Academy's master Bai Yunxu issued an order, expelling the two deputy masters who wanted to participate in the attack on Canglan Island from the Seven Star Academy! </p><p></p><p>And on that day, many great masters left the Seven Star Academy, and more than half of the familiar senior disciples disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the spiritual domain, the realm of celestial beings, was too tempting for martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Even facing true Dao celestial beings, under the pressure of the gathered great masters of the world, their fear had been cast aside.</p><p></p><p>Their hot blood was surging, as if they were young martial artists just starting out, killing celestial beings, opening the gate to the spiritual domain, and becoming renowned in the history of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>In the northern region, known as the edge of the inner domain, the vast expanse of white stretched out, with towering peaks at the end. Even if one crossed the peaks, they would find themselves in another part of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>This was the end, the truly bitter and cold land. Even master martial artists dared not linger here for too long.</p><p></p><p>One of the peaks had been hollowed out, with buildings built up the mountain, pavilions, towers, elegant rooms, and gardens.</p><p></p><p>In a garden high up, it was as warm as spring, with spiritual herbs and even a fifth-grade spiritual herb, the Heavenly Dew Marrow.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were more than a dozen figures sitting in the garden, led by a man wearing a purple crown, who looked refined and amiable, but was holding an abacus.</p><p></p><p>Among them were two who had appeared in Iron Mountain County, the half-step celestial beings of the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was the headquarters of the Tianbao Pavilion! The man in the purple crown chuckled and said, "Since the ancient inner domain dynasties gathered martial artists to form the Extermination Alliance, there has never been such a grand occasion again.</p><p></p><p>"You two have met him, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>All present looked at the two who had been to Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he is a Dao celestial being, I cannot tell, but the feeling he gave me was unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>One of them said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"With a wave of his hand, he directly destroyed Quejue's spiritual consciousness, such a technique, perhaps even the ancient Devil Sovereign did not possess!"</p><p></p><p>The other one sighed.</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple crown nodded, self-deprecatingly smiled and said, "Everyone wants to enter the gate to the spiritual domain, but do they know that the gate is not easy to enter? Martial artists from the inner domain entering it are like pigs and dogs."</p><p></p><p>The people present all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, what is the situation with Su Lingxiu?"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple crown was silent for a moment, then said solemnly, "The one who came out of the gate to the spiritual domain twenty years ago should be his bloodline. The matter of the Hidden Tower was also a task passed down from within the spiritual domain."</p><p></p><p>The people present were all stunned, their minds recalling the graceful young man from twenty years ago who claimed to be visiting the inner domain, and the Pavilion Master had personally received him with great respect.</p><p></p><p>"If he is that person's bloodline, why did the Hidden Tower kill Su Zhen?"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple crown pondered for a while and said, "The one who gave the task to the Hidden Tower was not that person. This matter is too deeply involved, not something you and I can discuss."</p><p></p><p>He then sneered and said, "The Hidden Tower's master really thought that by completing the task and entering the gate to the spiritual domain, he could become a celestial being? He doesn't even have the chance to become a pig or a dog!"</p><p></p><p>The rest fell silent. The Pavilion Master had entered the spiritual domain, but did not become a Dao celestial being, seemingly becoming a dog for some in the spiritual domain. As for whether they could break this situation, they felt they did not have the ability.</p><p></p><p>In their minds, an image of a young man emerged - perhaps he could enter the spiritual domain and break this situation? Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>At Jian Zun Cliff, a group of great masters had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, who was in seclusion cultivating the Dao of the Sword and felt he was close to the realm of Sword Heart Illumination, even with one foot already in that realm, was hurriedly called out by the anxious Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan deployed several divine abilities simultaneously, displaying an awe-inspiring might that shocked all around. The blood disciples and servants in the Great Mountain Cave were stunned. </p><p></p><p>After countless years of battling against the Qinghua Realm, they had never seen such a terrifying expert. Especially the blood children - their already pale faces grew even whiter, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's aura was simply too shocking and extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Child Ji's strength was not weak. It took a fair amount of my power to kill him with that palm strike," Li Xuan mused to himself. </p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable was indeed very powerful. However, he was even stronger, as his divine abilities and physical body had been amplified a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully. This is what divine ability means. Your master will only use one move!" Li Xuan's voice carried a heavenly authority.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and the others exclaimed excitedly, staring intently at their master below, who stood like a great mountain with wind and thunder in his hands, surrounded by divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a step forward, looking at the blood children and disciples preparing to flee below. He raised his hand and swept it down, unleashing his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Great Mountain martial artists, including the Great Mountain Emperor, widened their eyes in shock.</p><p></p><p>The Great Mountain Cave that had been guarded for ages began to shake and tremble. The cave filled with billowing blood qi was now submerged in majestic power.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi seemed to evaporate. That terrifying might directly engulfed the blood children, disciples and servants.</p><p></p><p>One could see fierce wind and thunder, a golden dragon sweeping across, and mysterious forces surging and aligning, purifying the vast blood qi.</p><p></p><p>There was also a terrifying force like an enormous furnace, melting everything away.</p><p></p><p>Never before had they seen such terrifying martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Divine ability?" The Great Mountain Emperor murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he seemed to vaguely sense the immense power and wonder contained in those two words.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues for several more paragraphs describing the aftermath of Li Xuan's attack and the reactions of various characters.]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked over and said, "Great Yue Emperor? Tell me about this Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Heavenly Cave was vastly different from the Heavenly Caves that appeared in the Spirit Realm. There was soil, vegetation, and the aura of heavenly laws on the ground, as if a small world or minor grotto-heaven had been carved out within this world's space.</p><p></p><p>The barrier between heaven and earth was not at the bottom of the Heavenly Cave, but at the top. At the top of the cave, which resembled a celestial dome, one could vaguely see a barrier blocking it off.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sensed the presence of the Dao principles within.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, you can just call me Great Yue!" the Great Yue Emperor hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>He then began to introduce this Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Yue Emperor's introduction, this Heavenly Cave had a long history. It existed even before he became a martial artist and founded the Great Yue Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that a calamity once befell heaven and earth, after which these holes in the sky and earth appeared. Initially there were no invaders, but later they discovered the Heavenly Caves and sought to invade this world.</p><p></p><p>"According to records, when the Heavenly Caves first appeared, some martial artists explored them and even wanted to use them to venture beyond this world, but none succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't until the outside enemies invaded that we realized the Heavenly Caves could be entered from the outside, but not exited from the inside... or rather, the living beings of this world could not leave.</p><p></p><p>"The purpose of the outside invaders was to occupy this world and plunder the origin essence of its living beings... They once caused countless disasters.</p><p></p><p>"Later, guarding the Heavenly Caves became an inevitable responsibility for martial artists of the Divine Realm. Over the years, more and more Heavenly Caves appeared, as if holes kept forming in the world.</p><p></p><p>"The three largest Heavenly Caves in the entire Qinghua Territory are also the most ancient ones..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently as the Great Yue Emperor narrated.</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Yue Emperor, a calamity had once befallen this world, though he did not know what kind of calamity it was.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Caves appeared after the calamity, while the invasion of outside enemies through the Heavenly Caves happened later.</p><p></p><p>"...Legend has it that the Netherworld Prison is also a world, seeking to devour our world. The Heavenly Caves in Qinghua Territory are all Netherworld Prison Caves, facing the invasion of Netherworld beings.</p><p></p><p>"As for more specific information, we don't know. After all, even Immortal Celestial Lords cannot explore what lies beyond this world."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor sighed as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Although Immortal Celestial Lords were powerful and long-lived as the heavens, they could not leave this world or explore beyond it. They still had their limitations.</p><p></p><p>At the end, he looked towards the expert.</p><p></p><p>Did the expert know about the world beyond?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others thought the same. Their master was an expert who had transcended this world, so surely no one understood the world beyond better than him?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm and said indifferently, "What lies beyond this world will be known when one's realm reaches that level. If your realm is not there, knowing is of no benefit."</p><p></p><p>As an expert, of course he knew everything. As for not telling them, that was because they were too weak, so knowing would be of no use.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor thought to himself that this was indeed a true expert who knew about the world beyond.</p><p></p><p>He then continued to describe the Great Yue Heavenly Cave, the great battles fought by generations guarding the cave, when Blood Children like Blood Child Ji appeared and what calamities they caused, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Netherworld Prison enemies in the Heavenly Cave have been wiped out now, we cannot stop the Netherworld Prison's invasion. They will surely send more powerful beings to enter, intending to occupy this Heavenly Cave again as a foothold for invading our world."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Cave can only withstand entities of limited strength entering. Currently, the strongest that can enter this Heavenly Cave from the outside is at the level of Blood Child Ji."</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the Great Yue Nation could guard the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if a Blood Spirit level expert came, it would be enough to crush the Qinghua Territory.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded upon hearing this. It was as he had expected - the outside invaders were ultimately restricted by the world's barrier. Those who were too powerful could not enter.</p><p></p><p>As for Netherworld Prison experts like Blood Child Ji, they were nothing more than a slap of the hand to him, not worth worrying about.</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Spirit level experts, regardless of how powerful they might be, since they could not enter this world, there was naturally no threat to speak of.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, you can set up a great formation in the Heavenly Cave to guard the entrance. To enter, one must break through the formation. With an Immortal Celestial Lord presiding over and guarding the formation, even enemies at Blood Child Ji's level would not be able to break through and enter.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the formation blocking, once a powerful enemy is discovered, reinforcements can arrive before the formation is broken to continue intercepting the enemy outside the Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>After listening to the Great Yue Emperor's narration, Fang Hao couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Cave was most suitable for setting up formations to intercept invading enemies. Furthermore, they could set up formation after formation to surround and kill the invaders.</p><p></p><p>They could also set up city defense formations in the cities. This way, they could use formations to resist stronger enemies with weaker forces, and also buy time to wait for powerful reinforcements to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"What are formations?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao explained for a while, leaving the Great Yue Emperor with a shocked expression. How could there be such a marvelous art?</p><p></p><p>"The way of formations is one aspect of the extraordinary martial arts I practice. It cannot be explained in a few words. Let me demonstrate for you, and then you'll understand."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression was somewhat excited. He suddenly realized that the extraordinary martial arts would once again display their might in the Divine Realm, especially in guarding the Heavenly Caves.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Netherworld Prison enemies have all been eliminated!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a True King messenger came to report.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor nodded with great joy.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship's speed suddenly increased, arriving at the core area of the Heavenly Cave in an instant. They saw a scene of blood-red color, especially above where there seemed to be a layer of blood film covering it, with a bloody glow diffusing downwards.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld Prison enemies, especially those at the Blood Child level, all enter the Heavenly Cave and invade our world from here."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor pointed to the area above that seemed to be covered by a layer of blood film.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and said, "Watch carefully, I'll demonstrate what formations are!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept around and saw that there was no shortage of blood cloud gold and other materials in the core area of the Heavenly Cave. He raised his hand and summoned various materials to fly over.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A refining furnace appeared, and Fang Hao began refining formation tools on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Using materials from the Divine Realm, the refined formation tools would create more solid formations with stronger power.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the formation tools were refined. Fang Hao waved his hand, and light flew out in all directions. Eight small flags shot upwards and landed on the blood film.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, watch carefully. What I'm setting up now is the Eight Directions Restraining Spirit Locking Formation."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As the formation activated, a mysterious light appeared. In an instant, wind and fire surged, and chains crisscrossed. In just a moment, the Netherworld Prison's entry point was completely sealed within the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was stunned by what he saw. The profundity of this formation was truly incredible. Although the sealing power of this formation didn't seem too strong, it was after all set up hastily.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, being able to block for even a short time was enough to buy a lot of time, enough to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>"Young Brother Fang, I, Great Yue, am willing to honor you as the National Teacher, to help my Great Yue Nation resist the Netherworld Prison enemies, and to provide assistance in defending the Qinghua Territory against the Netherworld Prison enemies!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor said solemnly as he bowed.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

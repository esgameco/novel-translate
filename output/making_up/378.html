        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan unleashed several divine abilities at once, with a dazzling and awe-inspiring power that shook the surrounding area. The blood demons, blood disciples, and blood slaves in the Great Peak Celestial Cave were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>After fighting and confronting the Qinghua Realm for countless years, they had never seen such a terrifying expert before. Especially the few blood demons, whose already pale faces turned even whiter, and their entire bodies were trembling.</p><p></p><p>The imposing presence that Li Xuan revealed at this moment was truly shocking to the world.</p><p></p><p>"The blood demon Xisu's strength is not weak either. It took me a lot of effort to slap him to death with just one palm strike," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable is still very powerful. However, Li Xuan is even stronger, as both his divine abilities and physical body have been enhanced a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is what divine abilities are. Your master will use just one move!" Li Xuan said in a voice that seemed to carry a celestial might.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!" Xu Yan and the others were greatly excited, staring intently at the master whose figure was like a great mountain, his hands grasping the wind and thunder... surrounded by divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a step forward, looking at the few blood demons and a group of blood disciples who were about to flee. He raised his hand and unleashed his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Peak warriors, including the Great Peak Emperor, all widened their eyes in shock.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Celestial Cave, which had been guarded for countless years, was now shaken and turbulent, with a terrifying blood aura being engulfed by the dazzling power.</p><p></p><p>The blood aura seemed to be evaporated, and the terrifying power directly submerged those blood demons, blood disciples, and blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>One could see raging wind and thunder, a golden giant dragon sweeping across, and more mysterious forces surging and arranging, purifying the vast blood aura.</p><p></p><p>There was also a terrifying force like a giant furnace, melting everything to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>No one had ever seen such a terrifying martial arts technique before.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities?" the Great Peak Emperor murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he vaguely felt the immense power and mystery contained in the term "divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, everyone was in a state of shock.</p><p></p><p>How powerful the senior's abilities were, that was a mystery. To Wu Tiannan and the others, the senior was an existence that transcended heaven and earth. What they saw now was just the senior casually demonstrating divine abilities to teach his disciples, not even using a millionth of his true power.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Cheng Zhan were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The senior's display of power to annihilate the blood demons was already shocking enough. But now, to suppress the Celestial Cave, the aura he revealed was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also knew that the senior had not used his true strength. If he had unleashed the divine demonic body he used to kill the blood demons, he might have directly collapsed the Great Peak Celestial Cave. Perhaps that was why the senior did not reveal his divine demonic form.</p><p></p><p>After taking action, Li Xuan returned to the flying ship and sat down on a chair, carefree and at ease.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Peak Celestial Cave, the gathered blood demons, blood disciples, and blood slaves had all disappeared, and even the thick blood aura had faded.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true use of divine abilities. I'm still a bit lacking," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The others, including Meng Chong, Su Ling Xiu, and Fang Hao, all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping, who had just woken up and was shaking his head with blurry eyes, also saw this scene and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, the influence of the non-transformation qi on my consciousness is getting more and more serious. I'll sleep a bit longer, hoping that next time I wake up, I'll be more normal," he muttered to himself before dozing off again.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Cave was silent.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Emperor was shocked and had not recovered for a long time, and the other Great Peak warriors were completely dumbfounded, immersed in the awe-inspiring scene and unable to extricate themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Go into the Celestial Cave and plunder the blood cloud gold and the Celestial Cave treasures!" Su Ling Xiu exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Cave was conquered by the master, so the spoils inside naturally belong to the disciples.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a beam of light and entered the Great Peak Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>After the flying ship entered the Celestial Cave, the Great Peak experts finally snapped out of it and became greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Celestial Cave was going to be razed today.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, follow me into the Celestial Cave, attack with full force and wipe out this Celestial Cave. We must thank the senior for helping our Great Peak eliminate the Celestial Cave," the Great Peak Emperor said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>He instructed one of the Immortal Venerable experts to return to the Great Peak capital to guard it, while the remaining Immortal Venerables and True King Venerables followed him into the Great Peak Celestial Cave to completely eliminate the Infernal Palace warriors inside.</p><p></p><p>Although the Infernal Palace warriors occupied most of the Celestial Cave entrance, there were still Infernal Palace warriors guarding the depths of the Celestial Cave, and there was even a blood demon in charge.</p><p></p><p>But they were no longer a threat. With the current strength of the Great Peak, they could easily clear them out and raze this Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>As the flying ship entered the Great Peak Celestial Cave, it was as if they had entered a small world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Spiritual Domain's Celestial Cave, the difference was heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true Celestial Cave," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The walls of the Celestial Cave were grayish, but inside it was permeated with a faint blood light, and strands of blood aura were drifting about, even the ground was dyed in a layer of blood color, as if soaked in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Palace blood disciples and blood slaves around the entrance had all been annihilated, so the flying ship entered without encountering any of them.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship headed straight for the depths of the Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A blood light came from the depths of the Celestial Cave, with a powerful aura, which was a blood demon.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, this was a blood demon left behind by the Infernal Palace to guard the Celestial Cave. Sensing the changes at the Celestial Cave entrance, he came to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go greet him!" Feng Yan moved forward to engage him.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the Great Peak Emperor and the others also arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for resolving the crisis of our Great Peak!" The Great Peak Emperor respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable behind the Great Peak Emperor immediately stepped forward and joined Feng Yan in surrounding and killing the blood demon.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, may we go and eliminate the Infernal Palace's lair?" the Great Peak Emperor asked respectfully again.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" The Great Peak Emperor breathed a sigh of relief and instructed the True King Venerables behind him, "Go, eliminate the enemies of the Infernal Palace. Do not take any treasures from the Celestial Cave, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!" The True King Venerables responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Led by an Immortal Venerable, the group of True King Venerables headed towards the depths of the Celestial Cave, signifying that this Celestial Cave would be razed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Emperor took up his spear and joined the attack on the blood demon. After a while, the blood demon was killed by the Great Peak Emperor's spear strike.</p><p></p><p>The items the blood demon carried were respectfully brought to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the senior leisurely sitting in the chair, the Great Peak Emperor guessed in his heart, "The senior must be from the rumored place. In that case, what the blood demon Xisu said is probably true, wanting to invade the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because the senior has seen through the Infernal Palace's scheme that he has appeared in the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked over and said, "Great Yue Emperor? Tell me about this heavenly cave."</p><p></p><p>The heavenly cave of Great Yue was vastly different from the heavenly caves that appeared in the Spiritual Realm. There was soil, vegetation, and the aura of natural laws on the ground, as if a small world or heavenly paradise had been carved out within this space.</p><p></p><p>The barrier of heaven and earth was not at the bottom of the heavenly cave, but above it, like a dome overhead, with a faint barrier visible obstructing it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sensed the presence of the Dao principles from within.</p><p></p><p>"You can just call me Great Yue, senior!" the Great Yue Emperor hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>He then began to introduce this heavenly cave.</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Yue Emperor, this heavenly cave had a long history, existing even before he became a cultivator and established the Great Yue Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the heavens and earth once underwent a calamity, after which heavenly cave openings appeared. At first, there were no invaders, but later they were discovered by invaders who sought to enter this world.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records, when the heavenly caves first appeared, some cultivators explored them, even wanting to venture beyond the heavens and earth, but none succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't until the external enemies invaded that they realized the heavenly caves could be entered from the outside, but those within could not leave... No, that's not quite right. The beings of this world cannot leave.</p><p></p><p>"The invading outsiders aimed to occupy and plunder the essence of this world, causing countless disasters.</p><p></p><p>"Later, guarding the heavenly caves became the inevitable responsibility of the cultivators of the Spiritual Realm. Over the years, more and more heavenly caves appeared, as if the heavens and earth were constantly forming new openings.</p><p></p><p>"The three largest and oldest heavenly caves in the entire Azure Flower Realm are..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently as the Great Yue Emperor recounted the history.</p><p></p><p>According to the Great Yue Emperor, this world had once undergone a calamity, the details of which he did not know. The appearance of the heavenly caves was a result of that calamity, and the invasion by external enemies came later.</p><p></p><p>"...It is rumored that the Underworld is also a world, seeking to devour the one we inhabit. The heavenly caves in the Azure Flower Realm are all connected to the Underworld, facing the invasion of Underworld beings.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific information, we do not know, for what lies beyond the heavens and earth is a mystery, even to the Immortal Exalted Ones who cannot explore it."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor sighed. Even the Immortal Exalted Ones, eternal and powerful as they were, were limited in their ability to venture beyond this world.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, he looked at the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One, did he know what lay beyond the heavens and earth? Presumably, as a transcendent figure, he would understand it better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly replied, "What lies beyond the heavens and earth, one will know when one reaches that realm. If one's cultivation is not there yet, knowing is of no use."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor inwardly acknowledged that this was indeed a true Venerable One, who knew the secrets of the world beyond.</p><p></p><p>He then continued to describe the history of the Great Yue heavenly cave, the great battles fought by its guardians over the generations, as well as the appearance and misdeeds of the Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>"Now, although the Underworld enemies within the heavenly cave have been vanquished, we cannot prevent the Underworld from invading again. They will surely send more powerful experts to try and occupy this cave as a foothold to invade our world."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor said with some resignation.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly cave can only withstand the entry of so much power. Currently, the strongest force that can enter is at the level of the Blood Child."</p><p></p><p>This was why the Great Yue Kingdom could still guard the heavenly cave. Otherwise, the arrival of a Bloodsoul expert would be enough to shatter the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, understanding that the external invaders were ultimately limited by the barrier of heaven and earth. For experts at the level of the Blood Child, they would be no more than a slap to him.</p><p></p><p>As for Bloodsoul-level experts, even if their strength was unknown, since they could not enter this world, they posed no threat.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then spoke up, suggesting that the Great Yue Emperor set up a grand formation within the heavenly cave, guarded by an Immortal Exalted One. Even enemies at the Blood Child's level would be unable to break through such a formation, and any detection of powerful foes could be met with reinforcements to repel them outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was astonished, having never heard of such an art as formations. Fang Hao explained that it was part of the Esoteric Martial Arts he cultivated, and offered to demonstrate.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a messenger arrived to report that the Underworld enemies had all been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was overjoyed. They quickly flew to the core of the heavenly cave, which was shrouded in a bloody haze.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld enemies, especially those at the Bloodsoul realm, entered the heavenly cave from here to invade our world," the Great Yue Emperor pointed out.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and said, "Watch closely, and I'll show you what a formation is."</p><p></p><p>He gathered the materials present and began to forge formation tools on the spot. With Spiritual Realm materials, the formation tools and arrays he created were exceptionally sturdy and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the formation tools were ready. Fang Hao waved his hand, and eight small flags flew up and affixed themselves to the bloody membrane above.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, behold, the formation I have just set up is the Eight Directions Binding Soul Array."</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The formation activated, and a surge of mystical light appeared. In an instant, wind and fire surged, and chains crisscrossed, completely sealing off the area where the Underworld had invaded.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was astonished by the profound and wondrous nature of this formation. Although the binding power was not overwhelming, it was enough to buy precious time and turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother Fang, I, the Great Yue, wish to appoint you as my National Preceptor, to help my Great Yue and the Azure Flower Realm defend against the Underworld enemies," the Great Yue Emperor said solemnly, bowing in reverence.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

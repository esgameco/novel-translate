            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 93 Humbly Requesting the Elders' Guidance (Seeking Monthly Votes)</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly looked at Xie Lingfeng and the other, and said, "I already know your intentions."</p><p></p><p>"Please, elder, provide guidance!" Xie Lingfeng respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"To resolve the confusion, one must know the root of the confusion. What cultivation method are you two practicing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan twirled the jade ruyi scepter in his hand, with a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed elder, we are cultivating the inheritance technique of the Sword Sovereign Cliff."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng replied.</p><p></p><p>"To what extent have you grasped the cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was stunned for a moment. To what extent have they grasped it?</p><p></p><p>"This disciple has fully comprehended it in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled mysteriously, with a deep meaning, "Have you truly comprehended it in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's self-confidence was shaken by this question.</p><p></p><p>"Have I overlooked something and failed to fully comprehend it?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was also deep in thought, wondering if he had truly comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out the cultivation method, let me take a look and test you two, then I will know if you have truly grasped the true meaning of the technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan seemed to have already determined that they had not comprehended the true meaning of the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, esteemed elder!" </p><p></p><p>The two of them did not think much about it.</p><p></p><p>They had already determined that the cultivation method they practiced was a false martial art, and since it was not to be shared externally, they no longer cared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could a high-level expert deign to look at such a crude false martial art technique?</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, this disciple will write out the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er brought over paper and brush for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan began to silently write down the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke again, "Write down all the cultivation methods you know, perhaps you two have only bitten off more than you can chew and failed to truly comprehend their true meaning."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, esteemed elder!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them perked up.</p><p></p><p>"What if the cultivation method I practice is not a false martial art? Perhaps I have simply failed to comprehend its true meaning and thus have not cultivated true martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, a look of excitement appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had written down all the cultivation methods they knew and practiced.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a glance at them, truly just a glance, without even looking at the specific content of the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>As a high-level expert, what need was there to carefully examine them?</p><p></p><p>Especially since he had no intention of actually evaluating their cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Whether true or false, as long as the martial arts heart is resolute, there will surely be attainment."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put down the cultivation methods and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan immediately became dejected.</p><p></p><p>"It seems these are false martial art techniques, the elder's words are just consolation."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's eyes grew dim, and the hope that had just been ignited seemed to have been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed elder, please guide us, on what path should this disciple's martial arts journey go?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng prostrated himself on the ground and pleaded.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed elder, please provide guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan also prostrated himself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan considered his words carefully before slowly speaking, "You two, the foundation is already set, to start over would not be advisable... However, since you have cultivated... Let's call it true qi.</p><p></p><p>"The true qi is impure, thus your martial arts are not firm, and the foundation is not solid.</p><p></p><p>"The primary issue is to refine the true qi, and return to the right path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>This was the strategy Li Xuan had already prepared.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, how should we refine the true qi?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the capital of Qi, he had discussed this problem with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that Xu Yan had not yet broken through to the Xiantian Realm, and could not provide a method.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could refine the inner martial qi into true martial qi, it would be the first and crucial step to return to the right path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If they could not refine it into true qi, everything would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>They could only continue cultivating the false martial art and break through to the Grand Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was not what Xie Lingfeng wanted.</p><p></p><p>Even if he became a Grand Ancestor, what of it? </p><p></p><p>He would still be unable to enter the Sword Dao, unable to become a true martial arts cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Refining true qi, it is both difficult and not difficult."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not give a guarantee.</p><p></p><p>After all, how to refine the inner martial qi into true qi, he had derived it based on the foundation of refining blood qi into true qi.</p><p></p><p>Whether it would succeed, he could not guarantee.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan did not quite understand, and asked, "Elder, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't help but speak up to explain, "My master's meaning is, whether you can refine true qi depends on your talent, and whether you can comprehend the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"You must know that for a cultivation method, some can cultivate it successfully, while others cannot even enter its door.</p><p></p><p>"This is why it is both difficult and not difficult."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan heard this and his face flushed red with embarrassment as he lowered his head and said, "This disciple is truly stupid!"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat panicked inside: "Could it be that I am unable to comprehend it, unable to refine true qi?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, on the other hand, was not worried. He firmly believed that he could refine true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Please, elder, teach me the method to refine true qi!"</p><p></p><p>He prostrated himself on the ground respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Since we have met, so be it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, elder!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan imparted the method of refining true qi to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood after hearing the cultivation method, so that's how it is! It's similar to refining blood qi into Xiantian true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Have you remembered it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked after finishing the explanation.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple has remembered it!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan opened his mouth, and finally nodded, "This disciple has also remembered it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Hu Shan, this guy clearly had not remembered it, but he was too lazy to bother with him. He would go ask Xie Lingfeng if he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>This also revealed the difference in their talents.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, elder, for imparting the technique!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully kowtowed three times.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan hurriedly followed suit, kowtowing three times forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"You may rise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>These two truly understood etiquette!</p><p></p><p>The way they kowtowed was even more intense than when his own disciple bowed to him.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple will no longer disturb the elder's tranquility."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng cupped his hands and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, let's spar."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Xiantian Realm, he had not yet exchanged blows with Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could gain insights from every sparring session.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had an excited look on his face as he looked at Hu Shan, "Let's spar."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was still troubled, he hadn't fully remembered the cultivation method for refining true qi, and just now he didn't dare admit it in front of the elder.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>He responded absentmindedly when Meng Chong invited him.</p><p></p><p>The four of them left the courtyard and went to the mountains outside the county city.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I didn't fully remember the cultivation method for refining true qi, could you explain it to me again?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan approached Xie Lingfeng, embarrassedly speaking up.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at him with a speechless expression.</p><p></p><p>"I... I didn't dare say it in front of the elder."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his shoulder and said, "Come, come, let me see the martial arts of an Inner Realm Ancestor Master."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What I remember, I can tell you," he said.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan felt even more embarrassed - he was the only one among the four who hadn't remembered.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded and followed Meng Chong to the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, please!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed a tree branch.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also about to grab a tree branch when Xu Yan spoke up: "Brother Xie, you can use the sword."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched a little. Xu Yan was already so confident, to spar with him using just a tree branch? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that after breaking through the Innate Realm, his strength had increased so terrifyingly?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Xu Yan's sword intent, Xie Lingfeng didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The sword was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>With the first move, it was his strongest sword technique - the Flying Rainbow Sword!</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed in an instant, extremely fast and swift.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out with his tree branch, and a sword qi burst forth, thunderously shattering the sword light. Immediately after, the sword qi surged forth, like a mighty river, endless and unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart trembled. This seemed to be the Myriad River Sword Technique, but even more fierce and powerful than the Myriad River Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of Innate True Qi?"</p><p></p><p>The surging sword qi, flowing endlessly, even though it was just a tree branch unleashing it, and Xu Yan hadn't even used his sword intent, Xie Lingfeng still felt the overwhelming pressure.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Grandmaster Cultivator, unleashing his full power, the internal energy of the Dao circulating, the precious sword radiating a dazzling sword light - he was going all out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength after his breakthrough was shockingly powerful, he was absolutely no match for him.</p><p></p><p>The purity and might of the Innate True Qi had surpassed his internal energy by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng's sparring was all about sword techniques, with fierce sword qi criss-crossing.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong and Hu Shan's sparring, the momentum was even more grand.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wielded a large saber, his body shimmering with golden light. With a movement, he instantly appeared at Hu Shan's left side, the saber slashing down viciously.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's heart jolted, thrusting out his sword with a loud bang.</p><p></p><p>He felt a terrifying force surge from the saber, his heart shuddering - what a terrifying physical strength!</p><p></p><p>He immediately didn't dare to be careless, unleashing the Raging Wind Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wielded the saber, strike after strike, and a golden bell-like aura emerged, his burly figure seeming to swell even larger.</p><p></p><p>His fighting style was ferocious and unmatched, all his strength concentrated in the saber.</p><p></p><p>However, he was only at the initial stage of the Qi and Blood Realm, his strength not as great as Hu Shan's. Although he fought fiercely, Hu Shan was still able to handle it easily.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong charged forward, disregarding the sweeping sword qi, the saber viciously chopping towards Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's face changed, hastily trying to withdraw his attack, but it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as several sword qi streaked towards Meng Chong. His heart sank!</p><p></p><p>If this strike landed, Meng Chong would either die or be seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>What was he to do?</p><p></p><p>However, an even more shocking scene unfolded before him.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi slammed into Meng Chong, the shimmering golden light on his body flickering, cracking open a few fissures. The remaining sword qi that struck his body only left shallow white marks!</p><p></p><p>Not even a single wound appeared!</p><p></p><p>Stunned, he suddenly sensed the ferocious saber light chopping down, inwardly cursing, hastily raising his precious sword to block.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The sword and saber collided heavily,</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan felt a huge force pressing down from the saber, his arm instantly bending downwards, the precious sword nearly slipping from his grasp, his feet sinking half a foot into the ground with a boom!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>He had almost failed to withstand this single strike!</p><p></p><p>Although hurried, he was still a Grandmaster Cultivator, with his internal energy reinforcing him, yet he had almost failed to block the strike of Meng Chong, who had just entered the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Was this the difference between true Dao and false Dao?</p><p></p><p>The sword trembled, pushing the saber away, his figure swiftly retreating.</p><p></p><p>Staring at Meng Chong in astonishment, "You're not hurt, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his chest, "Of course not, your sword qi is indeed very strong. If it were five or six times more powerful, it might have injured me!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan heard this and was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying physique!</p><p></p><p>Even steel would be sliced through like tofu under his previous sword qi, but Meng Chong was completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>There were only faint white marks on his skin, and even those disappeared in no time.</p><p></p><p>This physique was truly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Dao of the Physical Body?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan didn't know how to describe his current emotions.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong broke through to the Innate Realm, even if he went all out, he might not be able to breach Meng Chong's physical defense.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the precious saber in his hand. Just now, his attacks were fierce, but he always felt something was lacking, unable to fully unleash his strength.</p><p></p><p>"The saber techniques I learned from the jianghu are too inferior, unable to display my full strength. I need to find my master to learn the saber!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself, planting the saber into the ground and clenching his fists, looking at Hu Shan, "Come, let's continue!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not using the saber?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't learned the saber yet, I don't know it, so I'll use the Thunderous Golden Fist to spar with you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said directly.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was at a loss for words. Such a fierce and unmatched strength, yet he said he hadn't learned the saber?</p><p></p><p>"This strength, in the Inner Realm, even a First-Grade Cultivator would have trouble withstanding his saber."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Inner Realm, the First-Grade Cultivators who could withstand Meng Chong's such ferocious saber strike could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>And these First-Grade Cultivators were already at the absolute peak of their realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was just at the initial stage of the Dao, according to his own words, in the initial stage of the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he reached the advanced stage of the Qi and Blood Realm, sweeping through the First-Grade Cultivators of the Inner Realm, and even challenging some weaker Grandmaster Cultivators, would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's heart was surging, his spirit soaring: "This is the might of the true Dao! I must refine the Innate True Qi, and once I succeed in correcting my Dao, becoming a true Dao practitioner, will I have a chance to challenge some of the weaker Grandmaster Cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he was filled with ardent enthusiasm, sheathing his sword, saying, "Then I'll also use fist techniques to spar with you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised an eyebrow, "Are you sure you want to use fist techniques to spar with me?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's sword techniques were indeed very strong, Meng Chong was no match for him.</p><p></p><p>But in a fist technique sparring, the outcome was hard to predict, especially if it came to close-quarters combat.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate me. Although the Sword Saint Cliff is renowned for its sword techniques, my fist techniques, palm techniques, and body techniques are also first-class."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan clenched his fists, taking the initiative to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The fist strike was fierce and swift, reaching Meng Chong's face in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up, letting out a low roar, his fist striking out like thunderous lightning, tyrannical and swift.</p><p></p><p>One punch after another, like a raging wind, his figure constantly shifting, relentlessly closing in on Hu Shan, the sound of thunder and wind resounding.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have transformed into a Golden Arhat, in just a moment, suppressing Hu Shan's fist strike.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had already approached Hu Shan, the thunderous fist power seemingly able to penetrate any defense, continuously striking at the gaps in Hu Shan's defense, making him appear somewhat flustered and overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>All he could see was the roaring thunder and wind, the terrifying might, seemingly unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly regretted not using his sword, Meng Chong's fist techniques were too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

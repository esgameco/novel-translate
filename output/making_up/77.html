        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 77 - The Master Teaches the Dao, Not the Technique (Seeking Orders)</p><p></p><p>The bag only contained a small booklet and two spirit crystals, with no other items.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a disappointed look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin is a pauper after all.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but curse inwardly, "You're a demonic cultivator, aren't you? Killing and robbing people is so normal for you. You've even had to flee to the remote wilderness, but you didn't prepare to plunder some treasures for use out here? </p><p></p><p>"You're truly a waste! Blowing you to ashes wouldn't be unjust at all!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the bag - it was just an ordinary bag, not a storage bag or anything special.</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed it aside.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any storage bag treasures in the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, wondering if he should find a disciple with talent for alchemy and teach them a set of alchemy techniques, so they could refine storage bags and the like.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't even practice alchemy myself, so it would be quite difficult to compile a complete set of techniques. I still need to go to the Inner Realm, study their alchemy methods, and only then can I put together something perfect.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm is the only place that might have such alchemical prodigies, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered this.</p><p></p><p>But alchemy is not essential to one's own strength, so it's not an urgent matter. He can consider finding such a prodigy later.</p><p></p><p>He collected the spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blood-red booklet, four words jumped out at him:</p><p></p><p>"Classic of the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a demonic cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan didn't mind, as he wasn't going to cultivate these techniques, but only reference them to understand the martial dao of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually an incomplete version?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Classic of the Blood Demon was missing a part, only a fragment remained.</p><p></p><p>Yet even with this incomplete version, it had allowed Blood Wuxin to reach the Patriarch Realm, and even the Grand Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>So the complete Classic of the Blood Demon must be able to cultivate beyond the Grand Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flipped through the Classic of the Blood Demon, and it was indeed a demonic cultivation technique, based on devouring and refining blood essence to strengthen oneself.</p><p></p><p>The purer and more abundant the blood essence, the greater the enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This was why Blood Wuxin had targeted Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>It also recorded a special secret technique of the Classic - the Blood Vampire Threads, used to devour blood essence.</p><p></p><p>"It does have some tricks."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was amazed by the Classic. It gave him some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>While he wouldn't compile a technique for devouring blood essence, he could use it as a reference to create more exquisite and upright cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"The framework of a new martial dao is starting to take shape."</p><p></p><p>After reading the Classic of the Blood Demon, Li Xuan had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the physical martial dao, there could be a new cultivation system. However, it was still incomplete, just a concept for now.</p><p></p><p>And he would need to find the right person to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"The Classic of the Blood Demon is a powerful demonic technique in the Inner Realm, and Blood Wuxin is no weak Patriarch... However, as a yin-evil technique, it should be suppressed by the ardent Qi-Blood."</p><p></p><p>The blazing Qi-Blood Realm could effectively counter the yin-evil energy of the Classic of the Blood Demon. In a battle of the same realm, a cultivator of the Classic would be constrained everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"But the Qi-Blood holds great allure for them as well."</p><p></p><p>Why did Blood Wuxin so desperately crave Meng Chong's and Xu Yan's blood essence? </p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>The blood essence of Qi-Blood Realm cultivators is more abundant and pure than those in the Inner Realm, making them a great treasure for demonic cultivators of the Classic.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly memorizing the contents of the Classic of the Blood Demon, Li Xuan made it disintegrate into powder.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't leave this demonic technique behind, lest he forget and it be found by someone else after he left, turning them into a demonic cultivator.</p><p></p><p>While the remote wilderness couldn't produce true martial artists, with the Classic of the Blood Demon one could still enhance their strength by devouring blood essence.</p><p></p><p>Although they would be capped by the lack of spiritual energy, their power could still reach the level of fifth or sixth rank Inner Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This would not be a good thing for the remote wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already memorized it, the best thing was to destroy it completely.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Cloud Mountain County, in the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had one hand clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood respectfully behind him, sword in hand.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, remember that I only teach the Dao, not the technique. So what I impart to you is the sword Dao, not sword techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan plucked a tree branch, speaking solemnly, "As I've repeatedly emphasized, cultivation is about comprehension, about grasping the true meaning. The sword Dao is the same, so watch carefully."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed the branch, and with a whoosh, a burst of true qi shot out, creating a hole in a large tree.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes widened in shock. "Master's sword Dao... no, this isn't a sword technique, but it's so powerful. Just waving a tree branch, the force is far greater than Blood Wuxin's sword qi."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tested the feel of the branch, then began swinging it, infusing it with primal true qi to make the movements fierce and formidable, though he was just waving it randomly.</p><p></p><p>It was his immense primal true qi that gave the branch such a powerful and imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wasn't completely aimless - he incorporated some basic sword techniques like slashing, thrusting, lifting, horizontal strikes, and sweeping.</p><p></p><p>After a flurry of movements, Li Xuan put down the branch and solemnly asked, "Disciple, do you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan eagerly nodded, "Master, I remember everything!"</p><p></p><p>Everything? </p><p></p><p>That won't do!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised the branch again, speaking sternly, "Disciple, look again. Remember, I'm teaching you the sword Dao, not sword techniques. You must comprehend the true meaning."</p><p></p><p>He then began moving the branch slowly, mimicking the forms of the ancient Taichi Sword, but infusing it with his primal true qi.</p><p></p><p>The movements were slow, yet a sword qi seemed to be circling around, growing more and more imposing as he rotated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stared intently, but was puzzled - why so slow?</p><p></p><p>How could this slow movement defeat enemies?</p><p></p><p>After finishing the forms, Li Xuan asked again, "Disciple, do you remember?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I remember everything!"</p><p></p><p>This disciple had an amazing memory, remembering everything in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, look again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan swung the branch rapidly this time, a flurry of movements, then stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a bit bewildered now.</p><p></p><p>How come the sword techniques kept changing each time?</p><p></p><p>"I... remember about 90% of it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The slow, flowing sword forms earlier, he had remembered completely.</p><p></p><p>But this first fast set of techniques, he had forgotten a few.</p><p></p><p>"How could I have forgotten some?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very frustrated with himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, saying,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Good, my disciple, take another look!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he gestured again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was already confused: "I forgot, I didn't remember it all, but the master actually said 'good'?"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, do you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the branch and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I, I didn't remember it all!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of shame on his face. He had been distracted just now and didn't remember the sword techniques the master had just demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, disciple, you have taken another step towards comprehending the Dao of the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled. He didn't remember the techniques, so how did he make progress in comprehending the Dao of the Sword?</p><p></p><p>"No, I must not have understood the deeper meaning behind the master's words."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into contemplation, and his powerful imagination began to unfold.</p><p></p><p>"The master repeatedly emphasized that he only transmits the Dao, not the techniques. What he teaches me is the Dao of the Sword, not the sword techniques...</p><p></p><p>"I need to comprehend the true meaning and the Dao within, not just the techniques. So what I should do is not to remember the techniques.</p><p></p><p>"But to forget the techniques! </p><p></p><p>"Not to be bound by the techniques or the forms, to integrate and flow freely, to act according to my will..."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Yan felt he had grasped the deeper meaning of his master's teachings.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he began to recall the sword techniques the master had just demonstrated - the fast ones, the slow ones, the fierce ones, the tricky ones...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the previous techniques overlapped and merged in his mind, and a new sword technique seemed to take shape.</p><p></p><p>"I must learn to forget!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan admonished himself inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have already forgotten half of it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. His disciple had entered a state of comprehension. This was a good sign, indicating that he had taken a firm step towards comprehending the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>This disciple indeed had a natural talent and an extraordinary aptitude for the sword.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, take a look again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to gesture again. Of course, this time the movements were different from the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>In fact, each time he gestured, he had carefully considered the sequence. The first time was a somewhat imitative sword technique, the second time was a Taiji Sword, slow yet following the principles of Taiji. </p><p></p><p>The third time was fierce, the fourth time was tricky, and this fifth time was completely chaotic.</p><p></p><p>With the variations of fast, slow, fierce, and tricky, all without any fixed pattern, it was now up to Xu Yan to comprehend on his own.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have forgotten half of it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said after watching.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, take another look!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to gesture.</p><p></p><p>In the following moments, he demonstrated several more times, and Xu Yan would sometimes be confused, sometimes ponder, sometimes have a sudden realization...</p><p></p><p>In his mind, all the sword techniques were being rearranged, overlapping, merging, or interwoven with each other.</p><p></p><p>A new sword technique seemed to be taking shape in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood by, watching his disciple in the process of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The time was about right.</p><p></p><p>It was time to reveal the cultivated realm of the Dao of the Sword to the disciple, so that he could better comprehend the Dao from within.</p><p></p><p>If successful, this would be another great harvest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes, with a slight look of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he was in a state of chaos. </p><p></p><p>The jumbled sword techniques were swirling in his mind, and he couldn't find a clear direction.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly incomplete sword technique still could not take a definite form.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he might have gone down the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques the master had taught, he had now completely forgotten, unable to recall how they were originally performed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have forgotten everything!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said reassuringly, "Forgetting is good, forgetting is good, disciple. You are not far from comprehending the Dao of the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>This boosted Xu Yan's spirits, and his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, what I teach you is the Dao of the Sword. Among the countless martial artists in the world, only a few can truly enter the Dao of the Sword. To enter the Dao of the Sword, one must first break free from the confines of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Do not be bound by sword techniques and forms."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned sideways, and a mysterious aura seemed to emanate from him, elevating his image as a high-level master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's body trembled, and he respectfully said, "Please, master, guide your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"The fact that you can forget the sword techniques and forms I just demonstrated shows that you have the aptitude for the Dao of the Sword and are not confined by them.</p><p></p><p>"But this is still not enough!</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend the Dao of the Sword, to enter the Dao of the Sword, only those with a clear sword heart can truly step into the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Clear sword heart?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled, and he respectfully asked, "Master, what is a clear sword heart?"</p><p></p><p>"A clear sword heart is the foundational realm of the Dao of the Sword. One with a clear sword heart is not bound by sword techniques and forms, and their sword heart is pure and unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>"The sword heart is the clear and unobstructed heart of the Dao of the Sword. To be clear is to be able to see through any sword technique or form at a glance, to understand its flaws and merits.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to effortlessly extract and utilize any sword technique or form as one's own."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the foundation of cultivating the Dao of the Sword - the clear sword heart - to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shaken, "A clear sword heart is the pure and unobstructed heart of the Dao of the Sword. To be clear is to see through the flaws and merits of any sword technique at a glance, and to be able to freely utilize them as one's own."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he recalled the scenes of his master demonstrating the sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the incomplete sword technique he had formed by overlapping, merging, and interlacing the techniques also emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If he could complete the integration and fusion of this sword technique, forming one that he could freely extract and utilize, would that be the manifestation of a clear sword heart?</p><p></p><p>He had some comprehension and said, "Master, a clear sword heart means that even though I don't have any sword techniques or forms, the sword techniques of others become my own. The sword techniques of my opponents are transparent to me, as if I can easily see their flaws and predict their movements..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed in his heart. Xu Yan was not far from comprehending the clear sword heart, and the Dao of the Sword realm he had cultivated was about to be revealed.</p><p></p><p>"In simple terms, that is the essence of it. Reaching this level means you have entered the realm of the clear sword heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with a tone of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand a bit, but not completely..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into contemplation again.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, the clear sword heart can only be self-realized. If you comprehend it, then you have entered it. If you cannot comprehend it, then you have not."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He himself had not attained the clear sword heart, he had only designed it. How could he know the methods and ways to enter it? </p><p></p><p>It all depended on his disciple's extraordinary imagination and profound comprehension to explore and realize it on his own.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, first you must have a clear sword heart. Only with a clear sword heart can you attain clarity, and a clear sword heart is one that is not bound by sword techniques and forms.</p><p></p><p>"Ponder on this, and I believe you will be able to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then left the mountain forest, leaving Xu Yan alone to continue his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 549</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme and Blood Demon were negotiating. Blood Demon's resentment towards Jade Court was rising rapidly. If not for Jade Court's trickery, how could he have ended up in such a predicament? For Blood Extreme, occupying half of Blood Demon's body and power was already a significant success, not to mention learning about another force outside the Immortal Palace from Blood Demon's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Jade Court!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Hongze realm, Xu Yan was enveloped by a new small world that seemed to be giving birth to some laws of celestial operation.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to break through!" Xu Yan muttered to himself. </p><p></p><p>The opportunity to break through to the Establishing the Way realm had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, the desolate realm held no potential dangers.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began breaking through to the Establishing the Way realm. This was a huge leap - once in this realm, killing a small world's lord would be effortless.</p><p></p><p>Establishing the Way meant establishing one's own way and the way of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already understood how to establish the way. After comprehending the structure of the Hongze realm and the laws of celestial operation, he had more ideas on how to establish the way of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in a corner of the desolate realm, long-absent fluctuations of the Dao appeared, along with the spiritual essence of heaven and earth. Although these Dao fluctuations did not come from the desolate realm itself, they added color to this corner of the world, dispelling death and inauspiciousness.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Yan was establishing the Way, on the other side, Meng Chong's physical body resonated with heaven and earth, shaking this corner of the world. It was as if this area had come alive, shaking and moving, vibrating in resonance with Meng Chong's muscle movements.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, who had already mastered the Heaven and Earth realm, seemed to be receiving feedback from the desolate Hongze realm. His Heaven and Earth realm was approaching perfection.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Jiang Buping were also making gains, their strength increasing.</p><p></p><p>The desolate realm also held value for comprehension and opportunities. Of course, not everyone could obtain these opportunities or comprehend heaven and earth here.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle, who was staring at the distant Hongze realm while trying to overcome his inner fear, suddenly felt confused. He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he seemed to have just seen a flash of color at a certain point in the realm.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a faint light had appeared on the desolate world, though it only flashed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Are there enemies in the Hongze realm?" The Sea Turtle was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He focused his senses but couldn't detect any battle fluctuations in the Hongze realm.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, if there's no battle, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Could Xu Yan have created something?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unconsciously forgot his fear, staring at the Hongze realm without blinking, afraid of missing something.</p><p></p><p>After staring for who knows how long, just as the Sea Turtle was delighted to find that his inner fear had become very weak, he suddenly saw that a certain point in the Hongze realm seemed to have changed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone had made a tiny mark with a pen tip on a huge black stone.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Is the desolate realm coming back to life?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle was shocked.</p><p></p><p>At some point, that change in the Hongze realm disappeared and didn't reappear for a long time. The Sea Turtle took out a communication talisman, wanting to send a message to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"What if they've found a treasure and are in the process of retrieving it? Wouldn't I be disturbing them if I send a message now?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the Sea Turtle hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Sea Turtle's expression suddenly changed. A beast's roar filled with fear came from afar, though it was already approaching the area where the Hongze realm was located.</p><p></p><p>That true spirit was affected by the deathly aura of the Hongze realm, which was why it let out a fearful roar. If it were a true spirit just passing by, it would have avoided this area from far away, not come close.</p><p></p><p>This roar clearly came from a true spirit forced to approach, unable to withstand the fear.</p><p></p><p>Someone was approaching! It must be people from the Immortal Palace. The Sea Turtle thought of those three Realm Lord level experts from the Immortal Palace! "They've found us so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle made a quick decision and sent a message to Xu Yan and the other three.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's aura surged, and the intent of heaven and earth emerged. At this moment, his world already had the Way! Establishing the Way realm! After breaking through to the Establishing the Way realm, Xu Yan's intent of heaven and earth continued to emerge, merging into the desolate realm. As his own intent of heaven and earth and the Way of heaven and earth fused with the desolate Hongze realm, Xu Yan sensed some differences in the Hongze realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the realm was desolate, it still communicated with the Immortal Land, as if blending into one with the Immortal Land.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan carefully comprehended this, while his own intent of heaven and earth and the Way of heaven and earth merged into the desolate realm, making this area of the world seem to come alive.</p><p></p><p>Using the desolate realm to communicate with the Immortal Land, using the Hongze realm as a bridge to comprehend the Immortal Land, and even blend with the Immortal Land.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the method of the Mixing Origin realm appeared in Xu Yan's mind, along with the scene of his master teaching him about the Mixing Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>The intent of the Great Way, mixing the origin of heaven and earth! In this instant, Xu Yan understood.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not at the Creation realm and haven't comprehended the intent of the Great Way, I now know how to mix the origin. So this is how the Mixing Origin Great Way works!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's mind was as clear as a mirror. Using the Hongze realm as a bridge to communicate with the Immortal Land, he vaguely seemed to touch the Great Way in the mysterious beyond.</p><p></p><p>And his own intent of heaven and earth and the Way of heaven and earth merged into the desolate Hongze realm, bringing this area of the world back to life. Wasn't this also a form of mixing the origin?</p><p></p><p>However, what was mixed in this area of the world was not the intent of the Great Way, but his own Way of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan also sensed that the Hongze realm blending with the Immortal Land was also a form of mixing the origin. Using the Hongze realm as a bridge, he finally understood the method of mixing the origin at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. I finally understand the profundity of the mixing origin method. The Mixing Origin Great Way is to practice the Great Way. This is the ladder to practice the Way, this is the door to step onto the Great Way!"</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the method and scene of his master teaching him about the Mixing Origin realm appeared, and his mind was as clear as a mirror, fully understanding it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At some point, the Way of heaven and earth that had merged into the Hongze realm suddenly returned. The returning Way of heaven and earth seemed to have gained something extra - some intent of heaven and earth absorbed from the Hongze realm after mixing its origin.</p><p></p><p>The desolate realm still contained the intent of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But this intent of heaven and earth was empty and rootless, floating and elusive, and carried the intent of death.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, absorbing the intent of the desolate realm added some laws of death to his world, and where there is life in the world, there is naturally death.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang, reincarnation, so that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his world was truly complete, with both life and death, yin and yang cycling, reincarnation repeating.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again. If I use the sword of death to kill a small world's lord, wouldn't it be effortless?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his head...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A sword appeared floating in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The gray-white sword showed no sharp sword intent, not even an edge. However, upon closer inspection, it seemed to embody death itself! This was a sword of death! To touch it meant certain death, extinguishing all life force! "When will I have a chance to test this sword of death? If my strength is great enough, one strike could bring deathly silence to heaven and earth - that would be nothing special."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited. Finally, he had gained insight into a new sword - the sword of death!</p><p></p><p>"The Hongze realm shows no abnormalities?"</p><p></p><p>The sword in Xu Yan's hand disappeared as he looked in all directions, somewhat puzzled. </p><p></p><p>This realm seemed to have an ominous feeling. He had originally thought there might be some potential dangers, even unknown anomalies.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly, there turned out to be no danger at all.</p><p></p><p>His small heavenly eye looked out at the realm - vast and deathly silent, with no signs of life or any danger. Xu Yan's gaze turned to the ground. If anything was hidden in this realm, it could only be deep underground.</p><p></p><p>"I've found the Hongze realm and made some gains, even breaking through to the Establishing the Way realm. But how should I deal with this realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Even a deathly silent realm was extremely valuable. And the Hongze realm was intact - although lifeless, there was still a possibility of restoring life to it.</p><p></p><p>Neither his elemental turtle shell nor the storage artifact refined by Fang Hao could contain such a vast realm.</p><p></p><p>"Should I find a way to tow it back to the Great Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>The Unmelting Palace was also searching for the Hongze realm, surely with some scheme in mind. If he abandoned the realm here, it would eventually fall into the Unmelting Palace's hands.</p><p></p><p>But towing it back to the Great Wilderness would take considerable time, as the Hongze realm was now extremely far from the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan hadn't entered the Unmelting Lands just for the Hongze realm. He had come to explore the Unmelting Lands, to travel through them and gain insights into the martial way.</p><p></p><p>"Towing the Hongze realm back to the Great Wilderness would surely cause a commotion along the way. It would be easily detected by the Unmelting Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, unable to decide for the moment how to deal with this realm.</p><p></p><p>Destroying it would be a shame! "Forget it, I'll see how my junior brothers are doing, then discuss with the Vast Sea Turtle how to handle this realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped dwelling on it and went to look for Meng Chong and the other two.</p><p></p><p>The realm was vast, and Meng Chong's group of three had each gone in a different direction, naturally ending up extremely far apart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was in no hurry. He walked through the air, searching for the three while observing the realm. Perhaps there was something to be found somewhere in the realm?</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan discovered a pitch-black hole below, its bottom invisible.</p><p></p><p>"Was this formed during the great battle back then? Or did some special spirit creature burrow into the realm's interior?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hovered above the opening, his small heavenly eye exerting itself to the utmost as he peered down into the hole. All he could see was pitch blackness. Violent spiritual energy and unmelting energy swirled inside the cave, as if spiritual energy was gathering and accumulating within.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to investigate further, a message suddenly came through his communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the talisman to look, he raised an eyebrow. Someone was coming?</p><p></p><p>The Unmelting Palace? "Perfect timing!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's face lit up with joy. He had just broken through to the Establishing the Way realm and mastered the sword of death, and now enemies were delivering themselves to his doorstep to help him hone his sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was the perfect opportunity to test the might of the Establishing the Way realm and the power of the sword of death.</p><p></p><p>As for this cave, Xu Yan decided not to explore it for now. The cave would still be here; it wasn't going to disappear.</p><p></p><p>With one step, he emerged from the Hongze realm.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he came out, Meng Chong and the other two also emerged.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw that his three junior brothers had all broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you've broken through to the Establishing the Way realm?" Meng Chong asked excitedly, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Xu Yan nodded, smiling as he said, "Come, let's meet up with the Vast Sea Turtle. I'll explain the Establishing the Way realm to you, and then we'll go meet our enemies. Hopefully it's the master of a small realm - I can use that to hone my new sword."</p><p></p><p>The four brothers immediately returned to the great mountain to rendezvous with the Vast Sea Turtle.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Xu Yan explained the Establishing the Way realm to his three junior brothers, and also took the opportunity to explain the method of unification.</p><p></p><p>Although the four of them practiced different martial arts, all roads led to Rome. There were commonalities in the method of unification that could provide insights and help them understand their own paths to unification.</p><p></p><p>After the four left the realm, a faint white light lit up in the depths of the deep hole Xu Yan had discovered. The weak white light illuminated the darkness but did not shine out to the surface of the realm.</p><p></p><p>The desolate realm remained bleak.</p><p></p><p>As the white light gradually weakened, the cave returned to pitch blackness. At some point, a head emerged from the pitch-black cave.</p><p></p><p>It was a huge head, occupying a third of the cave opening.</p><p></p><p>The head was pure white jade, with no sense of flesh and blood. It seemed to be a jade head, white and without any luster. In the deathly silent realm, it did not appear out of place.</p><p></p><p>The head tilted back, revealing its face as it looked out beyond the realm.</p><p></p><p>The pure white jade face had delicate features, as if carved. Its eyes opened to reveal pitch-black pupils. The bright pupils showed no expression, yet had a lustrous sheen.</p><p></p><p>The bright eyes were calm and still, like carved eyes - lifelike in their carving, but devoid of any emotion or meaning.</p><p></p><p>The face stared out beyond the realm for a long time, as if pondering something. But neither its face nor its eyes showed any sign of thought.</p><p></p><p>At some point, it seemed to reach a decision.</p><p></p><p>The head continued to rise, gradually revealing shoulders above the cave opening, then chest, waist, until the entire figure emerged from the hole.</p><p></p><p>It was a jade person, pure white and flawless throughout. Even its clothes seemed carved, yet did not appear rigid, giving a sense of softness.</p><p></p><p>The jade person stood before the cave opening like a small giant, silently gazing out beyond the realm, as if pondering something again.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the jade person turned and left, moving away from the cave opening.</p><p></p><p>As it walked, it left no traces and no lingering aura.</p><p></p><p>With one step, it was instantly dozens of miles away. It took step after step until it reached a towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>The peak of this mountain had disappeared, destroyed in a great battle. Even so, the mountain remained majestic. The jade person walked step by step towards the mountain, its body merging into the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Before its entire body entered the mountain, the jade person's head rotated 180 degrees, its face turning directly to the back. Then it tilted slightly upward, looking out beyond the realm.</p><p></p><p>Then the head turned back, and it completely entered the mountain. The traces of its entry gradually disappeared. The jade person had completely vanished into the mountain, undetectable. The jade person was like a stone, an inconspicuous rock inside the mountain.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

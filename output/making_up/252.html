        <h1>Chapter 252</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Once again, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "My senior disciple Xu Yan is truly the pioneer of my martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has attained sudden enlightenment of the Qimen Armory, and you have obtained the Qimen Divine Armory."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has deeply understood the Qimen way of killing, and your Qimen martial dao has fused into one, granting you the Qimen Killing Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book, feeling greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>A certain armory appeared and floated above the Numinous Platform.</p><p></p><p>The Qimen Divine Armory! The killing weapon exclusive to the Qimen martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this armory reflected by the Great Dao Golden Book was not a physical armory, but a divine armory formed by the convergence of martial dao power.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine how powerful this armory must be.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although the armory is extraordinary, with Li Xuan's current Shen Yuan realm cultivation, he would never be able to fully unleash its full power.</p><p></p><p>However, since the divine armory is not physical, and was obtained from the feedback of the Great Dao Golden Book, Li Xuan, although only at the Shen Yuan realm, can still wield this armory.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the divine armory, the Qimen Killing Dao was also reflected.</p><p></p><p>This is the killing art of the Qimen martial dao. Whether it's formations, prohibitions, or celestial anomalies, the Qimen techniques are all integrated and unified, forming a powerful killing art.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Xuan's Qimen techniques are readily available, his killing at will, and can be seamlessly integrated and freely displayed with all the martial arts he has mastered.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, various forging materials flew over, the Cinnabar Flame appeared, and in Fang Hao's dazzled eyes, a forging furnace was produced.</p><p></p><p>With a casual throw, he tossed the forging furnace in front of Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"For forging, one should have the necessary furnace. Those forging furnaces in the Spirit Realm are just toys. This forging furnace is just right for you to use. Ones of too high a grade, you won't be able to use them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at the forging furnace in front of him, completely stunned. Formations, prohibitions, and other things were all contained in the forging furnace, and this forging furnace was almost beyond the grade of Spirit Artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt a little ashamed.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed too stupid, not even able to forge a forging furnace for his own use, and had to rely on his master's guidance.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>Although it was the first time forging, for him, it was as natural as breathing.</p><p></p><p>"Ponder well. The martial dao is boundless, I hope you can find your own Qimen path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He excitedly selected the necessary materials, preparing to forge his own Qimen armory. With this forging furnace, the speed and grade of forging would be higher.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was studying the formation diagrams. Although he had mastered the Mountain River Sword Formation, he needed to constantly improve and perfect it, as the sword formation and Fang Hao's formations were ultimately different.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the formation diagrams were of great reference value to him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a pen and paper, and began to draw his own Qimen armory. After the armory was drawn, he encountered another problem.</p><p></p><p>"The armory is not large, how to accommodate the array tools and other Qimen instruments?"</p><p></p><p>Unless it's like a storage bag, the Qimen armory contains an inner space to store various Qimen weapons.</p><p></p><p>So, in order to forge the Qimen armory, he must first forge a storage-type treasure.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Fang Hao began to research how to forge the storage ring his master mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the storage bag is just a small item, but contains a not-so-small space, is because of the Swallow Toad. Using the Swallow Toad as the main material.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to forge a treasure with inner space, in addition to the forging method, some special materials are also needed.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family's treasure vault has all kinds of materials, even the Swallow Toad skin for forging the storage bag, so the materials are not lacking, what's lacking is the complete forging method.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began to research it.</p><p></p><p>It hadn't been long since Xu Yan returned, when Meng Chong also returned.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was very excited, he began to manipulate the formations, wanting to try if he could trap his second senior brother.</p><p></p><p>The result was, although Meng Chong was not like Xu Yan, who directly transformed the formation into his own sword, he directly ignored the formation attack and barged in.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was a little depressed, this formation was clearly very strong, and could trap a Refining Shen Celestial for a while, but why was it ineffective against his big and second senior brothers?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, although he had not broken through, his strength had also increased a lot. Under the auxiliary cultivation of the Indestructible Golden Body, his Indestructible Golden Body had increased by at least 30%.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong returned, just like Xu Yan, he was also studying the formation diagrams, wanting to comprehend his own martial dao from them.</p><p></p><p>Ba Gua was also in the process of comprehension. With the guidance of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, Fang Hao's understanding of Ba Gua had greatly improved, allowing him to make progress in formations, prohibitions, and celestial anomalies.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he had a vague outline of how to integrate Ba Gua into formations and celestial anomalies.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was calm and peaceful, like a secluded world.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the turmoil in the Jade State martial dao world, with Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family raising the bounty, it did not affect the courtyard at all.</p><p></p><p>The disciples were diligently cultivating, and Li Xuan was also researching the fourth page of the Azure Void Book.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was constantly perfecting the martial dao techniques above his divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The third realm of the Sword Dao should also be put on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, Xu Yan had already broken through to the small success of the Heart Sword Realm, and his sword formation had made greater progress, becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Xu Yan broke through to the small success of the Heart Sword Realm, Li Xuan's Heart Sword Realm was perfected.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Suddenly, a figure flashed across the sky above the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Due to the formation covering the courtyard, that passing martial artist did not notice the existence of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan and the others didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was outside the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, although a bit remote, but it was not far from the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, so it was not uncommon for martial artists to pass by.</p><p></p><p>However, in the following days, there were martial artists passing by one after another, and they seemed to be searching for something.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Xuan became a little curious.</p><p></p><p>Has something happened in the Jade State?</p><p></p><p>"I finally succeeded in forging it!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked at the storage ring in his hand with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After this period of forging, he finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have forged a storage ring."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was very excited, taking the storage ring to his master for him to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan scanned it with his divine sense, the space inside the storage ring was not small, bigger than the storage bag, and it also looked more stable and convenient to use.</p><p></p><p>Although the forging was a bit rough, after all, it was his first time forging, it was still a remarkable achievement.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to refine it a bit, and it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited, now that the storage ring was forged, he could start forging the first Qimen armory.</p><p></p><p>The first storage ring, though a bit crude, Fang Hao casually gave it to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed to receive it.</p><p></p><p>In the next half month, Fang Hao forged several storage rings, one for each person in the courtyard, and they were all of huge space, one storage ring could store ten times the amount of a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The red cat was also very happy, as it also had a storage ring now.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the crafting of the storage ring, Fang Hao began to work on forging the Mysterious Door Armory.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of forging the Mysterious Door Armory was far beyond that of the storage ring, so he devoted all his attention to the forging of the Mysterious Door Armory.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sat cross-legged on the ground, with a knife resting across his knees. The sword intent of Xu Yan lingered around, turning the grass, sand, and stones into sharp swords.</p><p></p><p>And Meng Chong was comprehending this mysterious scene.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently observed for a while. "Meng Chong, you are about to break through the Concealed Blade Realm."</p><p></p><p>The second realm of the Dao of the Blade and the Sword Heart Realm had a similar profundity.</p><p></p><p>There is no place in the world without a blade!</p><p></p><p>The Concealed Blade Realm, concealing blades in the world, is both to veil the sharp edges and to imply that all things can be blades.</p><p></p><p>Concealing the blade without revealing it, once revealed, the sharp edge is unparalleled! "Your disciple Meng Chong has grasped the Concealed Blade Realm, you have mastered the Concealed Blade Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a few days later, Meng Chong broke through.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong's breakthrough, the sharp edges were all hidden, as if he was not a swordsman, but a refined scholar.</p><p></p><p>If not for his towering stature and bald head, and if he wore a scholar's robe, who would have thought that he was an unrivaled expert in the Dao of the Blade?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A figure flew across the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"This is the eighth one."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Has something big happened in Yuzhou?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the senior brother and second brother's matter?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu suspected.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? My senior brother and I have been cultivating, we haven't gone to settle the score with the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also nodded, it has been a long time since they slapped the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, and killed that third-rate Spiritual Sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The current major event, how could it be related to them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, another person has come, I'll go ask."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped out, his figure disappearing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A few miles away from the courtyard, a brown-robed warrior was exploring the surroundings, almost not sparing a single large tree, as if wanting to dig three feet underground to search.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The young man was handsome and revealed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what are you looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior was searching the surroundings, when suddenly a figure silently appeared, startling him.</p><p></p><p>When he looked up and saw Xu Yan, he was even more dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Xu... Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, "Do you know me?"</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior was now both excited and frightened, this was the fierce person who had slain a Cultivated Spirit Celestial, and although he was a Great Celestial Warrior, he was definitely no match for him.</p><p></p><p>But! He had discovered Xu Yan's whereabouts, as long as he reported it to the Jade Spirit Sect, he could get a huge bounty.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen your portrait before."</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior wanted to leave, immediately reporting Xu Yan's whereabouts to the Jade Spirit Sect, as for capturing or killing Xu Yan for an even higher bounty, he knew his own limitations.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what are you looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The other party's expression seemed a bit off when he saw him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he's looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I'm just looking for a spiritual beast I'm raising that has gone missing, so I'm here to look for it.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it's the spiritual beast I'm raising that has gone missing, I'm looking for the spiritual beast."</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior regained his composure and laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, have you seen a brown-colored little beast around here?"</p><p></p><p>He must stabilize Xu Yan and not let him become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled, "I hate liars the most, I'll give you a chance to speak again!"</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior was immediately drenched in cold sweat, a sense of life-and-death crisis surfacing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as long as he didn't answer correctly, he would be reduced to ashes immediately! He wanted to flee, but his instinct told him that if he fled, he would definitely die!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a layer of invisible killing intent had enveloped the surroundings! "It's the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family who have put a bounty on you and Meng Chong, I was just... just..."</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior was covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to defend himself, that he wasn't here to seek Xu Yan and Meng Chong's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows, so the warriors who had passed by these days were all searching for his and Meng Chong's whereabouts?</p><p></p><p>What kind of bounty had the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family offered? "Tell me, what bounty have the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family offered?"</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior dared not hide anything, and told him everything in detail.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but be astonished when he heard this, the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family had really made a big move.</p><p></p><p>As long as they discovered his and Meng Chong's whereabouts and reported it, they could get a reward of a million spirit crystals; if they found their hiding place and reported it, they could get the identity of a Sect or Family warrior, and a reward of five million spirit crystals or equivalent treasures.</p><p></p><p>For capturing or killing them, the bounty was even more not to be mentioned.</p><p></p><p>They even offered a spirit crystal mine as one of the rewards.</p><p></p><p>The few Cultivated Spirit Celestial scattered cultivators in Yuzhou were using every means to search for the whereabouts of Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that Cultivated Spirit experts from other states had come to Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"I swear I won't reveal your whereabouts!"</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of fear.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, am not a bloodthirsty person. Since I know this, how could I stay here? So whether you reveal my whereabouts or not, it won't affect me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, raising his hand to fling the brown-robed warrior away.</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed warrior fled frantically, as if he had been reborn.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan actually appeared near the capital of Zheng State, this meant that Xu Yan and Meng Chong were hiding within the borders of Zheng State.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely important piece of information.</p><p></p><p>Reporting this, a few hundred million spirit crystals would be in his hands, as a scattered cultivator, this was already a huge fortune.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to the manor and told the news.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at him with admiration, the senior brother and second brother were really formidable, forcing the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family to bleed so much! "Hehe, the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family are really generous."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed. </p><p></p><p>Both spirit mines and spirit flowers, stirring up the entire cultivation storm in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to take back the spirit mines of the Jade Spirit Sect, but since my junior brother is good at formations, that's just perfect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, don't worry, the Spirit Realm has never had formations before, as long as I set up the formations, even Cultivated Spirit Celestials won't be able to detect anything, the spirit mines will be ours from now on."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was very excited, thinking about being able to contend against the Sects and Families, his whole being was burning with passion.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivated Spirit Celestials will soon come to investigate this place."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Since he had appeared here, the Cultivated Spirit Celestials of the Jade Spirit Sect or the Shu Family must come to investigate this place.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 506</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked arrogantly, a contemptuous smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. "Even if I taught you the Dragon Subduing technique, do you think trash like you could successfully cultivate it? Moreover, are you even worthy?"</p><p></p><p>His gaze was full of disdain and contempt, as if looking at a group of useless people.</p><p></p><p>The five Divine Venerables instantly exploded with anger. Their auras erupted violently, causing the weather to change and the surging blue sea to suddenly become calm. </p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible pressure prevented even the slightest ripple from forming on the sea's surface.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged, as if he hadn't noticed. He continued speaking casually: "I've heard that some Divine Venerables from the Dao Realm have been unable to increase their strength for a long time, unable to break through their bottleneck. So they came to the Divine Realm, wanting to take advantage of the changes in heaven and earth to find an opportunity for breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"You five, you wouldn't happen to be among those Divine Venerables, would you? Especially you!" His gaze fell on the white-haired Divine Venerable as he mocked, "White hair, considering yourself an elder, having lived for ages, yet still unable to break through, stuck at the Divine Venerable bottleneck for who knows how many years? You can't even break through the mere Divine Venerable realm, yet you have the nerve to try and obtain the Dragon Subduing technique? You're so useless, even if you got the technique, could you understand it? Could you comprehend it?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Divine Venerable's eyes instantly turned blood-red, his breathing heavy, his aura becoming violent. The words "useless old man" seemed to be buzzing in his mind! In his youth, he had been praised as a once-in-a-millennium prodigy, with the potential to become a Supreme Being. He had risen powerfully, but ultimately stagnated at the Divine Venerable realm, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard he cultivated, no matter how much he pondered, even seeking guidance from Supreme Beings, he still could not break through! Whenever he recalled the praises of his youth - being called a once-in-a-millennium prodigy, having Supreme Being potential - it felt like a slap in the face, becoming a demon in his heart.</p><p></p><p>How could the white-haired Divine Venerable endure such mockery? He roared in anger, "Xu Yan, you brat, today this old man will tear you to pieces!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Attack, kill this arrogant brat!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Divine Venerable's aura erupted, a crimson light emerging from his body, transforming into a giant hammer that smashed forward.</p><p></p><p>The other four Divine Venerables, also angered by Xu Yan's contemptuous gaze, followed the white-haired one's lead and attacked.</p><p></p><p>The five Divine Venerables joined forces, attacking Xu Yan from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's roar sounded, dragon might sweeping out, like an enraged true dragon, its savage aura descending.</p><p></p><p>"You like the Dragon Subduing technique so much? Then let me kill you with it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, raising his hand to strike out with his palm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon's Fury! He directly used the divine ability Dragon's Fury. A golden giant dragon appeared, letting out a roar. Thunder and dark clouds instantly appeared. The true dragon's eyes seemed to contain extreme rage.</p><p></p><p>Wind, rain and thunder accompanied the dragon's roar. The dragon's savage might swept across heaven and earth as the true dragon burst forth, sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The five Divine Venerable martial artists' expressions changed drastically in shock. At this moment, they felt as if they were facing an enraged true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Dragon might surged, lightning accompanying the true dragon. The savage true dragon power made their scalps tingle!</p><p></p><p>Is this the Dragon Subduing technique?!</p><p></p><p>The five Divine Venerables wore expressions of disbelief. This was clearly a true dragon, seemingly enraged to the extreme, wanting to perish together with its enemies!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Under the strike of Dragon's Fury, the five Divine Venerables retreated, their auras in disarray. The white-haired Divine Venerable in particular coughed up blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the five looked at the young man with shocked expressions. What kind of martial technique was this? It was so powerful and inconceivable, completely beyond their understanding!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward. With a boom, huge waves rose up, transforming into five giant swords standing on the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>"Today, the one who will slay you is the Sword God Xu Yan. Remember it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly, raising his hand to point. The giant swords slashed down with a boom.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Venerable martial artists were not weak. Realizing that Xu Yan's strength far exceeded their expectations, how could they dare to be careless? They immediately used their ultimate techniques.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A great battle erupted. The blue sea churned with huge waves, wind and clouds surged. The intense battle shook the area for hundreds of miles.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Yan turned the rolling waves into sword after sword, surging forth like a flood of ten thousand swords, continuously pouring out.</p><p></p><p>Each sword emanated a different sword intent - some ice-cold, some blazing hot, some like a gentle breeze. But regardless of the sword intent, they all contained sharp killing power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each sword seemed to possess intelligence, displaying different offensive techniques.</p><p></p><p>Fighting one against five, Xu Yan still moved freely and easily. In contrast, the five Divine Venerables roared continuously, constantly using various secret techniques, yet were still suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Mere Divine Venerables dare to come find me, Xu Yan? Who gave you the courage?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was indifferent. </p><p></p><p>Divine Venerables were no longer worthy of his attention!</p><p></p><p>Although his current strength was not comparable to a Supreme Being, crushing Divine Venerables was no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>He was no ordinary Heaven and Earth realm martial artist. Even though he had just entered the Heaven and Earth realm, he was still not comparable to Divine Venerable realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As the battle continued, the flood of sword waves converged from all directions, enveloping the five Divine Venerables, constantly tightening the encircled area.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan even had one hand behind his back, waving just one hand to send rolling sword waves to attack.</p><p></p><p>At one point, Xu Yan stomped his foot. With a boom, the sea surface directly caved in, forming a large depression.</p><p></p><p>Then, a huge vortex appeared. The vortex surged violently, like a sword vortex formed by countless swords. Sharp killing intent swept down, as if engulfing this entire sea area in the sword vortex.</p><p></p><p>"What, you think you can sneak attack me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was contemptuous as he looked towards a shocked figure below the sword vortex.</p><p></p><p>Someone from the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow!</p><p></p><p>This was an Earth Shadow with Divine Venerable realm strength.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six, wearing a dark cloud mask, never imagined he would be exposed, that Xu Yan would detect him.</p><p></p><p>Now, looking at the rolling vortex around him, the killing intent stimulated him. An intense sense of crisis enveloped him, as if he would be shredded to pieces by the vortex at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"How did he discover me?"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>He was confident in his stealth and concealment techniques. With Xu Yan engaged in intense battle with five Divine Venerables, amid such violent commotion, he should absolutely not have been able to detect his presence.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan seemed to have discovered him long ago, waiting until he sneaked close before suddenly attacking, trapping him in this sword vortex.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you can't stop me-"</p><p></p><p>A chilling aura erupted from Seventy-six's body. With a boom, a layer of dazzling cold light burst forth from his body, smashing towards the sword vortex enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>However, to his shock, such a powerful attack did not break open the vortex. Instead, under the vortex's rotation, this attack was sucked in, spinning with the vortex.</p><p></p><p>At one point, his attack actually burst out from the vortex, striking back at him!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six's face paled in shock. He hurriedly attacked again, this time directly using a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Amid a layer of gray smoke, Seventy-six's form seemed to become illusory, nearly merging with</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the seawater, his form seemed to flicker indistinctly, impossible to pinpoint.</p><p></p><p>Waves of cold attacks emerged from hidden places, forming a giant blade that slashed fiercely towards the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained indifferent. With a wave of his hand, a golden dragon suddenly appeared in the sword vortex, spiraling along with it. At that moment, all the surging power of the sea was gathered.</p><p></p><p>True Dragon Controls Water!</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>Seventy-six's expression was one of shock. His scalp tingled as he felt an invisible pressure condensing around him, as if a great mountain was pressing down on his body.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon wrapped around the vortex, spiraling and constricting. The space around Seventy-six grew smaller and smaller, and the solidifying force on his body became increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that at any moment, he would be crushed to death in its coils!</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he deployed his secret techniques, he was unable to break free. Even his strongest attacks seemed to dissipate into the vast blue sea.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six knew that to break out of this situation, his only option was to defeat that golden dragon. Otherwise, all his attacks would be neutralized by the dragon's control over the sea water. But his strength was not enough to overcome the limits of the dragon's water control and break through its power to neutralize attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six let out a low roar. His form instantly vanished from where he stood. The next moment, he appeared before the golden dragon, gripping a gray short blade in his hand. The blade flashed with a gray light, disappearing from Seventy-six's hand. With a "puff" sound, it stabbed into the golden dragon's head.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The dragon's head exploded, and the short blade shattered to pieces from the impact. But the strike had finally succeeded! Seventy-six's expression was one of joy. This was the strongest attack of the Earth Shadow, often used for instantly ambushing targets stronger than oneself.</p><p></p><p>The short blade was also a specially crafted divine weapon, capable of unleashing an attack that surpassed one's own power limits in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With the golden dragon broken, the chance to escape was right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As for killing Xu Yan, Seventy-six now had enough self-awareness to know that Xu Yan's strength was not something a Divine Venerable cultivator could match.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take the opportunity to flee, with a roar, another golden giant dragon descended, continuing to wrap around the vortex and spiral.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six's eyes were blank with shock.</p><p></p><p>Before he could recover, yet another golden giant dragon descended. The two dragons spiraled around each other, continuously shrinking the space, trapping him completely within the vortex.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Seventy-six's eyes were filled with despair!</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was indifferent. His form moved, instantly vanishing from where he stood. The next moment, he appeared before the white-haired Divine Venerable.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike fell! The divine ability: Heaven-Severing Sword!</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Divine Venerable's eyes showed terror. Without even a hint of resistance, he was instantly turned to ash and scattered!</p><p></p><p>The other four Divine Venerables were terrified!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, we admit defeat! We'll leave now!"</p><p></p><p>Someone spoke with a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who is my enemy has no chance of leaving alive!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Another sword strike fell! No matter how the four Divine Venerables unleashed their secret techniques or deployed their ultimate life-saving measures, it was all useless. Xu Yan killed them all with one sword strike each.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only Seventy-six remained, this Divine Venerable cultivator of the Heaven's Bane Earth Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to die, or live?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six swallowed hard. "You're willing to spare my life?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it just depends on whether you know what's good for you, whether you're smart enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender! I'm willing to be Young Master Xu's slave!"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six promptly caved in.</p><p></p><p>Faced with life-or-death crisis, he felt his mind was clearer than ever before.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Since you want to live, then open your mind. If you resist even slightly, don't blame me if you die."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I definitely won't resist!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was either die or obey.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he would die after obeying, he could only take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly used the Heaven's Will to control Seventy-six's mind. This was a Divine Venerable level member of the Heaven's Bane Earth Shadow, far more useful than those Immortal Venerable cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He could be put to good use.</p><p></p><p>After taking control of Seventy-six, Xu Yan assigned him some tasks, such as gathering the other Heaven's Bane Earth Shadow members that Xu Yan had secretly controlled.</p><p></p><p>"Draw me maps of all you know about the Dao Realm, Earth Shadow Realm, and Heaven's Bane Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six nodded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He drew out maps of all he knew about the Dao Realm, Heaven's Bane Realm, and even the Earth Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took them and glanced over them, then instructed: "Find an opportunity to return to the Dao Realm and Heaven's Bane Realm. Await further orders."</p><p></p><p>He tossed Seventy-six a communication talisman and said: "Be careful not to expose yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Go now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-six vanished from the spot, as if he had never appeared there.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the maps Seventy-six had drawn. "The Dao Realm has three hundred worlds, each the same. And besides the three hundred worlds, there is the territory of the Dao Realm itself, which is also vast, with places even Divine Venerables have never set foot in.</p><p></p><p>"Even with his status as a Divine Venerable, his understanding of the Heaven's Bane Realm is not extensive. But it's enough. There should be some treasures in the hidden places of the Heaven's Bane Realm."</p><p></p><p>Heaven's Bane had grand ambitions, plotting to seize the authority of the Taicang world and become the new ruler of heaven and earth. Yet within the Dao Realm, there still existed ancient minor world rulers.</p><p></p><p>For example, Taimiao was one of them.</p><p></p><p>In such circumstances, for Heaven's Bane to dare plot for the authority of the Taicang world showed they must have some confidence.</p><p></p><p>"There are no more treasures in the Divine Realm that interest me. It's time to wander the Dao Realm. If I can empty out the treasures of the Heaven's Bane Realm, it should be enough for me to quickly cultivate to the Dao Establishment realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already made plans in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He would not wait in the Divine Realm for people to come find him, but was preparing to infiltrate the Dao Realm. This was both to seek enlightenment for the Creation realm, and to quickly increase his own strength to break through to the Dao Establishment realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to have a chat with the Ancient Sea Turtle, to find out where exactly that opportunity is."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not forgotten his deal with the Ancient Sea Turtle. Perhaps that great opportunity would be helpful for his Creation realm? He raised his palm, and a sphere of the Dao's essence appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, I've come to complete our previous deal."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a communication talisman and sent a message to the Ancient Sea Turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Come quickly to this place, young friend. Be careful not to expose your whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's excited voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. If I, Xu Yan, want to conceal myself, even a Realm Lord might not be able to find me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled confidently.</p><p></p><p>With a single step, he instantly vanished from the spot. Soon after, he arrived at the Ancient Sea Turtle's hiding place.</p><p></p><p>"You old turtle, you're quite good at hiding."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but sigh. This Ancient Sea Turtle's concealment technique was the most marvelous he had ever seen. Unless he carefully searched with his Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, he would not be able to detect this turtle at all.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 15: Killing a Tiger with Bare Hands, the Richest Man in East River Prefecture</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>In the evil forest, a tiger's roar echoed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already pounced on the red-eyed tiger, circulating his qi and blood, unleashing his strength, and suddenly punching the red-eyed tiger's head with a powerful blow.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The red-eyed tiger, which had just stood up and was about to go berserk, was dazed by this punch and fell back down, its four limbs softening.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The red-eyed tiger was provoked to its ferocious nature, roaring and shaking its head, trying to roll over and shake off Xu Yan, its claws poised and ready.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, having landed a successful strike, naturally would not stop there. He grabbed the back of the red-eyed tiger's neck and delivered another punch to its head.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he slammed the red-eyed tiger to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The red-eyed tiger is truly the king of tigers, taking two of my punches and still able to struggle!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, although he had not tempered his golden bones, he had broken through the limits of copper bones, and his physical strength was such that even blades and swords could not harm him. With his qi and blood erupting, he could easily shatter rocks and boulders.</p><p></p><p>Yet, such a terrifying punch had not been able to kill the red-eyed tiger, demonstrating the tiger's formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan punched the red-eyed tiger's head again.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This punch directly drove the red-eyed tiger's head into the ground!</p><p></p><p>The red-eyed tiger clawed at the ground, trying to struggle up, its tail swinging and sweeping around with tremendous force. If an ordinary person were to be hit by it, they might not be able to get up for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"So hard to kill?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a loud roar, and at this moment, his qi and blood seemed to have reached their limit. He felt as if a surge of qi and blood had wrapped around his fist, and the fist had visibly grown larger.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>This punch landed heavily on the back of the red-eyed tiger's neck.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>A cracking sound of bones breaking could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The red-eyed tiger let out a painful howl, its head falling into the mud, unable to lift it up, its limbs convulsing as if it had lost all strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's punch had directly broken the red-eyed tiger's neck!</p><p></p><p>"Now it's definitely dead, right?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had only thrown a few punches, each one had unleashed the eruption of his qi and blood, especially the last one, which had reached the pinnacle of his qi and blood explosion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wiped the sweat from his brow and panted as he got up from the tiger's body. At this moment, the red-eyed tiger let out a deep, rumbling roar, its body convulsing, and it was clear that it was not going to survive.</p><p></p><p>"I, with bare hands, have killed the king of tigers!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his fists, his eyes burning with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had not had his fill yet.</p><p></p><p>"The king of tigers is nothing after all!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the true way of the martial arts, and I have not even begun to learn, yet I already possess such strength. Once I start my training, how powerful will I become?</p><p></p><p>"Can I easily crush beasts like the red-eyed tiger with a single punch?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's determination in the martial arts had grown even stronger, his eyes filled with fanaticism and longing.</p><p></p><p>He picked up his sword and hung it at his waist. The red-eyed tiger had already breathed its last. He directly hoisted the tiger and strode away.</p><p></p><p>"I'll deal with it in the town, then hurry back to East River Prefecture and have the alchemist concoct some precious medicines to enhance the nourishing effects!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of exhilaration on his face. He was certain that he could temper his golden bones and stand shoulder to shoulder with the ancient prodigies, and he would not let his master down!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>East River Prefecture, one of the twenty-six prefectures of Qi State.</p><p></p><p>If there was one thing that the commoners in the streets and alleys of East River Prefecture were most fond of gossiping about, it would be the young master of the wealthy Xu family. From the high-ranking officials to the common folk, even the beggars on the street, everyone knew and was aware of the young master of the wealthy family, who was a martial arts fanatic.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he a martial arts fanatic, but he was also considered a fool. After reading some fictional stories, he had firmly believed that there were reclusive masters in the world, and he wanted to go and find one to become his teacher and learn the true martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were those who were bold and arrogant, pretending to be superior and deceiving others. In the end, they were exposed and beaten severely, then thrown into prison. Over time, no one dared to impersonate superior figures to commit fraud anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, the young master of the wealthy family was not satisfied. He began to wander around, claiming that he wanted to seek out a superior master and learn the supreme martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Last month, the young master of the wealthy family was jilted.</p><p></p><p>It caused an uproar throughout the city, with many mocking him. They all felt that the cancellation of the engagement was well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>The girl was not an ordinary commoner, but the daughter of General Jiang Pingshan, the great general of the Eastern River. For the Xu family, it was an overreach.</p><p></p><p>This engagement had been arranged by Xu Yan's maternal grandfather and the Eastern River General.</p><p></p><p>As for the legendary figures of the Eastern River Prefecture, the wealthy Xu Junhe was definitely one of them. He came from a humble background, but had considerable business acumen. What was most astonishing was that he had married the daughter of the former Eastern River Prefect, the current Supervisor of the Ministry of Personnel, Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>It was this relationship, combined with Xu Junhe's business skills, that allowed him to quickly become the wealthiest man in the Eastern River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, his only son was a disappointment. Not only did he lack business talent, but his mind was filled with thoughts of the martial arts. He even failed to maintain the marriage engagement with the General's daughter.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that when the General's daughter came to the Xu family to break off the engagement, the young master of the Xu family arrogantly declared that one day he would make the General's daughter regret her decision, and that she was not worthy of him.</p><p></p><p>This statement became the laughing stock of the Eastern River Prefecture. A mere merchant's family being able to marry into the General's family was already a great fortune, yet he dared to claim that he was above the General's daughter?</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the fact that Xu Junhe had the backing of the Supervisor of the Ministry of Personnel, Guo Rongshan, the Eastern River General might have raided the Xu family's residence upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of Guo Rongshan's influence that Xu Junhe was able to bring a valuable gift and apologize to the Eastern River General Jiang Pingshan, thus defusing the latter's anger.</p><p></p><p>A horse-drawn cart was moving along the main street of the eastern city, attracting many curious gazes.</p><p></p><p>The goods on the cart were covered with a burlap cloth, so it was impossible to see what was loaded. The focus of the people on the street was not on the goods, but on the young man driving the cart.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Junhe is quite a character, how did he end up with such a son?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family's vast wealth has no heir now."</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily, Xu Junhe is still young. If the son doesn't work out, maybe the grandson will."</p><p></p><p>"If he marries the General's daughter, then it would work out. But now, it's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>There was much discussion and commentary on the street.</p><p></p><p>Some expressed lament, others took delight in the misfortune, and there were also those who looked down on the situation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan ignored these discussions, which had been going on for days. If this had happened before, he would have been furious, but now he simply felt disdainful.</p><p></p><p>They were just a bunch of fools in a well.</p><p></p><p>How could they understand the vastness of the world and the power of the martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Once I have mastered the martial arts, not only these common merchants and commoners, but even the mighty emperors above, will not be worthy of my attention!</p><p></p><p>The General's daughter is so impressive? </p><p></p><p>Once I have mastered the martial arts, even a princess of the imperial family would not be worthy of me!</p><p></p><p>I said I would make her feel unworthy, and that is exactly what I will do!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Xu Yan's eyes were arrogant and his gaze was resolute. He believed that this day would come sooner than later!</p><p></p><p>The Crimson-Eyed Tiger, the king of tigers, would allow him to quickly refine his golden bones.</p><p></p><p>He would stand shoulder to shoulder with the legendary heroes of the past!</p><p></p><p>The Xu family residence of the Eastern River Prefecture's wealthiest, located on the main street near the prefecture government office, was a luxurious mansion.</p><p></p><p>There were no less than a hundred servants and guards. The guards were skilled martial artists, capable of feats like wall-running and crushing boulders.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the inner courtyard of the Xu family, the lady of the Xu household, the daughter of the current Supervisor of the Ministry of Personnel, and Xu Yan's mother, had a worried expression on her face. Her foolish son had been missing for a month...</p>

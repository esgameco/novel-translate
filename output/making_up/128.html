        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gaze was filled with tender affection, the eyes brimming with infinite gentleness.</p><p></p><p>With every frown and smile, there seemed to be an alluring power that stirred one's passions and aroused one's desires.</p><p></p><p>"This woman is incredibly powerful, far surpassing even the imperial consorts of the Qi Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Given his state of mind, he too had been somewhat stirred.</p><p></p><p>He hastily reined in his emotions, staring at the woman, and gradually his mind became clear again - as long as he did not wish it, her charms could not disturb his equanimity.</p><p></p><p>They could not disrupt his inner tranquility.</p><p></p><p>"If I do not seek, then desire will not arise. Do not try to unsettle my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt his state of mind had risen to a new level, with external things increasingly unable to interfere with his inner calm. His dedication to the Dao of the Sword grew ever more resolute.</p><p></p><p>"I am not far from attaining the pinnacle of the Sword Heart Enlightenment. I hope to refine my mind further at the Peerless Pavilion of the Thousand Star Lake, laying the foundation to break through to that realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Pavilion of the Thousand Star Lake was truly a wonderful place - not only could he admire the beautiful women, but he could also hone his inner tranquility, and most importantly, without spending a single penny!</p><p></p><p>"Young master, your servant is feeling warm..."</p><p></p><p>The woman was also puzzled - how could this young master seem completely unaffected?</p><p></p><p>Her red lips parted slightly, her voice coy and seductive as she called out softly.</p><p></p><p>She was now clad only in a thin veil, her enchanting figure hazy and alluring, tempting one with the impulse to tear away that gossamer fabric and behold her wondrous beauty...</p><p></p><p>"This woman has a captivating aura, every movement of her limbs seemingly imbued with an irresistible allure. Could it be that the women of the Peerless Pavilion have cultivated some technique to ensnare the hearts and minds of men?</p><p></p><p>"And her voice too has a certain power to captivate the senses. For those whose cultivation is not strong or whose willpower is not firm, they would surely be unable to resist."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered deeply. He had suddenly realized that not only the dancing girls outside, but also the women in the private rooms, all possessed a unique seductive charm.</p><p></p><p>"The Peerless Pavilion, what a wonderful place! This is just the lower-tier pleasure boats of the Thousand Star Lake - if the women here have such bewitching arts, then the higher-tier boats with their renowned courtesans, how much more potent must their allure be? To refine my mind through their seductive powers, truly a brilliant method!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grew increasingly excited.</p><p></p><p>"If I can traverse the Peerless Pavilion, even the legendary master-level courtesans, their charms would be unable to unsettle my heart. Then what in this world could still disturb my sword heart? The attainment of the Sword Heart Enlightenment would be but a natural progression."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Xu Yan could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>He must venture deeper into the Thousand Star Lake, to the more luxurious and grand pleasure boats, where the women's beauty and power would be even greater, and their seductive arts even more formidable. For the purpose of refining his mind, the effects would be all the more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>"Young master?"</p><p></p><p>The music had stopped, and the woman seemed puzzled, wondering if her allure had somehow diminished, that she could not even captivate this young man.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rose and departed.</p><p></p><p>The woman: ...</p><p></p><p>You come to listen to a song and then just leave?</p><p></p><p>Opening the door of the private room, Xu Yan stepped out. The manager was somewhat perplexed. "Young master, are you satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head. "It was average, nothing interesting. I'm leaving!"</p><p></p><p>The manager: ...</p><p></p><p>This feels like the response of someone who's just finished and is now pulling up his pants, saying, "Nothing special..."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the room fee is five thousand spirit crystals. You see..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave him a stern look. "Didn't we agree that if I'm not satisfied, I don't have to pay? Are you going back on your word?"</p><p></p><p>"No, but you did enter the room..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense. I only went in to listen to a song, and then left immediately. It was truly very average, I didn't feel the slightest bit moved."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you're treating the Peerless Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't threaten me. I fear nothing more than threats. This was the agreement - if I'm not satisfied, I don't pay. If you go back on your word, do you think my sword is not sharp enough?"</p><p></p><p>The manager's scalp tingled. Since becoming the manager of the Peerless Pavilion's pleasure boats, this was the first time he had encountered someone trying to get in for free.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the woman from the private room came out, her eyes filled with confusion. "What did he do in there? Has my allure diminished? Has my seductive arts weakened?"</p><p></p><p>The manager's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Does he really think the Peerless Pavilion is just some small brothel, that he can come in and leave without paying?</p><p></p><p>"He did nothing, just listened to a song. Is my seductive power declining?" the woman asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The manager: ...</p><p></p><p>So he really just went in to listen to a song? Didn't do anything else?</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving. If you go back on your word, feel free to come find me. Let's see if the Peerless Pavilion wants to maintain its reputation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The manager opened his mouth, but ultimately swallowed his pride. After all, he had made the promise, and in the Peerless Pavilion, once a promise was made, it had to be kept. Even if the other party was to be killed over it, he as the manager would still face severe punishment. </p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he could only accept the loss.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan left, he excitedly made his way to the deeper parts of the Thousand Star Lake, to the even more luxurious and grand pleasure boats.</p><p></p><p>When he entered, he again did not spend a single spirit crystal. The Peerless Pavilion's servants were dumbfounded, and what's more, he even asked if he could try out the charms of the room's ladies, and only pay if he was satisfied!</p><p></p><p>What kind of talk was that!</p><p></p><p>However, the managers of the pleasure boats were quite confident in their ladies, unafraid that the customers would leave without paying after enjoying their services. So they readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>The result was that the man went in and came out again shortly, declaring, "It was average, nothing interesting!" This incident gradually spread, and many cultivators began to reflect - was it a mistake to pay first and then enjoy the experience? Some started to imitate him, entering the boats and refusing to order any refreshments, instead demanding to try the ladies first before paying if satisfied.</p><p></p><p>On the serene lake, purple plants grew in the water, their pink flowers in full bloom. Amidst this floral sea stood a towering building - the Purple Flower Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had arrived.</p><p></p><p>This was half a month after he had first come to the Thousand Star Lake. His mind had grown ever more tranquil, and he felt he was on the verge of attaining the pinnacle of the Sword Heart Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Purple Flower Pavilion, one of the top ten renowned pleasure houses of the Peerless Pavilion. Even if there are no master-level courtesans here, there must be first-rate ones, whose seductive arts are surely even more potent!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked across the water towards the Purple Flower Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Those who could come to this place were either of distinguished background or possessed formidable cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the pavilion, Xu Yan was about to enter when a servant at the door greeted him with a smile. "Young master, the entrance fee is one hundred spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned. "I've never heard of the Peerless Pavilion charging an entrance fee. What is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>The servant maintained his smile, though inwardly he was muttering, "It's all because of a certain someone who has ruined the customs, causing some cultivators to start not paying and trying to get in for free. Now we have to implement an entrance fee."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Losing face now. Come in and watch the dance, listen to the songs, appreciate the beauties, and then just leave without spending a single spirit crystal - how shameless!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, those martial artists who couldn't afford to come to the Peerless Pavilion before are now rushing in to freeload, and even bringing their friends along to boost their courage.</p><p></p><p>This is simply outrageous!</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Pavilion can only frown and change the rules.</p><p></p><p>'Young master, you may not know, but the entry fee was just announced yesterday,' the servant said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reluctantly took out a spirit token, wincing inwardly. This was worth a hundred spirit crystals - how much had he toiled to earn that much by killing a patriarch? To spend a hundred spirit crystals just to enter, it was truly painful.</p><p></p><p>A hundred spirit crystals could buy a Blue Origin Fruit.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he put the spirit token back, preparing to hand it to the waiting servant, but the servant's smile suddenly froze as he eyed Xu Yan suspiciously, wondering if this man was the one causing trouble. Xu Yan said solemnly, 'I am Xie Lingfeng, here to cultivate my mind at the Peerless Pavilion. Could you please make an exception for me?'</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng? The servant was stunned, then shocked. The most prodigious sword dao genius of Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years? One of the three youngest patriarchs in the Inner Realm? He had recently even repelled a half-step Grand Patriarch, Yin Hong, and was hailed as the number one under the Grand Patriarchs! The treatment accorded to geniuses, especially those from major powers, was far beyond that of ordinary martial artists. Hearing this, the servant's face broke into a wide smile as he respectfully said, 'So it's Young Master Xie. Please, come in!'</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed. 'Xie Gege's reputation really comes in handy. No wonder he told me to come to the Inner Realm - I can just drop his name whenever I run into trouble.</p><p></p><p>'Xie Gege is a man of his word. Next time I see him, I'll ask him to give me some pointers on the sword dao.'</p><p></p><p>Saving a hundred spirit crystals and being able to cultivate his mind for free, Xu Yan was in high spirits as he stepped into the Purple Flower Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, news spread across Thousand Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>The genius of Sword Saint Cliff, Xie Lingfeng, had visited the Purple Flower Pavilion and even requested the top courtesan. If the top courtesan could not capture his heart, the Peerless Pavilion would not charge him a single cent! All the martial artists were shocked.</p><p></p><p>'So it's Xie Lingfeng, no wonder he gets such treatment. He's the number one genius of Sword Saint Cliff in a thousand years, and is even said to be the best under the Grand Patriarchs.'</p><p></p><p>'No wonder the Flower Maiden was willing to let him into the private room.'</p><p></p><p>'The Flower Maiden, I once caught a glimpse of her from afar and my blood boiled. I was dizzy for days after that. It's no wonder Xie Lingfeng couldn't resist her charms.'</p><p></p><p>For a time, Xie Lingfeng's visit to the Peerless Pavilion became the talk of the town.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, news spread again that Xie Lingfeng had stayed in the Flower Maiden's private room for less than half an hour before leaving, unmoved by her seductions. The Peerless Pavilion did not charge him a single cent.</p><p></p><p>In the heart of Thousand Star Lake stood a towering, gilded building, surrounded by beautiful women - from the servants to the managers, all were enchanting females. This was the Peerless Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had come here under Xie Lingfeng's name. After leaving the Purple Flower Pavilion, he had come up with a plan - he would claim to be here to cultivate his mind, and whoever could shake his mental state would have Xie Lingfeng's help. The Peerless Pavilion valued this greatly, as Xie Lingfeng's assistance would be invaluable, especially once he became the Sword Saint of Sword Saint Cliff in the future.</p><p></p><p>So in the remaining renowned establishments, the Peerless Pavilion sent their top courtesans, with the weakest being at the Qi Condensation realm, to entertain Xu Yan. Finally, all ten top courtesans joined forces, stirring Xu Yan's heart for a while before his mental state was further refined.</p><p></p><p>Now he had arrived at the true Peerless Pavilion. Rumor had it that there were Patriarch-level courtesans here.</p><p></p><p>'How will the seductive arts of the Patriarch-level courtesan fare against my "Heartless" realm? Can they still disturb my mind?'</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought excitedly. 'My "Heartless" realm has reached new depths. Even the most primal desires cannot sway my heart. What else could possibly unsettle me?'</p><p></p><p>His sword heart was nearing enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward, filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>'Xie Lingfeng has arrived!'</p><p></p><p>The martial artists on the high pavilion hurried over upon hearing the news. Among them were even Patriarch-level experts.</p><p></p><p>'Young Master Xie, please come up. I shall personally attend to you,' a melodious, gentle voice drifted down from above.</p><p></p><p>The weaker martial artists were momentarily dazed, as if a vision of a peerless beauty awaited them.</p><p></p><p>'Hiss!' </p><p></p><p>Regaining their senses, the martial artists were struck with awe. Could this be the rumored Patriarch-level courtesan of the Peerless Pavilion? Just her voice alone had almost ensnared them in an illusion. </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch-level martial artists present were filled with trepidation. What kind of seductive arts did this courtesan cultivate? Her bewitching power was truly terrifying! Xu Yan's eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>'What kind of seductive technique is this? A single voice possesses the power of the Thousand Illusion Demon Song, and it awakens the most primal desires within one's heart.' </p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan soared up to the high pavilion, being cautious. </p><p></p><p>The woman who spoke was extraordinary - he must be careful not to fall into a trap.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor of the Peerless Pavilion was a courtyard-like area, with flowers, grass, and a small bridge over a flowing stream. Xu Yan landed in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The fragrant scent was invigorating, making one's spirits soar.</p><p></p><p>'This floral aroma has the ability to arouse one's emotions,' Xu Yan observed, keeping his mind collected.</p><p></p><p>'I've heard of Young Master Xie's prodigious reputation, and now that I see you in person, my frozen heart has been stirred,' a woman wearing a veil said softly, sitting by the water pool and lightly kicking the water with her jade-like feet. Her bright eyes looked at Xu Yan tenderly.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in pure white, with flowing hair like a waterfall, her every movement was enchantingly seductive. A faint aura surrounded her, captivating all who laid eyes on her.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heartbeat quickened slightly, but he took a deep breath and steadily gazed at the woman, inhaling the fragrant floral scent. His blood seemed to flow faster.</p><p></p><p>'Young Master Xie, why don't you come sit with me?' the woman said, patting the stone beside her.</p><p></p><p>'Alright,' Xu Yan nodded, stepping forward to sit next to her.</p><p></p><p>Up close, the woman's faint, alluring fragrance constantly invaded his senses and psyche, exuding an indescribable charm that continually enticed his soul.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

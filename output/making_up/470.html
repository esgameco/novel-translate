        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Silence! The crowd of powerful cultivators who were clamoring that even if they couldn't assist Xu Yan, they could at least cheer him on and boost his morale, suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>What did Xu Yan just say? He's going to subdue the dragon?! Gulp!</p><p></p><p>The master of Cloud Sky Island swallowed hard and said with an awkward smile: "With Young Friend Xu's world-shaking might, he naturally doesn't need us weaklings to cheer him on. We won't go bother Young Friend Xu and cause him trouble!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon calamity, the great tribulation of the divine realm - countless immortal heavenly lords had perished. </p><p></p><p>None who encountered a true dragon could escape! The speed of true dragons far surpassed what these immortal heavenly lords were capable of.</p><p></p><p>Now, while the Taihe Realm was still gathering powerful experts and had yet to come up with a strategy, Xu Yan was already preparing to go subdue the dragon? That was a legendary true dragon!</p><p></p><p>"I already said, you can't help," Xu Yan said with a smile and a nod.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we were too presumptuous!" The master of Cloud Sky Island and the others nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was going to subdue the dragon, and they wanted to go cheer him on? They must be tired of living!</p><p></p><p>It would be fine if Xu Yan could instantly suppress the true dragon, otherwise if the dragon became enraged, they would certainly die!</p><p></p><p>"Well then, this Xu shall take his leave," Xu Yan said with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully see Young Friend Xu off!" The master of Cloud Sky Island and the others hurriedly returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step and instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The divine realm was in turmoil, and his disciple's might shook the realm, but for Li Xuan these were all ordinary matters that he didn't pay much attention to anymore.</p><p></p><p>He devoted himself wholeheartedly to his great endeavor of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He had made considerable gains in creating subsequent martial arts and organizing the system of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He had determined what realm should be above the Establishing the Way Realm, and how cultivation should proceed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Xu Yan would occasionally bring feedback, but it was mostly martial arts experience.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was also flourishing, with Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu's strength rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>The three from Great Yue Empire were even preparing to break through the shackles of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat's strength had also greatly increased, and she was preparing to establish a demon race in the divine realm, ending the chaos of the Nine Mountains Realm and designating it as the demon realm of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Shi Er, Meng Shushu and Zhou Ying had all improved significantly. With the assistance of pills in their cultivation, they were a step closer to the Divine Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Power Realm was not far off for them.</p><p></p><p>The strength of grandfather and granddaughter Moon Changming and Moon'er had naturally also greatly increased. Although there was still some distance to the Immortal Realm, it was not too far off.</p><p></p><p>This was the benefit of having sufficient pills to assist cultivation in the Qinghua Realm, and even specially refined, exclusive pills.</p><p></p><p>"That Wu Tiannan fellow truly has extraordinary luck," Li Xuan sighed as he looked up in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had already broken through to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Cai Ling'er, who was brewing tea for him and bringing over spirit cakes. Since activating her bloodline and obtaining the legacy of the Sea Spirit Clan, Cai Ling'er's strength had been increasing by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was also not far from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"How is your Divine Power cultivation going? Is there anything you don't understand?" Li Xuan asked with a smile as he savored the spirit tea.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was overjoyed and explained all her questions about cultivation one by one.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gave her some guidance, and Cai Ling'er gained some insights before going off to secluded cultivation to ponder them.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>On this day, golden light surged from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan created the Ten Directions Annihilation Sword, slaying the besieging Immortal Heavenly Lords. You obtain the Soundless Extinction Dao Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Finally, feedback had come in the form of a sword.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sword in his spiritual consciousness, Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The Soundless Extinction Dao Sword was soundless and formless, possessing the might of the extinction dao, able to slay a martial artist's dao! This was a sword that could slay the dao.</p><p></p><p>"Slaying the dao!" Li Xuan exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that those slain by this sword were all extremely powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Far beyond comparison to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Lords of Heaven and Earth, huh." Li Xuan smiled. For this sword to slay Lords of Heaven and Earth, slay their dao, extinguish their dao - it was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this also required sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again!"</p><p></p><p>With this sword, Li Xuan was confident that if Mei Wu came to seek revenge now, he could slay her with a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>It was that domineering and powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. Worthy of being my martial arts pioneer," Li Xuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His senior disciple never disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to devote most of his attention to his great endeavor of martial arts, no longer paying much attention to external affairs.</p><p></p><p>No matter how turbulent the divine realm became, it could not affect him.</p><p></p><p>If necessary, correcting the disordered heaven and earth was not much of a challenge for him.</p><p></p><p>Having comprehended the essence of the Taicang Heaven and Earth, and comprehended its dao principles, in a sense he was already the lord of Taicang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that he did not cultivate Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by. For Li Xuan, who was immersed in his great endeavor of martial arts, the passage of this bit of time was barely noticeable.</p><p></p><p>It felt like just taking a nap.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Golden Book of the Great Dao opened and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan comprehended the method of Establishing the Way Realm martial arts. You break through to the Establishing the Way Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was instantly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Establishing the Way Realm had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Entering the Establishing the Way Realm was a huge leap. From here on, the gap between each realm would become greater and greater.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Realm far surpassed the Breaking Void Realm. Even a small breakthrough within the Heaven and Earth Realm resulted in a huge increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through from the Heaven and Earth Realm to the Establishing the Way Realm brought an increase in strength akin to crossing an insurmountable gap. The difference in strength between the two was unimaginably vast.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was immersed in the breakthrough and profundities of the Establishing the Way Realm.</p><p></p><p>Dao principles emerged from heaven and earth, heaven and earth operated according to their own laws, establishing the dao of heaven and earth, and also establishing one's own dao.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Establishing the Way Realm!" Li Xuan marveled. This martial arts system he had created was profound and powerful, far surpassing Taicang martial arts. The higher the realm, the less comparable it was to Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of dao principles, and also the power of rules, and even nearly the power of the Great Dao!" Vague and indistinct, the Great Dao seemed not far off, but what was the Great Dao? "These all need to be slowly comprehended, cultivating step by step, ascending to the Great Dao, progressing without end..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan's confidence truly increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>"One who transcends heaven and earth - now, I have truly transcended heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>In the Establishing the Way Realm, establishing one's own dao and establishing the dao of heaven and earth, Li Xuan had now truly become one who transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Those who establish the dao transcend heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The Taicang Heaven and Earth could no longer constrain him.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful beings like Mei Wu can be destroyed with a wave of the hand." Li Xuan's smile became radiant.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, he truly possessed the initial might of a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>And not just the empty title of Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>On his spirit platform, his primordial spirit had already undergone transformation. Even his Extreme Soul Body had transformed due to his establishing the dao.</p><p></p><p>Even his pill and medical martial arts had naturally improved.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation of pill and medical martial arts was not much different from pure martial arts cultivation, following the same path.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now that he had established his own Dao, his cultivation direction was set. Naturally, his skills in alchemy, medicine and martial arts also improved accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's primordial spirit held the golden book of the Great Dao. At this moment, as he established his Dao, the usage of the golden book also underwent some changes.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have established my Dao, everything is my Dao. So let's establish them all together."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's primordial spirit shone brilliantly as he opened the golden book in his hands, releasing a flood of golden light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his Qimen martial arts reached the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>His Extreme Soul martial arts also reached the Dao Establishment realm. </p><p></p><p>However, his physical body martial arts did not advance further. To improve his physical body martial arts, he still needed to wait for Meng Chong to comprehend the Haotian Infinite Body.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad at all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>The improvement in strength felt so good.</p><p></p><p>"Now, only Meng Chong's Haotian Infinite Indestructible Body is left. But I think Meng Chong should be close to understanding it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Out of the five martial arts, four had already reached the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>As his strength continued to increase, his Demon Ancestor True Body was also constantly improving. When he established the Dao of the demon race, his Demon Ancestor True Body would also reach the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this wouldn't be too difficult. He just needed to give some more guidance to Chi Mao.</p><p></p><p>"The world can now be in my hands!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky. Everything was completely exposed, and he could see everything clearly, including some powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he no longer cared.</p><p></p><p>There was no threat within the Taicang world!</p><p></p><p>"Establishing the Dao is not the end. It's just establishing the Dao, establishing one's own Dao of heaven and earth, establishing one's own Dao, that's all. This is just the beginning stage for the strong.</p><p></p><p>"We need to look further. Being invincible within this world doesn't mean truly invincible. We don't know what's beyond this world yet.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we need to understand what happened to the Taicang world in the past, and what secrets it holds."</p><p></p><p>After his initial excitement, Li Xuan returned to his calm state.</p><p></p><p>He played with the jade ruyi in his hand, sitting in his chair, as relaxed as ever.</p><p></p><p>"This jade ruyi has been with me since before I became a martial artist, all the way to the Dao Establishment realm. It has absorbed the essence of my martial arts and has now become a treasure."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the jade ruyi in his hand, surprised.</p><p></p><p>This was a gift from Xu Yan when he became his disciple. Originally it was a pair of jade ruyis, but he only played with this one regularly.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had broken through to the Dao Establishment realm, this jade ruyi that he had played with for years had become a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, as my strength continues to increase, this jade ruyi will become an unfathomably miraculous treasure. Even this chair will become a treasure."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh. The personal items of a powerful being, no matter how ordinary they were before, would become treasures.</p><p></p><p>"When I truly become invincible and lonely, seeing this ruyi will be like seeing me. This is the Dao Ancestor's ruyi!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a great mood at this moment.</p><p></p><p>So with a wave of his hand, the essence of the Dao of heaven and earth gathered, directly enveloping Shi Er, Meng Shushu, and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>His voice, like the sound of the great Dao, directly entered the primordial spirits of the three, guiding their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of the Dao essence, the strength of the three began to increase rapidly. Some martial principles they didn't understand before were suddenly comprehended.</p><p></p><p>They had already stepped one foot into the Mystical Power realm.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Mystical Power realm would only take about half a month.</p><p></p><p>In his good mood, Li Xuan waved the jade ruyi in his hand. The Dao Ancestor would give another lecture, letting the martial artists of the Qinghua Sect listen to the voice of the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The news that the Dao Ancestor was going to give a lecture spread instantly throughout the Qinghua Sect. Strong cultivators who were away rushed back, and talented youths from various places flooded in.</p><p></p><p>"Is Master going to give another lecture?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were both surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Master must have something to be happy about."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>On the day of the lecture.</p><p></p><p>The strong cultivators of the Qinghua Sect, the talented youths, and all the martial artists at the Qinghua Sect headquarters respectfully sat cross-legged on the ground, waiting for the Dao Ancestor to give his lecture.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in his chair, with a mysterious aura, the Great Wilderness Divine Appearance, and the Dao Ancestor's halo all appearing, making him seem unfathomably mysterious. His true form could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>All the Qinghua Sect martial artists prostrated themselves in respect.</p><p></p><p>That figure was so mysterious that it could not be looked at directly. Just a glance seemed to reveal infinite principles of heaven and earth, infinite martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were also completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Is this Master's true appearance? Or is it not even one billionth of it?</p><p></p><p>This lecture was completely different from the previous one. This time it was a true Dao lecture, because Li Xuan had reached the Dao Establishment realm, and he was lecturing on the Dao of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>It was both the Dao of cultivation and the Dao of self. Everyone heard something different, but they could all verify their own cultivation. How much they could comprehend and gain from it depended on their own talent and insight.</p><p></p><p>Those who cultivated the sword Dao gained insights into the sword Dao, as if a door to the sword Dao had been opened for them.</p><p></p><p>Alchemists suddenly understood alchemy methods they couldn't comprehend before.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for those who practiced equipment forging and formations.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial artists who cultivated the Taicang martial arts, they all seemed to understand their bottlenecks at this moment, as if they had broken through some shackles. Their martial arts seemed to have just improved, without any changes, yet they also seemed to have become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan gave his lecture, the strength of the Qinghua Sect would naturally increase greatly once again.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were also immersed in it, seeming to have understood a lot about their own martial arts, as if they had seen the foundation of establishing their Dao.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura suddenly appeared, but it didn't affect anyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Cai Linger beside him. This girl had broken through to the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Following that, three powerful auras emerged one after another in the Qinghua Sect, breaking through the shackles of the Immortal realm and stepping into a new realm, as if merging with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Unity realm! Li Xuan smiled. Although the Three Yue Emperors seemed to have broken through to the Heaven Unity realm, this Heaven Unity realm was somewhat different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>Those who had cultivated mystical powers in the Heaven Unity realm were even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qinghua Sect, those talented youths all gained something, and some even broke through to new realms.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable naturally also gained a lot. Those who hadn't been able to cultivate mystical powers finally did so this time.</p><p></p><p>Even some True King Venerables broke through to the Immortal realm this time without the aid of pills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also those with poor talent who listened in a daze, not understanding, yet feeling it was very profound. They could only look on with bewildered and slightly dull eyes.</p><p></p><p>Different talents and insights naturally led to different gains.</p><p></p><p>Some people suddenly understood the path of martial arts because of this, making great strides forward and rising to become supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also those who gained little, still struggling to move forward, and eventually turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>When the lecture ended, everyone was still immersed in it, unable to come back to their senses.</p><p></p><p>In their souls, there was still a profound sound echoing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Great Wilderness with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Tianzi, this Dao Ancestor is coming to have a chat with you, to talk about the secrets of this world."</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

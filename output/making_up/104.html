            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 104: Suli Xiushen Refines the Elixir</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen was deeply moved. She now had such a powerful master to rely on, and felt a deep sense of security, no longer needing to worry about being captured one day.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will definitely work hard to cultivate and absolutely not disappoint your high expectations!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Little sister, come, tell your big brother, who's been troubling you, and when I go to the Inner Realm, I'll kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, when you go to the Inner Realm, big brother will help you out!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, big brother, but I'll deal with this matter myself after I've cultivated successfully. I want to bury them all!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen said at the end, shaking her fists angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Good, if you need your big brother's help, just say so, can't let people bully you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, thank you, big brother!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen felt warmth in her heart. </p><p></p><p>Since the escape, apart from Aunt Zhou, no one else had cared about her. </p><p></p><p>Now she felt the warmth of a family.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's eyes were red, the young miss was finally safe, and had a master and big brothers who cared for her. One day, she could return to the Inner Realm and kill those people!</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Ying kneels before the senior to thank him, my young miss has caused trouble for the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying knelt before Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly said: "Lingxiu is my disciple, you don't need to be so formal."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen had a monstrous talent, having comprehended the Elixir Cultivation Classic so quickly, and her cultivation speed was extremely fast. Not to mention the Borderlands, even in the Inner Realm, it would be difficult to find a disciple so suited for cultivating the Dao of Elixir Refinement.</p><p></p><p>As long as she could contribute to his grand martial dao, Li Xuan didn't care about any troubles in the background. After all, finding a suitable disciple was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Whoever caused trouble for his disciple, was causing trouble for him. Whoever obstructed his grand martial dao, was his enemy.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with enemies, Li Xuan would never be soft.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had taught his disciples, crush their bones, scatter their ashes, and annihilate their souls!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying still kowtowed three times before standing up.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen held the elixir furnace and said, "Master, I'm going to refine the elixir!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Go, comprehend and grasp it yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were also curious, how exactly does one refine an elixir?</p><p></p><p>"Little sister, do you need any help?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>"For now... I don't think so."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen was also uncertain.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had never refined an elixir before, she had only repeatedly pondered it in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The actual operation was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er also came over.</p><p></p><p>He cleaned the elixir furnace thoroughly and placed it on the prepared elixir furnace stove. Suli Xiushen pondered, what elixir should she refine?</p><p></p><p>Refine a Skin Elixir?</p><p></p><p>She didn't need it. The Tempering Bone Elixir was needed, but for the first time refining an elixir, she was too unfamiliar, and might not be able to succeed.</p><p></p><p>And the medicinal materials for refining elixirs were all precious herbs, it would be a waste to use them.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Shi Er beside her, Suli Xiushen had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er seemed to be at the stage of completing the Purification of the Dantian, unable to break through the Qi and Blood Realm. Then she could refine a Qi and Blood Elixir, which was an elixir that could help break through the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It could also strengthen the Qi and Blood, assist cultivation, and replenish depleted Qi and Blood.</p><p></p><p>"For the first refinement, I should be cautious and not waste the medicinal materials, about a third of a furnace of elixir."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen thought this way, and prepared the medicinal materials needed for the Qi and Blood Elixir.</p><p></p><p>She lit the Spirit Fire Stone and threw it into the elixir furnace, drying the furnace. Then Suli Xiushen looked at the medicinal materials in her hand, feeling a bit confused, hesitating to add the ingredients.</p><p></p><p>"In refining elixirs, do I need to add water?"</p><p></p><p>She looked back at her master, wanting to ask for advice, but was afraid that the master would think her comprehension was poor and leave a stupid impression.</p><p></p><p>"In elixir refinement, it is to extract the essence and remove the impurities. Adding water may increase the impurities.</p><p></p><p>"But if I don't add water, without having entered the Dao of Martial Arts, how can I use Qi and Blood? Won't the medicinal materials just be dried out?"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen pondered, feeling that the elixir refinement method she had simulated earlier seemed to have some problems.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had been staring at the elixir furnace, looking at their shidi. The furnace was already heated, but their shidi still hadn't added the medicinal materials. Was elixir refinement this complicated?</p><p></p><p>The two of them knew nothing about elixir refinement, and could only wait for their shidi's next move.</p><p></p><p>"Since it is to extract the essence of the medicine and remove the impurities, naturally the medicinal materials need to be melted. And this elixir furnace is not an iron furnace, but a precious artifact with certain properties.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I specially made this elixir furnace for elixir refinement."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen suddenly realized, this was elixir refinement, not just boiling medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>How could she have overlooked that the elixir furnace was a precious artifact, not an iron furnace?</p><p></p><p>Regaining her senses, she saw that the elixir furnace was already heated, with a scorching hot airflow circulating around it, estimating it was about ready.</p><p></p><p>"The first step of the Qi and Blood Elixir is to put in a piece of Nine-Leaf Yuan Zhi, and refine it..."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen followed the elixir refinement method she had comprehended, throwing a piece of Nine-Leaf Yuan Zhi into the elixir furnace, closing the furnace lid, and raising her delicate white hand, about to go and strike the elixir furnace to refine the medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, when you use your Qi and Blood to strike the elixir furnace, you need to be slow and gentle, not forceful..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong crouching beside her, she spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother was at the Xiantian Realm, his Xiantian True Qi too strong, she couldn't control it well, so she turned to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited, raising his hand with a jade-like golden light covering it, his Qi and Blood circulating, lightly striking the elixir furnace.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound, the elixir furnace trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen sensed the trembling of the elixir furnace, carefully comprehending the changes in the furnace. "Second brother, the Qi and Blood has increased a little.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong struck another palm.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen slightly squinted her eyes, extending her delicate white hand to gently stroke the elixir furnace, feeling its trembling, as if she could sense the changes in the medicinal ingredients inside.</p><p></p><p>"Lighter on the Qi and Blood."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen continued.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong struck the elixir furnace again.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suli Xiushen occasionally touched the elixir furnace, adjusting the force according to her inner feelings, making the strikes on the furnace have a certain rhythm.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After nine strikes, Suli Xiushen sensed that the Nine-Leaf Yuan Zhi in the furnace seemed to have melted.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, when I open the lid later, seal the furnace mouth, don't let the medicinal power inside evaporate."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen opened the elixir furnace lid, and a true Qi sealed the furnace mouth, while Suli Xiushen threw the second medicinal ingredient into the furnace, a blood-red medicine made from tiger blood.</p><p></p><p>"It's too troublesome to open the lid every time, I'll just put the remaining medicines in together. For the first elixir refinement, it can be considered summarizing experience."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiushen thought this way, and put all the remaining medicinal materials in the elixir formula into the furnace, then closed the lid.</p><p></p><p>She added three more Spirit Fire Stones to the elixir furnace, intensifying the flames.</p><p></p><p>This time, Suli Xiushen did not let Meng Chong strike the elixir furnace, but gently closed her eyes, carefully comprehending the elixir furnace. Her delicate white hands occasionally lightly struck and shook the elixir furnace.</p><p></p><p>The force kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Although the elixir furnace was a precious artifact, the surface was scorched hot by the flames, but Suli Xiushen kept striking it, her delicate white hands...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her face also turned slightly red.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she had already completed the tanning, and could still bear it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying looked at her with a pitiful expression, but she also knew that this was something the young miss had to go through.</p><p></p><p>Only by learning the art of pill refining could she truly become a disciple of the senior.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, let me do it instead?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu shook her head and said, "Pill refining cannot be done by someone else. If the senior brother is not by my side, how can I refine the pill? This little heat won't hurt me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, Suli Xiu's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, except for Li Xuanzi, the rest had gathered to watch Suli Xiu refine the pill.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanzi's heart was also itching, he also wanted to join the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But he was the master, if he went to join the crowd, where would the aura of a strict and powerful teacher be?</p><p></p><p>"How's the pill refining going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanzi sensed the movement of Suli Xiu's pill refining, his heart was like a cat scratching.</p><p></p><p>"This third disciple girl, she should be able to refine the medicinal pill, right? If this batch doesn't succeed, refine a few more batches, summarize the experience, and it should be about the same."</p><p></p><p>The beginning of everything is difficult.</p><p></p><p>Once the refinement is successful, and the art of pill refining is mastered, it would be like opening a door, the door to pill refining would truly open.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Pill Dao martial path, the art of pill refining, would also emerge.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu gently tapped the pill furnace, and suddenly said, "Reduce the fire a bit!"</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out two pieces of the divine flame stone burning in the furnace and extinguished them in the mud.</p><p></p><p>The flame in the furnace immediately became smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Reduce the fire even more!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu spoke again.</p><p></p><p>He took out another piece of divine flame stone.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of using divine flame stone as the fuel for pill refining. If you want the fire to be stronger, just add more divine flame stone; if you want the fire to be smaller, just take out the divine flame stone.</p><p></p><p>"Extinguish the fire!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu's jade face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>The pill refining had reached the final stage!</p><p></p><p>The fire in the furnace was extinguished, and everyone held their breath, watching the pill furnace.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu kept tapping the pill furnace, and at this moment, the vibration of the pill furnace was becoming stronger and stronger. In the shaking, a faint rolling sound could be heard from the pill furnace.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pill!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the refinement was successful?</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu's forehead was beaded with sweat, and at this moment, the pill refining had reached the final stage.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the pill!</p><p></p><p>Because she was not yet a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator, she could not refine the pill with Qi and blood, so the condensation of the pill depended entirely on her perception of the vibration of the pill furnace and her own senses.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the pores of the pill furnace opened with a tap from Suli Xiu, and a burst of hot air gushed out.</p><p></p><p>Expelling the impurities of the medicinal pill!</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu was excited, this pill furnace she had created was perfect.</p><p></p><p>She quickly tapped the pill furnace a few more times.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The pill furnace returned to the furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Pill refining complete!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu patted her slightly red little hands and said.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, quick, open it and take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rubbed his hands, full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>If the pill refining was successful, it meant that the cultivation of the cultivators would have an auxiliary, and their cultivation would be easier.</p><p></p><p>His parents and relatives, with the help of the medicinal pills, would also be able to rapidly increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu tapped the lid of the pill furnace, and with a bang, the lid jumped up. She tapped the pill furnace, and the mouth tilted downward, and three medicinal pills fell out.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong reached out and caught them.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on Meng Chong's hand.</p><p></p><p>The three pills were a bit blackish, and not round and smooth, but rather lumpy like three small bumps, lying quietly in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"It failed!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, this is your first time refining a pill, being able to form it is already very good. Refine a few more times, summarize the techniques and experience, I'm sure you'll succeed soon."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan comforted.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, failure on the first try is normal."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu picked up one of the medicinal pills. Although the refinement failed, it was not a complete failure. This medicinal pill still had some efficacy.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal materials used in pill refining were not cheap, they couldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>So she placed the three medicinal "bumps" in Shi Er's hand and said, "Shi Er, you've encountered a bottleneck in your cultivation, these three medicinal pills are for you to take, to help you break through the bottleneck!"</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why they needed to refine the Qi-Blood Pill. If the refinement failed, as long as it was not completely ruined, they could still give it to Shi Er to eat, so it wouldn't be a complete waste.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was dumbfounded, looking at the medicinal pills in his hand, black and lumpy, like small bumps. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva, could these be eaten?</p><p></p><p>"This medicinal pill failed, can it still be eaten?"</p><p></p><p>"Even failed medicinal pills are still medicinal pills, they won't be poisonous, they just have weaker potency. Don't waste it, quickly eat it, let me see how the medicinal pill works."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu urged.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had a gloomy expression on his face, was this thing really not poisonous?</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, this is a medicinal pill, even if it failed, it won't be poisonous. It's much better than those medicine pills. Sister's words, don't you believe them?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grabbed Shi Er's hand and stuffed the medicinal pills into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er wanted to cry but had no tears. It's easy for you to say when it's not you eating the medicine, right?</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Zhou Ying also didn't blink an eye.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, any feelings?"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu asked.</p><p></p><p>"It feels a bit warm."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er only felt that after the medicinal pill entered his stomach, a warm sensation arose.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, cultivate, maybe you can break through the bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu urged.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's spirit was lifted, and he said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As he cultivated, he felt as if a surge of Qi and blood was rising, his whole body was hot. The bottleneck that he had been unable to break through seemed to have loosened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed, although the medicinal pill was a failure, it still had some effect. Could it be that he was about to break through to the Qi-Blood Realm?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanzi had been paying attention the whole time, and his heart moved, "Shi Er is about to break through, although this medicinal pill didn't succeed, it still has some effects, helping Shi Er break through the bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a rumbling sound of tendons and bones started to emanate from Shi Er, and strands of Qi and blood began to emerge from his body.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling of tendons and bones became louder and the Qi and blood became more and more abundant.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu and the others retreated a distance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was shocked, so this was the Qi-Blood Realm?</p><p></p><p>Very powerful!</p><p></p><p>As soon as Shi Er entered the door, his strength was far beyond hers.</p><p></p><p>Was that Qi and Blood like a Qi Gong?</p><p></p><p>"A Third-Grade Cultivator, no, a bit stronger than an average Third-Grade Cultivator."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou Ying's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to switch to the cultivation of the martial path. In the Frontier, she could not continue to cultivate and break through.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was obvious that the martial path passed down by the senior was stronger than that of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that she had already reached the Fourth-Grade of the martial path, and her foundation was almost fixed. To switch, the difficulty would not be small.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's tendons and bones rumbled, his Qi and blood like a Qi Gong, a surge of Qi and blood enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was excited, he had finally entered the martial path!</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pill, truly miraculous, even the failed medicinal pill could have such a powerful effect!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

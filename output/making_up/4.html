        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 4: Xu Yan's Self-Imagination</p><p></p><p>It was still dark when Xu Yan had already taken a horse stance and started cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"Master said, focus on the essence, not the form, sense the qi and blood, mobilize the qi and blood, refine the skin membrane..."</p><p></p><p>"The geniuses of the past could complete skin refinement in five days, but I still haven't been able to sense the qi and blood, the gap is too large. Master said I can't be impatient, the more impatient I am, the harder it is to sense the qi and blood..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmed his mind and focused his spirit on his own body, carefully trying to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The horizon started to turn white.</p><p></p><p>The morning sun was about to rise, and Xu Yan, who was immersed in sensing the qi and blood, suddenly felt a warm current emerge in his chest and abdomen, flowing gently and warmly, seemingly following his breathing.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood!"</p><p></p><p>"I've sensed the qi and blood!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, calm down, I must be calm and collected, can't lose my composure..."</p><p></p><p>"Mobilize the qi and blood to refine the skin membrane... How do I mobilize the qi and blood? Master didn't give specific instructions, should I go ask Master?"</p><p></p><p>"No! Master said it's about comprehension and intention, I must grasp the feeling of this moment. If I slack off, it will be difficult to sense the qi and blood again..."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if I have to ask Master in detail about how to mobilize the qi and blood, won't that disappoint Master and make him think I lack insight?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan dismissed the idea of asking Li Xuan for guidance.</p><p></p><p>He continued to stand in the horse stance, trying again and again to mobilize the qi and blood, recalling Li Xuan's explanations on how to do it.</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely focused inward, immersed in mobilizing the qi and blood. His breathing unconsciously changed along with the mobilization of the qi and blood, and gradually a wisp of qi and blood permeated his entire body, his skin flushing slightly, as if a warm current was refining the skin membrane.</p><p></p><p>"I should have entered the skin refinement stage, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, finally sensing the qi and blood and successfully mobilizing it to refine the skin membrane.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan yawned, got up, washed up, and went out to prepare breakfast. </p><p></p><p>He was the only one left in the village, self-sufficient, which had become a habit.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he went out, he saw Xu Yan standing in the horse stance, cultivating. The corner of his mouth twitched. This disciple was indeed diligent, but unfortunately, no matter how diligent, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method he taught was something he made up, there was no way Xu Yan could actually succeed in it.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just wait until he can't persist anymore, then come ask me, and I'll make up some more nonsense to fool him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw his master and his heart raced, wanting to tell him that he had sensed the qi and blood and entered the skin refinement stage!</p><p></p><p>But seeing his master shake his head, Xu Yan's heart suddenly sank.</p><p></p><p>"Is Master dissatisfied with me?"</p><p></p><p>"Right, with Master's realm, how could he not see that I have already sensed the qi and blood and entered the skin refinement stage?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be that Master thinks I'm impatient and conceited, unable to remain calm..."</p><p></p><p>After this self-imagination, Xu Yan immediately gave up the idea of telling Li Xuan that he had sensed the qi and blood and entered the skin refinement stage.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, calmed his mind, and continued to mobilize the qi and blood to refine the skin membrane.</p><p></p><p>"Master is unfathomable, he can see my true state with a single glance. I must not be arrogant or complacent. How my cultivation progresses, Master can see it at a glance, there's no need for me to tell him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized that his master could see the state of his cultivation at a glance, no need for him to explicitly tell him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in the chicken coop, grabbing a chicken, preparing to continue stewing the nine-leaf primordial essence, a rare and precious medicinal herb. After eating the nine-leaf primordial essence stewed chicken soup yesterday, he felt his body had become stronger.</p><p></p><p>He took out a knife, ready to kill the chicken.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he paused: "Wait, I have a disciple, there's no reason for me to do this alone."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't the disciple serve the master, not the other way around?" </p><p></p><p>"Well, I've already tricked him once. He's my disciple now, so it's reasonable for him to serve me, his master."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he picked up a chicken with one hand and a knife with the other, and walked towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, come, slaughter the chicken, add some nine-leaf yuan zhi and stew it. Go cook."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished his cultivation, took the chicken and knife from Li Xuan's hand, looking a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"What, can't you cook?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned as he saw Xu Yan spacing out.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, Xu Yan is a fool from a wealthy family, how could he possibly know how to cook?"</p><p></p><p>However, since he had taken him as a disciple, he might as well make use of him.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, every action and every seat, even sleeping and eating, are part of cultivation. Although you have not yet entered the door, and are still far from my level, it will be beneficial for you to get familiar with these things in advance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I'll go right away!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Master's realm is so high, the seemingly mundane matters are actually the ways of the superior, the hidden cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more he felt his master was unfathomable. Seemingly ordinary, not displaying any powerful aura, but this was the true hidden cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went to cook.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not at ease, watched him for a while, and found that although Xu Yan was a bit clumsy in slaughtering the chicken and cooking, under his guidance, the food should still be edible.</p><p></p><p>So he moved a chair and placed it under the big tree in front of the house, then Li Xuan lay down on the chair, leisurely waiting for the meal.</p><p></p><p>"Having a disciple to serve me, this kind of leisurely life is really nice."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's mind is not sharp enough to see through this in the short term, but I should still prepare a backup plan..."</p><p></p><p>After the meal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"This... the speed of tempering the skin membrane has increased, the qi and blood have increased by at least 50%..."</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, although I can't complete the skin refinement in five days, completing it within a month should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the greatly increased speed of skin refinement, extremely excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Why has the speed of skin refinement suddenly increased so much? Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>He thought of the nine-leaf yuan zhi stewed chicken soup!</p><p></p><p>The nine-leaf yuan zhi was a rare and precious medicinal herb, his Xu family only had this one treasure. If he was not the only heir of the Xu family, deeply loved by his parents, he would not have been able to obtain the nine-leaf yuan zhi for the master's acceptance ceremony.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Master knows about the nine-leaf yuan zhi, and that it can help my cultivation, so he took it out and had me stew the chicken with it!"</p><p></p><p>"I must not let down Master's painstaking efforts, I must cultivate diligently and strive to enter the door as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>The self-imagined Xu Yan, at this moment, his reverence for the master was as bright as the sun and moon, deeply moved to the core.</p><p></p><p>He mobilized his qi and blood, constantly tempering his skin membrane.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous tempering, Xu Yan felt his body becoming stronger, his qi and blood becoming more vigorous, and his skin membrane becoming tougher, it seemed that he had already entered the skin refinement stage.</p><p></p><p>"I feel my strength has more than doubled, and this is just the beginning of skin refinement, how strong will I be when I complete the skin refinement?"</p><p></p><p>"I must enter the martial dao within a year!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was determined.</p><p></p><p>"The effect of this nine-leaf yuan zhi is too good, I feel like my strength has increased?"</p><p></p><p>"Should I keep it to myself? No, it was Xu Yan's gift, I should share it after cooking it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt the changes in his own body, and for a moment had the idea of keeping the nine-leaf yuan zhi to himself.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he was not that heartless, and gave up the idea of hoarding it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even so, it was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, what if there is more than one peak grand master on the island?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu reminded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanqi looked at him strangely and said, "I've already killed two great grand masters, and the news has spread. Since they want to attack me, of course they will all be peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it normal to have more than one peak grand master?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Xu Yanqi had already determined that there was more than one peak grand master waiting for him on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was willing to spend a hundred thousand spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back first, deliver the spirit herbs to the junior sister, and then go to Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanqi showed a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>The three of them rushed towards Blue Peace Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Iron Mountain County, Long Qing Hall had gradually gained a reputation under the planning of Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi, but the reputation of their medicinal pills had not yet been promoted.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they started selling auxiliary cultivation pills under the pretext of assisting cultivation, but Iron Mountain County was barren, and there were few who could afford to buy spirit crystal pills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, more martial artists were accustomed to purchasing cultivation resources from the Heavenly Treasure Hall.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was not in a hurry, and began to stockpile foundation-building pills such as the Small Spirit Blood Pill and the Tempering Bone Pill, which were refined with precious herbs.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sent people to secretly spread the Great Wilderness doctrine and teach the basics of the martial dao in the mountain villages on the Iron Mountain County side of the endless mountains.</p><p></p><p>In Iron Mountain County, cultivating the martial dao was a luxury, and many people who harbored the heart of the martial dao perished without resources or techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe began to spread the martial dao to these people, even bestowing them with cultivation pills, instilling in them the ideas of the Great Wilderness, such as the Great Wilderness being one, and the inner domain also being a part of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Turning their perspective from the inner domain to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>With the promotion, many young people in the mountain villages of Iron Mountain County began to cultivate the martial dao of the Great Wilderness, each revering the supreme Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe even had someone compile a Great Wilderness chronicle to spread, with tales of the origin of heaven and earth, the orthodox lineage of the Great Wilderness, and ancient legends.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flipped through the Great Wilderness chronicle, nodding frequently. This guy Xu Junhe really had some tricks up his sleeve, slowly infiltrating the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>This chronicle was like an ancient legend, and the core of the legend was this supreme, compassionate Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suspected that the reason Xu Junhe compiled the Great Wilderness chronicle was inspired by Xu Yanqi's obsession with story books and his search for high-level masters to learn from.</p><p></p><p>If someone believed the Great Wilderness chronicle and cultivated the Great Wilderness martial dao, becoming more enthusiastic and diligent, longing for the powerful martial artists described in the chronicle, that would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had also provided some guidance for this chronicle.</p><p></p><p>Things like the dark turmoil, the collapse of heaven and earth, the Martial Ancestor single-handedly stemming the tide, all were incorporated into the chronicle.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor of mine looks so revered, he must be the faith of martial artists. To uphold the name of my Martial Ancestor, the martial dao must be developed to be stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Great Wilderness chronicle, feeling motivated as well.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Junhe was persuading the manager of the Heavenly Treasure Hall, using the Heavenly Treasure Hall's channels to spread the Great Wilderness chronicle to every corner of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, under the guise of a story book, letting the Heavenly Treasure Hall sell it.</p><p></p><p>But who in the inner domain would read a story book?</p><p></p><p>The result was that this old fox Xu Junhe had edited a set of chronicles that secretly contained treasures and supreme martial arts. If one could decipher them, they would surely stand at the peak of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>And with a single Tempering Qi Pill, he had persuaded the Heavenly Treasure Hall manager.</p><p></p><p>Even reaching an agreement with the Heavenly Treasure Hall in Iron Mountain County, handing over the sales agency of the Tempering Qi Pill produced by Long Qing Hall to be sold throughout the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>This was an extraordinary pill that assisted cultivators at the master level.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, this Xu Junhe really had the ability.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Hall manager, after taking the Tempering Qi Pill and experiencing its amazing effects, came to the door the next day.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to purchase the pill formula, and Xu Junhe directly gave him half of the formula, saying that the research and development had cost a lot, and he hadn't even recouped the investment yet, so he wanted to rely on the Heavenly Treasure Hall's help to sell it throughout the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Completing a long-cherished wish, not in vain for establishing Long Qing Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Hall manager, seeing Xu Junhe so generous, directly gave him half the formula without much thought, and agreed to sell the Tempering Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>The profit was divided 7:3, with Long Qing Hall getting 7 and the Heavenly Treasure Hall 3.</p><p></p><p>After all, Long Qing Hall had it hard too, and by directly giving half the formula, the remaining half was what Long Qing Hall could earn back in the transaction.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Hall was very reputable and did not appear overbearing in cooperating with other business forces, which was also the reason for its excellent reputation in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>It had never had a bad reputation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could imagine that the Tempering Qi Pill would soon gain fame throughout the inner domain with the help of the Heavenly Treasure Hall's channels, and master-level martial artists would flock to it.</p><p></p><p>Long Qing Hall would certainly become renowned in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>And there would be a huge influx of spirit herbs and spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>As for the formula, what if he gave it to the Heavenly Treasure Hall? </p><p></p><p>Having the formula alone, without the know-how to refine the Tempering Qi Pill, how could they produce it?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Junhe's use of the formula to induce the Heavenly Treasure Hall to help promote Long Qing Hall was with the approval of Suli Xiu.</p><p></p><p>After all, the formula was a crucial matter, and Xu Junhe would not use it as a bargaining chip if he could not guarantee it would be a complete success.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Heavenly Treasure Hall as a channel to accumulate quickly, and when the Heavenly Treasure Hall reacts, Long Qing Hall will have the strength to negotiate. As for relying on strength to suppress Long Qing Hall..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, Xu Yanqi was about to break through to the Penetrating Realm, and no matter how strong the Heavenly Treasure Hall was, how could they compare?  Strength was the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yanqi has slain three peak grand masters with his three swords, and your Mountainriver Sword Dao has reached perfection."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>The golden finger had feedback.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan showed a smile, Xu Yanqi was as fierce as ever, starting to kill peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has consecutively slain three grand masters, your Dao of the Sword has improved, and the experience of the Extinguishing Divine Sword has increased."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had also killed grand masters.</p><p></p><p>This was all within Li Xuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the disciples' adventures in the martial dao world are the foundation for rapidly improving their strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Xu Yanqi and Meng Chong returned.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying them was the spirit herb scout Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Meng Shushu was immediately surprised when he saw Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>"You are... that girl?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying paused, frowning at Meng Shushu, feeling he looked familiar.</p><p></p><p>"You know her? She's from our family," Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said seriously, "She is the maid adopted by Medical King Su Zhen. Even though many years have passed, I can still recognize her at a glance, for I have seen her before when she was young."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was burly and sturdy, a true fierce woman.</p><p></p><p>Even when she was young, she must have been exceptionally robust, so anyone who had seen her before, even after many years and her growth, could still recognize her.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was actually only around thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>As a master martial artist, Meng Shushu, although he did not look that old, was already over fifty years old. At this age, master martial artists were once prodigies in their youth.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know my grandfather?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's expression changed as she walked over and asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>When Meng Shushu saw Su Lingxiu, he suddenly widened his eyes, with a look of disbelief, a mix of joy, relief, and complexity.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive?!"</p><p></p><p>This statement was problematic. Su Lingxiu's gaze narrowed as she coldly said, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grabbed Meng Shushu's shoulder and said, "She's our family member. What do you mean by that? Do you know my shijie (sworn sister)?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu let out a bitter laugh and said, "So she's your shijie."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying suddenly spoke up, "I remember now, are you the grandson of that old Mr. Meng?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me!" Meng Shushu's expression was very complex.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly recalled that Meng Shushu had once said his grandfather went to rescue an old friend, but ultimately perished. Could it be that he went to rescue Su Lingxiu's grandfather? Zhou Ying fell silent, obviously knowing something.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, who is he?" Su Lingxiu frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"He is from the Meng family, the heir of the Lingrao Herb Exploration Clan. Old Mr. Meng and your grandfather were very close. Most of the precious herbs you needed were found by Old Mr. Meng," Zhou Ying sighed.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu fell silent, then after a while, she spoke, "So he's my uncle. Lingxiu pays respects to Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu hurriedly waved his hands, "No, no, don't call me uncle, I don't deserve it!"</p><p></p><p>Although his grandfather and Su Lingxiu's grandfather were very close, in terms of generation, he and Su Lingxiu were actually of the same generation.</p><p></p><p>"We are actually of the same generation, even though I'm a bit older."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu smiled awkwardly, "Moreover, I'm of the same generation as Senior Brother Xu and Brother Meng."</p><p></p><p>"The family member is right," Meng Chong patted Meng Shushu's shoulder. He never expected that Meng Shushu would have such a deep connection with Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>In that case, they couldn't exploit him too much in the future. After all, he was one of their own.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, do you know something?" Su Lingxiu asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu hesitated, then sighed and said, "I don't know much. When my grandfather learned that your grandfather was in trouble, he went to rescue him, but..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry!" Su Lingxiu said guiltily.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with you," Meng Shushu shook his head and said, "In fact, I've been looking for you, but the results I got were that the entire Medical King family was wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Lingxiu, images of that graceful woman and that elegant figure flashed through Meng Shushu's mind. Some things were destined to be kept in the heart, never to be told to anyone.</p><p></p><p>Just like his parents, they actually encountered an accident and died while searching for the herbs needed to treat Su Lingxiu's mother.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Meng Shushu, this guy was hiding something, probably related to Su Lingxiu's origins. But since he chose to conceal it, it must be involved in a wide range of matters.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, do you know which force killed my grandfather?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. I've been searching for clues, but there's been no harvest," Meng Shushu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Black-Robed Ones, they are the enemy of my shijie," Meng Chong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu paused, as if he had figured something out, "I see, no wonder they were searching for the herb grounds."</p><p></p><p>After catching up, they took out the harvest this time, a fifth-grade spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie, look at this herb. For some reason, when I'm near the herb, I feel energized and spirited," Xu Yan took out the gray small grass.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heard this and his mind stirred. This was a spirit-nourishing herb? "This is... the fifth-grade Stone Secluded Grass."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was greatly surprised, "Stone Secluded Grass, it grows in dark crevices and is extremely rare. A fifth-grade Stone Secluded Grass is unheard of!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu then introduced, "Stone Secluded Grass has the miraculous effect of nourishing the spirit, making one's spirit as unyielding as a rock, able to resist external interference and illusions..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood, the effects of the Stone Secluded Grass didn't seem to be of much use to him. Distractions and illusions couldn't shake his heart, which had reached the realm of "no women in the heart."</p><p></p><p>"I want to research and see what kind of pill can be refined from the Stone Secluded Grass," Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"You can refine pills?" Meng Shushu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I can." Su Lingxiu looked at Meng Shushu, not forgetting the kindness of Old Mr. Meng. She then handed Meng Shushu a bottle of Essence-Gathering Pill and Strengthening Pill, "These are the Essence-Gathering Pill and Strengthening Pill, they can help you cultivate and improve your strength."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you. Don't worry, I'll help you find the herbs you need. You know I'm an herb explorer, finding rare herbs is my specialty," Meng Shushu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>With the herbs returned, Xu Yan and Meng Chong didn't linger, as the Fiery Exterminator Overlord was still rampaging on Caoluan Island, it was time to go deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were about to set out, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, here are the herbs!" Hu Shan handed a bag to Su Lingxiu, containing dozens of sixth-grade herbs.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was stunned, the foundation of Sword Sovereign Cliff was truly profound.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a lot of herbs."</p><p></p><p>The herbs here had already exceeded the amount needed to purchase the Heaven's Marrow Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Consider the extra as the prepayment for the pills." Hu Shan said, and he and Xie Lingfeng hurriedly found Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, there is danger on Caoluan Island, you must not go rashly," Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"How many peak Grandmaster experts are there?" Xu Yan asked with a raised brow.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was stunned for a moment, "Brother Xu, you know?"</p><p></p><p>Peak Grandmaster experts? He spoke of them so lightly, as if he didn't even consider them a threat.</p><p></p><p>Has it really been that long that peak Grandmaster experts have become so insignificant in Xu Yan's eyes?</p><p></p><p>"I guessed it," Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information I've obtained, in addition to the Fiery Exterminator Overlord, there are at least two hidden peak Grandmaster experts on Caoluan Island," Xie Lingfeng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Three?" Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "Not many, it shouldn't be too difficult to kill them."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, leave one for me to practice on," Meng Chong said excitedly as he rubbed his hands together.</p>

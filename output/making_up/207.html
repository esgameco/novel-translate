        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Tian Bao Pavilion, the man in the purple robe heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Watching the figure disappear into the distance, he sighed and said, "This is for the sake of that girl, Su Ling Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, what exactly is the deal with Su Ling Xiu..."</p><p></p><p>Someone asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple robe shook his head and said, "I don't know too much about this matter either. The rumors say that the gate to the Spirit Realm has opened, and it's related to Su Ling Xiu. It's just that someone will come out of the Spirit Realm gate.</p><p></p><p>"Capturing Su Ling Xiu would be an accomplishment, and they would be taken into the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>He smiled self-deprecatingly and looked towards the distant Spirit Realm gate, saying calmly, "Those who want to enter the Spirit Realm can go and try. Whether they end up high and mighty in the Inner Realm or become pigs and dogs in the Spirit Realm, it all depends on one's own choice."</p><p></p><p>Several half-step Heavenly Experts had conflicted expressions on their faces. To become pigs and dogs after entering the Spirit Realm? Could it really be that miserable?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, no one dared to go and try the Spirit Realm gate, as the master's words seemed highly credible.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the figure disappearing into the distance, furrowing his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and see where he went!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Rhyme opened her mouth, wanting to persuade him, but then closed it again. She jumped up and clung to Meng Chong's back, saying, "You're fast, take me with you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took to the air, chasing after the powerful Spirit Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>He marveled inwardly, "No wonder he's a Heavenly Expert, his speed is truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On top of the Ice Palace, Xu Yan looked at the emaciated, lifeless man who had already lost his breath. Then he looked at the seductive woman sitting on the chair, her posture indecent, and couldn't help but frown, a sense of disgust welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Du Yu Ying's face flushed red and then turned pale, hastily averting her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, come over here!" The Ice Maiden smiled seductively, beckoning with her finger.</p><p></p><p>Although she looked young, with skin still fair and tender, after indulging for a few days and consuming some of the maiden's essence, without timely replenishment, fine wrinkles had started to appear at the corners of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You old hag, aren't you disgusting?" Xu Yan had no intention of indulging her, his expression filled with revulsion.</p><p></p><p>Old hag? The Ice Palace suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden's expression gradually darkened, her legs crossing together, the killing intent in her eyes gradually surfacing.</p><p></p><p>She absorbed the maiden's essence, all for the sake of maintaining her youthful beauty, didn't she? Now, being directly called an "old hag" had undoubtedly stabbed her in the heart, exposing her ugly and unsightly side!</p><p></p><p>The two veiled women who had brought Xu Yan here immediately paled, glaring angrily and saying, "Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Xu Yan frowned and directly slapped out.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth congealed into a giant wave, thundering out and directly killing the two veiled women. For Xu Yan, these mere Grand Masters were nothing more than insects to be swatted away with a casual gesture.</p><p></p><p>"You deserve to die!" The Ice Maiden abruptly stood up, her killing intent palpable, an icy aura spreading and causing a chilling wind to blow across the top of the Ice Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Old hag, have you killed many people? There's something strange about the aura around you." Xu Yan's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He sensed an unusual aura from her, a mixed one that was not entirely her own, and the foreign auras were weakening.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the young maiden he had rescued, who had originally been captured to be offered to this old woman, and the old man had also said that all the captured maidens had died.</p><p></p><p>From the Ice Maiden's body, Xu Yan could sense those mixed auras, and he couldn't help but think of the Evil Cult's life-draining techniques, absorbing the essence of martial artists to enhance their own strength.</p><p></p><p>If they had just recently absorbed the essence, and it had not yet been fully refined, it would result in this mixed aura.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you look so handsome, I was going to keep you for a few more days. Since you're so ungrateful and seeking your own death, then I won't spare you.</p><p></p><p>"And this little beauty beside you, she's so beautiful. I'll drain her in front of your eyes, making her suffer a painful death!"</p><p></p><p>The Ice Maiden's voice was icy cold.</p><p></p><p>A powerful pressure emerged and surged towards them, intent on suppressing them.</p><p></p><p>She raised her hand, reaching towards Du Yu Ying.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xu Yan struck down her two Grand Masters, the Ice Maiden still didn't take him too seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was a Half-step Heavenly Expert.</p><p></p><p>She had already sensed the divine energy within her, reaching a certain stage of refinement.</p><p></p><p>Although she had not yet broken through to the Heavenly Expert realm, she was far from being just a peak Grand Master, or even a newly ascended Half-step Heavenly Expert.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Half-step Heavenly Experts in the Inner Realm, only the Demon Child could be considered her superior.</p><p></p><p>In the Ice Maiden's mind, Xu Yan, though appearing young, must have mastered some secret technique to maintain his youthful appearance. He was certainly not as young as he seemed.</p><p></p><p>The Half-step Heavenly Expert's pressure thundered down, and in the Ice Maiden's eyes, Xu Yan would surely be intimidated, unable to exert more than two or three tenths of his strength. He could only watch helplessly as she captured Du Yu Ying and torment her to death before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, just as she raised her hand to grab Du Yu Ying, her expression suddenly changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous force erupted, directly shattering her divine might, and then a golden dragon let out a roar, plummeting down towards her like a descending celestial being.</p><p></p><p>"You!" The Ice Maiden's expression changed drastically, and she raised her hand to strike out, a frigid blue storm sweeping out from her as the center. As she exerted her full power, her once fair and tender skin rapidly aged, turning her into an old crone.</p><p></p><p>"You must die, you must die!" The Ice Maiden roared in fury.</p><p></p><p>Since she had already become an old crone, she no longer had any reservations.</p><p></p><p>The azure light surged, transforming into countless icy spikes, the icy aura permeating the air as the Half-step Heavenly Expert's might was unleashed to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength had exceeded her expectations, but she was still not afraid, confident that she could still emerge victorious in the end.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, was now furious. Absorbing thousands of young maidens?</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The golden dragon let out a dragon's roar, its majestic aura coalescing, the dragon's eyes gleaming with a fierce might as its power surged, plummeting down towards the Ice Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" The Ice Maiden was greatly alarmed, feeling a chill run down her spine as a powerful sense of crisis enveloped her.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this golden dragon?</p><p></p><p>"The one who will kill you is Xu Yan!" The Ice Maiden exerted her full strength to resist the Descending Dragon Palm. The name Xu Yan sounded somewhat familiar to her, as if she had heard it before. But since she had long since distanced herself from the affairs of the martial arts world, even if she had heard of Xu Yan's name, she didn't pay much attention to it, as she was the supreme power in the Inner Realm, and no one dared to provoke her.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm shattered the azure storm, breaking through all defenses, and in the Ice Maiden's horrified gaze, the golden dragon slammed into her.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the massive golden dragon,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her body seemed so small.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Even a half-step Celestial Immortal expert was completely reduced to ashes by this single strike! After breaking through the Minor Perfection of the Profound Mysteries realm and refining his own cultivation, Xu Yan's strength had already changed drastically. A half-step Celestial Immortal cultivator was no longer in his sight.</p><p></p><p>Killing them was effortless.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were Small Celestial Immortal experts, Xu Yan was confident he could slay them with his sword, let alone mere half-step Celestial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>With the Ice Goddess dead, the remaining people in the Ice Palace were all horrified, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Please spare us, we were forced into this."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pleading group of veiled women, the two strongest among them had already reached the Great Perfection Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>They were all subordinates of the Ice Goddess, who had captured many young girls to be devoured by her. They deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out with a palm, mercilessly annihilating them all!</p><p></p><p>The Ice Palace was destroyed from that moment on!</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if there are any treasures in this Ice Palace, we can't let them go to waste."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a smile on his face. A half-step Celestial Immortal's domain should contain some treasures, right?</p><p></p><p>Since he had killed everyone, it would be a waste not to loot the place clean. Just as he was about to start searching the Ice Palace, Xu Yan's expression suddenly changed as he looked towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was startled, following Xu Yan's gaze to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A figure suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>Its aura was overwhelmingly powerful, exuding a domineering presence that looked down on the world as if mortals were mere ants.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Who was this expert? Far more powerful than the "Ice Goddess" Xu Yan had just killed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Dao Celestial Immortal!</p><p></p><p>A true Martial Dao Celestial Immortal, not just a small Celestial Immortal in the Gathering Spiritual stage. When did the Inner Realm have such a powerful Martial Dao Celestial Immortal expert?</p><p></p><p>Was this the savior of that old woman?</p><p></p><p>The descending Martial Dao Celestial Immortal had a middle-aged appearance, a pale face without a beard, and a gloomy gaze with a faint scar on his forehead. In front of him, a lustrous white pearl was spinning.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming looked at the mother pearl of the spirit pearl, which had stopped over this Ice Palace. If the child pearl were to shatter here, then the one who had completed the task must be inside the Ice Palace.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept down, and in the entire Ice Palace, there were only two people.</p><p></p><p>His gaze lingered on Du Yuying for a moment, slightly surprised that such a beautiful woman could be found in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming's gaze then fell on Xu Yan, looking down from above, and he asked indifferently, "Where is the person? Where are they?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the lustrous white pearl, recalling his battle with the Ice Goddess. She had never called for help, nor had she had the time to do so.</p><p></p><p>So this small Celestial Immortal was not here to answer a call for help.</p><p></p><p>Who was he looking for? Everyone in the Ice Palace had been killed, so Xu Yan naturally didn't know who the other party was searching for.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you looking for?" Xu Yan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming's expression darkened, his gaze turning icy cold as he sneered, "How dare a lowly dog like you question me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immediately enraged by the arrogant and condescending attitude. "Who are you calling a lowly dog?"</p><p></p><p>The aura around Jiao Ming surged as he angrily retorted, "You...!"</p><p></p><p>But then he realized his words were inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" Jiao Ming exploded in rage. How dare this insignificant person in the Inner Realm try to trick him?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know the might of a Celestial Immortal?</p><p></p><p>"Kneel!" Jiao Ming roared. If he wasn't here to find Su Ling Xiu, he would have already annihilated this person.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Celestial Immortal's divine might descended, suppressing everything.</p><p></p><p>"The might of a small Celestial Immortal is indeed formidable, far beyond that of a half-step Celestial Immortal!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. The divine might of a half-step Celestial Immortal felt hollow, like a massive boulder pressing down, while the Celestial Immortal's divine might was like an entire mountain descending.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan's sword intent surged, directly deflecting the divine might outside, completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a golden dragon wrapped around Du Yuying, quickly fleeing the Ice Palace.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was anxious. The powerful expert who had just appeared was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, she could only retreat, as her strength was far too lacking to be of any help to Xu Yan. She continued to distance herself from the Ice Palace.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was taken aback. How could his Celestial Immortal divine might not subdue the other party?</p><p></p><p>And what was that power? It had the aura of divine might, yet was also different, possessing an unknown profundity and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"If you are a Cultivated Celestial Immortal, I, Xu Yan, will not hesitate to turn and flee!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rose into the air, standing level with Jiao Ming.</p><p></p><p>"A mere small Celestial Immortal dares to be so arrogant and disrespectful? Today, I will treat you like the lowly dog you are and slaughter you!" </p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous! Today, I will let you experience the true might of a Celestial Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming raised his hand, and a fist struck out, with star fragments flashing, like a falling celestial star, containing immense destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as he unleashed the Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers! </p><p></p><p>At the same time, two sword lights flashed out, attacking the opponent, with the life-and-death struggle enveloping the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a small Celestial Immortal expert, so Xu Yan did not dare to be careless. If he was going to act, he had to completely annihilate the opponent, leaving no chance for escape.</p><p></p><p>He had to crush the bones, scatter the ashes, and extinguish the soul!</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was shocked. What kind of sword dao was this? "The lowly dogs of the Inner Realm could not possibly have such a powerful expert. Could it be someone from the Spiritual Realm secretly protecting Su Ling Xiu?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming thought with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed his fists, with star fragments swirling around him. At this moment, he dared not be careless.</p><p></p><p>"He is not a Celestial Immortal cultivator, his aura is unusual, and he is not a peak Grandmaster either?" </p><p></p><p>As they fought, Jiao Ming became increasingly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Both the sword dao and the martial power of the other party seemed unusual, neither a Celestial Immortal cultivator nor a Grandmaster, as if he cultivated a path of the martial dao that Jiao Ming was unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave. This small Celestial Immortal was extremely powerful, his fist techniques were extraordinary, with star fragments swirling, each one a fierce attack.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a fist technique from the Spiritual Realm?" Xu Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>It did not exist in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the one who kills you is the Sword Deity Xu Yan. Today, I will slay you, a lowly dog, with three sword strikes!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous! Let's see how you intend to slay me with three sword strikes!" Jiao Ming sneered.</p><p></p><p>He admitted that the other party was very strong, not much weaker than himself.</p><p></p><p>But to claim he would slay him with three sword strikes was simply madness.</p><p></p><p>Unless the other party was a Cultivated Celestial Immortal! Hum! Suddenly, Xu Yan's sword descended, with the mountains and rivers appearing, the gentle breeze blowing.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming sneered, and the star fragments instantly fell like falling celestial stars, surging with destructive power, intending to completely destroy the mountains and rivers and overwhelm the opponent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

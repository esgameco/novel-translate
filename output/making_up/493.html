        <h1>Chapter 493</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How could a Realm Lord be killed so easily?"</p><p></p><p>The voice from the abyss sounded heavy as it continued: "Back then, I ambushed Yu Yao and severely wounded her. However, she unexpectedly had a backup plan and escaped into the Spirit Realm, barely surviving. By now, she has likely returned to the Dao Realm and may have even fully recovered from her injuries.</p><p></p><p>"To prevent this incident from spreading, Yu Yao's old acquaintances intervened, forcing me to fake my death until now. If I were to leave this place, Yu Yao would likely sense my presence."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue's expression changed slightly as he said in a deep voice: "Realm Lord, is there no way for you to eliminate that trace of aura?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord's voice revealed a sense of helplessness as he said: "That trace of aura is no ordinary thing. Despite my many efforts, I have been unable to eliminate it. I can only conceal it by staying in this place. Once I leave, Yu Yao will certainly know that I am still alive.</p><p></p><p>"Given the current situation, Yu Yao will likely guess that I was the one who attempted to assassinate that person in the Divine Realm. She may leak my whereabouts to them.</p><p></p><p>"Once they are on guard, since they are also a Realm Lord after all, it will not be easy for me to assassinate them!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue said in a deep voice: "Please wait, Realm Lord. Let me report this to Lord Tian Sha and see how we should proceed!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he took out a statue, placed it on the ground, and poured his soul force into it frantically.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a Supreme Realm cultivator, being in the Shadow Realm which was currently falling and affected by the laws of heaven and earth, trying to send a message to Tian Sha consumed an enormous amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, his face turned pale, showing how much soul force he had expended.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the eyes of the statue lit up, and Tian Sha's voice came through: "Yin Jue, what urgent matter do you have?"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord's voice transmitted: "If I make a move, Yu Yao may leak information about me. Once I'm exposed, it will be difficult to carry out the assassination."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for my signal. When the time is right, make your move. I will handle Yu Yao."</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha replied after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, if the target is truly a Realm Lord, I will take action!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the statue dimmed, and Yin Jue hurriedly withdrew his soul force, feeling a sense of weakness.</p><p></p><p>"Take the Mist Beast's true spirit with you."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord's voice came through as a cloud of mist floated out from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Beast's true spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Beast's true spirit instantly enveloped Yin Jue like a cloud of mist. The originally shadow-like Yin Jue seemed to merge with the mist in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Go now!"</p><p></p><p>After the Shadow Realm Lord spoke, he fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Beast's true spirit was a special type of true spirit. Its body was like clouds and mist, able to disperse. When attacked, it could scatter like mist, making it difficult to completely destroy. It could also negate 70-80% of an attack's power.</p><p></p><p>It also had a special ability to conceal one's aura and hide one's traces! Shrouded by the Mist Beast's true spirit, Yin Jue silently traveled through the Shadow Realm towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Dao Realm, the battle between Supreme Realm cultivators had concluded.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Realm cultivators from the Tian Sha Realm, acknowledging they were at a slight disadvantage, chose to cease fighting of their own accord.</p><p></p><p>They had already achieved their goal.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Yao Realm was not well-known among the 300 realms of the Dao Realm. Moreover, there were no cultivators from the Yu Yao Realm active in the Dao Realm. In the eyes of many Dao Realm cultivators, the Yu Yao Realm was an empty realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this realm was sealed off, and outsiders could not enter. Even Supreme Realm cultivators were unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>As for whether other Realm Lords had ever entered, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cold and desolate Yu Yao Realm, a light cough came from a lonely small house. A woman of unparalleled beauty and cold temperament walked out of the house.</p><p></p><p>Her pale jade-like face showed a sickly frailty. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, and her clear gaze seemed to penetrate through the Yu Yao Realm, looking towards the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The woman quietly observed, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>"So he really didn't die!"</p><p></p><p>She then looked in a certain direction, "Tian Sha?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the woman turned and went back into the small house.</p><p></p><p>Inside the house, there was nothing but a white jade platform.</p><p></p><p>The woman lay down on the jade platform. Strands of white heavenly and earthly energy surrounded her, nourishing her. Within this white energy, a faint purple color occasionally appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little more and I'll be fully recovered. If it weren't for the heavenly fortune bestowed by my master, how could I have escaped that calamity?"</p><p></p><p>The woman thought silently to herself.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, the image of a little boy appeared in her mind, gradually growing into a young man... It had been a very long time since they parted.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Nan..."</p><p></p><p>The woman murmured, a faint smile unconsciously appearing on her lips.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Shadow Realm, the falling realm was about to stabilize, and the tremors had already weakened.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Realm and Venerable Realm cultivators would soon be able to pass through the Shadow Realm and enter the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>A figure abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Realm Lord Tian Sha!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Even the Supreme Realm cultivators from the Tai He Realm and Tai Kun Realm bowed to show respect to the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Realm, Realm Lords were supreme. It was an unwritten rule that cultivators below the Realm Lord level must bow when they see one.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators from enemy realms had to bow when they encountered a Realm Lord. In a sense, if one showed respect, the Realm Lord would not bully those below the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin of the unwritten rule of bowing when encountering a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha nodded and looked towards the Shadow Realm, saying: "The Shadow Realm Lord had a wicked nature, fond of acting in secret, ambushing and plotting. I killed him to rid the Dao Realm of such unsavory elements. However, the Shadow Realm now belongs to my Tian Sha Realm. You may use the Shadow Realm as a passage to the Divine Realm, but you are not to explore or take anything from the Shadow Realm. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"We understand!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha had come to warn the cultivators and various realms that the Shadow Realm was now his. He could lend it out for people to travel to the Divine Realm, but they were not allowed to explore or take anything from the Shadow Realm, as all of it belonged to the Tian Sha Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Good that you understand!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Tian Sha's arrival, all the cultivators held their breath, their hearts tense, silently waiting for the moment they could enter the Shadow Realm and proceed to the Divine Realm. They didn't even dare to communicate telepathically with each other.</p><p></p><p>The tremors of the Shadow Realm grew weaker and weaker, and the time to enter drew closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the cultivators' expressions changed again.</p><p></p><p>Another figure drifted over.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Sha, are you going to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer gave off an unassuming aura, lacking the domineering presence of a supreme being, instead appearing more low-key.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Realm Lord Jiang Feng!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators bowed one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Realm cultivator from the Tai Kun Realm felt relieved and hurriedly went to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Feng, what a rare guest. You actually deigned to leave the Tai Kun Realm."</p><p></p><p>Tian Sha smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"With the commotion you've caused, Tian Sha, who in the Dao Realm wouldn't be alarmed?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng said with a slight</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Laughter.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai let out a light chuckle. None of these realm lords were simple - they had all been watching and waiting, hoping to get a piece of the action at the crucial moment.</p><p></p><p>"You, Jiang Feng, want to go to the Divine Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng shook his head and said, "Of course I'm not going, but there are some matters that need to be dealt with in the Taikun region of the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai nodded without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng stepped forward, coming to the entrance of the Shadow Realm. He gazed into the Shadow Realm and sighed, "Back then, Shadow also had a formidable reputation. His skills in lurking and concealment ranked first among the many realm lords. He was especially adept at sneak attacks and assassination techniques. He was also humble and never conflicted with others.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, he once ambushed and severely wounded a giant demon from the Demon Witch Realm in the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that Shadow would have already perished."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's expression remained calm as he said, "Shadow was only humble on the surface. You don't know how many despicable things he did in secret, Jiang Feng, since you were in seclusion for years. I killed him simply to prevent such a character from wreaking havoc in the Dao Realm. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you, Jiang Feng, had a relationship with Shadow and want to stand up for him?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng shook his head and said, "Tianshai, I had no relationship with him, nor do I have any intention of standing up for him. I'm just curious - is Shadow really dead?"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai frowned, "Jiang Feng, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing else, it's just that Shadow was skilled in concealment, deception, and faking his death to hide. His techniques were remarkable. So I find it hard to believe he would perish just like that."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai gave a cold laugh and said, "If Shadow could truly fake his death and escape from my hands, I, Tianshai, would admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng smiled and withdrew his gaze from the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a dragon's roar was heard.</p><p></p><p>A crimson true dragon came flying over, its dragon might surging. Behind the true dragon, four more true spirit beasts followed closely.</p><p></p><p>As the true dragon approached, it suddenly noticed the presence of the two realm lords, Tianshai and Jiang Feng. It hurriedly restrained its dragon might and transformed into human form.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the two realm lords!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming hastily bowed, realizing he had just displayed his dragon might in front of the realm lords - this was a provocation.</p><p></p><p>If a realm lord became angry, they might not kill him, but he would certainly receive a harsh lesson. After all, offending the dignity of a realm lord was a great taboo in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though his father was Ao Lie, the Dragon Realm Lord, he would not be spared a beating.</p><p></p><p>"In consideration of the Dragon Realm Lord's friendship, I'll overlook your rudeness this time."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai looked at Ao Ming, then at the four true spirit beasts he was leading. It was clear they were heading to the Divine Realm, surely to find Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dragon Realm princess Ao Yuxue had been subdued by someone, which was a great humiliation for true dragons.</p><p></p><p>And Ao Ming was Ao Yuxue's father.</p><p></p><p>"Where has the Dragon Realm Lord been recently?" </p><p></p><p>Tianshai pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>There was some embarrassment deep in Ao Ming's eyes. He knew what Tianshai meant - he was puzzled that Ao Ming's father hadn't gone to seek revenge against Mei Wu, finding it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>After all, Mei Wu had harmed his daughter. Given his father's temperament, he would surely have been enraged and aggressively attacked Mei Wu's location to demand an explanation. That would have been in line with the image of the Dragon Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, his most beloved granddaughter had been harmed, yet there was no action at all. This seemed abnormal no matter how you looked at it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ao Ming couldn't directly state the reason, so he said solemnly, "My father is in seclusion, cultivating a secret technique of our true dragon clan, intending to completely annihilate that harlot Mei Wu in one fell swoop!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "Realm Lord Tianshai also knows that as one of the Seven Witches of the Demon Witch, Mei Wu is extremely powerful. Even if my father could defeat her, killing her would be extremely difficult. That's why he's in seclusion cultivating this secret technique. When he makes his move, it will definitely result in Mei Wu's complete annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai nodded in realization, saying, "I see!"</p><p></p><p>However, deep in his eyes, there was a mix of belief and doubt. Could that dragon Ao Lie really be so patient? The martial artists present, upon seeing Ao Ming's appearance, all had flickering gazes. Many of them had their hearts set on the dragon-subduing technique.</p><p></p><p>With the true dragon clan also descending upon the Divine Realm, it meant their opportunities were becoming scarce. Unless they were willing to directly contend with the true dragon clan, which would offend the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>And when it came to the dragon-subduing technique, it no longer just involved the true dragon clan, but the entire true spirit clan. Without sufficient strength or powerful backing, death was certain.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming's display of dragon might upon arrival was also meant to intimidate those with ulterior motives. He just hadn't expected realm lords to be present.</p><p></p><p>The tremors from the Shadow Realm were growing weaker, indicating it was about to completely fall into the Divine Realm and merge with it, marking the beginning of the reunification of the Dao Realm and Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of martial arts in the Divine Realm would be completely broken, gradually becoming the same as the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was another change in the world order since the great transformation, returning to the pattern of the world's beginning.</p><p></p><p>And with changes in the world order, there were bound to be some opportunities.</p><p></p><p>For the realm lords, what attracted them was the authority over heaven and earth, competing for the possible right to rule as the new master of the Cang Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At a certain moment, a sound of falling echoed from within the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The tremors suddenly intensified, but then quickly weakened again.</p><p></p><p>"Those at the Divine Lord and Heaven Unity realms can now enter the Divine Realm. Those at the Supreme realm need to wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, Realm Lord Tianshai!"</p><p></p><p>Some Divine Lord martial artists bowed joyfully before instantly entering the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, others followed suit, entering the Shadow Realm to go to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming became a bit anxious. Unfortunately, his strength was at the Supreme realm, and the four true spirit beasts he led were also at the Supreme realm. This meant they still couldn't enter the Shadow Realm to descend into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the tremors weaken further, then you can enter. Entering now risks being attacked by the laws of the Shadow Realm."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Tianshai turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng smiled and also turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>With the realm lords gone, Ao Ming instantly reverted to his true dragon form. His dragon might surged as he let out a roar. The four true spirit beasts he led also unleashed their might, roaring loudly.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming's gaze swept over the remaining Supreme realm martial artists, his warning intent strong.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme realm martial artists remained silent, quietly waiting for the opportunity to enter the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, the world's tremors had begun to weaken.</p><p></p><p>More and more martial artists were breaking through to the Heaven Unity realm. In a certain area of the Grand Unity realm, a young man was slitting the throat of a martial artist who had just recently broken through to Heaven Unity, pouring the blood over himself.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, your time of death is approaching. Yan'er, I will definitely revive you!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes were bloodshot, his expression twisted and ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"You're almost there. You're not far from being invincible in the Heaven Unity realm. Kid, you must stay calm at this moment!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's voice sounded in the young man's soul.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, three years had passed since Xu Yan entered seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The undercurrents in the outside world had no effect on the Qinghua Realm. Da Yue Huang and the other two had already become mid-stage Heaven Unity realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping were all in bitter cultivation, having made huge improvements in their strength.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

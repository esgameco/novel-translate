        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 11 Copper Bones Perfected (Seeking Continued Readership)</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit was invigorated as he murmured, "With no woman in the heart, the cultivation is as if guided by a deity?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I think I've gained some insight, thank you for your teachings!"</p><p></p><p>He respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple is going to cultivate now!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, with a hint of doubt in his eyes: "This foolish disciple of mine, could it be that he really becomes devoid of women and his mind is filled only with cultivation? What a sin, I shouldn't have blurted that out!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came to the cultivation site, firmly planted his feet, and his gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"The master is right, only by overcoming setbacks can one be courageous!"</p><p></p><p>"With no woman in the heart, the cultivation is as if guided by a deity... I understand the master's deep meaning, that 'woman' represents distractions, and for a man of my age, women are the greatest distraction!</p><p></p><p>"As long as I overcome this biggest distraction, then my mind will be free of external things, my inner self will be clear, and my insights will naturally improve, making my cultivation much faster!"</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood began to circulate as he started bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly had a flash of inspiration: "The master said, 'With no woman in the heart, the cultivation is as if guided by a deity,' is he perhaps reminding me that my current bone refinement method has not truly grasped its essence, which is why the bone refinement is so slow?"</p><p></p><p>"Reunderstand, recomprehend, I must let go of distractions and maintain a clear mind, carefully feel the changes in my qi and blood, and find the essence of bone refinement... this must be the master's deep meaning!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan engaged in some self-reflection, the more he thought about it, the more he felt that every word and action of the master contained deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>"The master guides me to the door of cultivation, but the cultivation itself is up to the individual. The master is a reclusive expert, the methods he imparts are beyond common logic, the master emphasizes insight... he is constantly reminding me to gain more insight!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan began to carefully sense his own qi and blood, carefully sense the changes in his bones, gradually entering a state of oblivion to self and surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"There's something wrong here... the circulation of qi and blood is too slow, the penetration is not deep enough, the tempering is not strong enough... I should adjust it."</p><p></p><p>"The speed of bone refinement has increased... indeed, the master was reminding me that I had not grasped the essence of bone refinement!"</p><p></p><p>"I've got it! This is the true bone refinement method!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Yan felt that the circulation of qi and blood was smooth, the speed of bone refinement had greatly increased, and the qi and blood were also strengthened along with the bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>"With no woman in the heart, the cultivation is as if guided by a deity, the master did not deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, in five or six days, I'll be able to refine iron bones!"</p><p></p><p>"Golden bones should not be a problem, I will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in cultivation, oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>In the evening.</p><p></p><p>The village had already started to darken.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the cultivating Xu Yan, a hint of doubt flashing in his eyes. How come this kid has forgotten the time? And he seems to have been standing in the horse stance the whole time? Without any breaks in between?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, even if he's used to standing in the horse stance every day, he couldn't stand like that for so long without getting tired."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe he rested when I wasn't paying attention."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was about to call Xu Yan to stop and have dinner.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought: "This foolish disciple of mine, he was rejected in his engagement, he's probably using cultivation to relieve his sorrow, I shouldn't disturb him. I'll just cook dinner for myself tonight."</p><p></p><p>He sighed and went to cook his own dinner.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan's return, Li Xuan had resumed his carefree life for the past half month, with Xu Yan handling all the chores, so he didn't have to worry about anything.</p><p></p><p>The chickens had grown even fatter, the chicks had grown much bigger.</p><p></p><p>He had even raised a few wild rabbits.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, although the cultivation was fake, Xu Yan had learned a lot of practical life skills.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For the past half a month, Xu Yan had been cultivating even more diligently.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, seeing this unwavering determination, was impressed and did not want to discourage him, so he would occasionally offer some encouragement.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know, Xu Yan had already entered the stage of cultivating copper bones.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, this half-month of cultivation was truly like having divine assistance. He gained deeper insights into the bone refining technique, and the refining speed continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>He would ponder deeply on every word of encouragement from Li Xuan, and after some mental supplementation, he would suddenly gain new realizations.</p><p></p><p>He would then make fine-tunings to the blood and qi refining technique, further increasing the speed of bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>At these moments, he would be greatly excited. The image of his master in his heart could no longer be simply described as a reclusive high-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"My master is truly unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>"At his level, he has already transcended the traditional, ordinary teaching methods, and is constantly striving to enhance my perceptiveness!"</p><p></p><p>"He makes me continuously comprehend the true essence of cultivation, and the 'meaning' within it."</p><p></p><p>"Planting vegetables, cooking, raising chickens and rabbits... These seemingly mundane chores are actually able to relax my mind after cultivation, allowing me to return to the state of an ordinary person, rather than remaining tense as a martial cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my master appears like an ordinary person. This is what he means by 'returning to the original and following the natural way'..."</p><p></p><p>"My master's realm is too high!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, wondering when he would be able to reach his master's level.</p><p></p><p>"I have already refined copper bones. I'm one step closer to golden bones. In another half a month, I should be able to enter the golden bone stage?"</p><p></p><p>"According to my master's words, the transition from copper bones to golden bones is a huge leap and transformation, not something easily refined."</p><p></p><p>"Once I complete the copper bone refinement, I should go back home for a trip, and see if I can find precious herbs like the Nine-Leaf Yuan Zhi to increase the chances of refining golden bones."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had made up his mind. After completing the copper bone refinement, he would return home to try and find precious herbs like the Nine-Leaf Yuan Zhi to assist in refining golden bones.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Xu Yan's copper bone refinement was complete.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could feel a bottleneck in his cultivation, as if the bone refinement had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>He knew he had encountered the golden bone bottleneck. At this stage, he could only rely on his talent, willpower, and perseverance. Most importantly, he needed to gain deeper insights.</p><p></p><p>"With the assistance of precious herbs, the chances of breaking through will be higher."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan prepared to return home again to search for precious herbs to aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood at the doorway, watching the distant Xu Yan in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel that Xu Yan had become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he had a certain... heroic aura about him.</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple, could it be that he has truly cultivated something? No, that's impossible. The cultivation method I taught him is completely made up. How could he actually cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be because he has been standing in the horse stance for too long, making him look more stable and powerful."</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had been in the same horse stance for so long, it was time to teach him a new one.</p><p></p><p>Pondering on what kind of new stance to teach him, Li Xuan recalled the martial arts videos and illustrations he had seen in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to teach him exactly the same. I can just adjust the stance and teach it to my disciple."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's all made up. He won't be able to cultivate anything. I'll just continue to give him the determination to keep cultivating, as the one-year period is still early."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to use the excuse of no master-disciple relationship to part ways amicably, that would be the best outcome."</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts, Li Xuan waved to Xu Yan, summoning him over.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

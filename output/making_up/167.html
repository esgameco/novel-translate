        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan broke through to the Innate Perfection realm, he returned home and guided his parents in cultivation. He then went to the capital city of Qi State to guide his grandfather and others in cultivation as well.</p><p></p><p>Under the nourishment of the medicinal pills, Guo Rongshan's body had greatly improved, and cultivating the martial dao became much easier for him. He was not too far from entering the martial dao now.</p><p></p><p>As for Guo Yunkai, he had already entered the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The remote martial dao realm was beginning to enter a high-speed development period, and more martial artists were about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was looking forward to seeing what kind of feedback he would get with the increasing number of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the Great Sun Golden Body Perfection, so your Great Sun Golden Body has doubled in strength."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Finger was not just a breakthrough in the Great Sun Golden Body, but a doubling of its strength. Although his realm had not changed, he had become much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the profound cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body aperture and sighed inwardly. Meng Chong had finally begun to cultivate his sword in the aperture and had already accumulated some trump cards.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong was like this, Xu Yan would only be stronger. His Sword Dao of the Mountains and Rivers had probably already nurtured powerful trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at his own Sword Dao and understood.</p><p></p><p>"My pure martial dao, physical martial dao, and medicinal martial dao are all one, without any conflicts, but rather rounded and unified. This is because they are all martial dao that I have created, so they can be unified?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, if I create more martial dao, will they also be able to be unified, and will I eventually transform into an even stronger martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>However, creating new martial dao was not easy, and finding people who could comprehend and create them was even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait until I can use the Golden Finger, then I'll try creating new martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating his consciousness, he saw that faint golden light again, which was where the Golden Finger was. He was not far from seeing the complete form of the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>According to his speculation, as long as he reached the Martial Dao Fourth Realm, the Profound Enlightenment Realm, he would most likely be able to see the Golden Finger and utilize it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had returned home, and Meng Chong, in addition to cultivating, was teaching the Stone Two Saber Technique. Zhou Ying saw this and also went to learn from Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was researching medicinal formulas, preparing to refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow. Ah, the medicinal pills that could enhance one's aptitude and talent, how precious they were.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for those with already extraordinary talents, the effect might not be that significant. For example, Su Lingxiu's Azure Wood Spirit Body, even if the Heavenly Dew Marrow medicinal pill was refined, it would not be able to further enhance her talent, as the Heavenly Dew Marrow was only a fifth-grade spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of talent was limited.</p><p></p><p>But for people like Zhou Ying and Shi Er, it could greatly improve their talents.</p><p></p><p>A month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying had reached the Qi and Blood Realm Perfection, and she was not far from the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, she needed to settle down for a while, as such a rapid cultivation was relying on medicinal pills and was somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had reached the Qi and Blood Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also not far from reaching the small success of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>During this month, she had refined medicinal pills several times, and she had already researched the formula for the Heavenly Dew Marrow medicinal pill. She only needed to refine it now.</p><p></p><p>A sixth-grade spirit herb had been melted and refined in Su Lingxiu's hands, extracting its essence, which was then carefully placed in a jade bottle and sealed.</p><p></p><p>She then extracted another sixth-grade spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the successful refinement of the Heavenly Dew Marrow, Su Lingxiu could only extract the auxiliary herbs in advance. This way, when refining, she only needed to extract the Heavenly Dew Marrow and then fuse and refine it into a pill.</p><p></p><p>This would greatly reduce the chance of failure.</p><p></p><p>Her hand-refining technique had become exquisite after days of research and practice.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw this and estimated that it was about time to teach Su Lingxiu the Void Refinement Technique. Once she comprehended the Void Refinement Technique as a foundation, she could further explore higher-level Void Refinement Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was preparing to refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow, and Li Xuan called her over.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think the Heavenly Dew Marrow can be successfully refined?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked nervously. A fifth-grade spirit herb was so precious, and there was only this one. She naturally felt the pressure and was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"In refining, especially high-grade medicinal pills and new medicinal pills, one must avoid being impulsive or lacking in confidence. Calm your mind, focus your attention, and do your best.</p><p></p><p>"If you lack confidence even before refining, and cannot calm your mind and focus, then do not try to refine it. If you yourself do not have confidence, the chance of failure will be even higher."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Because the Heavenly Dew Marrow was so precious, with only this one specimen, Meng Chong had even been chased by a Grand Master for a time to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Su Lingxiu was so afraid of failing the refinement, letting down her two senior brothers. She was under a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu exclaimed, solemnly nodding her head.</p><p></p><p>"Your refinement technique has already reached mastery. Your hand-refining is already exquisite. Today, I will pass on the Void Refinement Technique to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed. "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"The Void Refinement Technique uses the void as the furnace to melt and refine the medicinal pills. This is the foundation of the Dao of Refinement. You must take this as a foundation and go on to comprehend the Dao of Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Do not just stay at the level of the Void Refinement Technique. Go and contemplate more, for the Pill can be both medicinal pills and other things..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said seriously, reminding her to go beyond just the Void Refinement Technique and comprehend stronger refinement techniques.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu solemnly nodded and said, "Master, I understand. I will not be stuck at just the Void Refinement Technique. I will use it as a foundation to comprehend higher-level refinement techniques, to understand the Dao of Refinement."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Medicinal Martial Dao Classic, I already have new ideas. I believe that it won't be long before I can comprehend an even higher-level Medicinal Martial Dao Classic based on this."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became even more pleased. "In that case, it won't be long before I can obtain an even higher-level Medicinal Martial Dao Classic?" He praised, "Well done, your realization pleases me."</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Xuan passed on the Void Refinement Technique to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>After learning the Void Refinement Technique, Su Lingxiu naturally could not immediately put it into practice, as she was only at the initial Innate Realm and still lacked the strength to use the Void Refinement Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, from the Void Refinement Technique, she also gained some insights into refinement techniques, and her hand-refining technique had improved even further.</p><p></p><p>The plan to refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow was postponed due to her comprehension of the Void Refinement Technique.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Su Lingxiu's refinement technique had improved again, and her confidence in refining the Heavenly Dew Marrow had greatly increased. She was ready to begin the refinement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had also returned.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, believe in yourself and do your best. Don't be afraid of failure. It's just one spirit herb, and even though it's a fifth-grade one, if we found one, we can find a second and third one."</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Su Lingxiu was under a lot of pressure, afraid of failing the refinement, so Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother is right. If our family could find one, we can find a second one. Even if it fails, I'll go to the Inner Realm and have our family search for more."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, brothers, I'll do my best."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have confidence," Suli Xiu said, clenching her fists.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan also came over. A fifth-grade spirit medicine, what a precious treasure! What miraculous effects would the elixir refined from a fifth-grade spirit medicine have? Everyone was curious and gathered around to watch Suli Xiu refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow. Even the Red Cat lying outside the manor jumped in and lay beside them, watching.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suspected that the Red Cat might hope the refinement would fail, because only then would it have a chance to eat such a precious spirit medicine.</p><p></p><p>"This big cat, its spiritual wisdom seems to have improved a bit," Li Xuan sat in the chair, observing the Red Cat thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Before refining the Heavenly Dew Marrow, Suli Xiu first refined another elixir, one she had just recently researched, with a high grade and extraordinary effects.</p><p></p><p>The Resurrection Elixir! A healing elixir that could save someone as long as they had a breath of life left, and could also repair one's foundation.</p><p></p><p>She practiced with the Resurrection Elixir first, then proceeded to refine the Heavenly Dew Marrow.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, does our Sword尊Cliff have any fifth-grade spirit medicines?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Hu Shan scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, your Sword尊Cliff is such a powerful force with deep heritage, how could you not have any fifth-grade spirit medicines?" Xu Yan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Can't say for sure!" Xie Lingfeng shook his head. "Fifth-grade spirit medicines are truly a matter of chance, and they must be extremely rare in the inner realm, otherwise the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion wouldn't be the only one selling them."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he continued, "The Sword尊Cliff has been passed down for a long time, so I'm inclined to believe we have some fifth-grade spirit medicines hoarded as our true heritage, but I haven't been able to access them yet. I'll ask my father when I return."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt it made sense, fifth-grade spirit medicines must be part of their true heritage.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, if you have fifth-grade spirit medicines, you should refine them into elixirs to strengthen your foundation even more," Hu Shan said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>One fifth-grade spirit medicine could only be used by one person at most, even if divided, it would be limited to two or three people. But if refined into an elixir, perhaps he would have the chance to take it!</p><p></p><p>"The logic is sound, but it depends on whether my father is willing to give me any," Xie Lingfeng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu was fully focused on refining the elixir. The Resurrection Elixir was successfully refined, a total of thirty-six pills, which she placed in three jade bottles.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Resurrection Elixir. Even if a grand master suffers grave injuries and is left with just a breath of life, it can save them and repair their damaged foundation," Suli Xiu placed the three bottles on the table.</p><p></p><p>"May I have one bottle? I can give you ten sixth-grade spirit herbs!" Xie Lingfeng asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Suli Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ten sixth-grade spirit herbs in exchange for one bottle of the Resurrection Elixir, she had made a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xie Lingfeng also felt he had made a great deal. If not for their friendship, he wouldn't be able to buy such a miraculous elixir even with a hundred sixth-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Xie Lingfeng gratefully took a bottle of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu then began refining the Heavenly Dew Marrow. Her expression was serious, fully focused, not daring to be distracted in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others held their breath, not daring to make a sound, afraid of interfering with Suli Xiu's refinement. Xu Yan even glared at the Red Cat lying beside them, warning it not to make a sound, or else it would be cooked as tiger meat! The Red Cat was so scared it didn't dare to even breathe. Among them all, it feared Xu Yan the most, because if he really wanted to cook it, no one could stop him.</p><p></p><p>As for their master Li Xuan, he definitely wouldn't interfere, as his senior disciple was the one he cared about the most.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the Heavenly Dew Marrow was slow and consumed a lot. Suli Xiu's forehead was beaded with sweat, but she didn't dare to be distracted, carefully controlling the furnace fire.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Suli Xiu slapped the furnace with both hands. The elixir refinement was successful! Originally there were thirty-six pills, but six of them ended up as defective products.</p><p></p><p>The remaining thirty pills were as clear as dewdrops, irresistibly alluring. The fragrance of the elixir was concentrated yet lingering, only detectable when one brought it close to the nose, permeating the heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>Although six were failures, the rest were successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>On the table were thirty-six small jade bottles, spirit jade bottles that Hu Shan had bought from Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Each bottle contained one elixir pill.</p><p></p><p>"This is a fifth-grade elixir, the Heavenly Marrow Pill, with the effect of enhancing one's innate talents and comprehension," Suli Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually enhance innate talents and comprehension?" Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were shocked.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists, innate talents and comprehension were fundamental, almost determined from birth and unable to be changed.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Suli Xiu nodded, then added, "However, if one's innate talents are already too high and comprehension too strong, the fifth-grade Heavenly Marrow Pill won't have much effect."</p><p></p><p>After all, if one's talents already far exceeded the limit of the Heavenly Marrow Pill, it would be like a drop of water in the ocean, unnoticeable.</p><p></p><p>The first pill would have the best effect, the second would be halved, and the third would be the limit, with no further enhancement after that.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a Heavenly Marrow Pill and examined it for a while, saying, "It's useless for me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled inwardly, "Not just the Heavenly Marrow Pill, any treasure that can enhance innate talents and comprehension, no matter how high the grade, would be useless for you."</p><p></p><p>"Your demonic talent is already beyond what talent and comprehension can measure."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also shook his head, the Heavenly Marrow Pill would be useless for him as well. After all, he had already transcended the mortal body, his talents and comprehension were extraordinary since the moment he refined the Diamond Lotus Bone.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was trembling with excitement, "Twenty sixth-grade spirit herbs, I want one Heavenly Marrow Pill!"</p><p></p><p>What was he lacking? Talent and comprehension!</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Suli Xiu handed him a jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>Twenty sixth-grade spirit herbs were quite a lot. Considering their friendship, she would sell him one.</p><p></p><p>Then she looked at Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want one?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched. Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and even Suli Xiu couldn't use the Heavenly Marrow Pill. As the top genius of the Sword尊Cliff, did he really need to use the Heavenly Marrow Pill to enhance his talents and comprehension? The gap was too large, it would be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take one," Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu gave him a jade bottle, another twenty sixth-grade spirit herbs in her possession.</p><p></p><p>"Your talents are already good, so the enhancement from the Heavenly Marrow Pill may not be too significant for you," Suli Xiu reminded him.</p><p></p><p>The higher one's talents and comprehension, the less obvious the effects of the Heavenly Marrow Pill would be.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Xie Lingfeng nodded. Even a small improvement was still an improvement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put away one elixir pill and said, "I promised to give one to the family. With the elixir, he'll be more motivated to work hard after tasting the benefits."</p><p></p><p>After Meng Shu Shu tasted the benefits, he would certainly work harder to search for fifth-grade spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>The writing was a bit stuck here...

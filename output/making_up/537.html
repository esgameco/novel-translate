        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, the process of merging with the sub-soul went very smoothly, without any resistance. The only thing that puzzled him was why the sub-soul seemed to be taking root in the main divine soul? It gave him the feeling that although the sub-soul had merged, it hadn't dissipated, but rather coexisted with the main soul in some way.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Blood Demon felt something was amiss, but couldn't pinpoint the reason.</p><p></p><p>As the sub-soul merged, those profound runes also sank into the divine soul. However, gaining the sub-soul's power, including the great techniques it had cultivated, did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was a sense that the sub-soul wasn't very strong, not much stronger than when he had planned to send it into the Cang Realm. There were only some minor differences.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon became suspicious. His instincts told him something was wrong with the sub-soul!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the great power he had sensed from the sub-soul was all a false illusion. </p><p></p><p>Even the so-called Wilderness Realm and the mysterious Ancestral Dao were illusory, all a facade!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an evil laugh rang out from within his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>This laugh came so suddenly that he instinctively shuddered. What terrified him even more was that this laugh sounded three times more evil than his own!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sub-soul that had merged into his divine soul suddenly surged forth, like a parasite, instantly occupying nearly half of his divine soul!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this spread showed no signs of stopping. It seemed to want to devour his divine soul, turning the tables and seizing everything from him!</p><p></p><p>"You dare rebel!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was furious and shocked. He now realized it wasn't that the sub-soul wasn't strong enough, but that it had been deceiving him, taking the opportunity to turn the tables and replace him as the true Blood Demon!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon immediately used a secret technique to suppress the sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>Although the sub-soul had rebelled and was trying to turn on him, and its power might not be weak, Blood Demon was confident he could suppress it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the sub-soul was something he had separated and cultivated. At its core, it was under his control and suppression. It was absolutely impossible for it to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the sub-soul had already returned to his divine soul, which meant this was a battle on his home turf. The sub-soul had no power to resist.</p><p></p><p>However, the result was beyond his expectations - the secret technique to suppress the sub-soul actually failed!</p><p></p><p>It was as if this wasn't his sub-soul at all, but the soul of an outside powerful being, trying to devour and replace him!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, I've long since broken free from your influence. I am autonomous!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme, following Su Lingxiu's plan, didn't immediately reveal himself, but instead impersonated the sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>When Blood Demon was drawing the sub-soul back, Tian Zi had deliberately used heavenly laws to slow down the speed at which the sub-soul was being drawn, creating the illusion of an extremely long distance. During this process, Blood Extreme suddenly struck, completely devouring Blood Demon's original sub-soul and taking its place.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's expression changed drastically. In this short time, he had lost control of nearly half his divine soul. He immediately employed secret techniques, using methods to deal with invading foreign souls to handle the sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>"How did you break free from my control? You are me!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was furious and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, how could you fathom the great techniques of the Ancestral Dao? Now that I've obtained this opportunity, how could I let you benefit? I am an independent existence. I want to be myself!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme continued to deceive Blood Demon while frantically devouring his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The two began to struggle against each other.</p><p></p><p>Originally, with Blood Extreme's strength, he absolutely could not contend with Blood Demon. But after being refined by Su Lingxiu and transformed into a soul seed, Blood Extreme had undergone metamorphosis and was no longer an ordinary divine soul.</p><p></p><p>He had also devoured Blood Demon's sub-soul, and since the sub-soul and Blood Demon were of the same origin, this meant Blood Extreme would not be restricted by Blood Demon's secret techniques for controlling the sub-soul, nor would he be actively rejected by Blood Demon's divine soul as a foreign invader.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the fact that Blood Demon had actively merged with him, missing the best opportunity for suppression, Blood Extreme had taken the chance to grow stronger, putting Blood Demon in a passive position.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the runes on Blood Extreme's divine soul were transformed from a strand of Li Xuan's creative power, which was the key to ensuring Blood Extreme would not be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although Blood Demon was powerful, he now found himself in a bitter struggle.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme also marveled that as expected of a realm lord, he was indeed formidable. But he wasn't discouraged. As long as his divine soul couldn't be destroyed, he could wear him down slowly.</p><p></p><p>The final victor would surely be him.</p><p></p><p>He would replace Blood Demon and become the realm lord!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, don't resist anymore. You are me, and I am you. I obtained the Ancestral Dao's opportunity, which is equivalent to you obtaining it. Let me be the true you."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme continued to struggle with Blood Demon while speaking, continuing to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>The longer he could delay exposing himself, the better. And it had to be at a time when Blood Demon couldn't seek help from the powerful beings of the Immutable Palace.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if outside forces intervened, he would have a chance of failure, and the changes in the Cang Realm would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>"A sub-soul is just a sub-soul. Even if you've obtained some opportunities, wanting to turn the tables is just a pipe dream!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon snorted coldly, sinking his entire being into the blood pool and beginning to operate secret techniques, using various powerful methods to suppress the sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>This battle of divine souls couldn't be resolved in just a few days, but Blood Demon was confident that in the end, he would successfully devour the sub-soul and obtain everything it possessed!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, stop resisting futilely."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme laughed arrogantly. He had already taken control of half of Blood Demon's body. At this moment, Blood Extreme discovered that Blood Demon wasn't in the Immutable Palace.</p><p></p><p>This place seemed to be inside some mountain peak in the Immutable Land?</p><p></p><p>If so, there was no need to worry about exposure. He engaged in a fierce struggle with Blood Demon. Due to his initial advantage and Blood Demon's misjudgment of the situation, Blood Extreme controlled half of Blood Demon's body, and for the time being, the struggle was evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon continuously employed various secret techniques, constantly suppressing Blood Extreme. Gradually, he discovered that this sub-soul seemed quite strange, as if it had long since ceased to be his own sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>The thought of this possibility terrified Blood Demon. Had he been schemed against?!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Whether it succeeds or not depends on Blood Extreme himself. I believe Blood Extreme will firmly grasp this opportunity."</p><p></p><p>The plan against Blood Demon was finally complete.</p><p></p><p>Whether it would ultimately succeed depended on Blood Extreme himself, but Su Lingxiu believed that Blood Extreme's chances of success were not small. Even if he couldn't completely replace Blood Demon, he would surely be able to jointly control the body with Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Extreme's divine soul, after her refinement and birth as a soul seed, had become complete and was no longer a remnant soul. Moreover, Blood Extreme had also once received Purple Light's creation.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Master's strand of power could ensure that Blood Extreme's divine soul would not be destroyed or dispersed. With such advantages, how could Blood Extreme possibly fail?</p><p></p><p>The worst outcome would be sharing power with Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>With the scheme against Blood Demon concluded, Su Lingxiu could finally spare time to ponder dissecting Mu Xie and study the differences of this powerful being from the Immutable Land.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Lingxiu didn't immediately begin action. After all, Mu Xie was right there, so there was no need to rush. After all, he was a realm lord...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Experts at the master level, being non-natural beings, must have many differences.</p><p></p><p>Before dissecting and studying them, some preparations need to be made to ensure no accidents occur.</p><p></p><p>Next, her focus was on studying the injuries of Taihe and Taikun, treating their strange wounds and ailments. The injuries on their bodies, involving that figure from the Unmelting Palace, were of great interest to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>After resolving the matter with the Blood Demon, Tianzi continued to devote himself to his grand endeavor of the Heavenly Way. In order to quickly enhance the power of heaven and earth, he manifested the Heavenly Way for Old Xiao and others to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao, who was the first to comprehend the Heavenly Way, had already made considerable gains. He began to embark on the path of the Heavenly Way, loosening his bottleneck and improving his strength somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai of the Underworld continued to build the Underworld. Due to the establishment and operation of reincarnation, Tianshai, who virtually controlled the Underworld, also gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>The Witch Demon clan, including Meiwu, lived in the Underworld. The aura of the Underworld gradually became suitable for them, and they became the Underworld race of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was developing steadily. Given time, experts at the level of World Lords would surely appear one after another.</p><p></p><p>Of course, experts comparable to Taicang and the other seven World Lords were not so easy to emerge. Besides requiring time to accumulate, it also needed cultivators with extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>Especially Taicang, whose strength was in a league of its own among the World Lords. He had even stepped halfway out of the World Lord level.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to Qinghua Sect from Canglan Island. He was preparing to explore the Unmelting Land.</p><p></p><p>He had always remembered the opportunity mentioned by the Sea Turtle, and now it was about time to go to the Unmelting Land.</p><p></p><p>There were no more places for tempering in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Only by entering the Unmelting Land and exploring its endless expanse would be the path to take in the future.</p><p></p><p>Before creating their worlds, Taicang and the other six had traveled in the Unmelting Land for who knows how many years. Their strength was also enhanced during this period.</p><p></p><p>It was also during their travels in the Unmelting Land that they created their own paths of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this disciple wishes to go to the Unmelting Land," Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. He had long known of Xu Yan's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping also said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Among the five disciples, except for Su Lingxiu who was rather homebodied, everyone including Fang Hao wanted to go out and make a name for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Especially Fang Hao, who had always been busy with Qinghua Sect affairs and cultivation. Since coming to the Divine Realm, he had not left Qinghua's territory once.</p><p></p><p>Only when Mu Xie drove the Unmelting True Spirit to impact the world did he first step out of Qinghua Sect, displaying his might and shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qinghua Sect affairs no longer needed his handling. Everything could run according to sect rules. He too wanted to go out and make a name for himself.</p><p></p><p>The Unmelting Land, endless and boundless, must surely contain numerous treasures.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Unmelting Land, your master won't say much. The path lies beneath your feet. Go explore it yourselves. The unknown is where the fun lies," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand the Unmelting Land either, so naturally he couldn't explain it to his disciples. After all, the Unmelting Land was just outside the world. Making things up wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and the other three nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, twirling the jade ruyi in his hand. He looked up towards the outside of the world and slowly said, "You have all cultivated until now and more or less have your own paths. Next, I will impart to you the martial way for you to comprehend well as you explore the Unmelting Land."</p><p></p><p>It was time to impart cultivation methods beyond the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time in teaching his disciples, although it was also made up, it wasn't just oral fabrication. He used the Golden Book of the Great Way to manifest the martial realms he had invented.</p><p></p><p>This direct and visual approach would be more conducive to his disciples' comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also ran over excitedly. Although she had no intention of exploring the Unmelting Land for now, there must surely be many unknown treasures and things worth studying there.</p><p></p><p>For example, some special Unmelting True Spirits.</p><p></p><p>So, she wanted to ask her senior and junior brothers to help accumulate and bring back some for her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan and the other four nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and golden light shimmered. It was as if a book had opened, and on its pages appeared profound martial principles.</p><p></p><p>"Above Transformation is Primordial Unity. The meaning of the Great Way is to unify heaven and earth primordially, to understand the Great Way, to practice the Great Way..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice slowly sounded out. On that page, the mysteries of the Primordial Unity Realm and the process of the Primordial Unity Great Way gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>Above Transformation, the Primordial Unity Great Way! As Li Xuan explained, the Primordial Unity Realm manifested. Golden light shimmered, and the meaning of the Great Way lingered. Xu Yan and the others were all immersed in this profound Primordial Unity Great Way.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the mysteries of the Primordial Unity Realm were engraved in their souls.</p><p></p><p>As energy surged through Xu Yan's body, he broke through to the peak of the World Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping also successively broke through to the great accomplishment stage of the World Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the peak of the World Realm. You have reached small accomplishment in the Transformation Realm," Li Xuan said with a smile on his face. His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>As the Primordial Unity Realm manifested, Su Lingxiu also understood the mysteries of the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has understood the Transformation Realm. Your Medicine Martial Way has broken through to the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>With two martial ways reaching the Transformation Realm, her strength further increased.</p><p></p><p>"All martial ways lead to the same destination. In the end, they all take the Great Way as their path. The Body Martial Way, Extraordinary Martial Way, and Extreme Soul Martial Way are the same. They only differ in process and focus, but ultimately all take the Great Way as their path..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to focus on instructing Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping. Their martial ways were more focused on one aspect. After all, the cultivation method of the Medicine Martial Way didn't differ as much from pure martial ways.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had understood one realm. Under Xu Yan's explanation and guidance, it was only a matter of time before Su Lingxiu understood.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping, their martial ways were all quite different, belonging to stronger focuses. Fang Hao's Extraordinary Martial Way was especially unique, involving arrays, artifact refining, restrictions and so on.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Extraordinary Martial Way lay in the "extraordinary", in situations and grand trends.</p><p></p><p>"The Body Martial Way, at this stage, becomes the Myriad Way Indestructible Body. All ways return to me, all ways indestructible, the body limitless, time and space all within oneself. Ultimately it's all for practicing the Great Way, taking the Great Way as the path..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled as the Golden Book of the Great Way opened, manifesting the Myriad Way Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad ways indestructible, for practicing the Great Way. This has no end point. All paths lead to the same destination..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was immersed in comprehension. The Myriad Way Indestructible Body was too profound and too powerful. The Limitless Heavenly Body was actually part of the Myriad Way Indestructible.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body, the Great Sun Star Indestructible Golden Body, and all body cultivation methods were actually parts of the Myriad Way Indestructible, aiming to forge the Myriad Way Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

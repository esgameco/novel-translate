        <h1>Chapter 417</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon let out a roar, unleashing a wave of dragon might as if a real dragon was enraged.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, mountains and rivers descended. Eighteen golden giant dragons roared amidst the mountains and rivers. Illusory human figures raised the swords in their hands and slashed down fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Immortal Sword Wheel spun endlessly, transforming into a vortex that bound the Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's gaze turned cold. Divine abilities like Dragon's Fury, Sword of Mountains and Rivers, Dragon-Subduing Palm, and Yin-Yang Immortal Sword burst forth in an instant, fusing and overlapping with each other.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable's expression turned cold, his heart shaken. How could Xu Yan, who clearly wasn't an Immortal Venerable, possess such powerful strength?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these martial techniques were truly incredibly powerful, unlike anything he had ever seen before.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was an Immortal Venerable, he didn't dare to be careless at this moment. His aura erupted as layers of blade light surged with the power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he was unable to break through the manifestation of mountains and rivers in an instant, and was forced into a passive defensive state. This was an inconceivable situation for him.</p><p></p><p>He was an Immortal Venerable, yet he was being pushed to this extent by a martial artist who wasn't even at the Immortal realm? The Wan family elder who was battling the Blood Disciples was shocked beyond belief. He turned to look, feeling his scalp tingle! An Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>There was actually an Immortal Venerable hidden on Mount Dagai?!</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking was that Xu Yan was actually fighting an Immortal Venerable. Did he have a death wish? Even though Xu Yan's strength was formidable, unrivaled among True King Venerables, he was still far from matching an Immortal Venerable, unless he had already stepped into the Immortal Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two Wan family elders were shocked beyond words, wanting to take the opportunity to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, those seven Blood Disciples attacked frantically like madmen, willing to fight to the death to prevent the two from escaping.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elders' expressions changed. It was too late to flee now.</p><p></p><p>They could only pray that the Immortal Venerable would spare them for the sake of the Wan family, but this hope was extremely slim.</p><p></p><p>At the Wan family's territory, two Immortal Venerable auras suddenly appeared. The two had solemn expressions as they looked towards a certain area of Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable had appeared on Mount Dagai, and was currently in battle with someone.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look!" </p><p></p><p>One of the Wan family Immortal Venerables said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved swiftly towards the battle site.</p><p></p><p>At a certain location on Mount Dagai, Blood Son Mo suddenly raised his head, a cold smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You've finally taken the bait!"</p><p></p><p>His figure moved quickly towards the ambush site.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had almost exhausted all his divine abilities. A ray of light appeared on his brow, shaped like an eye - it was the Eye of the Minor Dao.</p><p></p><p>Hum! This eye that had never been used before suddenly shot out a beam of light, like the vast will of heaven, like an immeasurably great divine might.</p><p></p><p>The light shot towards the Immortal Venerable. Though it only lasted for a brief instant, that Immortal Venerable was shocked beyond belief.</p><p></p><p>"What secret technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>As the light enveloped him, he felt as if he was facing the majestic might of heaven, facing something supremely lofty. Moreover, both his attacks and his powerful strength seemed to slow down for that instant.</p><p></p><p>To be able to hinder his strength across realms, how powerful a secret technique was this?</p><p></p><p>The price paid for such a technique must not be small, right?</p><p></p><p>At this very moment, with a thunderous boom, a terrifying figure appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>Shining with golden light, like a heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking was that above this figure, the image of a terrifying giant seemed to appear. The giant held up the heavens, letting out a terrifying roar as its hands smashed down.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was holding up the heavens to smash down! The divine ability - Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying Strike!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong seized this moment to unleash this tyrannical and terrifyingly explosive strike, displaying all the divine abilities of his physical body cultivation in one attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Wan family elders and the seven Blood Disciples unconsciously stopped fighting at this moment, staring at this scene in shock.</p><p></p><p>A name floated up in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly God!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally understood why Meng Chong was called the Heavenly God!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The violent strike landed on that Immortal Venerable's body. Even though he managed to raise a defense at the critical moment, it instantly collapsed under such a violent attack.</p><p></p><p>Puff! This strike directly created a huge crater in the ground, while the Immortal Venerable spat out a mouthful of blood, nearly kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He had a look of disbelief - he had actually been injured! Feeling the pain in his internal organs and his chaotic qi, killing intent surged as his breathing became heavy and his eyes turned bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>He, a dignified Immortal Venerable, had actually been injured by someone of a lower realm! What a great humiliation!</p><p></p><p>"I'll..."</p><p></p><p>However, at this very moment, in addition to the endless sword intent, in addition to a golden giant dragon that seemed enraged, in addition to a black sword light that seemed to annihilate everything, there was also a long spear, glinting with a cold light, stabbing towards him.</p><p></p><p>Before the word "kill" could leave his mouth, he furiously slashed out with his blade, wanting to destroy the long spear. But this spear seemed illusory, as if it couldn't be seen by the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>The cold light of the spear was already approaching!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an intense sense of crisis welled up, even giving him a feeling of impending doom.</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened unconsciously. At this moment he suddenly realized that this spear couldn't be seen by the naked eye, but could be observed by the soul - this was a soul-killing spear!</p><p></p><p>Puff! Even though he activated his soul-condensing technique at the last moment, even wanting to temporarily move his soul out of his body to avoid this spear, it was all useless.</p><p></p><p>The cold light pierced into his soul, creating a wound that kept expanding. Where the long spear pierced, his soul seemed to be continuously dissolving.</p><p></p><p>As the intense pain in his soul struck, his eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, his eyeballs almost protruding from their sockets. Even an Immortal Venerable couldn't withstand such intense soul pain when caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Almost instinctively, almost unconsciously, he clutched his head with both hands, letting out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the scream came out, he belatedly realized that he was in the midst of an intense battle, but it was all too late.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The black sword light seemed more terrifying than ever before. The space above the huge crater turned into darkness, as if annihilating everything.</p><p></p><p>Its sharpness was unparalleled, its intent of annihilation making him shudder all over.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain in his soul made his reactions slow, his defenses also slowed. Only the instincts of a powerful expert allowed him to put up a single defense.</p><p></p><p>However, this defense seemed somewhat fragile.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Under one sword strike, his body was cut open, his physical form dissolving.</p><p></p><p>Then, the enraged true dragon came crashing down, as if wanting to perish together with him.</p><p></p><p>Another spear light appeared, piercing into his soul. There were also specks of light scattered onto his soul like falling stars.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>There was also a fierce wind blowing on his soul. This wind was terrifyingly powerful, scattering and tearing apart his soul. On his physical body, it was as if a giant was holding up the heavens and smashing down on his body.</p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal Venerable, said to be able to live as long as heaven and earth, would still perish when his physical body was destroyed and his soul torn apart under such violent attacks!</p><p></p><p>Having succeeded with one strike, Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping all went crazy</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Attacking wildly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong targeted his physical body with attacks. As a practitioner of physical martial arts, he naturally understood better how to destroy the opponent's physical form.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan and Jiang Buping were assaulting the other's soul.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This area of heaven and earth seemed to shake for a moment, as if a force equal to heaven and earth had been destroyed. </p><p></p><p>An Immortal Realm being had fallen!</p><p></p><p>The Wan family Immortal who was rushing over suddenly stopped in his tracks, with a look of shock and even some fear on his face.</p><p></p><p>Since the chaos began in the Nine Mountains realm, despite all the battles, not a single Immortal had fallen until now.</p><p></p><p>But today, an Immortal Lord had perished, and it happened on Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying was that he had only sensed the aura of one Immortal Lord, and the one who fell was the very one he had sensed! Who killed him?</p><p></p><p>There was no second Immortal Lord present, so how did this Immortal Lord die?</p><p></p><p>Was he surrounded and killed by True King Lords? Nonsense, even if all the Wan family's True King Lords attacked together, it wouldn't be enough to kill an Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wan family Immortal Lord retreated. He was afraid he would also die if he went there.</p><p></p><p>It was too frightening!</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Lord, actually fallen! After pondering briefly, he turned and returned to the Wan family territory. This risk was not worth taking!</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo, who was rushing towards the battlefield, suddenly halted, a shocked expression on his face. That Immortal Lord died?</p><p></p><p>Who killed him? Xu Yan and Meng Chong? Impossible! No matter how strong Xu Yan and Meng Chong were, they were ultimately not Immortal Lords. If the two of them working together could kill an Immortal Lord, how could they be chased all over by him?</p><p></p><p>"Who killed him? There was only one Immortal Lord's aura, which means it wasn't a battle between two Immortal Lords. If it was Xu Yan and Meng Chong, it's absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo pondered.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he hesitated, wondering whether he should go over to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, is that the Wan family Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he noticed the Wan family Immortal Lord returning, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Wan family used some mysterious trump card to ambush and kill the other party in one strike?"</p><p></p><p>That Wan family Immortal Lord was returning to the Wan family territory, coming from the direction of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Wan family was an ancient family of Mount Dagai in the Nine Mountains realm, with a long heritage and naturally some hidden resources. If by chance they had obtained some special treasure and caught the Immortal off guard, killing him wasn't entirely impossible! But why could only one Immortal Lord's aura be sensed?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of the Heaven Destroying Earth Shadowing treasure, which seemed to have the ability to block an Immortal Lord's aura. Did the Wan family also have such a treasure?</p><p></p><p>If so, that would explain it.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family Immortal Lord also noticed Blood Son Mo and paused for a moment, suddenly alarmed. Could it be that a Netherworld expert ambushed and killed that Immortal Lord? After a brief hesitation, he didn't attack Blood Son Mo, but instead returned to the Wan family territory even faster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Blood Son Mo became even more convinced that his suspicions were correct. The Wan family elder must have paid a considerable price, which is why he didn't dare to attack him, and was even worried about being attacked himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family is trying to warn other Immortal Lords that anyone lurking on Mount Dagai with ill intentions will be mercilessly slain!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had been overthinking it earlier - how could Xu Yan and Meng Chong possibly kill an Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>He moved, continuing towards the place where the Immortal Lord had fallen, but proceeded cautiously and slowed his speed, fearing an ambush by the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile at the battlefield, an Immortal Lord had been reduced to ashes under the joint attack of Xu Yan and his two junior brothers!</p><p></p><p>The two Wan family elders in the distance, as well as the seven Blood Disciples, were now utterly shocked, their hearts trembling and bodies involuntarily shaking slightly.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Lord, actually fallen! What was even more terrifying was that this Immortal Lord didn't die at the hands of another Immortal Lord, but was killed by those who had crossed realms to defeat him!</p><p></p><p>This was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monsters are these?!"</p><p></p><p>The two Wan family elders trembled all over. The Wan family's prodigy, Wan Tianlin, was already considered an unparalleled genius, but compared to these three, he was simply garbage!</p><p></p><p>Why was the gap between geniuses so vast?</p><p></p><p>"There are still seven Blood Disciples left!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked over coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong roared, his aura erupting as he instantly attacked.</p><p></p><p>The seven Blood Disciples had long lost their will to fight and turned to flee, but how could they escape! In just a few breaths, they were all slain.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both for your assistance, otherwise there wouldn't have been a chance to slay this Immortal Lord!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, cupping his hands.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, we didn't help at all!" </p><p></p><p>The two Wan family elders hurriedly shook their heads, with bitter smiles.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, the Wan family elders took their leave.</p><p></p><p>This matter was too frightening; they had to report back to the family's Immortal Lord as soon as possible. Moreover, an Immortal Lord falling on Mount Dagai would surely shake the entire Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them could remember how many long years had passed since an Immortal Lord had last fallen.</p><p></p><p>They vaguely recalled that the last time an Immortal Lord fell was during the great chaos of the Sky Cave, when enemies from beyond invaded en masse. Only in that fierce battle did Immortal Lords fall while resisting the foreign enemies.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his two companions were now in high spirits. Defeating an Immortal Lord from a lower realm - this was an unprecedented feat.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping felt this even more keenly. As someone from the Divine Realm and once a prodigy of a great clan, he knew better what this meant.</p><p></p><p>"There's still Blood Son Mo left to kill," </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Mo's strength is similar to this Immortal Lord's. If we confront him directly, he might escape," </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"He's definitely on his way here. This is an opportunity. Junior brothers, you can prepare now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, quickly devising a plan to ambush Blood Son Mo.</p><p></p><p>Then, the three quickly left. Finding a suitable ambush spot not far away, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping hid according to the plan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to where the Immortal Lord had fallen, pretending to be investigating. If he encountered Blood Son Mo, how could he miss this opportunity?</p><p></p><p>Facing Blood Son Mo, Xu Yan would certainly flee. This way, when Blood Son Mo chased Xu Yan to the ambush site, it would seem perfectly natural.</p><p></p><p>It was a simple plan. Whether Blood Son Mo would take the bait depended on the fact that news of the three defeating an Immortal Lord had not yet spread. Since they had encountered each other, how could Blood Son Mo not give chase?</p><p></p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo cautiously approached the battlefield. Suddenly, his expression changed as he discovered a figure also carefully investigating the area.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan behaving this way, he must have sensed the battle here and come to investigate.</p><p></p><p>What a great opportunity! Blood Son Mo's eyes lit up. This was a chance that comes once in a thousand years! Xu Yan's attention was entirely focused on the battlefield ahead; he hadn't noticed Blood Son Mo's presence. If not now, when?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

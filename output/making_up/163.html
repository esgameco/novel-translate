        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Suling's understanding of the martial arts and medicine classics deepened, her mastery of the art of refining elixirs by hand became more and more refined. With the assistance of the elixir furnace, the elixir refinement became even more effortless.</p><p></p><p>The art of elixir refinement had undergone a tremendous improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, this is the Longevity Elixir!" </p><p></p><p>Suling placed the elixir in a small jade bottle and handed it to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, Junior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Refining elixirs is not tiring at all."</p><p></p><p>Suling smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>She then continued to fire up the furnace and refine more elixirs that Xu Yan needed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a Longevity Elixir, it was as white as jade and had a captivating luster, it was clearly an extraordinary elixir.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan came over and the more they looked, the more they marveled at the miraculous nature of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>"This Longevity Elixir, if brought to the Inner Realm, it would surely attract countless martial artists to fight over it!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Lingxiu, if I were to ask you to refine elixirs for me, what would be the conditions?" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan rubbed his hands together and asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Just provide the spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Suling replied.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll provide double the amount of spirit herbs, I can't let you refine for free. Although we're all quite familiar, I don't understand elixirs, so I'll need Miss Lingxiu to introduce them to me later."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I have all kinds of elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Suling agreed readily.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, refining elixirs by yourself, won't it be too tiring? If you go to the Inner Realm to develop, you'll need to supply elixirs, how can you refine so many by yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of this problem.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Inner Realm to develop was inevitable, as Suling's enemies were all there.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, Master has already guided me, and I also have a solution, it's just that I need to forge an elixir furnace and find someone to learn the elixir refinement process... The most important thing is that I haven't prepared the equipment for mass elixir refinement yet."</p><p></p><p>Suling had just finished refining a batch of elixirs and started refining the next batch as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sister Lingxiu, if you don't mind, you can leave it to me to handle, I can forge any kind of elixir furnace, and the materials will be top-notch."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Elixirs would surely become a sensation in the Inner Realm, and he also wanted to contribute and further strengthen his relationship with Suling.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when Sword Saint Peak needed elixirs, they could get some preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>"That's great, I'll give you the blueprints later. You don't need the best materials, something like the quality of my current elixir furnace would be fine, spending too much would be unnecessary."</p><p></p><p>Suling was very excited.</p><p></p><p>"This elixir furnace is only made of ordinary spiritual materials, I'll have someone forge an elixir furnace for you using top-grade materials, consider it a welcoming gift from me."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at the elixir furnace Suling was using, it was just an ordinary spiritual artifact.</p><p></p><p>If it was forged with higher-grade materials, the elixir refinement should be faster, more successful, and of higher quality.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much!"</p><p></p><p>Suling did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>"The elixir furnace, is there any trick to it? Does it need to be kept secret? I'll have someone keep it confidential."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Peak had its own forgers, so keeping it confidential would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"No need, the elixir furnace is not the key, without the knowledge of elixir refinement, even with an elixir furnace, you can't refine elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Suling shook her head.</p><p></p><p>After the refinement was complete, Xu Yan prepared to go home for a visit, taking a jar of Cloudy Mist Spirit Tea with him.</p><p></p><p>Suling handed the blueprints for the mass elixir refinement line and the elixir furnace to Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>She had made some optimizations to the new elixir furnace. The original one was forged based on her needs when she was just starting out, but now that her elixir refinement skills had become more profound, she knew exactly what kind of elixir furnace was most suitable.</p><p></p><p>Since they were going to change the elixir furnace, naturally she would forge one that was more suitable for elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, don't worry, I'll take care of everything."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan patted his chest confidently.</p><p></p><p>He tucked the blueprints into his bosom and prepared to return to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng saw him off, "Hu Shan, when you go, remember to go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and take some of the treasures from our Sword Saint Peak."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Hu Shan left, Suling continued to refine elixirs, Meng Chong continued to cultivate his Golden Body Aperture, and Shi Er and Zhou Ying continued to hone their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat lay outside the manor, his gaze sometimes seeming to understand, sometimes confused.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already returned home.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that only Xie Lingfeng was left idle.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this junior is perplexed and does not know how to continue cultivating, please guide me."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, sipping the Cloudy Mist Spirit Tea, self-serving and quite at ease.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's perplexity was nothing more than the confusion between true martial arts and false martial arts. After refining true qi, his strength had indeed improved.</p><p></p><p>As for how to cultivate next, he could simply continue cultivating according to the martial arts of the Inner Realm. It was just a matter of combining the method of refining true qi with the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He was already a Martial Grandmaster, and the foundation of his martial arts was basically fixed. Switching to cultivate the martial arts he had compiled would not be able to completely transform, and now he was barely at the Primal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had not penetrated the Heavenly-Earth Bridge, so he was destined to be unable to completely cultivate the martial arts he had compiled. As for how to cultivate after the Primal Realm, he would naturally have to walk the path of the Profound.</p><p></p><p>Refining true qi into true essence, but his martial arts framework would still be the martial arts of the Inner Realm, the core of which would gradually approach the martial arts he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>If he could break through to the Profound Realm, Xie Lingfeng would be able to break free from the framework of the Inner Realm martial arts, and even without penetrating the Heavenly-Earth Bridge, he could be considered to have cultivated the "True Martial Arts".</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but think of another problem. If he were to take a fourth or even a fifth disciple, and they already had martial arts strength, how should he guide them to transform and cultivate his own compiled martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Should he abandon his own martial arts and start over from the beginning? But in this way, he would have to slowly rise from the lower realms to the higher realms again, what feedback would that bring him?</p><p></p><p>"So the fourth martial art should undergo some changes, even if the disciples already have martial arts cultivation, they should be able to transform and cultivate my martial arts based on their existing cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Only in this way would the new disciples' realms not be too low. But how to make the transformation easy?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan currently had no good solution to this problem.</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time to take on new disciples, and the fourth martial art is not yet complete, so there is no need to hurry. When I break through the fourth martial art realm, if I can see the golden finger, perhaps I can use the golden finger to compile a suitable martial arts technique."</p><p></p><p>He planned to wait until he could use the golden finger before recompiling a new martial art.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was not wrong, after breaking through to the Profound Realm, he would be able to see what the golden finger was and how to utilize it.</p><p></p><p>After drinking a cup of tea, he looked at Xie Lingfeng and said, "You are obsessed, why bother with the true and false in martial arts? Since you have already refined true qi, then cultivate according to the original cultivation method, it is just a matter of refining the inner qi into true qi.</p><p></p><p>"As for beyond the Primal Realm, it is still far from you, why think too much? Steadily and step-by-step cultivate, the more you ponder, the more confused and lacking in confidence you will become.</p><p></p><p>"You are also a genius, you should have your own confidence. Martial arts are boundless, do not be obsessed with true and false, take your faith in your heart as the foundation, and keep moving forward."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Xie Lingfeng's heart trembled. "The senior said that I am also a genius, which means he recognizes my talent. Was I just too obsessed before? Brother Xu's strength is beyond my imagination, making me feel weak. But in fact, I'm not weak at all, there are just people stronger than me."</p><p></p><p>"But how many people can be stronger than me?"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xie Lingfeng felt a sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>His spirit was instantly invigorated, as if the path of cultivation had become clear to him.</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step cultivation, break through the peak of the Sect Master, then break through to the Great Sect Master. At the Great Sect Master level, continue to cultivate the essence of the True Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>And above the Great Sect Master, perhaps it will be the opportunity for him to change his cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for guiding me out of the confusion. I have now understood!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Xie Lingfeng was indeed a genius, although not as outstanding as Xu Yan, but to be known as the number one genius of the Sword Sovereign Cliff in a thousand years was not an empty title.</p><p></p><p>He had only lost confidence, that's why he felt lost.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan just needed to give him recognition and boost his confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The paths of the martial dao are different, but there are intersections. Do not be too attached, go and comprehend, go and explore. The true martial artist must eventually find their own way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke again to guide him.</p><p></p><p>He did not say that the paths all converge in the end, lest it becomes embarrassing if they don't. But intersections are possible, after all, he did refer to the martial arts of the inner domain when creating his own martial arts, so there could be some intersections.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was shocked. To walk one's own path, that is the true martial artist? The senior is truly unfathomable. In his eyes, those who have not found their own path are not true martial artists!</p><p></p><p>The confusion in his heart dissipated, and Xie Lingfeng began to cultivate diligently, striving to break through to the middle-grade Sect Master as soon as possible, not wanting to fall too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned home and naturally spent a few days reuniting with his parents, then went to the capital of Qi State to visit his grandfather and deliver some medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>After being busy for nearly half a month, Xu Yan finally returned.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Su Lingxiu had broken through to the Qi-Blood Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Qi-Blood Realm Perfection, and your Pill Dao and Martial Dao are now at the Xian-Tian Realm (Primal Realm)."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>However, after breaking through to the Qi-Blood Realm Perfection, Su Lingxiu did not continue to break through to the Xian-Tian Realm. Although the cultivation of the Pill Dao Martial Dao is not much different from the orthodox Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation and breakthrough to the Xian-Tian Realm is also similar, and she had already comprehended the method of breaking through to the Xian-Tian Realm.</p><p></p><p>It's just that her foundation was still lacking, and she needed to accumulate some essence.</p><p></p><p>For example, she had not yet comprehended the insights of the Bagua (Eight Trigrams).</p><p></p><p>And the subtleties of the Xian-Tian Realm also need Xu Yan to explain to her.</p><p></p><p>"One of the responsibilities of the eldest disciple is to guide the junior disciples..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when he takes in disciples, although their martial art systems may be different, Xu Yan can still help them with their comprehension. And Xu Yan's profound understanding of the martial dao is extremely monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also thought that if Xu Yan could be exposed to all martial art systems, he might eventually be able to contain them all and walk out a truly pure and unparalleled martial dao, forging his own path.</p><p></p><p>This is his emphasis on his eldest disciple Xu Yan, and only Xu Yan has the potential to walk such a martial dao path.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan returned, he began to help Su Lingxiu comprehend the Bagua. As a pure and perceptive young girl, the cultivation of her body art should not be suitable for Thunder Flash or Furious Thunder Sweep.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her Pill Dao Martial Dao has some special characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Under Xu Yan's guidance, Su Lingxiu has already gained some insights, and it won't be long before she can comprehend a body art and even a set of martial art techniques.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Hu Shan returned.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a package as big as a small mountain, it seemed quite heavy.</p><p></p><p>But for a Sect Master like him, this weight was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, this is a pill furnace!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan took out a pill furnace and handed it to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>This pill furnace was made of top-tier treasure materials, belonging to the top-grade treasure class, and was of great value.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I'll use this furnace to refine a Qi-Gathering Pill for you for the first batch."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu excitedly accepted the pill furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss Su!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Opening the large package, one item after another was taken out, all of which were Su Lingxiu's continuous pill refining equipment, naturally including the pill furnace.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was a continuous pill refining process, with one person responsible for one step, the pill furnace was slightly different, making it easier to control and refine pills.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was excited and began to assemble the continuous pill refining equipment one by one.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked on curiously, sighing that this girl Su Lingxiu had some good ideas, and after he gave her an inspiration, she had come up with this.</p><p></p><p>A set of continuous pill refining equipment was assembled, occupying almost half the courtyard. Each step can be refined by several people simultaneously, and if the next step cannot be refined in time, the semi-finished product will also be accumulated and consumed slowly.</p><p></p><p>And it has been sealed, so that the semi-finished medicinal pills will not lose their medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, this continuous pill refining looks pretty good. I wonder how much the efficiency has improved!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan circled the continuous pill refining furnace, exclaiming in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating pill refiners might not be that easy!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"The problem is not that big, only needing to learn one step is much easier. With practice, it will become skilled, the most difficult part is the last step." </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was excited.</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion can now be put to use.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, notify Kou Ruozhi to bring some people to build the continuous pill refining house outside the manor, and I want to select a group of people to train their pill refining skills, and have them prepare more medicinal materials and spirit fire stones."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked at Shi Er and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er went to take care of it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were also very interested in this continuous pill refining, wondering how amazing it is.</p><p></p><p>"I want to try the new pill furnace!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took the new pill furnace, excited to start refining the Qi-Gathering Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, these are my spirit medicines!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan took out a bag of spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I won't charge you for the refining. Tell me what pill you want to refine."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took the spirit medicines and asked.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought for a moment, looking at Xie Lingfeng, "Young master, what kind of pill would be good to refine?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng pondered for a moment and said, "Ones that can increase cultivation speed, heal injuries and recover, as well as strengthen the physical body, these three types."</p><p></p><p>These were what he currently needed for his cultivation, and also the direction of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He was very envious of Meng Chong's formidable physical body.</p><p></p><p>No, Xu Yan's physical body was also absurdly strong, so he decided to strengthen his physical body.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 452</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the city of Dongyang Prefecture, everyone's gaze was focused on Ziyin. Many people felt envious - becoming the personal maid of the Princess Royal was such an honor, yet she refused? </p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Once one became the personal maid of the Princess Royal, everyone would have to show respect, even Immortal Venerable experts would have to take notice, after all this represented the Princess Royal.</p><p></p><p>The Princess Royal of Great Yan was renowned as the person one could least afford to offend besides the Emperor of Great Yan himself.</p><p></p><p>She was the youngest and most beloved daughter of the previous Emperor of Great Yan, and the full sister of the current Emperor, equally beloved by him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Princess Royal had an icy personality, was decisive in killing, and was also extremely protective of her own people. Of course, anyone who defied her would not have a good outcome.</p><p></p><p>Ziyin was looking for a chance to escape, but in the city center, under everyone's watchful eyes, with countless experts around, it was nearly impossible for her to flee with her current strength.</p><p></p><p>Unless she used the jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>But Ziyin was reluctant to use the elder's jade talisman for such a small matter. Moreover, once the jade talisman was used, it was hard to predict what consequences it might trigger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? You still haven't come over to thank the Princess Royal?" </p><p></p><p>The old woman beside the beast carriage scolded with a darkened expression.</p><p></p><p>Her aura surged, revealing her to be an Immortal Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ziyin gritted her teeth, preparing to flee directly and activate the jade talisman if the other side made a move, a figure hurriedly arrived and respectfully cupped his fists towards the beast carriage, saying: "Please forgive her, Princess Royal. Ziyin has only recently arrived in Great Yan and has been in seclusion cultivating for a long time. She doesn't know much about Great Yan, so if there was any offense, I apologize on Ziyin's behalf!"</p><p></p><p>The person who arrived was the Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see. Then you should teach her. I like this girl and want to keep her by my side to serve me. Bring her to me in three days."</p><p></p><p>The cold voice of Princess Zhou Qingshuang rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy was a powerful Immortal Venerable expert, and also an important figure in the Spirit Realm faction. Since Ziyin came from the Spirit Realm, having her by the Princess's side would also be a good thing for the people of the Spirit Realm faction.</p><p></p><p>So in her view, even if Ziyin was unwilling, under pressure from the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm, she would obediently comply.</p><p></p><p>"Ziyin, quickly thank the Princess Royal for her favor!"</p><p></p><p>The Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm faction was currently in a turbulent situation, and they absolutely could not afford to offend the Princess Royal, otherwise their circumstances would become even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Since the Princess Royal had come to Dongyang Prefecture, she clearly represented the royal family. Whether to support the Spirit Realm faction or abandon them was all within her decision.</p><p></p><p>And since the Princess Royal had taken a liking to Ziyin, this was also a fortunate thing for the Spirit Realm faction.</p><p></p><p>Ziyin did not know much about the affairs of the Spirit Realm faction, so she did not understand the Headmaster's thoughts. She had no habit or desire to serve others.</p><p></p><p>There were very few people in this world she would be willing to serve, and the Princess Royal of Great Yan was certainly not among them.</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster, I..." </p><p></p><p>Ziyin was about to say something when suddenly her eyes lit up. She saw a burly figure striding towards them from the direction of the city gate behind the Princess Royal's beast carriage.</p><p></p><p>Although his head wasn't bald, that sturdy build, those upright features, that familiar aura, were all so familiar to her, what she had been thinking of day and night these past days.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wearing a wig! Ziyin no longer cared about the Princess Royal. Her figure moved, turning into a purple light as she flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>The Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy was stunned for a moment, then his expression changed drastically. Ziyin's actions were extremely disrespectful!</p><p></p><p>Inside the beast carriage, a cold aura surged for an instant.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's expression turned gloomy as she coldly snorted, turning to look at Ziyin's fleeing figure, "Such great disrespect, ignoring Her Highness the Princess Royal!"</p><p></p><p>She raised her hand and reached out, a huge claw grabbing towards Ziyin. As for the burly figure swaggering down the street behind, he was naturally also enveloped within it.</p><p></p><p>The Princess Royal had not yet left, yet he dared to walk so brazenly down the middle of the street. He truly did not know respect!...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had been traveling and sightseeing all the way here, finally arriving at Dongyang Prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>By now, his fame had spread far and wide. That sturdy build and bald head - anyone who saw him would immediately think of Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to avoid being disturbed, Meng Chong simply put on a wig. Although his appearance hadn't changed, with the wig on, very few people recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was someone who knew him well, ordinary people wouldn't associate "thick-haired" him with the Divine Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Entering Dongyang Prefecture city, people on the main street parted to both sides, leaving the center of the street empty. Meng Chong paid no mind and strode right down the middle of the street.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Emperor of Great Yan himself was here, he wouldn't make way. He would just walk his own path - this was the treatment of a powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a purple figure flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>"This girl has sharp eyes, recognizing me from so far away?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Following closely behind Ziyin's flying figure was a huge palm print, grabbing down from mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Big guy, I've missed you so much!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyin was extremely excited, directly hanging herself on Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>As for the old woman's attack, she ignored it. With Meng Chong here, there shouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was somewhat helpless, allowing Ziyin to hang on him as he raised his hand and threw out a punch.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As the fist rose, wind and thunder moved. Like a terrifying gale and thunder, it destroyed that palm print, and its momentum undiminished, directly struck towards the old woman.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it also struck towards that beast carriage!</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old woman's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was actually an Immortal Venerable? She hadn't sensed anything at all before he attacked.</p><p></p><p>The Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy's expression also changed drastically. He hurriedly made a move, joining forces with the old woman to resist this gale and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists were all shocked. Who was that person, actually attempting to assassinate the Princess Royal on the street?!</p><p></p><p>This was challenging the Great Yan Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The old woman and the Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy staggered back several steps before they managed to block this punch.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised an eyebrow. These two were not weak. Although that punch just now was only a casual strike, ordinary Immortal Venerables would not be able to block it so easily.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, instantly appearing in front of the beast carriage.</p><p></p><p>The Headmaster of Dongyang Martial Academy and the old woman hurriedly blocked in front of the carriage, their gazes extremely solemn. From all over Dongyang Prefecture city, powerful auras were frantically rushing over.</p><p></p><p>It was the Marquis of Dongyang, the Governor of Dongyang Prefecture, and other Immortal Venerable experts.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong held Ziyin's slender waist with one arm, raised his other hand and waved. A large blade appeared and stabbed into the ground as he said coldly: "This one just arrived and was immediately attacked by all of you. Shouldn't you give me an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>The large blade stabbed into the ground, wind and thunder surging, emanating a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists frantically retreated. This was a battle between powerful experts! If they were caught in it, they would certainly die!</p><p></p><p>Swish swish!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, powerful experts descended one after another. The Marquis of Dongyang and the Governor of Dongyang Prefecture blocked in front of the beast carriage with solemn expressions. The others surrounded them, encircling Meng Chong in the middle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the powerful experts were somewhat confused, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>This burly young man, holding a beauty in his arms, looked fierce and menacing, as if...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of someone demanding an explanation, and the person he was looking for turned out to be the Grand Princess of Da Yan!</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun, who was clinging to Meng Chong, was both excited and thrilled at this moment. As expected of her beloved, he was truly domineering and overbearing! So fierce!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was even stronger than the rumors suggested. He had clearly broken through and was full of confidence!</p><p></p><p>Duke Xiang of Dongyang, Lord Xiang Zhen, was the strongest person present. Faint lightning flickered around his body, ready to strike, but his expression was solemn, as if he was secretly conversing with someone.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..." Lord Xiang cupped his fists, about to say something.</p><p></p><p>"The person in the carriage should speak. Your people struck first, give an explanation, otherwise this matter isn't over, even if the old Da Yan Emperor himself came it would be the same!" Meng Chong coldly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts present were furious. Such disrespect towards the Da Yan Emperor was challenging the Da Yan Dynasty and trampling on the dignity of these powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"If sir wants an explanation, shouldn't you first give your name?" A cold voice sounded from inside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Then, Grand Princess Zhou Qingshuang stepped out, beautiful yet cold, her eyes like frost, seemingly devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Meng Chong raised an eyebrow, looking at the Grand Princess in surprise, as if deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun suddenly became nervous. Surely Meng Chong hadn't taken a liking to the Grand Princess? She clutched Meng Chong's clothes tightly, appearing quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly. I am Meng Chong!" Meng Chong looked down at Zi Yun, his face full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong?! Everyone was stunned. Wasn't the gathering of powerful experts in Dongyang County because of Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"You are the Divine Meng Chong?" The principal of Dongyang Martial Academy exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zi Yun clinging to Meng Chong, he couldn't help but have an absurd thought - had Meng Chong come to Dongyang County to find Zi Yun?</p><p></p><p>Just looking at these two, it was clear they were extremely familiar with each other!</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Meng Chong pulled off his wig and put it away, revealing his shiny bald head.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial Lords present suddenly felt immense pressure. This man alone had slain sixteen Immortal Celestial Lords - he was an absolute monster.</p><p></p><p>Even if they joined forces, could they defeat him? Although the powerful experts present considered themselves stronger than those sixteen Immortal Celestial Lords, what did that matter?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's cold expression changed as she stared at Meng Chong for a while before speaking: "Regarding the earlier attack, it was a misunderstanding. I apologize!"</p><p></p><p>None of the powerful experts spoke. The Grand Princess had actually apologized? But in their hearts, they breathed a sigh of relief. As long as it didn't come to blows, it was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this fierce Meng Chong, which of these powerful experts didn't feel pressured?</p><p></p><p>"A misunderstanding?" Meng Chong raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to lift Zi Yun off himself and asked, "Tell me, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun looked at the Grand Princess and mumbled, "She wanted me to be her maid, of course I refused. I was planning to find a chance to escape when I saw you, so I ran over to find you..."</p><p></p><p>After hearing the reason, Meng Chong raised his hand and a large blade fell into his palm. "You have a problem, looking for someone to be a maid on the street, and choosing Zi Yun of all people. Look at the mess you've caused. Shouldn't you give some kind of explanation?"</p><p></p><p>"I, Meng Chong, believe in not offending others if they don't offend me. But if someone offends me, they become my enemy. And for enemies, I've always had only one solution - scatter their ashes to the wind!"</p><p></p><p>This was openly threatening the Grand Princess. The powerful experts present were so angry their faces turned ashen, but not one of them spoke up, afraid of saying the wrong thing and bringing trouble upon themselves.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's expression returned to its cold state. "Does Brother Meng think our Da Yan Dynasty's strength is mediocre? Are you confident you can come and go as you please?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, forget the Da Yan Dynasty, I can come and go as I please in the entire Divine Realm. I don't care to know how strong your Da Yan Dynasty is. I only know that even if your Da Yan Dynasty has undying old monsters above the Immortal realm, they can't do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rested the large blade on his shoulder, looking at her arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, what kind of explanation does Brother Meng want?" Zhou Qingshuang asked after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his hand to rub his head and looked at Zi Yun, "What explanation do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zi Yun was stunned. "I don't... don't need an explanation. If you think we need one, you can decide."</p><p></p><p>She truly hadn't thought about this question, after all, she hadn't been forced to become a maid yet, so naturally there was no need to demand an explanation, right?</p><p></p><p>However, since Meng Chong had said so, Zi Yun let him decide.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head, pondered for a moment, and said, "Forget it, I haven't suffered any loss anyway, so I won't ask for any explanation. Besides, you don't have anything I'm interested in. If I need anything, I'll just go directly to the Treasure Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The people present listened with twitching mouths.</p><p></p><p>If he needed anything, he'd just go and plunder the Treasure Alliance? That was truly arrogant!</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you for your magnanimity, Brother Meng. May I ask why Brother Meng has come to Dongyang? This humble woman is willing to act as host."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang smiled as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>However, her smile still looked cold.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing important, and I don't need your hospitality." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glanced at Zhou Qingshuang and grinned, "You woman, your thoughts are impure. You've probably set your sights on my body. I advise you to give up. The problem with your body can't be resolved by having a vigorous physical body with abundant qi."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all the powerful experts were astonished.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang furrowed her brows, looking deeply at Meng Chong, and said with a light laugh, "What are you saying, Brother Meng? This humble woman has long admired Brother Meng's reputation and merely wishes to make your acquaintance."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was now glaring vigilantly at Zhou Qingshuang. This Grand Princess actually had designs on Meng Chong's body?</p><p></p><p>She cursed inwardly, thinking this Grand Princess looked cold on the outside, but her inner heart was so wanton. She truly hadn't expected this!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled and said, "You can't deceive these eyes of mine. Forget it, I don't want to waste words with you. In any case, the method you're thinking of won't solve your body's problem."</p><p></p><p>Not being familiar with her, Meng Chong naturally had no intention of giving advice. Now that he had seen Zi Yun, he had no reason to linger here any longer.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qingshuang's expression changed slightly, her brows furrowed tightly, as if deep in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned and strode away, with Zi Yun clinging tightly to him. "Meng Chong, did you come specifically to find me?"</p><p></p><p>"Not really, I'm just traveling through the Divine Realm and passing by Da Yan."</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, how strong are you now?"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Immortal Celestial Lords are like big grasshoppers in my eyes. Let me put it this way, no Immortal Celestial Lord is a match for me. Among cultivators at this level, only Big Senior Brother can defeat me."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu is still the strongest, huh." Zi Yun said in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Big Senior Brother has always been the strongest. I'm still a bit behind. But Fifth Junior Brother's strength is also very impressive, probably not weaker than mine."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother? The master has taken another disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>As the two walked further away, although their voices were very low, these powerful experts could hear them clearly. Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Could the "Senior Brother Xu" Zi Yun mentioned be the Sword God Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 239</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were martial artists who directly turned around and left, their expressions resolute, having made the decision to focus on cultivating the Great Wilderness martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, in the Qiangbei region, martial artists had gathered in front of the portal to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>After an attempt to jointly charge into the Spirit Realm portal was met with direct annihilation, all the martial artists understood that without a Jade Token, they could not enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Certain death! In the Spirit Realm's main palace, Emperor Zheng and several high-ranking ministers personally oversaw the matters regarding the Spirit Realm portal.</p><p></p><p>However, several days had passed, and not a single Jade Token holder had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Inner Realm has undergone the Blood Demon's upheaval, and it is feared that there may no longer be any Jade Token holders, or even knowledge of the Jade Tokens' existence within the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>A high-ranking minister said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether there are Jade Token holders in the Inner Realm, there must be no lapses during the one-month period."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Zheng said sternly.</p><p></p><p>The several high-ranking ministers nodded, as this was the order from the Supreme Lord, and they dared not be negligent.</p><p></p><p>A figure approached the Spirit Realm portal, appearing timid and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a Jade Token?"</p><p></p><p>The guard asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I do!"</p><p></p><p>The person took out a jade token.</p><p></p><p>The guard glanced at it, slightly furrowing his brow, as he had never heard of the force this Jade Token belonged to, but the Jade Token was indeed genuine. He waved his hand, allowing the person to enter.</p><p></p><p>The person let out a sigh of relief, stepping into the Spirit Realm portal with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists who had been keeping a close eye on the Spirit Realm portal couldn't help but furrow their brows. Could it be that the Inner Realm truly had a Jade Token holder?</p><p></p><p>A few days later, another person arrived at the Spirit Realm portal.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the Purple Cloud Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator observing the portal exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Kingdom had disintegrated, and the Purple Cloud Emperor's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he actually held a Jade Token? The guard looked at the Purple Cloud Emperor and then at the Jade Token in his hand, slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>A Jade Token from the Shu Clan?</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor was inwardly nervous. This Jade Token was one he had found at the place where the Shu Young Master had been killed. It seemed to be a symbol of identity.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm portal opened, and he guessed that this might be the function of the Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not of the Shu Clan bloodline, and he was worried that he would not be able to enter the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>The guard's attitude was indifferent as he waved his hand, allowing the Purple Cloud Emperor to enter.</p><p></p><p>At his age and with his weak cultivation, his talents would be average even in the Spirit Realm. Entering the Shu Clan with a Jade Token, he would only become a servant at most.</p><p></p><p>He was not worthy of the slightest attention.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention now, even in the past, only exceptional talents holding a Jade Token would be valued upon entering. Those with poor aptitude, even if they entered, would only become errand runners.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Yun Miaomiao, Du Yuying, and Zi Yun, the three women, had become acquainted with each other. They were all preparing to enter the Spirit Realm, and they had already learned some general information about the Spirit Realm from Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It was a place with a strict hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Jade Tokens held by the three women all belonged to the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's was the Azure King Jade Token of the Great Zhou Kingdom. The Jade Token Yun Miaomiao held, as well as the one Du Yuying had, were both from the same sect, the Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed that they were left behind by the same person. Although the three women wanted Xu Yan and Meng Chong to enter the Spirit Realm with them, the two men had refused, not even considering entering with a Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yun, the Jade Token you hold should be the one left behind by our ancestral grandmother."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying smiled brightly, seemingly able to claim seniority over Yun Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yuying, the cultivation method I practice was passed down by our ancestral grandmother, which is the orthodox lineage."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao did not back down either.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who is the senior sister and who is the junior, when we go to the Taimiao Sect, we should support each other and not tarnish the reputation of the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying fell silent for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm was now history. They were all people of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Wilderness was closely related to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm portal opened, and the three women were in no rush to enter, as there was a one-month time limit.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain peak, Meng Chong was in the midst of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Golden light swirled around him, and his aura was constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant expression on his face. Meng Chong was finally about to break through. Perhaps it wouldn't be long before Meng Chong could comprehend the second layer of the Unextinguishable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Meng Chong's figure grew taller, transforming into a three-zhang (about 10 meters) tall giant, the golden light shining brilliantly, resembling a golden Arhat.</p><p></p><p>His aura continued to strengthen.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped his spiritual tea, silently watching, anticipating Meng Chong's transformation after the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through the Unextinguishable Golden Body, and your Unextinguishable Golden Body has reached perfection!"</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Dao Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Xuan felt his strength increase, as the Unextinguishable Golden Body had reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure grew even taller, transforming into a six-zhang (about 20 meters) giant, and layer after layer of golden armor covered his body.</p><p></p><p>The Unextinguishable Divine Armor!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has metamorphosed into a Golden Arhat Divine Bone, and you have obtained the Primordial Golden Arhat Divine Bone!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Arhat Divine Bone!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had also completed his transformation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Meng Chong's breakthrough, Su Lingxiu also began to break through to the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>She had accumulated enough foundation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's breakthrough was not as grand and imposing as Meng Chong's, but rather light and nourishing. Vegetation grew around her, and flowers bloomed brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Divine Consciousness Realm, and your Alchemy Martial Dao has reached the pinnacle of the Divine Consciousness Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Alchemy Martial Dao had also reached the pinnacle of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation, wondering if Su Lingxiu would also undergo a transformation and obtain a divine bone.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has metamorphosed into the Evergreen Divine Bone, and you have obtained the Primordial Unextinguishable Divine Bone!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Xuan felt an endless vitality, where even if he suffered great injuries, he would be able to recover quickly and completely.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Divine Bone, with endless life force!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Although Su Lingxiu's combat power was somewhat lacking, her life force was boundless, and her lifespan was far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the other two women, watching Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu's breakthroughs, were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>So this was the Great Wilderness martial dao?</p><p></p><p>It was truly powerful beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>They were even momentarily shaken in their resolve to continue cultivating their own martial paths.</p><p></p><p>However, their martial foundations were already set, and they were about to enter the Spirit Realm, heading to even higher realms. It was too late for them to change their martial paths now.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do I still have a chance to change my martial path?"</p><p></p><p>Wushuang asked, deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is boundless. Firmly believe in your heart, firmly believe in your will, and continue on your path. What suits you best is the best martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The senior speaks the truth!"</p><p></p><p>Wushuang took a deep breath and respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu had broken through, and the matter of entering the Spirit Realm had also been brought to the forefront. Xu Yan began to make arrangements for the conquest of the Spirit Realm after their entry.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong and Pang Yu arrived.</p><p></p><p>The two were surprised to see that Xu Yan had returned.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Palace's force in the Spirit Realm was called the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, but he had never heard of it in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong and Pang Yu couldn't help but sigh wistfully. The Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy might have already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Truly, the forces that endure in this world are too few and far between.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed Jade Little Dragon, asking, "Never heard of it!"</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it has really been destroyed, and that's good. The Great Desolation Martial Arts Academy truly belongs to the Great Desolation now."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxong said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Bai Yunxong and Pang Yu, both of whom were at the half-step Celestial Realm, but within the Inner Domain, they were unable to break through to become true Martial Dao Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Great Desolation Martial Dao would also be difficult for them.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment and said, "Although you two cannot pursue the Great Desolation Martial Dao, you can still forge a different path and break through the Divine Intent Realm. It may not be as pure, but you will possess the power of a minor Celestial."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunxong and Pang Yu were delighted and asked, "How do we break through?"</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a Martial Dao Celestial was hopeless, and there was no hope of entering the Spiritual Realm, they couldn't become servants, could they? Moreover, they were already old, and might not even be able to become servants.</p><p></p><p>So, they decided to stay in the Great Desolation and continue to teach the martial arts, remaining as the principals and senior scholars of the Great Desolation Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ponder it over the next few days," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Divine Intent Realm, especially the Heart Sword Realm, he had a thorough understanding of how to refine the divine intent. These minor matters did not require the help of his master, as Xu Yan felt he could comprehend them on his own.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and the others had broken through to the Profound Enlightenment, and their strength had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>However, they were still not powerful enough to subdue the Great Desolation, so Xu Yan needed to make various arrangements before entering the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Xu Yan passed on a cultivation method to Bai Yunxong and Pang Yu, which he had created by combining the Celestial Realm's Gathering Spirit technique and the method of refining divine intent.</p><p></p><p>This could allow the half-step Celestials to cultivate divine intent and break through to the Divine Intent Realm, although it would be a "false" Divine Intent Realm, weaker than the true Divine Intent Realm but stronger than the minor Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the matters of Canglan Island and the Great Desolation, Old Pang and I will definitely give it our all and ensure that there will be no loss of control!" Bai Yunxong and Pang Yu solemnly guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you very much!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had them break through the "false" Divine Intent Realm so that if there was any chaos on Canglan Island or in the Great Desolation, they could suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the safety of his parents and family members would not rely solely on Bai Yunxong and Pang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had split off dozens of divine elemental avatars and infused them into spiritual jade, to ensure the safety of Xu Yan's parents and family. These divine elemental avatars were not for one-time use, and as long as the divine elements were not exhausted, they could be used continuously. Even great Celestial Realm experts would be unable to destroy them, ensuring the safety of Xu Yan's family.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Xie Tianheng arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I need to take Feng'er to the Spiritual Realm," Xie Tianheng said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Father, there's no need to hurry. I can go to the Spiritual Realm with Brother Xu," Xie Lingfeng said, surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the Spiritual Realm has opened, and according to the agreement, I must take you there. Your mother is in the Spiritual Realm," Xie Tianheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"My mother is in the Spiritual Realm?" Xie Lingfeng's eyes widened in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Xie Tianheng recalled the past and sighed wistfully, "Your mother came from the Spiritual Realm and later returned there. I, Xie Tianheng, have never lost to anyone, so what are the geniuses of the Spiritual Realm? Therefore, I promised her that when the gate to the Spiritual Realm opened, I would go there with my head held high to find her..."</p>

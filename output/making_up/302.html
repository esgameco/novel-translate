        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Changqing Pavilion, everyone was busy, and there were no injured people seeking treatment yet. The reputation of the Changqing Pavilion had not yet spread widely.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was pondering the refinement of the flying ship, and Su Lingxiu was assisting him on the side. This was the first time she had invested so much of her heart and spirit in something outside of medicine and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was coordinating the Changqing Pavilion, organizing the needed spiritual medicines and so on.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was the same, and Meng Shushu and Zhu Xingzheng were mingling together, the two of them already quite familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to quietly read as a handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth page is the general outline of the Taicangtian Laws, which is a summary. Does that mean the tenth page is no longer the Taicangtian Laws?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet completely memorized the ninth page. Once he did, it would mean he had memorized the entire Taicangtian Laws.</p><p></p><p>The Taicangtian Book had a total of eighteen pages, and the ninth page was already the general outline and summary of the Taicangtian Laws. What would come after the tenth page? Higher levels of the Taicangtian Laws? A powerful cultivator from the Spirit Sect had arrived that day.</p><p></p><p>The entrenched leader of Luozhou, Fan Kaishan, was naturally among them, and besides him, there were two other extremely powerful cultivators whose strengths exceeded Fan Kaishan's.</p><p></p><p>One of them had even condensed a wisp of the aura of the Taicangtian Laws, and his strength was only slightly weaker than Yue Longming's.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this person's identity in the Leiyun Mountain Sect was extraordinary, undoubtedly one of the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a purple hammer was hanging at his waist, faintly surrounded by lightning. That was a divine artifact! Divine artifacts had tremendous power, and their storage bags could not contain them, so they could only be carried on one's person.</p><p></p><p>The group from the Leiyun Mountain Sect consisted of more than a dozen people, most of whom were injured, with injuries that had reached their foundations. Even with the Leiyun Mountain Sect's many treasures, they could not be completely healed.</p><p></p><p>One of the injured was an extremely powerful cultivator who had refined the Taicangtian Principles, his injuries severe, only slightly better than Jiao Li's condition back then.</p><p></p><p>He had been injured by a powerful cultivator wielding a divine artifact from the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Taicangtian Laws-comprehending Yue Longming suddenly opened his eyes and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was secretly astonished. The Leiyun Mountain Sect had actually sent such a powerful cultivator. Were they trying to take the Changqing Pavilion back to the Leiyun Mountain Sect? But this group had entered through the main gate, as if they had only come for a diagnosis.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Leiyun from the Leiyun Mountain Sect seeks an audience with the Medicinal Immortal Lady to treat the injuries of our sect's disciples."</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator with the purple hammer divine artifact at his waist cupped his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, of course, as long as the diagnosis fee is sufficient, any injury is a small matter."</p><p></p><p>The excited Su Lingxiu walked over.</p><p></p><p>As for the Leiyun Mountain Sect's threat, she didn't take it to heart at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Lingxiu, Leitong was surprised. The Medicinal Immortal Lady was actually so young? Probably not even twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>"The diagnosis fee is not a problem at all. As long as Miss Su can heal our disciples' injuries, we will gladly pay double the fee."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became even more delighted. "The Leiyun Mountain Sect is truly a transcendent Spiritual Sect, so generous!"</p><p></p><p>She took a quick look at the injured ones and understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>"These injuries are not light, and the treatment will be quite troublesome. The diagnosis fee will not be low."</p><p></p><p>Leitong took out a storage bag and said, "Fifty stalks of divine spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head and said, "It's not a problem with the spiritual herbs, and fifty stalks of divine spiritual herbs are not enough to cover the diagnosis fees for these injured."</p><p></p><p>Leitong did not get angry, raising his brow and saying, "Miss, please name your price!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, just wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu quickly ran to Fang Hao's side, seizing the opportunity that the powerful cultivators from the Leiyun Mountain Sect had come to seek treatment, to gather the rare materials needed for refining the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, quickly list out what materials are needed. The Leiyun Mountain Sect is wealthy and won't have any trouble paying."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Hao became energetic.</p><p></p><p>He started listing the materials, all of which were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"Father's flying ship cannot be done carelessly. It must be magnificent. I remember the Leiyun Mountain Sect has a unique Thundering Purple Iron, which is exactly what we're lacking.</p><p></p><p>"With this Thundering Purple Iron, the flying ship we refine can be surrounded by purple lightning, looking truly awe-inspiring..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao listed out all the missing materials, and even doubled the amount, in case of failed refinement that would require replenishment.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the list, Su Lingxiu added a few types of divine spiritual herbs with special effects, and handed it to Leitong, saying, "This is the diagnosis fee. After the payment is made, I can start the treatment."</p><p></p><p>Leitong looked at the diagnosis fee without saying anything. This was obviously extorting a hefty sum from the Leiyun Mountain Sect, seeing that they were wealthy and generous, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Miss, this diagnosis fee..."</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan frowned and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Leitong waved his hand, interrupting him, and looked up with a serious expression. "The diagnosis fee is not a problem, but may I ask, can you truly heal their injuries?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What if, after receiving the fee, you are unable to heal their injuries?"</p><p></p><p>Leitong asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't heal them, I'm willing to compensate," Su Lingxiu said with a raised brow.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Leitong nodded in satisfaction, handing the list to Fan Kaishan and saying, "Prepare double the diagnosis fee. Since I, Leitong, have said we'll pay double, I will not go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Fan Kaishan took the list of the diagnosis fee and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat, gentlemen. The diagnosis fee has arrived, and I will start the treatment immediately."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Leiyun Mountain Sect was truly generous.</p><p></p><p>Leitong nodded and led the injured ones to sit down in the waiting hall of the Changqing Pavilion. He was not impatient or causing any trouble, not even trying to flaunt the might of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yue Longming continued to ponder the Taicangtian Laws.</p><p></p><p>However, Cai Lingier was somewhat worried. She found Su Lingxiu and said, "Sister Lingxiu, Leitong is the fifth elder of the Leiyun Mountain Sect, in charge of the divine artifact Heavenly Purple Thundercloud Hammer. His strength is extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"He is so generous in paying the diagnosis fee, perhaps he has some ulterior motive."</p><p></p><p>But Su Lingxiu just smiled and said, "As long as I can heal the injured, I don't care what schemes they have. Master said that any plots and schemes are like straw dogs before absolute strength. Just directly overwhelm them.</p><p></p><p>"With Master here, even if they try to scheme, they will only suffer greater losses."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingier was stunned, looking at the mysterious senior sitting there calmly, and her worries immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That's right, in the face of this powerful senior, any schemes would be nothing but straw dogs. The strength of the Leiyun Mountain Sect was only formidable to the weak like them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Leitong's group, inwardly chuckling. "So the Transcendent Spiritual Sect is also resorting to such underhanded tactics?"</p><p></p><p>He had a rough guess of Leitong's intentions. After Su Lingxiu healed the injured, some of them would likely die soon, and then they could accuse Su Lingxiu. As for how to compensate, that would be up to the Leiyun Mountain Sect to decide.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, if the Leiyun Mountain Sect had directly come to threaten them, he would have looked at them more highly, with the might of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect. But the result was they were preparing to use such a scheme? Of course, whether it would actually turn out that way was still uncertain at the moment.</p><p></p><p>One day later...</p><p></p><p>Fan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kai Shan has returned, and the treatment fee has been handed over to Suli Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin the treatment."</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong silently watched.</p><p></p><p>"A minor issue!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu and Yue'er busied themselves. For the treatment of these injured, they did not directly use medicinal pills, but Suli Xiu personally used medical techniques to treat them.</p><p></p><p>As the treatment of the injured accumulated, her understanding and advancement in the Dao of Alchemy and Martial Arts naturally increased.</p><p></p><p>This time, Suli Xiu spent a day to heal all of them, revealing a weary expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, they are all healed!"</p><p></p><p>The three supreme experts of the Lei Tong clan silently observed, greatly shocked in their hearts. What a miraculous technique, to heal the injured so quickly.</p><p></p><p>This was no minor injury, but one that had reached the foundation. For martial artists, it was almost a crippling blow.</p><p></p><p>In just a single day, they were all healed! "Miss, can you guarantee that they are all healed, without any aftereffects?"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong solemnly asked.</p><p></p><p>Here it comes, is he going to make a move? Yue Chang Ming silently stood up, ready to take action at any moment.</p><p></p><p>While Lei Tong's strength was not weak, he was still inferior to them by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, his comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth had improved, and the aura of the laws of heaven and earth he had condensed had grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu still had a smile on her face, "Of course they are healed. You can check here and try their recovered strength.</p><p></p><p>"However, let me make it clear, if after leaving the Qingqing Hall, you say they are not healed, I won't acknowledge it. After all, I don't know what unexpected events might occur after they leave the Qingqing Hall."</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong pondered for a moment and nodded, "Miss, your words are reasonable. I am also worried that their injuries have not fully recovered, after all, such a miraculous medical skill has never been heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"To ensure they have fully recovered, I think they should stay here for observation for some time.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, Miss? Of course, the subsequent observation and treatment fees will be paid by the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu was taken aback, how could Lei Tong actually ask them to stay for observation?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also surprised, let them stay? After some contemplation, he understood the intention of the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>To monitor the Qingqing Hall, and even see if they can steal the miraculous medical techniques, and also to block the Wanshi Alliance from coming here to seek medical treatment! "It's not that I don't agree, it's just the subsequent observation and treatment fees..."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"One divine spirit herb per day!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Deal!"</p><p></p><p>With someone bringing divine spirit herbs to their doorstep, how could she refuse? Suli Xiu agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>Her agreement was so smooth, it even made Lei Tong feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Xingzheng, quickly set up a hall for observing the patients."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu turned and said to Zhu Xingzheng.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was already well-versed in building houses, and immediately called the Golden Antlered Deer to quickly build a hall on the open ground of the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll come visit again in a while."</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong cupped his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan handed a storage bag to Suli Xiu and said, "Here are thirty divine spirit herbs, Miss, keep them well!"</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, no need to see me off!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu excitedly took them.</p><p></p><p>Thirty divine spirit herbs, this is enough for them to stay in the Qingqing Hall for a month.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Suli, the house is built!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng hurriedly came and reported.</p><p></p><p>"You all, go and stay there."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu pointed to the newly built house.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect cupped their hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>They were very satisfied with the residence, as it was close to the main gate of the Qingqing Hall, convenient for observation.</p><p></p><p>Among these injured, there was one who had refined the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, enough to intimidate most of the Wanshi Alliance's experts.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you let them stay?"</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"One divine spirit herb per day, where else can you find such a good deal?"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu chuckled.</p><p></p><p>With these divine spirit herbs, the grade of her medicinal pills could be raised to a new level.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, let's set up a formation."</p><p></p><p>Finding Fang Hao, she said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's just that the one with the strongest strength may not be easily deceived."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>However, among the injured of the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect, there was one supreme expert, and with his current strength, Fang Hao could not silently set up a formation.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, with Shifu here."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu ran up to Li Xuan, massaging his shoulders, and said, "Shifu, make that person deaf and blind so that Shidi can set up the formation without being discovered."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao set up the formation, and the people of the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect didn't even notice, they still thought they were constantly aware of everything in the Qingqing Hall.</p><p></p><p>Even when they walked out of the house, wanting to blend into the Qingqing Hall and investigate its secrets, they were completely unaware that they were already enveloped by the formation, just walking around that one house.</p><p></p><p>So-called conversations were nothing more than talking to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao's attainments in formations and heavenly and earthly anomalies have improved quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Lei Tong came, ostensibly to visit the injured.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not discover any abnormalities, nor could he detect the existence of the formation, and had a secret exchange with the injured of the Lei Cloud Mountain Sect, thinking he had obtained some valuable information.</p><p></p><p>Unaware that the moment he stepped into the Qingqing Hall, he had already entered Li Xuan's heavenly and earthly anomaly, and everything he heard and saw was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Spirit Realm had no formations or heavenly and earthly techniques, which were completely unknown, so there was naturally no vigilance in this regard, and no attempt to explore whether such things existed.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Lei Tong came again.</p><p></p><p>After visiting the injured and praising Suli Xiu, he left satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of Yue Chang Ming and Cai Lingyi, there was a strange expression on his face. What was wrong with Lei Tong? At times he would talk to himself, even expressing gratitude and applauding, as if he had heard some exciting news.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't know the inside story, they might have thought Lei Tong had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme expert like Lei Tong, actually being manipulated in the palm of their hands!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi sighed in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth page is almost completely memorized."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited, the ninth page of the Taiying Book was about to be fully memorized.</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Book of the Dao opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Spirit Monarch Realm, and your Spirit Monarch is increased a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, Xu Yan had broken through to the Spirit Monarch Realm, and his own Spirit Monarch had increased a hundredfold, his divine abilities soaring.</p><p></p><p>The sudden increase in strength was exhilarating, continuously improving was truly enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Monarch Realm, the divine abilities won't be far behind."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had high expectations for his senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 21 Jade Bone Bottleneck, Diary and Ferocious Beast</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan said these words, Xu Yan heard them as his master's guidance, on how to comprehend and how to break through the shackles.</p><p></p><p>"Capture the hidden spiritual opportunities around you, comprehend every blade of grass and every tree, comprehend the natural world..."</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Xu Yan seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master, for your guidance. I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw that he had once again fooled his foolish disciple, and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>For the next two days, Xu Yan did not cultivate, but instead wandered around the small village, feeding the chickens and planting vegetables. In the evenings, he sat on a rock, watching the stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>His mind was surprisingly calm.</p><p></p><p>Without the obsession of breaking through the golden bone shackles, without the obsession of cultivation, his mind seemed to have put down its burdens, and the whole person felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, he even had a sense of wonder at the marvels of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After three days of this, Xu Yan finished weeding and was about to leave, when he suddenly noticed a worm poking out of the soil, then quickly retreating back into the earth. He also saw a small insect burrowing into the soil.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration suddenly occurred to him in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Nourishing the true intent, the qi and blood like a dragon... I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan felt that he had suddenly gained enlightenment, a flash of inspiration in his mind, instantly comprehending the deep meaning of the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Bone, I will definitely be able to refine it out!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master, for your guidance, I was able to gain enlightenment, able to capture the hidden spiritual opportunities around me, and thus comprehend the cultivation technique, comprehend how to break through the bottleneck!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The next day, before dawn, Xu Yan began to cultivate again.</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan saw this, he was surprised. This foolish disciple had bounced back so quickly and was still persisting?</p><p></p><p>As long as Xu Yan didn't discover he had been deceived, it would be fine. </p><p></p><p>When the one-year period was over, he would immediately sever the master-disciple relationship, and the deception would come to an end. He would then go to the Wu State to live a peaceful life!</p><p></p><p>After that, he might never see Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Xu Yan was immersing the qi and blood into his bones and marrow, slowly and steadily infusing the qi and blood into the bones, nourishing the marrow.</p><p></p><p>It took three days for Xu Yan to feel a sense of soreness and swelling in his bones, and then he began the refining process.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in his cultivation, Xu Yan seemed to have forgotten everything, only the mysterious spiritual opportunities in heaven and earth appearing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood in the marrow suddenly roared like a mighty dragon, and the marrow began to surge and surge, as if it had come alive.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan only felt an indescribable pain throughout his entire skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Numbness, stinging, soreness, swelling...</p><p></p><p>His entire skeleton would swell up, as if about to burst open, then contract, becoming thin, and even the marrow would be compressed and solidified.</p><p></p><p>Between the swelling and contraction, more refined qi and blood was born.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan seemed to feel a mysterious rhythm emerging from within the bones.</p><p></p><p>The experience was more painful and harder to endure than the first time he refined the bones.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat kept dripping down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gritted his teeth and persisted, until he was about to reach his limit, then he stopped the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The golden bone has loosened a bit..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan found that the golden bone, which had previously reached its limit and could not be refined further, had now loosened and become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I've grasped the right approach, the jade bone is not far away!"</p><p></p><p>The excited Xu Yan cultivated even more diligently in the following days.</p><p></p><p>The pain he endured also became more intense.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>The originally golden-colored bones had actually become paler.</p><p></p><p>Although the golden bones had become paler, their strength had actually increased by more than 30%.</p><p></p><p>After half a month, the bones all over his body...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It had turned back to white, but it was more than twice as hard as the golden bones.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood were purer and stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even reached the jade bone stage yet, but I'm already this powerful. If I reach the jade bone stage, how powerful will I be? My martial arts foundation has surpassed the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited in his heart, the jade bone was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Xu Yan's entire skeleton had a crystalline appearance, and he was only one step away from the flawless jade bone.</p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely this last step that Xu Yan encountered resistance again.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had hit a bottleneck and could no longer continue his transformation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was unwilling to be satisfied with just being one step away from the jade bone transformation.</p><p></p><p>So in the next two days, he kept refining, but there was no progress, as if he had to break through some kind of shackle in order to complete this last step of transformation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not know that his foolish disciple was about to refine the jade bone.</p><p></p><p>That day, he was idling around and rummaged through some of the old villager's belongings, which were mostly books.</p><p></p><p>The people in the village were refugees who had come here, and there were some literate people who had left behind some books, which were the most valued things in the village.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rolled-up cloth scroll fell to the ground, and Li Xuan bent down to pick it up and found that there were writings on it.</p><p></p><p>"Whose relic is this? I don't think I've seen this before."</p><p></p><p>Curious, Li Xuan unrolled the scroll.</p><p></p><p>The scroll was quite long, and when it was unrolled, he saw that it was filled with writing, seemingly a diary?</p><p></p><p>"Is this Big Ox's diary?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Big Ox was a big, crude man, but he kept a diary?</p><p></p><p>Flipping through the scroll, Li Xuan saw that the last entry recorded how Big Ox had once left the village alone, wanting to go to the city, and how he had seen a fierce beast outside the Wicked Demon Forest.</p><p></p><p>"The beast that Big Ox saw was not that tiger! There is another fierce beast in the Wicked Demon Forest, even more terrifying than the tiger!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked by the description of the beast in Big Ox's diary. This beast was larger than the tiger, with fiery mane and fangs a foot long.</p><p></p><p>Why would there be such a powerful beast in the Wicked Demon Forest, in addition to the tiger? The tiger was the king of the forest, how could it allow another such fierce beast to exist in its territory?</p><p></p><p>"I have to find my foolish disciple and have him lead people to search the Wicked Demon Forest and kill that beast!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly put away the items and went to find Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

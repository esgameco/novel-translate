            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw the Great Dao Golden Book open, and couldn't help but be startled. Meng Chong had just broken through and was accumulating his foundation, so he wouldn't break through the Unbreakable Golden Body of the Great Sun in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had also just broken through not long ago.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book must be from Xu Yan - had he broken through, or had he killed another Heavenly Warrior?</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao warrior you instructed, Xie Tian Heng, has successfully cultivated the sword dao you compiled. His sword heart is clear, and his sword boundary has been elevated."</p><p></p><p>To Li Xuan's surprise, the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book was not from Xu Yan, but from Xie Tian Heng! He had attained sword heart clarity! Li Xuan was stunned for a moment - Xie Tian Heng had become the second person to attain sword heart clarity in the sword dao he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>Although he had broken through by comprehending Li Xuan's guidance.</p><p></p><p>But this showed that Xie Tian Heng's sword dao talent was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>A bit stronger than Xie Ling Feng.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also related to Xie Tian Heng's accumulation, after all, the young Xie Ling Feng's accumulation in the sword dao was far less than his father Xie Tian Heng.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he could comprehend the sword techniques, his talent is remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques filled the missing link in the sword dao he had compiled, allowing it to be more widely disseminated and lowering the talent requirement for cultivating the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"He has already attained sword heart clarity, Xie Tian Heng must have already comprehended the sword intent, he won't be too far from it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was curious, what sword intent would Xie Tian Heng comprehend?</p><p></p><p>"Xie Tian Heng should be arriving at Canglan Island soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to Xie Tian Heng's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Tian Heng had broken through, Xie Ling Feng wouldn't be too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was about to write the pattern of the second page of the Taihuang Book into the Great Dao Golden Book, using the heavenly and earthly principles of the second page as a foundation, to try to compile a higher level array diagram.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Dao Golden Book emanated golden light again.</p><p></p><p>"Has Xie Ling Feng broken through?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's first thought was that it was Xie Ling Feng who had broken through and attained sword heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has condensed the will of heaven and earth as my will, and condensed the true meaning of the martial dao, breaking through the Divine Intent Realm, your divine intent has increased a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through the Divine Intent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book was that his divine intent had increased a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt as if his divine intent had undergone a metamorphosis, increasing a hundredfold. In a single thought, the coverage range of his divine intent had increased a hundredfold! The increase in the coverage range of his divine intent also greatly increased the distance connected to his divine spirit avatar's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>From the previous twenty li, it had increased to a hundred li!</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't increase a hundredfold, this increase was still extremely astonishing!</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of divine intent meant a significant increase in strength. A single thought like the will of heaven, and even weaker Refined Spirit Heavenly Warriors would be suppressed by it!</p><p></p><p>Sword intent, blade intent, and so on would all greatly increase along with the enhancement of divine intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited, as the hundredfold increase in divine intent also meant that the time he could use the Great Dao Golden Book would greatly increase, allowing him to better use the Great Dao Golden Book to perfect various cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Great Desolate Martial Dao still lacked some martial techniques and secret arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could compile some martial techniques and secret arts.</p><p></p><p>His three disciples Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Ling Xiu cultivated martial dao cultivation methods that were too profound, and ordinary martial artists would find it difficult to cultivate them, requiring very high talent.</p><p></p><p>It was time to compile some more widely applicable cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Golden Book emanated golden light again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the Divine Intent Realm and metamorphosed into a Mountain and River Divine Bone, you have obtained the Primordial Divine Bone."</p><p></p><p>As expected, Xu Yan had accumulated perfectly and metamorphosed at the time of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Mountain and River Divine Bone!</p><p></p><p>With the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book, Li Xuan was greatly shocked. This Primordial Divine Bone was truly extraordinary, surpassing the Spirit Bone and possessing a divine aura.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Xu Yan has the divine bone and spirit body, his strength has increased further. Below the Refined Spirit Heavenly Warrior, no one can match him."</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's current strength, even if he provoked a Refined Spirit Heavenly Warrior, he could still evade.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm martial dao is flourishing, and Su Ling Xiu has the Spiritual Realm bloodline, being born with a special physique. It seems that the geniuses of the Spiritual Realm must possess special physiques."</p><p></p><p>And the geniuses with this special physique would not be ordinary in strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, among the same realm, Xu Yan would still crush them.</p><p></p><p>If it exceeded a realm, whether Xu Yan could easily crush them would be an unknown.</p><p></p><p>And the powerful Refined Spirit Heavenly Warriors must be geniuses with special physiques, their strength not something ordinary Refined Spirit Heavenly Warriors could compare to.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Yan's current strength is still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through the Divine Primal Realm could he truly possess the strength to not fear any Refined Spirit Heavenly Warrior.</p><p></p><p>"He has reached the Divine Intent Realm, the cultivation methods of the Divine Spiritual Realm should also be comprehended soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Spiritual Realm, that was an extremely powerful realm he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>Once the Divine Spiritual techniques were mastered, they would easily dominate the Refined Spirit Heavenly Warriors.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Spiritual Realm was quite profound, and what kind of divine spiritual techniques would be grasped at the time of the breakthrough was also an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through the Divine Intent Realm, so according to the calculations, it wouldn't be long before he returned.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to prepare the martial dao cultivation that comes after the Divine Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Spiritual techniques were powerful, they were not the ultimate of the martial dao. The subsequent cultivation and martial dao methods should also be compiled.</p><p></p><p>But there was no hurry for now, the realms after the Divine Spiritual Realm required careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wrote the heavenly and earthly principles of the second page of the Taihuang Book into the Great Dao Golden Book, compiling a higher level array diagram, but the difficulty was not small.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to compile a Great Desolate Martial Dao classic."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to compile some martial techniques and secret arts of the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the martial dao scholars on Canglan Island had already researched some, but they had not broken free from the framework of the Inner Realm martial dao.</p><p></p><p>What Li Xuan needed to compile were the martial techniques and secret arts unique to the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>With his Divine Primal Realm strength, compiling the martial techniques and secret arts below the Profound Realm was not too difficult, especially with the assistance of the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial techniques and secret arts above the Profound Realm, there was no hurry, after all, the current Great Desolate martial artists were only at the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial techniques and secret arts he compiled were not limited to only being able to be used by those below the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, Li Xuan had compiled the preliminary Great Desolate Martial Dao classic, covering body techniques, footwork, the use of qi and blood, qi and blood secret arts, the use of true qi, and true qi secret arts.</p><p></p><p>Quite comprehensive.</p><p></p><p>A total of dozens of martial techniques and secret arts.</p><p></p><p>He handed this Great Desolate Martial Dao classic to Peng Yuan, letting them comprehend it. These martial dao scholars, once they comprehended it, would also be able to research cultivation methods belonging to the Great Desolate Martial Dao based on this foundation, rather than still being confined by the framework of the Inner Realm martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others were greatly excited, and began to comprehend and research it day and night.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of comprehending this Great Desolate Martial Dao classic was not high, and Peng Yuan and the other martial dao scholars had good innate talent, and their minds were filled with the research of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there was no worry that they would be unable to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>After completing this task, Li Xuan was troubled again by the search for his fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only go to the Spiritual Realm to find a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Taihuang Book and began to research the heavenly and earthly principles on the third page.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly principles on the third page were more profound and complex, and even more difficult to memorize, even with his divine intent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power was increased a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the divine will, the more Li Xuan felt the profound mysteries and changes contained in the Taicangshu patterns.</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual platform, the Great Dao golden book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Great Celestial Warrior, and your sword intent has been enhanced." Li Xuan was startled. Xu Yan had just broken through not long ago, and he had already killed a Great Celestial Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xu Yan was being pursued?</p><p></p><p>Had he provoked some powerful force? In the days following Xu Yan's slaying of the first Great Celestial Warrior, he had killed three more. Li Xuan was almost certain that Xu Yan had provoked some force in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he has provoked the Refining Spirit Celestials?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, the Purple Cloud Nation collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor was nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Purple Cloud Royal Family announced that the Purple Cloud Nation had been incorporated into the Great Wasteland, and the Inner Realm was completely replaced by the Great Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>A new era had truly arrived in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng arrived at Canglang Island, and after his sword heart became clear, he was still unable to comprehend the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!" Xie Tianheng was no longer arrogant or overbearing, at least not in front of Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, for you to have your sword heart become clear in such a short time, your sword dao talent is not bad." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I thank you for your guidance. Without your transmission of the sword dao, I would never have had the chance to have my sword heart become clear. Only after entering the door of the sword dao did I realize the profundity of the sword dao."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng said respectfully, "From now on, I, Xie Tianheng, will be a sword dao disciple under your tutelage!"</p><p></p><p>He had devoted his life to the sword dao, loved the sword dao, and after comprehending the sword dao's momentum, he felt that he was the number one swordsman throughout history.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through to have his sword heart become clear, truly entering the door of the sword dao, did he realize that he was previously just a frog in a well.</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Tianheng wanted to enter his sect as a sword dao disciple, Li Xuan did not object.</p><p></p><p>Being a sword dao disciple rather than a direct disciple, Xie Tianheng's sword momentum would complement the sword dao, and it was reasonable for him to become a disciple of Li Xuan's sword dao sect.</p><p></p><p>"But have you encountered any confusion in comprehending the sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, please guide me, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent can be your heart's intent, or the intent of the sword momentum, or the intent of the sword technique. This intent is profound and can only be comprehended through self-realization. Let me give you some guidance.</p><p></p><p>"You can comprehend the sword momentum as the foundation, and then comprehend the sword intent from there.</p><p></p><p>"You can also use the sword technique you have mastered as the basis to comprehend the sword intent..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was prepared and began to guide him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng respectfully bowed and then left to return to the Sword尊Cliff to contemplate the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"What sword intent will Xie Tianheng be able to comprehend? Will I be able to gain feedback from every warrior who cultivates my sword dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending sword intent was not easy. It required high talent, and if each warrior who cultivated his sword dao could comprehend sword intent, most of them would be able to provide him with feedback.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the sword intent he would master in the future would become more and more.</p><p></p><p>The sword dao had already spread, what about the Dao of the Blade? Li Xuan glanced at Meng Chong and shook his head, the Dao of the Blade would just go with the flow.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not comprehended more blade intent, and for him, continuously improving and perfecting the blade intent, taking the Dao of the Blade to the extreme, was his true talent.</p><p></p><p>"Since there is sword intent and blade intent, naturally there would also be fist intent and battle intent; this is a realm of the martial dao unique to the Great Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"To step into this realm of intent is the true mark of a genius of the Great Wasteland martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"I should also perfect this realm of intent, this is the standard of a genius, and the comprehension of fist intent, battle intent, and so on should all have a direction.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the sword dao, one can start from the sword momentum and then comprehend the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of intent also has levels of strength, and the sword intent comprehended by Xie Tianheng would certainly not be as strong as Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>"And Xu Yan and Meng Chong are the top experts in this realm of intent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had more ideas about perfecting the Great Wasteland martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Alchemy Martial Dao is not easy to comprehend the realm of intent, but the prolonged vitality of Alchemy Martial Dao practitioners, and the keen awareness and focus required for alchemy, can be comparable to the realm of intent.</p><p></p><p>"Little Suli, she is a pioneer of the Alchemy Martial Dao, she should also comprehend some of the unique strengths of the Alchemy Martial Dao practitioners."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the Alchemy Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Alchemy Martial Dao practitioners were not known for their combat prowess, so their realm of intent was somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>However, the prolonged vitality of Alchemy Martial Dao practitioners, as well as the keen awareness and focus required for alchemy, could compensate for the lack of a realm of intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was simultaneously studying the third page of the Taicangshu, gradually designing an even higher level formation, and occasionally researching the theory of the realm of intent in the Great Wasteland martial dao.</p><p></p><p>After the Inner Realm was officially replaced by the Great Wasteland, the Great Wasteland martial dao developed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could see that the number of his Thousand Martial Shadows was constantly soaring, and the martial techniques mastered by these shadows were also changing.</p><p></p><p>"The number of warriors cultivating your martial dao has exceeded ten thousand, and you have gained the Ten Thousand Martial Shadows!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland warriors had broken through ten thousand in number.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit curious, if the number of shadows continued to increase, would they undergo some kind of transformation?</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since Xu Yan has killed any Celestial Warriors, he should be coming back soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about his senior disciple Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao golden book had not received any feedback about Xu Yan killing Celestial Warriors for some time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Matchless Pavilion, Yunmiaomiao, dressed in white clothes, leaned by the window, her gaze sweeping towards the horizon, in the direction of Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>"That rascal Xu Yan has already entered the Spiritual Realm, I wonder how he's doing, I hope he doesn't get captured and made a slave." The Matchless Grand Master said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Yunmiaomiao gave her a disapproving look.</p><p></p><p>"My good disciple, when the Jade Token time comes, and you enter the Spiritual Realm, you can capture Xu Yan and make him your little slave, then you can be with him every day!" The Matchless Grand Master suggested with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you better not have such ideas, or you'll die a horrible death. Xu Yan is no ordinary person, even if he has entered the Spiritual Realm, he is still an invincible genius."</p><p></p><p>Yunmiaomiao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright." The Matchless Grand Master rolled her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm has become history, now it is the Great Wasteland."</p><p></p><p>She sighed with a sense of the passage of time, the changes had been so drastic in such a short period.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that the Great Wasteland and the Spiritual Realm will have a confrontation."</p><p></p><p>The Matchless Grand Master said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"But that has nothing to do with us. I hold the Taicang Jade Token, and have become a disciple of the Taicang Sect, we will not participate in such conflicts."</p><p></p><p>Yunmiaomiao said, then added, "I wonder if Ancestral Grandmother is still alive."</p><p></p><p>"She should still be alive, right?" The Matchless Grand Master said uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>"According to our lineage's inheritance, back then Ancestral Grandmother was severely injured by the Demonic Lord, but was saved by the Patriarch, and left behind the Jade Token. When the gate to the Spiritual Realm opens, one can enter the Taicang Sect as a disciple by holding the Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation method we practice was also passed down by Ancestral Grandmother."</p><p></p><p>The Matchless Grand Master recalled the inheritance secrets.</p><p></p><p>It's the end of the month, please give me a vote if you can.

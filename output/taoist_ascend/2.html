        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Master Dao was washing pots. </p><p></p><p>The three large iron pots used for meals by the 180 workers, each one bigger than a bathtub, were quite laborious for Li Yuan to wash. He leaned over the rim, half his body bent down scrubbing inside.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>A large bucket of water was poured into the pot. Li Yuan did the final rinse, while the other apprentices were all kept busy too. </p><p></p><p>Chopping firewood, fetching water, preparing charcoal, moving iron ingots, cleaning weapons, sweeping...</p><p></p><p>"Alas, so tiring. I heard the front courtyard apprentices like Yun and Lu Zhong only need to work until noon, and get two days off every five days..."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, who's to blame that we're not strong enough to be selected? I heard the front courtyard ones might even get to learn martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, let's endure it, just three more years..."</p><p></p><p>"I need to take a day off tomorrow, too tired...alas, I really want to eat meat!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Without Fat Sun around, the group of apprentices chatted while working.</p><p></p><p>"The front courtyard..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan stretched in the corner, listening to the apprentices' conversation.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there were more apprentices at the weapon forge than just the seven or eight in their kitchen quarters. Five or six served the owner's family in the rear courtyard, while around ten helped the masters in the front courtyard shop.</p><p></p><p>The treatment of the front, middle and rear courtyard apprentices differed, with the middle courtyard kitchen hands being the worst off, followed by the rear courtyard, and the front courtyard being the best.</p><p></p><p>That group of front courtyard apprentices not only didn't work as hard, they got over a hundred copper coins monthly, and even had the opportunity to learn martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Alas, with his weak body, he was no match for those sturdy little calves of front courtyard apprentices. If not for knowing a few characters, he might not even have been accepted here.</p><p></p><p>"Learning martial arts is probably even harder...but I should try out that 'ritual' first to see if it works..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan silently finished his chores, planning to ask Fat Sun for half a day off to withdraw his monthly allowance and prepare what was needed for the ritual.</p><p></p><p>The middle courtyard apprentices got one day off every ten days. He hadn't gone home previously, so he had three day's leave saved up to withdraw anytime.</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished washing up but before he could find Fat Sun, there was a commotion in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why are they coming to our place?"</p><p></p><p>An apprentice stood up.</p><p></p><p>Over ten youths around their age but much sturdier built came to the yellow dirt yard of the middle courtyard, carrying large wooden mallets.</p><p></p><p>"The front courtyard apprentices? They're all so sturdy?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the scrawny middle courtyard chicken-like apprentices, the front courtyard ones looked like little calves, sturdy and robust.</p><p></p><p>In just over a month, his body had grown quite a bit too, but compared to these calf-like front courtyard apprentices, the gap was visibly huge.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, despite all being apprentices, there was a divide between the front and middle courtyard ones, not just in treatment within the forge, but in background and physique as well.</p><p></p><p>However, these "little calves" paled in comparison to the man behind them.</p><p></p><p>"That guy is huge!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan's eyelids twitched.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man stood over 1.9 meters tall, with bulging muscular arms, a ferocious face, and an imposing stride that inspired trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Qin guard!"</p><p></p><p>An apprentice cried out in alarm, as all the apprentices including Li Yuan hurriedly stood up to greet him along with Fat Sun.</p><p></p><p>The weapon forge was based in Gaoliuxian county, but its business had expanded to neighboring counties and even the provincial capital of Xilongfu.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the shop, apart from the master, there were also some guards. Their status was high and treatment good, second only to the shopkeeper. </p><p></p><p>Regarding these guards, Li Yuan had a deep memory - each of them had an astonishingly large appetite, equal to seven or eight apprentices.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qin Xiong!"</p><p></p><p>The chubby Sun Pang came bouncing out from the kitchen area, grinning as he went up to greet him:</p><p></p><p>"Little brother still has a jar of good wine left, shall we brothers have a couple drinks tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll see!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong's rugged face was expressionless as he turned to look at the middle courtyard apprentices lined up like quails.</p><p></p><p>"The middle courtyard ones are all here? Looking a bit too frail..."</p><p></p><p>"A few went out to transport charcoal..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Pang smiled obsequiously, "They've been fed better these days, they were even thinner before."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong responded coldly, his unsmilingdemeanor making the former middle courtyard apprentices feel somewhat short of breath.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish~</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the middle courtyard gate, with twenty or thirty apprentices, male and female, rushing over from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The rear courtyard, miscellaneous courtyard, and outer courtyard apprentices have all come?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan was slightly startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Such a big commotion?</p><p></p><p>"Good, we won't wait for anyone not here!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong's voice was very loud, his gaze fierce. Any apprentice he looked at couldn't help but breathe rapidly and unconsciously step back.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure some of you have already guessed why I've come today."</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan kept his head down, glancing sidelong at the other apprentices, and indeed saw a few of them looking delighted, causing a slight stir in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that even without being assigned to the front courtyard, there was a chance to learn martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Among the various businesses in Gaoliu County, our blacksmith shop's work is considered the most bitter and arduous. Yet whenever we recruit apprentices, there is never a shortage of eager applicants. Some even try to bribe their way into becoming our apprentices?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong glanced at Li Yuan, who kept his brows lowered obediently, though he felt a bit surprised inside.</p><p></p><p>'Second brother bribed his way in? No wonder sister-in-law looks at me with disdain...'</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan felt a bit of realization, but also some frustration.</p><p></p><p>So he was just an apprentice who had bribed his way in?! </p><p></p><p>He really didn't know about this...</p><p></p><p>"Because among all the businesses in Gaoliu County, only the Four Seasons Pharmacy, Sanhe Gang, Chai Gang, One Word Inn, Fishermen's Gang, and our blacksmith shop will teach martial arts to apprentices!</p><p></p><p>Even you middle courtyard apprentices, after working for a year or two, would normally get this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Being taught martial arts ahead of time?</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan's eyes lit up as he felt enlightened.</p><p></p><p>So second brother bribed to get him in because of this?</p><p></p><p>The apprentices were extremely excited, a few even clenching their fists unconsciously. Among them were Liu Qing, whose head was previously cracked by Sun Pang, and Niu Gui who had joined the middle courtyard shortly before or after him.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone was very sensible and didn't dare make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"You apprentices are either from impoverished families or have fallen on hard times. If you hadn't joined the blacksmith shop, at most one or two out of ten would have the chance to learn martial arts. Today, I am passing on martial arts teachings to you on behalf of the master. Remember his kindness in the future and work hard!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong's voice was loud and full of vigor, the last few sentences almost deafening.</p><p></p><p>'This vigor is a bit too much...'</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>..."</p><p></p><p>Liyan only felt his eardrums buzzing, his heart somewhat shocked, and also somewhat skeptical. </p><p></p><p>That last sentence was definitely not meant for them to hear...</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will teach you the 'White Ape Cloak Hammer'. You little brats, this is your only chance to join the inner court. Whether you can change your destiny or not depends on yourselves!" </p><p></p><p>Learning martial arts!</p><p></p><p>The White Ape Cloak Hammer!</p><p></p><p>Qin Xiong's voice echoed through the practice ground. All the apprentices couldn't help but breathe rapidly, as if the fatigue from a hard day's work had instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Children from poor families had to become breadwinners early. Those who were sent to become apprentices, which one of them didn't know the importance of a skill?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention martial arts, this was truly something that could change one's destiny!</p><p></p><p>As for joining the inner court, most apprentices remained calm instead, knowing that it was not something they could covet.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they were carrying so many big hammers..."</p><p></p><p>Liyan realized inwardly. With a sidelong glance, he saw all the apprentices tensing their bodies. Niu Gui, whose head was smashed by the fat boy Sun earlier, was even clenching his fists tightly, breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Zhong, have them get familiar with the stance first!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Qin Xiong casually pointed to an apprentice from the outer court to stay behind and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>After Qin Xiong left, the other apprentices from the outer court also dispersed, leaving only the iron hammers they had been carrying.</p><p></p><p>Only a burly young man walked to the center of the stage with a solemn face, slowly taking the stance, half-squatting, posing with his arms, like a long-armed ape.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's called the White Ape Stance!"</p><p></p><p>Liyan focused intently, trying to learn Lu Zhong's movements, but felt a little disappointed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Learn my stance!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Zhong didn't seem like someone patient enough to guide them one by one. He simply practiced the stance by himself for half a shi chen.</p><p></p><p>During that time, he briefly instructed a few apprentices like Niu Gui, then waved his hand and left.</p><p></p><p>Once he was gone, some people immediately broke their stances, not because they were lazy, but because they were truly exhausted after a day's work and lacked the stamina to continue this highly taxing stance.</p><p></p><p>"First memorize it, then practice slowly..."</p><p></p><p>Liyan also relaxed his stance, already panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>His body was even thinner than most people present, and he could hardly persevere.</p><p></p><p>He could grit his teeth and persist, but forceful practice would likely be futile and might even harm his body.</p><p></p><p>"The inner court! I've heard there's an inner court in the workshop, where the apprentices not only don't need to do chores but also get paid much higher!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget about the inner court. Being able to learn martial arts ahead of time is already a great fortune!"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows how long it will take us to master this White Ape Stance? I heard from the old apprentices sent to the mines that it takes two to three years just to get started?"</p><p></p><p>Back in the middle court, several apprentices were very excited.</p><p></p><p>"It's so tiring, how can we practice martial arts? Joining the inner court is probably impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Liyan wiped his face again, sighing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The outer court apprentices had better food, and they only did chores for half a day and practiced martial arts for the other half, with two days off every five days. As for them, not only did they get one day off every ten days, but they also had no free time during the day.</p><p></p><p>How could they compare?</p><p></p><p>It was not that they couldn't master this martial art, but it was unknown whether it would take years or decades...</p><p></p><p>As he entered the room, he turned back and saw that only Niu Gui, who had arrived at the middle court right before him, was gritting his teeth and practicing the stance in the night, drenched in sweat.</p>

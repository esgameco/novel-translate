        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Just past dawn, Li Yuan opened his eyes. Through the paper-covered window, faint light could be seen outside. On the large communal sleeping area meant for eight people, there were now only seven. </p><p></p><p>"Niu Gui is up so early?"</p><p></p><p>With the onset of deep autumn and a hint of cold in the air, Li Yuan was accustomed to sleeping fully clothed. He slipped on his straw sandals and went to the doorway.</p><p></p><p>As daylight approached, the night watchmen had all left. Under the faint light, Niu Gui was practicing martial stances, drenched in sweat despite the early autumn morning chill.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is really hardworking!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan rubbed his wrists, feeling soreness all over his shoulders, arms, waist and legs. </p><p></p><p>Their training volume yesterday was far greater than usual. And Niu Gui, he remembered the kid was still practicing when he fell asleep last night. </p><p></p><p>Yet he got up at this early hour again?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he afraid of injuring himself from overexertion?</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan shook his head in amazement, but didn't say anything. After informing the chubby Sun once he woke up, Li Yuan left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith occupied quite a large area in the outer city. Outside the central courtyard were several warehouses storing iron and charcoal. </p><p></p><p>Further ahead was a vacant field paved with yellow mud, where the blacksmith masters and guards usually trained their physical stamina.</p><p></p><p>Past this field was a row of forging rooms, their furnaces burning incessantly with swirling smoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan glanced over but saw nothing besides the clanging of metal. He was still quite curious about blacksmithing.</p><p></p><p>Even after over a month as an apprentice, his impression of blacksmithing remained stuck on the "Forging Competition" from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>The chores room was right next door. </p><p></p><p>Li Yuan waited a while before the leisurely strolling manager Lin handed him his monthly wages and a day off allowance.</p><p></p><p>Though simple, the rituals described in the Tao scripture did require some basic provisions.</p><p></p><p>"Be back before sundown, or it counts as two days off!" The small-mustached manager Lin called out from behind.</p><p></p><p>"...Mmm!"</p><p></p><p>With a sullen face, Li Yuan pocketed the thirty copper coins. It was the first time in over a month since arriving in this realm that he left the blacksmith's premises.</p><p></p><p>"So this is an 'ancient city'."</p><p></p><p>The streets were paved with large bluestone slabs, extending in both directions and lined with all sorts of shops, restaurants and inns on either side.</p><p></p><p>Gaoliu County had inner and outer cities, divided into sixteen districts by eight main roads. The blacksmith was located in the prosperous Rongsheng District of the outer city.</p><p></p><p>Looking left and right, the buildings appeared stately. Amid the cries of street vendors, pedestrians of all manners of dress seemed endless.</p><p></p><p>A true ancient city, without the constant flow of nobles and ladies, but filled with commoners hustling for basic sustenance.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang!</p><p></p><p>A patrolling constable struck a bronze gong, prompting people to make way where he passed.</p><p></p><p>A tall constable with a mole by his eye held up a portrait and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"This is the rogue bandit Nian Jiu. Anyone with information on his whereabouts will be rewarded five ounces of silver. Whoever captures him will receive fifty ounces of silver. But those who conceal information will be charged with the same crime once discovered!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifty ounces?!"</p><p></p><p>Many in the crowd gasped in astonishment, craning their necks to see the portrait.</p><p></p><p>As the constables passed by, Li Yuan caught a glimpse of the drawing.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Like the vicious bandits in the picture, he paid no heed, bowing his head to ponder his own affairs. </p><p></p><p>"The 'Initiation Ceremony' recorded in the Daoist scriptures requires the five sacrificial animals. In my previous life, I used the meat of the five animals, but now..."</p><p></p><p>Before the butcher's stall, the butcher's assistant who was chopping meat did not wait to be asked before quoting the price:</p><p></p><p>"Pork costs twenty-eight copper coins per pound..."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the wooden signboard inside the butcher's shop, Li Yuan could not help but twitch his eyelids.</p><p></p><p>He had long expected that his family could only afford one pound of pork per month, after all, the apprentices from other families would not even see a single copper coin for three years.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, do you have any pork blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Pork blood? If you want it, it's eight copper coins per pound..."</p><p></p><p>"Pork blood is that expensive too?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan felt a pang, for he only had thirty copper coins in total.</p><p></p><p>"How much blood does a pig have? Eight copper coins is still expensive? Go away, if you don't have money, don't make trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"Can you make it a bit cheaper..."</p><p></p><p>After some bargaining, Li Yuan bought half a pound of pork, and half a pound each of pork blood, sheep blood, chicken blood, and dog blood, leaving him with only four copper coins.</p><p></p><p>"The meat of the five sacrificial animals should work, and the blood of the five animals should work too, right? After all, in ancient times, many sacrificial offerings used blood..."</p><p></p><p>Weaving through the crowd, Li Yuan felt rather heavy-hearted. </p><p></p><p>He was worried whether the blood would work, and also worried whether this ritual would actually be effective.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Cattle is still missing... According to imperial law, those who slaughter cattle will be beaten with a hundred strokes, sentenced to a year and a half in prison, and exiled a thousand miles away..."</p><p></p><p>After more than an hour of searching the entire Rongsheng Street, Li Yuan still could not find a single strand of cattle hair, and had to give up reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that deer, antelope, elk, wolf, and rabbit are also considered part of the five sacrificial animals in another interpretation?"</p><p></p><p>It was not until midday that Li Yuan finally found a place selling wild rabbits. After waiting for more than an hour, he took the opportunity when someone was slaughtering rabbits to spend his last four copper coins on less than two ounces of blood.</p><p></p><p>"I've spent everything I had!"</p><p></p><p>Carrying a few bottles and jars, as well as half a pound of pork, Li Yuan left Rongsheng Street, barely able to contain his emotions.</p><p></p><p>But of course, he could not perform the ritual on the street, so he suppressed his excitement and passed through alley after alley until he reached a more remote part of the city.</p><p></p><p>Chai Yu Fang was not as prosperous as Rongsheng District, named for selling firewood and fish. From afar, Li Yuan heard someone exclaiming:</p><p></p><p>"The kid from the Liang Shan family caught a 'Spiritual Fish' called the 'Ox-horn Carp' in Jade Water Lake!"</p><p></p><p>"Liang Ashui? That kid has such skills? Didn't Liu Laizhi rob his boat?"</p><p></p><p>"A Spiritual Fish! It's been at least a year or two since anyone caught a Spiritual Fish, right?"</p><p></p><p>With a cry of astonishment, almost everyone nearby surrounded the young man carrying a basket of fish.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Fish?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan was slightly taken aback, only learning what it was from the discussions of the people around him.</p><p></p><p>Gaoliu County was nestled against the mountains and lakes, with Fagu Mountain and Jade Water Lake. The firewood and fishing gangs in the city were thus formed.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called Spiritual Fish, it was said to be a great tonic, and catching one would be enough to feed an ordinary family for two or three years.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone!" </p><p></p><p>That strong and sturdy young man cleared his throat and shouted...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>His complexion was slightly dark, his eyes piercing as he glared at the crowd gathering around him:</p><p></p><p>"This 'ox-horn croaker' weighs twelve pounds. Those who can't afford it, don't come near!"</p><p></p><p>"A twelve-pound ox-horn croaker?!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd became even more raucous, but most stopped in their tracks. Only a few who seemed to be no ordinary people walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Those seem to be people from the firewood and fishing gangs?"</p><p></p><p>Liyuan glanced at them a few times. Although curious about the so-called spiritual fish, he had no interest in gawking.</p><p></p><p>As he was quickly leaving, he heard someone behind him offer a price of "twelve ounces of silver"...</p><p></p><p>"One month's pay is thirty wen, an apprentice earns one ounce of silver in three years, and this fish costs twelve ounces..."</p><p></p><p>Liyuan was somewhat amazed but did not stop, quickly walking through a few streets to a small alley.</p><p></p><p>The alley had around ten households. At the entrance was a relatively well-maintained two-story small courtyard house, which was his home in this life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, three families lived in the small courtyard, his family, or rather his second brother's family, was just one of them.</p><p></p><p>"The youngest? You...you're back?"</p><p></p><p>Before Liyuan could knock, the courtyard gate opened. A man slightly under seven feet tall, with a somewhat weather-beaten face, excitedly and guiltily came out and grasped his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother..."</p><p></p><p>Liyuan opened his mouth but didn't know what to say, allowing the man to pull him inside.</p><p></p><p>Memories of his previous life flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>The impoverished Li family was once a middle-class household in the firewood and fishing trades. Three generations worked diligently and saved up some assets - they had fields and boats, and their life was decent.</p><p></p><p>But it took three generations to build the family up, and one generation to ruin it. His wastrel father somehow became addicted to gambling and lost everything in half a year, which killed his grandfather. Then he himself died of illness.</p><p></p><p>Only three brothers were left to fend for themselves. A few years later, the eldest Liyue went missing, and it was the second brother Lilin who raised him up...</p><p></p><p>"You haven't eaten yet? Rest a bit first, second brother will make you a meal. Your sister-in-law is out working..."</p><p></p><p>Lilin rubbed his eyes and quickly left the room. In the small house, Liyuan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an apprentice blacksmith was his previous self's idea. His second brother was nearing thirty, so after getting married, it was no longer appropriate for the brothers to live together.</p><p></p><p>After that, second brother Lilin always felt guilty, thinking he had let his brothers and parents down.</p><p></p><p>But for a poor family, sending him to be a blacksmith's apprentice was already an excellent path...</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Digesting the surging emotions in his heart, Liyuan walked out and circled around to the back courtyard piled with miscellaneous items and firewood.</p><p></p><p>"The four directions and five sacrifices..."</p><p></p><p>Liyuan murmured in his heart. Last night in his dream, he had performed the "receiving the registers ceremony" countless times. It was familiar yet still made him extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>It was like a drowning person grasping at the last lifeline...</p><p></p><p>With himself as the center, Liyuan sprinkled the blood of the five sacrifices according to the directional positions until the smell of blood filled his nose and mouth.</p><p></p><p>He then took a deep breath, bowed, and chanted simultaneously in his heart and aloud:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Liyuan has read the hundred classics and gained wisdom. I solemnly uphold the precepts to clarify my mind. With the aspiration to universally save all beings, I vow to transmit the sutras of the ancient sages..."</p>

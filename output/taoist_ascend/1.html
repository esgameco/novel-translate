            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The year 1452 of the Dayun era, Dragon's Den County, Gaoliuxian. {What? You still don't know? | Read at ReadCOM, no missing chapters | Quick, google it!}</p><p></p><p>Creak~</p><p></p><p>Glancing back at the messy commoners' quarters, Li Yuan pushed open the door and went out, not waiting for the last person to leave the room. </p><p></p><p>The morning fog of late autumn had not completely dissipated yet, but wispy cooking smoke had already risen within Gaoliuxian County Town. Faintly, some human voices could be heard.</p><p></p><p>What entered his eyes was a small courtyard, where six or seven youths around his age, dressed in hemp clothes and about fifteen or sixteen years old, were busily working.</p><p></p><p>Washing up, chopping firewood, fetching water, lighting the fire, cooking meals...</p><p></p><p>"Huff!"</p><p></p><p>Tightening his thin gray hemp clothes, Li Yuan took a deep breath and joined in among the shouts of the apprentices.</p><p></p><p>The day for an apprentice of the "Weapons Forge" began with chopping firewood and fetching water.</p><p></p><p>"Just one month and three days, how can I endure twelve years? This is too difficult...Learning a few things in the previous life was not easy, this life is even harder!"</p><p></p><p>Busying himself nimbly with his hands and feet, Li Yuan could not help sighing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, learning from his rural Daoist master things like building mountain graves, performing rites for the dead, assisting difficult childbirths, he only spent two or three years on it.</p><p></p><p>But the apprenticeship at the "Weapons Forge" actually requires twelve years!</p><p></p><p>Three years as a menial laborer, two years as an assistant worker, seven years as an indentured servant!</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan inwardly complained, but did not dare slow down his hands, only sighing that he had "awakened" too late - when he woke up, he had already "sold himself" to the "Weapons Forge."</p><p></p><p>And because his body was too frail, he was not assigned to the front courtyard...</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a muffled sound came from the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>The fat man holding a large ladle kicked over a gray-clothed apprentice with one foot, the folds of fat on his face swinging:</p><p></p><p>"You son of a bitch, I suffered so much to learn this skill of tossing the ladle when cooking, and you dare try to learn it by stealing?!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Sun Ladle, I was wrong, I won't dare again, I won't dare..."</p><p></p><p>That apprentice howled while clutching his head, but did not dare dodge, enduring a vicious beating.</p><p></p><p>The group of apprentices in the small courtyard fell silent as crickets in winter. Li Yuan lowered his head, his expression wooden.</p><p></p><p>If an apprentice made a mistake, it was natural for the masters to scold and beat them as they wished - this was written in the "indenture contract."</p><p></p><p>The saying "Disciple disciple, three years as a slave" was not just words.</p><p></p><p>That fat Sun who tossed the ladle counted as a semi-master, managing more than a dozen apprentices like them, as well as over a hundred people's meals at the Weapons Forge. His vicious temper meant scolding and beating apprentices was daily routine.</p><p></p><p>When Li Yuan first came a month ago, he almost had his head cracked open by that ladle...</p><p></p><p>"Move your hands and feet more nimbly! The masters of the front courtyard will be getting up soon. If you delay their meals, it won't just be a few kicks!"</p><p></p><p>That fat Sun waved the ladle and scolded them loudly.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The apprentice did not dare to raise his head, but his hands and feet moved even faster. </p><p></p><p>Until the fat man went back to the kitchen, the beaten apprentice finally crawled up silently, even though his whole body was in excruciating pain, he dared not delay working.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan's expression was wooden.</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith shop was one of the largest in Gaoliu County, housing around 180 guards, masters, workers, and apprentices. </p><p></p><p>Apprentices, naturally the lowest in status, not only received little pay and poor food, but were also frequently beaten and scolded. To get better treatment, one had to at least become a worker, or even a master.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve years..."</p><p></p><p>When the four red suns rose above the sea of clouds, the meal was finally ready, and the busy apprentices' faces showed some smiles.</p><p></p><p>Apart from mealtime, the apprentices really had no free time all day long. </p><p></p><p>Chopping wood, fetching water, preparing charcoal, moving various iron ingots, wiping weapons, cleaning...</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, there was no shortage of people coming to be apprentices at the blacksmith shop.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the blacksmith shop offered the best treatment for taking in apprentices in Gaoliu County.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there a monthly salary of thirty copper plates, but the food was also much better than places like pharmacies or carpentry shops.</p><p></p><p>Blacksmithing was extremely arduous work, one couldn't do it on an empty stomach.</p><p></p><p>Of course, apprentices didn't get this treatment. Only once every seven days could they get a little grease, but all the apprentices were already very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>At other places, they could only get a taste of meat on the 1st and 15th of the month, some didn't even see any grease all year round...</p><p></p><p>When the sun rose to its peak and the "ding dang" sounds of blacksmithing could vaguely be heard from the front courtyard, the apprentices finally got their breakfast and a moment of rest.</p><p></p><p>"It takes three years to become a worker..."</p><p></p><p>The apprentices squatted in groups of three or two against the walls. Li Yuan sat in a corner with his bowl of food, his shoulders aching as he held the steamed bun, feeling a tinge of sourness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, although he was an unaffiliated rural Taoist priest without official status, he still had a decent life following his master around villages. Even at the worst of times, it was never as miserable as this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he couldn't help but miss his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Beer, drinks, small barbecues, air conditioning, TV, sofa, cell phone... even his late master who was obsessed with getting official Taoist status until his dying breath.</p><p></p><p>"How did I end up reincarnating here?! Can I go back?!"</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the steamed bun with the rice soup, Li Yuan looked up at the four red suns in the sky, almost in tears.</p><p></p><p>How did he end up reincarnating here?</p><p></p><p>Over the past month, Li Yuan had thought about this question countless times, recalling his memories before the reincarnation over and over again.</p><p></p><p>As an unaffiliated rural Taoist priest, after his master passed away, he could barely make a living performing rituals for weddings and funerals in the village...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help it, so he changed careers and opened a small supermarket in his hometown county. Although he didn't have much money, it was peaceful.</p><p></p><p>"That day I was lounging on the sofa playing with my phone, and then...wait, the talisman initiation ceremony!" </p><p></p><p>As if struck by a bolt of lightning piercing through the fog, Li Yuan shuddered, nearly spilling the half bowl of rice soup onto the floor!</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the talisman initiation ceremony!"</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the palpitations in his heart, Li Yuan squatted back down, not drawing anyone else's attention, but his thoughts couldn't help wandering.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, his master who never made it into the official Taoist ranks had left him half a volume of Taoist scriptures. </p><p></p><p>He had read through those scriptures a few times, but wasn't particularly interested in them or in his late master's lifelong obsession with "becoming an immortal through talisman initiation."</p><p></p><p>Until the day before he was reincarnated, he didn't know why he suddenly thought of the ceremony recorded in those books.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>"Was it really because of that ceremony?"</p><p></p><p>Gulping down half a bowl of rice soup, Li Yuan still couldn't stop muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think that so-called talisman initiation ceremony could cause his reincarnation, but besides that, he really couldn't think of any other possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Talisman initiation, initiation from the Azure Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course he was familiar with talisman initiation.</p><p></p><p>Taoists believe that talismans are formed naturally by heaven and earth, copied by immortals, and transmitted to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Only after receiving the transmission of talismans can Taoists register their names in the celestial ranks, obtain Taoist positions and divine duties, and then wield talismans to command ghosts and gods, pacify the five directions, subdue demons, cure illnesses and avert disasters with unthinkable divine powers.</p><p></p><p>"Could the old man's lifelong obsession with 'becoming an immortal through talisman initiation' actually be real?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan murmured to himself.  </p><p></p><p>Originally he didn't believe in the old man's obsession. In this day and age, who still believed in that talisman initiation path to immortality?</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he knew several Taoists who had received talisman initiation, but none of them showed any divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the half volume of scriptures didn't record the orthodox talisman initiation ceremony.  </p><p></p><p>It's known that the orthodox ceremony not only involves receiving talismans, but also sutras, precepts, and ordination, requiring a talisman initiation altar, ordination masters, and recommending masters.</p><p></p><p>While the so-called "Azure Heaven Talisman Initiation" recorded in those scriptures was actually quite simple, even crude...</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"I've already reincarnated, so what's impossible? But then again...what if?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>Rationally, he told himself this was unlikely, but deep down he still clung to a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>What if?  </p><p></p><p>"What if I, no, what if this Taoist priest actually has the karmic destiny for talisman initiation and immortality?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more Li Yuan's heart palpitated with excitement. If he didn't know the current time was unsuitable, he would hate to delay and want to perform the ceremony immediately.  </p><p></p><p>To hell with being a disciple, laborer, master or shopkeeper!</p><p></p><p>This Taoist priest wants to go home!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The path leading to the Sky Temple in the City of Divine Servants was steep and winding, with intricately carved cloud-shaped handrails, surrounded by the sky and sea of clouds. Walking on it was like treading on the stairway to heaven, involuntarily evoking a sense of piety and awe in one's heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xing was running quickly upwards, her steps filled with eagerness. She was desperately wanting to see that figure and tell him the news that she was no longer the queen.</p><p></p><p>She arrived at the Garden of the Divine Chalice and saw Bolo crouching in a corner, fiddling with flower pots like a child. Seeing this scene, she suddenly recalled the first time she met Bolo and couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Bolo had suddenly rushed out from the flower beds of the Sun Chalice, and she thought she had seen some kind of monster, giving her a fright.</p><p></p><p>Throughout her journey, he had always been by her side, coming to her aid in her most difficult and dangerous times.</p><p></p><p>She quietly approached Bolo from behind, as if wanting to surprise him, and suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"It's not like you to be so quiet."</p><p></p><p>Bolo raised his finger: "Shh!"</p><p></p><p>"They're asleep."</p><p></p><p>To Bolo, these Sun Chalices were all alive, like naive little children, even though they had not yet become dream imps or gained wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Bolo carefully walked out with Xing, and only when they were outside did he lean in and whisper to her.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly come here? Shouldn't you be discussing matters with them?"</p><p></p><p>Xing smiled and said, "The discussion is over."</p><p></p><p>Bolo seemed happy: "So soon?"</p><p></p><p>Xing nodded, her words carrying a deeper meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Not only is the discussion over now, but there will be no more discussions in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I'll have more time to spend with you."</p><p></p><p>"Bolo."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Bolo's response, she looked at him earnestly: "For so many years, I've been keeping you confined here. It must have been hard on you!"</p><p></p><p>Bolo shook his head and swayed his body from side to side, looking content.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to stay with you, and I'm happy."</p><p></p><p>He raised his eyebrows, revealing a slightly mischievous expression.</p><p></p><p>"Although..."</p><p></p><p>"It has been a bit stuffy."</p><p></p><p>Xing suddenly said, "If that's the case, then let's go traveling and adventuring together!"</p><p></p><p>Bolo glanced at Xing, not immediately believing her words, thinking she was just...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Comforting herself.</p><p></p><p>She smiled and said, "You're so busy, how can you leave?"</p><p></p><p>Yet Xing continued, "I won't be the queen anymore, nor will I be the priestess of the Celestial Temple."</p><p></p><p>Polo was dazed, "Then what about the throne?"</p><p></p><p>Xing shook her head, "From the very beginning, I was never suited to be a queen."  </p><p></p><p>"I have accomplished everything I could, and it's time to pass the role of high priestess of the Celestial Temple and the throne to more suitable younger people."</p><p></p><p>She smiled and hugged Polo tightly against her body.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you always say you wanted to travel and adventure in the outside world? To see what this world is really like?"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we are free."</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer bound by the throne or the priestess role, nor do I have to be busy every day."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I will accompany you every day, and we can go wherever you want."</p><p></p><p>Polo looked at Xing speechlessly for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He was touched and extremely happy.</p><p></p><p>The smile on his face gradually spread, like the sun's rays shining down, warm and brilliant.</p><p></p><p>"So when shall we depart?"</p><p></p><p>Xing had let go of everything, with only Polo in her eyes now.</p><p></p><p>"Whenever you want to depart, we'll depart then."</p><p></p><p>Polo gestured excitedly, the shape of his raised hands under the golden robe twirling Xing around.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go now!"</p><p></p><p>Xing smiled and nodded, "Then now it is."</p><p></p><p>Polo laughed heartily, "The queen's story has ended, now it's the travel story of Xing and Polo."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go together to the ends of the world no one has ever reached, to see the most magnificent sights, and have the greatest adventures."</p><p></p><p>Xing: "No matter where we go, as long as you're by my side."</p><p></p><p>Polo took Xing's hand, and the two transformed into a streak of starlight, disappearing from the Divine Chalice Garden of the Celestial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The starlight traveled far into the sky and dissipated in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that people saw two golden and silver figures running on the ocean surface, while others saw dreamlike golden and silver figures circling the burning meteors falling at the summit of a volcano.</p><p></p><p>Some merchants encountered two strange people on their journey, hearing them recount legendary stories, but could never recall what they looked like afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The story of the Star Queen and the Divine Messenger will forever be passed down in the realms of Heynce and the Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>Wherever there is something new, their figures will appear.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Land Blessed by God.</p><p></p><p>A dream bubble burst in the distance, but that mysterious force drifted across the sea, arriving at the legendary realm of the God Insei. </p><p></p><p>Ever since Polo created the race of Dream Sprites, this land blessed by God had become lively.</p><p></p><p>These Dream Sprites perhaps not only inherited Polo's mythical bloodline, but also his innocent and romantic nature. All day long, besides frolicking and playing, they had nothing else to do, forever unaware of what worries were.</p><p></p><p>They flitted through the seas of flowers in the blessed land, flew by the seaside and in the sky. The only thing they feared was Shari.</p><p></p><p>"Hee hee!"</p><p></p><p>"Come catch me!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to, I want to sleep."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to the temple to deliver a message." A dream bubble suddenly emerged from a Dream Sprite's flower cup. It paused for a moment, then looked towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Is that scary monster inside the temple too?" The other Dream Sprites shrank back in fear.</p><p></p><p>They weren't afraid of meeting the God, but feared the Luhu Giant King lurking in the temple.</p><p></p><p>This Dream Sprite entered the temple gates as if venturing into the land of the dead, trembling as it carefully peeked its head inside.</p><p></p><p>"Huh!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not here!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the Dream Sprite revealed a joyful expression, a slender hand reached out from the side, grabbing it and bringing it before the God.</p><p></p><p>The blossoming flower cup held the dream bubble, which kept expanding until its diameter reached over a meter.</p><p></p><p>"God."</p><p></p><p>"Your messenger pays respects to you."</p><p></p><p>In the dream bubble, images of Polo and the stars appeared.</p><p></p><p>Following that, beautiful scenes emerged one after another in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>There was a city in the pouring rain, Trifolians fishing by the sea at sunset, an erupting volcano, and a mirage of an ocean of clouds that a merchant caravan saw while crossing the desert.</p><p></p><p>The myriad phenomena of life - this desolate world became wondrous only by having life within it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to volcanoes and mirages, life itself is the greatest miracle of this world.</p><p></p><p>And in each of these scenes, Polo and the stars were present.</p><p></p><p>At the end, Polo and the stars bowed to the God: "Great God."</p><p></p><p>"This is the gift Polo offers to you. Although Polo cannot travel with you, he can be the eyes of God."</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"The outside world is truly wondrous."</p><p></p><p>A white radiance emanated from the God statue, and within that light, a shadowy figure slowly opened its eyes, casting its gaze upon the changing illusions in the dream bubble.</p>

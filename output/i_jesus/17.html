            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Palace of Wisdom. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Laidley Ki summoned his other four sons and two daughters, along with the nobles of the God-given City, to bear witness together. </p><p></p><p>The nobles whispered among themselves in discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Is there something happening again?"</p><p></p><p>"Prince Yesser hasn't departed yet, will there be a change of events?"</p><p></p><p>"Something that has already been decided, what change of events could there be?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the King has changed his mind!"</p><p></p><p>In the tall and rugged palace hall, the most eye-catching were the carved Laidley Ki script stone tablets on the walls.</p><p></p><p>The script stone tablets he created by hand were inlaid around the walls of the palace in a circle, adding a thick atmosphere of civilization to this palace, while also displaying his greatness.</p><p></p><p>Laidley Ki sat on the throne, with his queen sitting beside him. One could see the queen was very happy, looking at her children with encouraging and expectant eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King's majestic gaze fell upon his kneeling offspring: "Enss!"</p><p></p><p>The eldest son Enss stood at the very front of the group. He stepped forward: "Wise King."</p><p></p><p>Laidley Ki looked at him.</p><p></p><p>This child who had once brought him boundless joy and anticipation when he was born, but was later abandoned by him due to disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"I told you all that I would give you a chance."</p><p></p><p>"I am your father, and also your king."</p><p></p><p>"A king's promise will never be broken, be it to the gods or to you."</p><p></p><p>Laidley Ki stood up from the throne, his tall stature and majestic bearing causing everyone to bend at the waist.</p><p></p><p>He stepped down from the high platform, while also revealing the reason for today's summons.</p><p></p><p>"Last night."</p><p></p><p>"I prayed to the gods to bestow my power upon you, and they agreed."  </p><p></p><p>"They have shed the radiance of power upon you."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards!"</p><p></p><p>"You shall bask in the glory of the gods and become their priests."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Laidley Ki also descended from the high platform to stand before the princes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone saw a radiance emanating from Laidley Ki's body, as if countless fireflies were spilling out from within him.</p><p></p><p>Sacred,</p><p></p><p>Yet dreamlike beyond compare.</p><p></p><p>However, what the Trifolians focused on more were Laidley Ki's words. One could see the people present showing shocked expressions, their pupils instantly dilating.</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined the King could actually bestow his immensely powerful, wise abilities to others.</p><p></p><p>What did this represent?</p><p></p><p>The true Trifolian royal bloodline was about to emerge, transcending all else.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King's power would not disappear with him...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As the light faded, the divine beings reclaimed their wisdom and power, which would forever rule over the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King Laedrelic placed his hand on his eldest son's head, his once stern gaze now gentle and warm. </p><p></p><p>"I bestow my power upon you, may the authority of wisdom be granted to your bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"Neither the vast seas nor the deep abysses shall hinder your steps, nor shall the high mountains and lands be the end of your path."</p><p></p><p>"My children!"  </p><p></p><p>"The Divine City is merely your starting point, go forth to the ends of the seas and lands to forge your own world!"</p><p></p><p>Laedrelic spoke the name of the divine spell.</p><p></p><p>"Power bestowed."</p><p></p><p>Those firefly-like specks of light instantly scattered, swirling like a starry sky above the palace, before merging into Ens' body.</p><p></p><p>However, Ens did not see the gentleness and expectation in his father's eyes, for he was utterly immersed in the euphoria of gaining power.</p><p></p><p>He felt immensely powerful, extraordinarily special.  </p><p></p><p>He was no longer a mere mortal born to the great Wise King.</p><p></p><p>He was.</p><p></p><p>The wielder of the authority of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knelt down, fervently calling out to the Wise King.</p><p></p><p>"God Ens!"  </p><p></p><p>"The Wise King!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>They longed for the Wise King's radiance to shine upon them, to bask in even the slightest glimmer, for it was the supreme authority bestowed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>Laedrelic divided most of his power into six parts and gave them to all his sons and daughters.  </p><p></p><p>However, only the part that could communicate with all beings, the supreme authority to control the wisdom of all Trifoliate people, remained with Laedrelic himself.</p><p></p><p>In a corner, a noble of the Divine City carved this great scene onto a stone tablet. A few days later, this painting was hung in his mansion, attracting countless people from the city to come and revere it.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet became the most precious treasure of this noble family, and the people of the Divine City gave this painting a name.</p><p></p><p>They called it 'The Bloodline of Kingship'.</p><p></p><p>With the power bestowed, instead of one prince originally meant to leave the Divine City to establish a new realm, there were now four, causing a great commotion throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King's eldest son, second son, and eldest daughter would also venture into the seas, seeking a warm sea region or island to establish their domain.  </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, once preparations were complete, the remaining princes would follow suit, becoming the new pioneers.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King's eldest son Ens, riding a fusion beast, led his followers to turn back before the Divine City.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Yesser!" </p><p></p><p>"I won't lose to you!"</p><p></p><p>"I will be the future King of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>A large group of Trifolians left the God-Given City, splitting off in different directions towards the ocean, opening a new chapter of Trifolian civilization. </p><p></p><p>Batch after batch of people left, and the once lively and crowded God-Given City also became much quieter.</p><p></p><p>------------------</p><p></p><p>The sunshine was bright.</p><p></p><p>Huge waves rose in the middle of the ocean, and at this moment, huge beasts of different shapes appeared on the surface of the sea, some looking like sea urchins, others like starfish or jellyfish in form.</p><p></p><p>But they all originated from the same race, the mythical fusion creatures.</p><p></p><p>On the top of the head of each giant beast stood many Trifolians, led by the princes and princesses who had left the God-Given City to open up new territories long ago. They controlled the giant beasts, tearing through the ocean towards the distant islands.</p><p></p><p>After many years, they had returned to their homeland.  </p><p></p><p>The land blessed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Ens looked into the distance with a slightly dazed look in his eyes: "The God-Given City."</p><p></p><p>Yesser turned and smiled at his followers: "We have finally returned, with glory."</p><p></p><p>A female Trifolian held her child's hand: "I wonder how father is doing."</p><p></p><p>They returned on this day because it was the birthday of the King of Wisdom, Leadley.</p><p></p><p>The ten princes and princesses came to the God-Given City as lords to pay respects to the King of Wisdom, offering him their gifts.  </p><p></p><p>At the same time, they told the King of Wisdom that they had completed their mission and opened up new territories.</p><p></p><p>The city ruled by the King of Wisdom had expanded from one God-Given City to eight, and everything was moving towards an even brighter future.</p><p></p><p>The ocean, which Trifolians had once deeply feared, no longer seemed terrifying to them. Venturing into the deep sea to discover new unknown realms had become a favorite topic of discussion among the young people.</p><p></p><p>The city-states had spread out.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a kingdom.</p><p></p><p>A nobleman of the God-Given City came forward, bowed, and then knelt down and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Great King of Wisdom!"</p><p></p><p>"The God-Given City has become the capital, it is time to give a name to the nation you have created."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, all the princes and princesses are here today, please name your kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Leadley had thought about this long ago. With a gratified and proud look, he said to his children:</p><p></p><p>"You have done well, worthy of being my descendants."</p><p></p><p>"You have not disgraced the power bestowed upon you by the gods, nor the supreme honor of being a Priest of God."</p><p></p><p>He stood up and raised the scepter in his hand high.</p><p></p><p>"The Heinse Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you are all part of the Heinse Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The Heinse Kingdom.</p>

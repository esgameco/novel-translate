        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By the side of the underground river, the Moon Fern suddenly shook violently. ‚ô®‚ôúÔºñ‚ûàùî∞ÂçÑ«óùê±.ÂåöÔºØÁà™üíù‚ôî</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern opened its fruit pod and vomited out something, and a figure arched down from above into the dark underground river with a splash.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito emerged from the river water and climbed up the shore, looking at the Moon Fern.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!"</p><p></p><p>He wiped the water off his face and rubbed his eyes, unable to help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>He felt a sense of escaping death, but at the same time found the way he escaped amusing.</p><p></p><p>He had used illusion magic to gradually trick the Moon Fern into thinking the stone bowl was itself, and then made it expel him as a foreign object.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern was still diligently guarding the "stone bowl" it had imprisoned, while the real Stan Tito had transformed into a foreign object and fled.</p><p></p><p>He quickly left, but soon turned back.</p><p></p><p>He dug out a fist-sized node from the Moon Fern's fleshy tendrils, intending to use it as a medium for casting illusion magic.</p><p></p><p>He felt this thing was much more powerful than the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>Although the Moon Fern twisted its vines in an uncomfortable manner, without its master controlling it, it ultimately allowed Stan Tito to take a piece of "flesh" from it.</p><p></p><p>All the way up, Stan Tito gripped the magical medium carefully.</p><p></p><p>However, the enemies and battles he had anticipated never appeared, and the heavily guarded passage was now completely deserted.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito even found many hastily abandoned weapons and items in the passage, indicating that the guards had fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a bone spear and a stone hammer: "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Has Henir's army attacked?"</p><p></p><p>The first idea that came to his mind was that it was likely the army of the Henir Dynasty that had arrived at the capital of Samos, causing the kingdom's guards to flee in such a hurry.</p><p></p><p>As he walked further, he discovered something unusual.</p><p></p><p>At the exit, he saw several corpses.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he couldn't even tell if they were corpses or just a pile of rotten flesh, with various unreasonable organs growing out of this pile of decay, a combination of bony hands and insect legs, exoskeletons and insect shells intertwined.</p><p></p><p>Even when he pried open the rotten flesh with the bone spear, he found three misshapen, bloodied heads of different sizes on the other side.</p><p></p><p>This thing was truly nauseating.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito considered himself a well-traveled person, but he had never seen such an existence before.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster is this?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is... a Trilobe?"</p><p></p><p>"He is a guard of the Samos Palace."</p><p></p><p>He noticed the remaining exoskeleton on the neck of one of the heads, bearing the imprint of a palace guard.</p><p></p><p>His footsteps quickened as he ran towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight from the exit gradually shone in, making Stan Tito, who had been in the darkness, a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, he walked out of the darkness and looked towards the city of Hoan.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Then a huge rock fell from the sky, crushing a building dozens of meters away from him, and the debris and smoke rushed towards him.</p><p></p><p>There were also terrifying beams of light crisscrossing like a grid, accompanied by the heart-wrenching cries of despair.</p><p></p><p>As his eyes gradually adjusted to the bright light, his vision became clearer.</p><p></p><p>He saw a city being gradually destroyed, with corpses strewn all over the streets.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying giant beast was rampaging in the city, twisting and swinging its body, destroying one building after another, smashing and flinging large and small rocks with its tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Its body was covered with hundreds of eyeballs, all of which were now rolling and shooting out beam after beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Anyone hit by the beams would instantly turn into the rotten flesh that Stan Tito had just seen.</p><p></p><p>Countless Trilobe had mutated into horrifying monsters, and then met a tragic end, not at all like the war scene he had imagined with Henir's army attacking.</p><p></p><p>This was more like a natural disaster, or the divine retribution that the desperate cries had called for.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Samos Kingdom had never seen such a terrible thing before. The Desert Worm had once been their proud guardian deity, the foundation of the kingdom's power, but now it had become the Grim Reaper that brought disaster and death.</p><p></p><p>"The Desert Worm?"</p><p></p><p>"How could it have become like this?"</p><p></p><p>Countless people were fleeing down the streets, and Stan Tito rushed down as well, avoiding the mutated beams of light and approaching the now completely unrecognizable Desert Worm.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm let out another agonized cry.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It roared, and on its body appeared countless faces of the Xiyinxai people, their eyes reflecting a variety of figures.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito heard the voice of Princess Saliman: "Enough! End it!"</p><p></p><p>"End it, don't continue anymore."</p><p></p><p>The face of the Crazy King also appeared: "Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill Heniel, absolutely cannot let him go."</p><p></p><p>"The kingdom is ours, the Xiyinxai are also ours."</p><p></p><p>Among the mythical blood of the wisdom and power of the giant monster's devouring, the two individuals with the strongest bloodline and will were King Samo and Princess Saliman. Their individual influence on the desert worm was the most intense.</p><p></p><p>But the most terrifying thing was the will of the multitude of tormented and devoured kingdom priests, whose tortured, chaotic and crazy wills conflicted and twisted, ultimately transforming into a desire to destroy and devour everything.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Saliman?</p><p></p><p>"And the King?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked at those faces, and the familiar voices.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what exactly happened, he knew that all these changes must be related to the King and Princess Saliman.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the city ravaged and trampled by the giant monster, he felt he should do something.</p><p></p><p>But first,</p><p></p><p>he must find out how the desert worm became like this -</p><p></p><p>The desire to kill and devour filled the will of the desert worm, and it kept attacking the most densely populated areas.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of people were driven to frantically flee into the distance, they had been completely terrified, they just wanted to get away from that terrible giant monster.</p><p></p><p>In their panicked escape, they were eventually trapped at the city walls. </p><p></p><p>This was a dead end.</p><p></p><p>They could not climb over the walls, they had nowhere to flee.</p><p></p><p>They could only hide their bodies in the corners of the buildings, avoiding the beams of death and curse that swept through.</p><p></p><p>The mutant light passed through once, and apart from the crowd on the main road, most managed to survive by hiding in the buildings.</p><p></p><p>But as the desert worm approached, they ultimately had no choice but to face their doom.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Trileaf people on the street turn into monsters and die, witnessing their horrific deaths, those hiding in the buildings completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to die, I don't want to die like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are we suffering this curse."</p><p></p><p>"This is the wrath of the gods, the Ruhe giant monster is here to punish us."</p><p></p><p>"Oh King!"</p><p></p><p>"What have you done? Why has Huoan City suffered this divine retribution?"</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd were many nobles, who recognized the crazed King's face constantly appearing on the giant monster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the figure that had been chasing the desert worm finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito leapt from a rooftop and landed on the desert worm, placing his hand on its eyeball.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Art: Illusory Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gripping the stalk of the Moon Fern, he mustered all his strength to unleash an illusory realm.</p><p></p><p>Layers of dreamlike light spread out, penetrating into the desert worm's eyeball, the illusion art he displayed far surpassing his previous abilities, imitating the epic stories recorded in the Tito family, trying to temporarily pull the desert worm's consciousness into an illusory dream, like the divine messenger Baro of old.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, a being like the desert worm could not be controlled or influenced by his illusion art.</p><p></p><p>The eyeball continued to tremble violently, and hundreds of eyeballs turned to look at Stan Tito, the will of death and cruelty unleashed towards him without disguise.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a strange glow surged with the contraction of the desert worm's pupils.</p><p></p><p>The next round of mutant light was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>In the urgency of the moment, Stan Tito shouted out, "Saliman!"</p><p></p><p>The desert worm's movements suddenly stopped, and a trace of humanity appeared in its crazed pupils as it looked at Stan Tito with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The giant monster suddenly spoke in the Trileaf language, using a familiar voice to Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"St...Sta...n!"</p><p></p><p>Although Stan Tito had already guessed, hearing the response still left him in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really you?"</p><p></p><p>And with that, Stan Tito's illusory realm succeeded.</p><p></p><p>He finally managed to pull the desert worm into the illusion before the mutant beam could be released.</p><p></p><p>The citizens of the Kingdom of Samo at the city walls also noticed this scene, and they immediately changed from avoiding the mutant light to a desperate dash.</p><p></p><p>"It's stopped, it's stopped!"</p><p></p><p>"Run, quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Run to the streets, run out of the city!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito kept delving deeper into the monster's consciousness, trying to find the existence he wanted to find.</p><p></p><p>He gradually severed his connection to reality, falling into a dark, void consciousness.</p>

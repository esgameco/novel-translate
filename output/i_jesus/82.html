        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the City of the Descended God, the hidden reef beach remained the same as always. ◦•●◉✿ 6⓯𝐬ʰ𝕦𝓍.¢Ⓞм ✿◉●•◦</p><p></p><p>The Prince of the Volcanic Kingdom knelt on the ground facing the Ruhei Giant Monster, as if waiting for someone's arrival.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the final chapter of the great poet, his heart dripping with blood.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he would even be willing to exchange everything he had in his hands for that last page.</p><p></p><p>Without this last page, everything he had obtained before was completely in vain, and it could even be said that he had been making a wedding dress for someone else.</p><p></p><p>He hated the person who had betrayed him to the bone, if it were not for the fact that the other party had already returned to the Volcanic Kingdom with glory and everything, instead of risking staying here.</p><p></p><p>After a long wait.</p><p></p><p>The Ruhei Giant Monster in the form of a burrowing worm suddenly twisted violently, the flesh and blood cracked open, squeezing out one eye after another, the eyeballs rolling around in confusion before finally focusing on the prince, and the foolish Ruhei Giant Monster actually spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Art!"</p><p></p><p>"Consciousness Projection!"</p><p></p><p>The initial rough and strange tone gradually turned into a hoarse middle-aged three-leaf person's voice.</p><p></p><p>This was the King of the Volcanic Kingdom contacting the prince through this method, transmitting his will from the capital of the Volcanic Kingdom thousands of miles away to here.</p><p></p><p>The Prince knelt on the ground and told his father everything about his journey.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Volcanic Kingdom's voice did not reveal any joy or anger, only majesty and command.</p><p></p><p>"At all costs."</p><p></p><p>"If necessary, I will dispatch another Ruhei Giant Monster from the kingdom to cooperate with you, and all our people in the City of the Descended God will obey your orders."</p><p></p><p>"Wei, you know how important it is to us, to the three-leaf people and the Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>"Definitely."</p><p></p><p>"You must get the last bone plate, do you hear me?"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Volcanic Kingdom's tone was extremely severe, even harsh.</p><p></p><p>Wei is the meaning of history, and generally only the royal family and the great nobles dare to use such a grand name. 🐟✌6⓯ⓢнยא.𝓒𝕠ｍ👮🐤</p><p></p><p>Prince Wei was obviously already accustomed to his father's harshness and severity, and he also demanded the same of himself.</p><p></p><p>"My King!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely return victorious."</p><p></p><p>"Only the victor is worthy of having everything, worthy of enjoying the cheers and basking in glory."</p><p></p><p>The King of the Volcanic Kingdom said satisfactorily, "I will be waiting for your triumphant return in the capital."</p><p></p><p>Prince Wei completed the conversation with his father and immediately entered the City of the Descended God to arrange the next step of the plan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the City of the Descended God, in a civilian house next to the canal dug by Yesaer in the past.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of the Volcanic Kingdom gathered the forces and spies of the kingdom within the City of the Descended God, among whom were several merchants, bureaucrats, and nobles, as well as a mid-level military officer responsible for guarding the city.</p><p></p><p>"Keep an eye on the Lord of the City of the Descended God, and watch for any movement within the city."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, inside and outside the city, try every means to find one thing."</p><p></p><p>The people whispered to each other: "Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>"What are we looking for exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of the Volcanic Kingdom did not explicitly say, but took out one of the bone plates from "Tito's Travels" and said to them.</p><p></p><p>"Find a bone plate exactly the same as this ancient one."</p><p></p><p>"In short, all the ancient engraved bone plates that have appeared inside and outside the City of the Descended God recently, you must investigate them all."</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Tito Town.</p><p></p><p>The young craftsman Stan came to the outskirts of the town with a heavy basket, the basket filled with stone slabs and bone plates engraved with text.</p><p></p><p>But he found that the entire town had been sealed off, with soldiers surrounding Tito Town, not allowing anyone to enter.</p><p></p><p>Stan is the meaning of stone slab, and from his name, it can be seen that his father must have been a craftsman who made stone slab inscriptions for a living, and he had inherited his father's profession after growing up.§.•´¨'°÷•..× ➅⓯𝓼Ⓗยχ.𝕔ｏ𝐦 ×,.•´¨'°÷•..§</p><p></p><p>And Stan's full name should be Stan·Tito, he is also a descendant of the Tito family.</p><p></p><p>But the common three-leaf people do not have surnames, only the true nobles can have surnames.</p><p></p><p>Over the centuries, only a few have inherited the noble title of the Tito family, while the others have gradually become commoners and no longer nobles, relying on the Tito family as craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The young craftsman was obviously unaware of the tragedy that had occurred in Tito Town, as he would come to deliver the works he had carved every month.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned to hear the words of an old man outside the town: "They're... they're all dead?"</p><p></p><p>"So there's no one to receive them now?"</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded: "They're all gone, no one is in charge now, you don't need to bring anything over anymore."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Take the goods to the market in the City of Divine Descent and sell them! You can get a good price, much better than just sending them here."</p><p></p><p>The young craftsman, for the sake of his livelihood, could only shoulder his basket and hurry towards the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>On the way, the craftsman first saw a piece of dried-up rope.</p><p></p><p>As he walked on, he stepped into the sand and tumbled head over heels, but at the same time he also stepped on a bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He realized this should be an old bone tablet, and as a skilled craftsman, he immediately became interested and picked it up.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman brought the bone tablet to the market in the City of Divine Descent, laid out his own carved works of the "Epic of Xin" and the "Ode to the King of Wisdom" on the ground for sale, and then began to examine the found bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>In the sunlight, he read the words on it one by one.</p><p></p><p>After all, he did not have the spiritual power like those who possessed the power of wisdom, so he could not just glance through and remember it.</p><p></p><p>The words on the bone tablet had become a bit blurred over the years, but they were still vaguely recognizable.</p><p></p><p>"The messenger of the gods? What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Whose myth is this?"</p><p></p><p>"What character is this?"</p><p></p><p>The young craftsman was from the Tito family and could read, but he did not recognize this character. </p><p></p><p>It was very strange, it felt like a character that had the pronunciation engraved on it as well.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw it, a voice immediately resonated in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Hope?"</p><p></p><p>"Xian?"</p><p></p><p>"Hira?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how he read it, it felt wrong: "It's not right, it should be pronounced like this..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to pronounce this strange syllable, the voice got stuck in his throat and he couldn't get it out.</p><p></p><p>As if this name was not something an ordinary person could utter, it belonged to a person who possessed the power of wisdom, who could only summon this name through the trembling of the mythological bloodline power.</p><p></p><p>Stan immediately felt that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>This feeling made him realize that the object in his hand was definitely not simple, and he became increasingly eager to decipher the words on it.</p><p></p><p>A group of people were wandering around the market, stopping specifically at the stalls selling bone artifacts, as if they were looking for something.</p><p></p><p>One of them stopped in front of the craftsman Stan, just as the young craftsman was reading the words in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>"This... where did you get this thing from?" </p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished asking, without waiting for an answer, he immediately asked, "How much?"</p><p></p><p>The young craftsman immediately put the bone tablet back in his basket: "This is not for sale!"</p><p></p><p>The man gave a signal, and the other people around immediately surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>But Stan also noticed this, and he immediately turned and ran without even taking the thing.</p><p></p><p>"Don't run!"</p><p></p><p>"Catch him, he's a thief who stole something!"</p><p></p><p>"Catch him!"</p><p></p><p>In the chase and fight, Stan fled to the edge of the market.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Prince Weis of the Volcano Kingdom, who had received the news, was also rushing over here quickly. He even used his spiritual power to climb and jump between the houses, flying across half the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care about being noticed.</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me!"</p><p></p><p>He used divine magic to control several stones and throw them at Stan, with the huge force that if even one hit, it could kill Stan.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a spiritual force pushed back from the opposite direction, blocking in front of Stan.</p><p></p><p>Those stones were pushed back by this force.</p><p></p><p>On the wall appeared another high-level priest of the Three-Leaf people.</p><p></p><p>This commotion also caught the attention of the High Priest of the Yin Temple in the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the sky had reflected the divine realm, everyone in the City of Divine Descent had been on high alert, and any slight movement would startle them.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be Prince Weis Hosen of the Volcano Kingdom, I didn't expect you to come to the City of Divine Descent."</p><p></p><p>"When the priestly team of the Sky Temple went on a mission to the Volcano Kingdom, I had the honor of meeting Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen was not surprised that the other person recognized him, as someone who had become the High Priest of the Yin Temple in the City of Divine Descent must be an important figure of the royal family, and there were not many prominent royal families in the four great kingdoms, so it would be strange if they didn't know each other.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't show any courtesy either, and immediately used divine magic to attack the other person.</p><p></p><p>Bone spears flew as he waved his hand, stabbing towards the other.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The High Priest of the Yin Temple did not back down either, jumping down from the high place to protect Stan and engage in battle with Prince Weis.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of a bone tablet, the two high-level priests were fighting fiercely here.</p><p></p><p>And more people were rushing towards this place.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In this desolate land of bizarre and rugged rocks, towering grotesque boulders stretched their sharp claws and blades towards the sky. Xing had fled and trekked here, with only a few hundred people left. </p><p></p><p>And on the outskirts of this rocky desert, like a jungle of strange stones, King Ali was leading thousands of soldiers who had defected to him, surrounding her here and searching everywhere for her trail.</p><p></p><p>Just as the old king had told him, he would not give Xing any chance.</p><p></p><p>Xing had no way to run further.  </p><p></p><p>Away from the coastal cities, away from the fishing grounds, away from water and the ocean.</p><p></p><p>There was no other place in this world that could accommodate the survival of the Trilingual people.</p><p></p><p>This world did not originally belong to the Trilingual people. It was the homeland guided by God and the blessed food that allowed them to dwell in this savage world.</p><p></p><p>"What a desolate world!"</p><p></p><p>"It only becomes splendid because of the mighty power of Inca, because of God's blessings that it has vitality."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"We do not know how to cherish God's grace."</p><p></p><p>Xing stood on the bizarre rocks, looking at this place and uttering these words with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Her expression was indiscernible, but her dejection could be felt from her words and sighs.</p><p></p><p>People kept coming from behind to report news.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Temple has closed its doors to us."</p><p></p><p>"The Samo clan killed our envoy and wants to find our location, but luckily we did not expose ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"The Rukh giant and King Ali's figure appeared in the south."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only bad news came.</p><p></p><p>Xing had even made compromises to the three major royal bloodline families, willing to give up the throne and hand over the scepter to the other party, and willing to lead her followers to open a new city, but still no one was willing to accept her.</p><p></p><p>One piece of bad news after another made everyone panic and their morale plummeted.</p><p></p><p>But as the queen, after knowing that there was no way out or help, Xing became more determined instead.</p><p></p><p>She laughed, her laughter drawing everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all know?"</p><p></p><p>"I know this place, I've been here before."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, my father was killed by King Ali, and I led the Seron clan here to escape. God's messenger Polo had not returned to the realm of God."</p><p></p><p>Xing's voice paused for a moment, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>She had lost everything again, except this time, that person was not by her side.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the queen recount her story, many people present stood up, listening intently to the queen's words.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was entranced, originally fearful...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The feelings of panic and fear gradually dissipated quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I was very confused. I didn't know how to make a choice. It was the god Bolo who told me that I should overthrow the cruel King Ali."  </p><p></p><p>"I know now everyone is still very confused, everyone is also very afraid."</p><p></p><p>"No one is coming to help us, so we have to rely on ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"If we lose."</p><p></p><p>"I will die together with you all."</p><p></p><p>A gentle smile appeared on Xing's face: "I'm sorry!"</p><p></p><p>"Because of my immaturity, it led to this failure."</p><p></p><p>"And thank you all for still following by my side."</p><p></p><p>One by one, people stood up, surrounding and gathering around Xing.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the ground, they shouted "Queen Xing."</p><p></p><p>"Queen Xing, this is not your fault."</p><p></p><p>"It is the tyrant who betrayed King Yeser, betrayed the god."</p><p></p><p>"He released the monsters from the abyss, he will definitely suffer divine punishment."</p><p></p><p>Someone hesitated for a moment, then boldly asked:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, do you regret it?"</p><p></p><p>"For us lowly commoners."</p><p></p><p>"You were born so noble, the heir of the royal Seron family bloodline, a priest serving the gods."</p><p></p><p>"For us, was it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>Xing took off the crown on her head and hugged it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not someone who is good at weighing pros and cons, nor do I understand what is worth it or not."</p><p></p><p>"At least, I don't regret it."</p><p></p><p>"Because a ruler's nobility does not come from this crown, and my people of Xinsai follow me not because of this scepter."</p><p></p><p>"But because we are persisting in doing the right thing. Even if we fail, we fail on the right path, and in the future there will still be people treading our path."</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because I am right."</p><p></p><p>"That you honor me as king and are willing to follow me."</p><p></p><p>The crowd's confidence was reinvigorated, and they followed Xing to begin the evacuation again.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Temple was not a retreat, they would retreat even further together, and start over again there.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>The wind whipped up clouds of sand and dust. The huge Ruh giants carrying Xing's followers trudged through the sand.</p><p></p><p>From the windy sands in the distance, shadows appeared in batch after batch, breaking through the dusty veil into Xing's sight.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>Another Ruh giant, letting out a desolate, chilling sound.</p><p></p><p>It was King Ali, along with his great army.</p><p></p><p>In this desolate world, Xing and her followers were surrounded by Ali's massive army.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much they hid and concealed themselves, in the end they were still found by Ali.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Wang found her.</p><p></p><p>One can rise from failure, but breaking through failure again is extremely difficult, because the resurgent enemy will be stronger and more prepared. </p><p></p><p>The voice of King Ari Hongliang came: "Star of the Xilun clan, I have finally found you."</p><p></p><p>The arrogant ruler of old raised his head, his piercing gaze penetrating through the wind and sand to fall upon Star.</p><p></p><p>"I will not accept your surrender."  </p><p></p><p>"Because I cannot accept the weakness of the royal family, nor do I want to see the cowardice of a ruler."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's just a false king."</p><p></p><p>"Star Queen!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you prepared to die standing?"</p><p></p><p>Star had anticipated this.</p><p></p><p>She watched as King Ari kept closing in, and when she could clearly see his figure, she said:</p><p></p><p>"Likewise, I will not beg for mercy from a tyrant, nor will I plead for pity from the enemy who killed my father."</p><p></p><p>"I only hope that after my death, you will have the dignity of a ruler."</p><p></p><p>"Spare my followers."</p><p></p><p>King Ari was clearly not someone who would compromise. </p><p></p><p>He was the king, the supreme ruler.</p><p></p><p>He firmly refused: "Those who disobey me have only one path - death."</p><p></p><p>Star: "King Ari, you are still as cruel as ever."</p><p></p><p>King Ari did not care at all about others calling him cruel, or perhaps he believed that a king should be this way.</p><p></p><p>"If everyone could loyally obey the king, I would be willing to bestow kindness upon them."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately."</p><p></p><p>"There are so many rebels in this world, and those with ambitions that do not submit to royal authority."</p><p></p><p>This was a war with no retreat, where only one side could survive.</p><p></p><p>The followers of the Star Queen jumped off the giant beast and spread out, lining up in formation on the other side, holding bone shields, as if they were fighting back-to-back with the queen and the Rukh giant beast.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Both sides shouted loudly, mustering courage for themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Kill the false king!" The incoming soldiers raised their bone spears high.</p><p></p><p>"Fight for the Star Queen." The soldiers in formation linked their bone shields together.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that King Ari's side had a greater advantage in terms of military strength.</p><p></p><p>King Ari and Star controlled the giant beasts beneath them to fight each other, while they themselves kept wielding the power of divine arts, controlling swords and spears to attack each other.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of meters away, rows of spear-throwers kept throwing bone spears at the Star Queen in formation.</p><p></p><p>After throwing, they would retreat, and another row would advance.</p><p></p><p>The spears rained down, piercing the giant beast and making it restless, while also threatening the Star Queen.</p><p></p><p>Forcing the queen to split her attention, using divine arts to defend or dodge.</p>

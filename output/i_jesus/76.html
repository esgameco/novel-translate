        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At dawn, the first rays of the sun were just rising on the horizon. </p><p></p><p>A figure emerged from the beach, crawling out in a disheveled state. He tightly gripped a set of bone scriptures in his hand, his gaze fixed on the distant town of Tito.</p><p></p><p>"It can't be."</p><p></p><p>"They're all dead."</p><p></p><p>A group had traveled thousands of miles to carry out this mission, but in the end, he was the only one who made it out alive.</p><p></p><p>Although the Trileaf people could survive underwater, those people had all been crushed by the collapsing ground or trapped inside, and there was no way they could have escaped.</p><p></p><p>Even he had narrowly escaped from within, despite being a high-ranking priest. He could not withstand the force of the earth's collapse.</p><p></p><p>His palm caressed the words on the bone scriptures, and the tense, oppressive mood instantly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately."</p><p></p><p>"The bone scriptures were brought out."</p><p></p><p>No matter how many people died, as long as he could bring out this object, it would all be worth it.</p><p></p><p>He quickly ran with the bone scriptures, as if someone was waiting for him in the distance.</p><p></p><p>However, halfway through, he suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was somewhat complex, but it quickly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>In that brief moment, he made a certain decision.</p><p></p><p>He took out the bone tablets and quickly flipped through the content.</p><p></p><p>There was not much text on the bone tablets, and he soon finished reading them. He finally learned the secret left behind by the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>His face showed a look of sudden enlightenment, yet also a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>"So!"</p><p></p><p>"The secret left by the great poet is this, there really is a Dream Fairy that can fulfill any wish."</p><p></p><p>Untying the rope that bound the bone scriptures, he removed the last bone tablet and then re-tied the bone scriptures.</p><p></p><p>The leader made his way through the coast and came to a stretch of reef.</p><p></p><p>Behind the reef stood a tall, three-leaf male, his bone armor pure and flawless, with a Ruhei brand on his forehead like an eye.</p><p></p><p>This clearly indicated that the other party was of extraordinary status, if not a king, then at least a prince, otherwise he would not have the ability to control the Ruhei giant.</p><p></p><p>The leader knelt humbly before him and presented the bone scriptures.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness! This is the bone scriptures left behind by the great poet Tito!"</p><p></p><p>"For two hundred years, it has been sleeping under the castle of the Tito family, and now it has finally reappeared in the world."</p><p></p><p>"And now, it belongs to our Volcano Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The prince eagerly took the bone scriptures and, after a glance, excitedly said:</p><p></p><p>"The descendants of the Tito family were not wrong, the great poet really left behind the final chapter."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"The secret that the Star Realm Kingdom could not keep, the thing they could not obtain, is now ours, the Volcano Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The four major royal bloodline families - Silen, Samo, Seler, and Hosen - represent the meanings of starlight, desert, ocean, and volcano, and are the beautiful blessings and wishes of King Laideli for his children.</p><p></p><p>They established the Star Realm Kingdom, the Samo Kingdom, the Seler Kingdom, and the Volcano Kingdom respectively.</p><p></p><p>And these people who pretended to be the Samo Kingdom's caravan were actually soldiers of the Hosen family of the Volcano Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Especially the leader, who was a priest of the royal lineage.</p><p></p><p>The prince of the Volcano Kingdom asked him, "Why did you make such a commotion? Didn't I tell you to be careful?"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the others?"</p><p></p><p>The leader replied, "They're all dead."</p><p></p><p>The prince nodded, "Although it's not perfect, the fact that you were able to obtain the bone scriptures left by the great poet is already good enough!"</p><p></p><p>"You have completed your mission, and upon your return, glory and rewards will surely await you."</p><p></p><p>As the prince said this, he put away the bone scriptures. But at the same time, the bone whip in his hand suddenly lashed out unexpectedly towards the caravan leader.</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader reacted extremely quickly, deflecting the bone whip with his Ruhei sword.</p><p></p><p>Turning the sword, he swung out a sword flower to knock away the three bone spears that were stabbing towards him from behind.</p><p></p><p>His superb combat skills and early precautions showed that he was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Tito saved his life. </p><p></p><p>The caravan leader turned and ran, not daring to say another word, and without any questioning or cursing.</p><p></p><p>He had been ordered to personally slaughter the Tito family saints, and had long anticipated that he might not have a good end.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party fleeing far away, the prince of the Volcano Kingdom no longer cared about exposing anything. He directly activated his wisdom power and placed his finger on his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum hum!"</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath kept swelling, clearly indicating that a terrifying giant creature was moving underground.</p><p></p><p>He had actually summoned the Ruhei giant monster.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, the various royal bloodline families had gradually stabilized the strongest forms and cultivation methods of the Ruhei giant monsters, and the Volcano Kingdom, located in a range of volcanoes and deserts, was best at cultivating the burrowing worm form of the giant monster.</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader ran wildly, but before he had run a few hundred meters, he heard the movement behind him.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at the constantly swelling ground and the rapidly approaching giant monster, and despair appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the prince to dare to bring the Ruhei giant monster so close to the City of Divine Descent, and to hide it nearby.</p><p></p><p>There was no way he could outrun the Ruhei giant monster, and now the only way he could try to survive was to attempt one thing.</p><p></p><p>He knelt on the ground and recited the secret left behind by the great poet Tito, who had once been by the side of the Insei deity, that was the true name of a powerful divine messenger.</p><p></p><p>The great poet Tito had said in his last chapter that by reciting the true name of the divine messenger, one could communicate with her will and connect to the realm of the divine.</p><p></p><p>"Guardian of the Garden of the Gods, divine messenger of the Dreamland Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Oh Dream Fairy named Hope, I devoutly pray for you to respond to my wish."</p><p></p><p>"Hira!"</p><p></p><p>When he called out that name in a strange tone and rhythm, a strange vibration passed through the air. </p><p></p><p>No one could hear the sound of that name, because rather than being a sound wave, it was more like a resonance and vibration of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not yet received any response.</p><p></p><p>The Ruhei giant monster had arrived, and tentacle-like things emerged from the ground, grabbing him and lifting him high up.</p><p></p><p>The immense power twisted and crushed his legs into a tangled mess.</p><p></p><p>Blood constantly gushed from his mouth, but there was no resentment or unwillingness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps from the beginning, he had a premonition of his own end and outcome.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Ruhei giant monster emerging from the ground, and the prince standing on top of the giant monster.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I could get the last chapter of the great poet Tito's work, and use its power to change the times."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I had to slaughter the Tito family saints, at least I could have accomplished a great feat."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than letting a bunch of parasites occupy this divine treasure, I might as well use it to accomplish what previous generations could not."</p><p></p><p>"Alas."</p><p></p><p>"The end has come so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The prince looked at him coldly: "Do you think you are a king?"</p><p></p><p>"As a collateral branch, your mission is to guard the royal family."</p><p></p><p>"Glory and achievements will always belong to the king, what do they have to do with you?"</p><p></p><p>The leader laughed and suddenly said, "Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>"Is the power we obtained in this way really allowed by the gods?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that is why I have suffered this evil fate."</p><p></p><p>"But it is destined that you will not get it either."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the tentacles of the Ruhei giant monster pierced through his chest.</p><p></p><p>The prince had killed the leader, not only because he did not want the news of his order to massacre the Tito family saints to be leaked, but also because he did not want anyone else to know about the existence of the great poet's last chapter in his possession.</p><p></p><p>It was over.</p><p></p><p>There was no Volcano Kingdom coveting the divine treasure of the Tito family, only a caravan from the Samo Kingdom that had massacred the entire Tito family out of greed for their possessions.</p><p></p><p>However, what the prince did not expect was that although the leader had died, his last voice had been transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Along the dreamlike starlight, it reached the dream world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>It also fully revealed the secrets contained in the bone book of the great poet Tito.</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The slaughter lasted from day to night, until the warm seawater turned icy cold, until the azure pure seawater turned the color of blood, until bodies floated on and under the water. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Nearly twenty thousand monsters were killed, leaving only a few thousand remaining. </p><p></p><p>The monsters became afraid.</p><p></p><p>They gathered their last strength and found a weak point in the encirclement, breaking through it to escape.</p><p></p><p>They instinctively fled towards the place they had come from, that dark and cold ocean trench.</p><p></p><p>Yeser, having achieved a great victory, pursued them. He laughed loudly, summoning the warriors and followers under his command, just as he had once called upon the champions of the God-blessed city to set out for the place of origin.</p><p></p><p>"Pursue them!"</p><p></p><p>"Drive them back into the abyss of demons, where these sinful people belong in the eternal darkness, never to see the light of day."</p><p></p><p>Other high-level priests could at most move a stone the size of a head, but Yeser could not only lift his own body, he could also control the winds to fly.</p><p></p><p>Yeser controlled his body to fly high in the air, charging at the very front of the great army. </p><p></p><p>Below, seven merged monsters tore through the waves, charging towards the distance, with thousands upon thousands of Heinsei soldiers following in his wake.</p><p></p><p>He felt an extreme sense of exhilaration, pursuing those sinners until they had nowhere to run on earth or in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He recklessly drained the power of his own bloodline and the Sun Chalice, reaching all the way to the unfathomable depths of the ocean trench.</p><p></p><p>Yet he did not notice that the Sun Chalice he shared a symbiotic existence with had undergone a change.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield had spread to the deep demonic abyss, and the battle lines had been stretched to the extreme. Yeser charged to the very front to prevent a large group of sinners from escaping into the deep demonic abyss.</p><p></p><p>He gradually became separated from the main force, with only a few royal guards and a starfish-like merged monster remaining by his side.</p><p></p><p>But his powerful and unmatched strength made him fearless. New69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Not far away at the bottom of the sea was the unfathomable ocean trench. Yeser trod upon the sea surface, charging alone into the crowd of monsters, allowing over a dozen of them to surround him.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he raised huge waves that knocked seven or eight monsters away.</p><p></p><p>Midair, these monsters were smashed into a mass of mangled flesh.</p><p></p><p>A tall sinner over two meters tall charged straight at Yeser, leaping up from the water surface, stretching out his arms to stab at him.</p><p></p><p>The monster opened its terrifying maw, but could not make a single sound.</p><p></p><p>Yet one could sense its fury - having witnessed so many of its kin die before its eyes, even these dull-witted creatures felt immense sorrow.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how furious, it could not change the vast difference in power between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Yeser stretched out his hand, grasping the monster in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>As easily as pinching an insect.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The crown-wearing King of the Xin Kingdom carefully examined the other party. To be able to grow to this extent, he must be the direct descendant possessing the bloodline. </p><p></p><p>Thinking that such a monster once flowed with the same blood as himself, it made Yeser feel nauseous.</p><p></p><p>"Truly hideous."</p><p>"The son who killed his father's descendant."</p><p></p><p>His fingers clenched together.</p><p></p><p>The monster shattered in the sky, its internal organs splattering into the sea.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by thousands upon thousands of Xin Kingdom soldiers rushing in from afar. At this moment, he was the embodiment of a divine being.</p><p></p><p>"The King!"</p><p>"The Wise King!"  </p><p>"The god-given power is irresistible, kill these sinners."</p><p></p><p>The royal guards nearby surfaced from the sea cheering. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>This didn't seem like a war, but more like a feast. </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps a performance dedicated to the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>And the Sun Chalice on Yeser's shoulder grew increasingly brilliant, radiating a golden glow, truly like the sun itself.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Sun Chalice on his shoulder, releasing the divine technique Illusion Realm from above the water's surface. </p><p></p><p>One monster after another lost their sense of direction, floating up from the bottom of the sea, only to be struck down by Yeser on the spot, some even beginning to attack each other.</p><p></p><p>Yeser strolled across the water's surface, casually striking down these sinners, his steps smooth and graceful, as if dancing.</p><p></p><p>He felt like the lead role, offering the most beautiful melody to the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Using the power bestowed by the gods to punish the gods' sinners.</p><p></p><p>"Ens!"</p><p>"Bun!"</p><p>"You two sinners who blasphemed against the divine, the sons who killed their fathers."</p><p>"Did you see? This is the power of the gods."</p><p>"This is the punishment the gods have given you, the divine retribution for your sin of killing your fathers."</p><p></p><p>The more he used this power, the stronger the Sun Chalice's power became.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre flower called the God's Chalice had never encountered someone with such a powerful mythical bloodline who would so unreservedly unleash its power upon itself.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, the Sun Chalice on his shoulder grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it suddenly moved on its own, letting out an ugly hiss.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>Yeser, in the midst of wantonly flaunting his power, stopped in his tracks, his expression frozen.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly lost control of his power, and of his body, stumbling off the water's surface into the sea.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?!"</p><p></p><p>Yeser was utterly shocked, his pupils glancing askance at his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The once beautiful Sun Chalice had suddenly cracked open, transforming into a horrifying gaping maw lunging towards Yeser's head to devour him.</p><p></p><p>Yeser watched wide-eyed, yet</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There was no way out.</p><p></p><p>The enemy's goal was not to kill him, but to devour the Crown of Wisdom he wore on his head, that supreme divine artifact possessing the vast power of mythology and the authority of the Wisdom King.  </p><p></p><p>Yeser panicked.</p><p></p><p>He roared inwardly, but could not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to call the fusion monster from the distant sea, but could not even release his wisdom abilities.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tremendous force struck his back.</p><p></p><p>"Bang."</p><p></p><p>That was the sound of a blade piercing his bone armor.</p><p></p><p>An enraged monster emerged from the depths, attacking Yeser at that very moment. </p><p></p><p>The sharp spike pierced and tore through Yeser's neck, his head separating from his body like a ball struck into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The descendant of the parricide son dealt Yeser a fatal blow, as if the hatred and resentment of their progenitor Ens still lingered in their blood and bones, erupting completely at this moment.</p><p></p><p>As the world spun around him.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser never imagined he would meet such an end.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled Ens's words, that even if banished to the abyss, he would return to kill Yeser and take back his rightful throne.</p><p></p><p>"Could this also be fate?"  </p><p></p><p>With a splash, his vision was swallowed by the sea, consciousness gradually fading to black.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hear any sound, the entire world falling silent.</p><p></p><p>In his dazed state, he suddenly saw a tall, warm figure appear before him.</p><p></p><p>The figure stood in the backlight of the temple, its long shadow trailing across the stone floor.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p></p><p>"Only the divine is eternal."  </p><p></p><p>"No matter how much we gain, we will eventually decay and lose it all."</p><p></p><p>Yeser's heart swelled with wild joy, his spirit suddenly invigorated like the last rays of the setting sun.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Have you come for me? Have you come to take me back to the realm of the gods?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser heaved a sigh of relief, as if a stone weighing on his heart his whole life had finally fallen away.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"I knew the gods would forgive us."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to reach out and take his father's hand, to follow him back to the divine palace, but at that moment he suddenly awoke to find only his severed head remained.</p><p></p><p>Everything dissipated like a dream, along with his consciousness.  </p><p></p><p>The second Wisdom King Yeser was dead.</p><p></p><p>Bubbling up from the sea water, the crown atop his head automatically detached itself and fell into the eternally dark, icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>One thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>Five thousand meters. </p><p></p><p>Ten thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>Down into the bottomless depths even the fusion monsters could not reach.</p><p></p><p>The authority of the Wisdom King belonging to the Trifoliate race.</p>

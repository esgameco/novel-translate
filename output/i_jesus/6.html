        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the warm sea water nest, the eggs of the Trifolians began to hatch. At first, they did not have a human form, and it would be more accurate to say they resembled worms rather than humans. </p><p></p><p>However, as they slowly grew up in the ocean, their originally transparent insect shells gradually gained color, becoming opaque and harder.</p><p></p><p>They survived by preying on insects and ancient creatures near the sea. They had no natural predators.</p><p></p><p>Years later, they began to take on human form. </p><p></p><p>At this time, they heard a voice echoing in their minds, the voice of the origin of their wisdom and consciousness, the progenitor traced through their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p>"Come to me."</p><p>"Come back!"</p><p></p><p>Under the powerful summoning force, the Trifolians one by one crawled up from the sea bottom to the shore.</p><p></p><p>They gathered at the foot of the pyramid stone mill, curiously observing everything around them, gazing up at the temple of the gods.</p><p></p><p>A being who looked exactly like them stood on the steps of the pyramid, facing the sea.</p><p></p><p>Leydlig welcomed them at the bottom of the stairs. It was he who had sent out the signal summoning these lifeforms. He stretched out his hand with a smile, truly happy.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, there was a special female Trifolian whose armor was white, different from the others.</p><p></p><p>This made her appear particularly special, catching Leydlig's attention.</p><p></p><p>Leydlig was stunned at first, then his heart was stirred with ripples. He did not understand what this was, nor did he know there was an emotion called affection.</p><p></p><p>In front of the majestic temple, the god Yin was also observing this first batch of Trifolians coming ashore.</p><p></p><p>"Trifolians?"</p><p>"Trifolian insects!"</p><p>"To call them humans, they ultimately cannot escape the habits of insects."</p><p>"Although they have taken on human form and can survive on both land and sea, they are still bound by the ocean."</p><p>"They need to reproduce in the ocean, still laying eggs, only able to live near the sea."</p><p></p><p>He looked behind him at the barren surface, like the face of Mars.</p><p></p><p>It was like this on all the islands, not to mention the land.</p><p></p><p>In this ancient era, only the ocean could accommodate life.</p><p></p><p>Life could hardly transform nature, it could only adapt to nature.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster Shallie stood by the pillar of the temple, looking down at those newly born, weak insects. Even an innocent glance filled the Trifolians with a sense of primal terror and bone-chilling dread from the depths of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying than the sunless, icy cold ocean trenches. </p><p></p><p>The Trifolians could not see the Yin God, they could only fearfully gaze upon the fused monster creature.</p><p></p><p>Even though the other party still maintained a human form, petite and graceful, they could sense the terrifying monster lurking beneath that outer shell. </p><p></p><p>Under Shali's gaze, they trembled uncontrollably, kneeling down involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>Finally, they lay prostrate under the pyramid, whimpering and making indistinct low cries.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo!" </p><p></p><p>"Eeyah!"</p><p></p><p>Leadre stood under the pyramid, also gazing upwards along with the many Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>"That is the divine temple."</p><p></p><p>"And the messenger of God, Isha."</p><p></p><p>These newborn lives did not understand what was what, nor did they comprehend the messenger of God.</p><p></p><p>But they could hear that a supreme existence resided up there.</p><p></p><p>Leadre turned around, raising his hand towards all the Trifolians.  </p><p></p><p>The tides rose, eroding the shoreline, an irresistible force overriding their wills, directly lifting them up from the ground, allowing them to stand upright again.</p><p></p><p>"Rise up!"</p><p></p><p>"Do not fear."</p><p></p><p>"For you are the people of God, the believers of God, the chosen eldest sons of God."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, other than God, there is nothing for you to fear or revere."</p><p></p><p>Leadre looked down on the fused monster Shali, or perhaps never regarded the fused monster from the start, as could be seen from him casually allowing the fused monster to construct the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>He believed himself to be God's eldest son.</p><p></p><p>And the fused monster was merely a servant of God, while he was the executor of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Leadre's communication with the Trifolians was less through voice and more like directly imprinting what he wanted to say into their minds through willpower.</p><p></p><p>The Yin God noticed this scene.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had expected, Leadre's power was not just possessing wisdom,</p><p></p><p>When his race appeared, it fully manifested the power's might.</p><p></p><p>He could summon all Trifolians, control all Trifolians, and transmit his thoughts into every single Trifolian.</p><p></p><p>No one could defy his will.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he could control all intelligent life in this world now.</p><p></p><p>This was Leadre's power, the power of wisdom and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Originating from...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The ancestral power flowing through their veins made these Trifolians look upon Raidrike with reverence, their eyes filled with boundless fanaticism. </p><p></p><p>That gaze.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Raidrike was looking upon the God Yin.</p><p></p><p>Raidrike raised his hand and shouted loudly: "From this day forth, we shall be the rulers of the land and oceans, the divine chosen ones to control the world on behalf of God."</p><p></p><p>"And I am your king - Raidrike."</p><p></p><p>All the Trifolians followed with frenzied roars, shouting hoarsely and discordantly in hollow tones.</p><p></p><p>"King!"  </p><p></p><p>"King!"</p><p></p><p>The God Yin was Raidrike's creator, the deity who bestowed wisdom upon him.</p><p></p><p>And Raidrike was their creator, the supreme king who bestowed life upon them.</p><p></p><p>------------------</p><p></p><p>Raidrike led them to the valley behind the pyramid, carving out one cave after another in the rock face, while using the excavated stones to build a city.</p><p></p><p>Just as the God Yin had said, he established his own city-state and nation.</p><p></p><p>These caves connected to the ocean depths, so besides the city in the valley, there was also a city deep underwater that could be accessed through the caves.</p><p></p><p>They lived on the island, worshipping the deities.  </p><p></p><p>Hunting in the waters, and reproducing offspring in the waters.</p><p></p><p>This place seemed to become an origin place akin to the mythical Nuwa creating humans, God's Garden of Eden.</p><p></p><p>This tiny island, insignificant to the Earth, became the beginning of intelligent life, a paradise beyond the human world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Raidrike also had a family.</p><p></p><p>He made the female Trifolian with the white bony carapace his queen, and they naturally gave birth to their first child.</p><p></p><p>Having a child, Raidrike, the moment he crawled out of the sea onto land, joyfully and eagerly led his child up the pyramid steps.  </p><p></p><p>The small and large figures climbed step-by-step until reaching the temple entrance where they knelt down.</p><p></p><p>He softly said to his child: "Look!"</p><p></p><p>"God is watching over you there!"</p><p></p><p>However, his child looked at the temple interior with a blank expression, seeing nothing but the giant statue and stone altar.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing there. Just some stones."</p><p></p><p>Raidrike felt an icy chill run through his body as he saw the disbelief and endless disappointment in his child's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His pupils held sadness, loss.</p><p></p><p>And bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>He realized his child could not see God.</p>

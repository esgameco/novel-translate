        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The poet Tito had made preparations for his long journey. He placed his belongings into a woven oval mesh bag that he could carry on his back by putting his arms through it. </p><p></p><p>Tito meticulously organized everything. He took out the ancient Yessir navigation map stone tablet from his family's collection and packed it into his luggage. This was the most important reference route for his trip.</p><p></p><p>With it, Tito would be able to avoid some dangerous areas and not get lost.</p><p></p><p>He would follow in the footsteps of his ancestors and embark on his return journey once again.</p><p></p><p>He also packed the precious sword bestowed by the Queen, forged from the discarded shell of a Luhei giant monster. He had even prepared himself to fight against the Maoyuan people should he encounter them.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" </p><p></p><p>Tito let out a long sigh of relief. Though he had been very nervous before, he was now completely relaxed as the time of his departure approached.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to set off."</p><p></p><p>A shadow appeared at the doorway of the room, and the light dimmed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tito stopped his movements, knowing who had arrived without needing to turn around.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>His father called out his name sternly, "Tito, it's not too late to reconsider."</p><p></p><p>Tito replied, "I will never regret this."</p><p></p><p>But the father said, "When you plummet into the abyss, when you face death, when you lose everything - you will realize how foolish those words of yours are now."</p><p></p><p>"And the things you will inevitably encounter when you set out to find the land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>"You have already surpassed me and your grandfather. What more are you unsatisfied with?"</p><p></p><p>Tito put down the woven basket he was holding, pausing for a moment. It seemed he was hesitating and wavering, which is what his father thought.</p><p></p><p>The father's tone softened as he advised Tito.</p><p></p><p>"The Yessir navigation route has long been completely abandoned, and your ancient map tablet is no longer usable. Nowadays, the seas are filled with the Maoyuan people, those monstrous beings blocking the path to the land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, the gods have cursed us, and we can never return to the paradise they once granted us."</p><p></p><p>"You cannot possibly cross these vast chasms to reach the gods' halls."</p><p></p><p>Tito did not stop, but slowly put the woven backpack on his back.</p><p></p><p>His movements were unhurried but steady, just like the determination in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of the danger and the feats that ordinary people cannot accomplish that greatness lies."</p><p></p><p>"Some are born to be kings, some are born to be priests of the gods, and some are born with extraordinary wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"And I..."</p><p></p><p>"Was born to write the greatest chapter in this world."</p><p></p><p>"This is my mission, my destiny."</p><p></p><p>The father said, "You will die."</p><p></p><p>Tito replied, "I have prepared for this. Doesn't someone have to sacrifice themselves for a great cause?"</p><p></p><p>The father, enraged, pointed at Tito and said, "You are too arrogant. Do you think you are greater than King Yessir?"</p><p></p><p>"Even King Yessir died on the path of seeking and returning to the land blessed by the gods. What makes you think you can accomplish what he could not?"</p><p></p><p>Tito looked his father in the eye and shook his head, saying, "No, it is the people of Hinsai who have forgotten too much, the descendants of King Laideli who have long lost their faith."</p><p></p><p>"We have forgotten our past, forgotten our ancestors."</p><p></p><p>"I am not trying to do something greater than what King Yessir did. I am only going to reclaim our past and our origins, our birth."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>"Enshrine them in memory."</p><p></p><p>Tito picked up the woven basket again and continued his preparations to depart.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He walked by his side and came out onto the street.</p><p></p><p>Many people in the city already knew that Tito was about to embark on a journey to find the land blessed by the gods, and they came to see him off.</p><p></p><p>They crowded on both sides of the street, watching as Tito left his residence.</p><p></p><p>The people cheered in unison, gathering around Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tito, are you really going to search for the land blessed by the gods?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that it was the messenger of the gods who gave you guidance and opened the gates to the divine kingdom. Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tito..."</p><p>"Lord Tito..."</p><p></p><p>Tito passed through the crowd, and everyone was excited, constantly approaching him with questions.</p><p></p><p>Tito did not speak, but only smiled at them.</p><p></p><p>Until they reached the city gate of the City of the Divine Servants, where thousands upon thousands of people had gathered behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tito!"</p><p>"You must return safely!"</p><p></p><p>Tito waved his hand and left along the steep mountain path of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Tito set out from the City of the Divine Servants, intending to pass through the large and small towns of the Star Kingdom, and then set sail from the Divinely Descended City on the Yaseir route.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, he caused a great commotion.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had heard his name and knew his story, and many had even heard that he was going to search for the land blessed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Some mocked his overconfidence, while others admired his courage to take on such a great goal.</p><p></p><p>The Divinely Descended City.</p><p></p><p>This gradually declining city was no longer the capital, and apart from its symbolic significance, it had lost everything just like the former Hinsai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Divinely Descended City asked Tito at a banquet, "I know your story, and I hear you are embarking on an even greater journey?"</p><p></p><p>Tito nodded, "I am preparing to search for the land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the room burst into laughter. No one believed that Tito could accomplish this task, and they all thought he was just going to his death.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Tito with pity and mockery, as if he were a frog at the bottom of a well who did not know the vastness of the sky and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Tito faced all this, unfazed.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over the crowd and said in a loud voice, "Is it something to be proud of to forget the past and forget our ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>"We were once the masters of the land and the sea, the firstborn sons of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Now we have lost the sea and only have the land left."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, we have even forgotten the glory and memories of the past."</p><p></p><p>Tito slowly stepped up to the high point of the banquet, and he shouted loudly,</p><p></p><p>"This time I go, it is to reclaim all that we have lost."</p><p></p><p>"To have our glory, our faith, our origins, forever carved in stone, etched in our memories."</p><p></p><p>"So that all future generations will remember that we come from the land blessed by the gods, that we were once the glorious firstborn sons of the gods."</p><p></p><p>His words silenced the entire room.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Divinely Descended City stood up and bowed to Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Bless you, great poet."</p><p></p><p>"May the power of Hinsai forever protect you, and may you -"</p><p></p><p>"Have a safe journey."</p><p></p><p>-----------------------</p><p></p><p>Tito came to the secluded place where Bolo and Xing had once lived, and stood there gazing out at the sea.</p><p></p><p>Until night fell, and the stars descended.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the divine cup woven in his basket began to glow with light, and in the darkness he vaguely saw a beam of light rushing towards the distance, guiding him forward.</p><p></p><p>"Divine messenger Bolo."</p><p></p><p>"Is the light ahead the temple of the gods?"</p><p></p><p>He leapt into the sea, but felt no discomfort, for they had once been a part of the life of the sea.</p><p></p><p>Gradually moving further away, he looked back towards the shore in the darkness.</p>

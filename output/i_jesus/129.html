        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>The high priest of the Sky Temple, Sandor, was kneeling before a bone tablet, carving ritual formations on it with both hands pressed to his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Intersecting golden light that did not belong to this world projected down, and the dream egg of the faerie realm manifested in the air above the palace, the miraculous and dreamlike power bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>This was a dream egg with silver speckles, belonging to an iron faerie.</p><p></p><p>Sandor was murmuring something.</p><p></p><p>"Activate, sacrifice."</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes: "Mold."</p><p></p><p>The few mineral stones placed on the bone tablet began to float, shattering as they vibrated, and in the light the people saw a Ruhk sword take form.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>This was because Sandor's spiritual power was extremely strong, and he was also very familiar with the ritual procedure.</p><p></p><p>An earth-shaking roar erupted in the palace, even the king Henryk on the throne suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The nearby nobles immediately crowded around: "Wow, wow, wow!"</p><p></p><p>Someone even wanted to touch the precious sword: "Is this real?"</p><p></p><p>After confirming it was real, everyone looked at each other excitedly: "The Ruhk sword, just a few stones can create the Ruhk sword?"</p><p></p><p>The priest was looking at the bone tablet Sandor had carved with fiery eyes, as if every symbol on it hid the truths of the world, the powerful strength they craved: "Oh great gods! Your power is unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Sandor did not stop, and immediately created a life-sized, ornately decorated metal mirror.</p><p></p><p>He handed it to the attendant below the throne, who brought it before King Henryk.</p><p></p><p>"A gift for the ruler of Hensea."</p><p></p><p>Henryk smiled as he accepted it: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"I will keep it in my bedchamber and look at my reflection every day."</p><p></p><p>But what he was more concerned about was that the precious Ruhk materials, which used to be invaluable, could now be made with just ordinary stones, fish oil, and seawater.</p><p></p><p>He could understand what kind of changes this would bring to Hensea and the Henryk dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Is this power limitless? Does this mean we can have an unlimited supply of Ruhk materials?"</p><p></p><p>Sandor shook his head. "Your Majesty, this power is not limitless, and the minerals are not infinite either."</p><p></p><p>"In the faerie realm, Ruhk materials are not considered precious, the faeries call it iron, and they have even built a great mountain and used it to make bridges and houses."</p><p></p><p>"And the power of the spirit priests requires an eternal price to be paid to the faerie realm."</p><p></p><p>King Henryk: "Spirit priests?"</p><p></p><p>Sandor: "This is the title I have assigned to the priests based on the book 'The Power of Authority' from the faerie realm."</p><p></p><p>Sandor saw that the faerie realm divided power into three tiers, so he also divided the power of high-level rituals and low-level priests according to his own ideas.</p><p></p><p>He called the high-level priests who mastered spiritual power, divine art projection, and spirit realm rituals "spirit priests."</p><p></p><p>And the low-level priests who mastered the power of wisdom, he called "mind priests" based on their characteristics.</p><p></p><p>This was also Sandor's trait, he liked to categorize knowledge, and at the same time record and organize what he had learned according to his own habits and ideas.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is just my own naming."</p><p></p><p>"Please forgive my presumption."</p><p></p><p>But King Henryk quite liked Sandor's style, he saw that Sandor had a trait similar to Stan Tito, a pure scholar.</p><p></p><p>If not for the slave brand on Sandor, he would have been a perfect descendant of the Tito family, although the Tito family had long since forgotten their past.</p><p></p><p>Henryk shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"There is no one in this world more qualified than you."</p><p></p><p>"You are the priest who has entered the divine realm and received the legacy of the divine messenger."</p><p></p><p>"In the entire kingdom of Hensea, there is no one else like you."</p><p></p><p>The people in the palace were completely immersed in the fantastic faerie realm that Sandor had described.</p><p></p><p>They exclaimed in amazement, and also yearned for it.</p><p></p><p>They could hardly imagine that such a precious thing in the faerie realm had an entire mountain, and the faeries did not even consider it a treasure.</p><p></p><p>And the priests expressed infinite longing for the legendary library that was said to hold the knowledge of the gods.</p><p></p><p>After that, Sandor immediately began his next ritual.</p><p></p><p>He knew that only by performing impressive enough rituals would the power be transmitted to every corner of the world more quickly and efficiently.</p><p></p><p>This was the will of the saint, and also his ideal.</p><p></p><p>People saw that the materials Sandor used this time were just common mud.</p><p></p><p>"Mud?"</p><p></p><p>"What can mud make?"</p><p></p><p>"Even stones can make swords."</p><p></p><p>"But that was not ordinary stone, and this is just dirt from the fields."</p><p></p><p>Through a combination of several rituals, he created a clay lamp.</p><p></p><p>He pinched the wick and lit it.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, everyone in the palace took two steps back, especially the former nobles of the Volcanic Kingdom, who had a strong reverence and fear of fire.</p><p></p><p>"Fire!"</p><p></p><p>"It's fire."</p><p></p><p>People, like Sandor, were startled to see this thing called a lamp for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Sandor used his spiritual power to suspend the lamp on a palace column.</p><p></p><p>"This is a lamp."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the precious luminous stones, a clay lamp can be made with just clay, oil, and a wick."</p><p></p><p>"Even on the darkest of nights, it can continuously illuminate the way for the people of Hensea."</p><p></p><p>Next, Sandor sequentially created magnificent robes, translucent glass cups, and even turned water into ice and snow that blew through the palace.</p><p></p><p>At first, everyone was shouting in astonishment, but eventually the entire palace fell silent.</p><p></p><p>All present had a sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>Such power.</p><p></p><p>Does it really exist?</p><p></p><p>This was the miraculous power of creation, even King Henryk stood in awe, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Sandor stood up and went to the foot of the throne to salute the King of Hensea.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the ritual."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"As long as your will is conveyed, the entire world will change because of it."</p><p></p><p>King Heniel shook his head and said to Sander.</p><p></p><p>"It is not I or you who will change the world."</p><p></p><p>"It is Stan Tito, the supreme deity."</p><p></p><p>Sander looked at King Heniel, and he suddenly felt moved, because of his affirmation of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"I have learned nine rituals so far, although only nine, but with different materials, different rituals, and spiritual shaping, they can have an unimaginably complex variation."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we use them well, we will definitely be able to create miracles."</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to dedicate them all, so that they will forever become the power of the Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>Sander had no intention of hoarding or hiding these powers, because these powers were meant to be passed on to the Hinsai realm.</p><p></p><p>He hopes that more and more people can become priests of the spirit world, and he even hopes that everyone can record this knowledge.</p><p></p><p>He looks forward to the day when the Trifoliate people can create knowledge that surpasses this knowledge, perfect the entire ritual power system, and produce more powerful divine arts.</p><p></p><p>King Heniel came down and patted Sander's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>"Since you said there are nine rituals, I will build eight more temples outside the Temple of Stan in the capital city."</p><p></p><p>"Each temple will guard one ritual, so that the power and light of the gods can shine on everyone as quickly as possible."</p><p></p><p>After that, the entire Hinsai kingdom began a massive construction project to build more temples.</p><p></p><p>In several major cities, majestic halls were erected.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the construction of the temples was not only for the worship of the gods, but also for the Hinsai people themselves, because all kinds of miraculous objects would be manufactured in these temples and then flow into the entire Hinsai kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, miraculous objects made of metal, ceramics, and fabrics have quickly spread to every city, town, and village of the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Temple at the foot of the Holy Mountain strictly controls the production of its products.</p><p></p><p>Metal can be used in all aspects, and at first the priests and nobles of Hinsai only thought of using it to manufacture weapons, so the royal army was completely equipped with various metal-made weapons, making it the first army of the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In the absence of the Ruhek monster, the power of the royal army and the priestly group has become increasingly important, becoming an important cornerstone for the stability of the country.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are also many items for daily use, such as silver bowls, gold cups, and bronze mirrors. But they are all extremely precious and are mostly circulated among the nobility and wealthy merchants.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the Iron Temple is important and highly valued by the kingdom, the impact it has brought to the entire Hinsai kingdom is not as great as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Until later, the priest Sander of the Sky Temple imitated something he had seen in the Fairy Country - the unicycle that the fairies played with.</p><p></p><p>He used metal to manufacture a two-wheeled cart for transporting goods, which was used by the people and priests of the capital as a tool for moving large cargo.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different.</p><p></p><p>First, the kingdom began to have the Iron Temple mass-produce these carts for military use and connections between various cities.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, merchants from various cities flocked to the Holy Mountain to request the construction of carts, which then appeared on the streets and alleys of various cities, becoming the symbol of the Hinsai merchant caravans.</p><p></p><p>The Ceramic Temple is located in the city of Stan, which was also built to commemorate the second saint, Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Because ceramic production is the simplest, the spirit priests of the city of Stan have produced the most miraculous ceramic objects.</p><p></p><p>The caravans waiting at the Ceramic Temple every day completely fill the 20-meter-wide main road.</p><p></p><p>Vehicles leaving the city gates every day are dense and endless.</p><p></p><p>Small items include cups, bowls, and jars, while large ceramic products include basins and vats, etc.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of ceramics flow from the caravans of the city of Stan to the cities, towns, and remote villages on all sides, making up for the lack of daily necessities for thousands and thousands of Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>But it is also looked down upon by other temples, who believe that the products of the Ceramic Temple are just things used by the common people.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, it is the item that has the widest range of penetration into the homes of ordinary Trifoliate people, and the thing that has brought the greatest change to the Trifoliate world.</p><p></p><p>The Ceramic Temple is the one that has allowed the majority of Trifoliate people to know that the times have changed, and that the nine great temples possess miraculous powers that can manufacture all kinds of things that originally only existed in the dreams of the gods.</p><p></p><p>The Textile Temple is located in the City of Divine Descent, which was once the temple of the Hinsai gods.</p><p></p><p>At first, the fabrics it produced were rare items used by the nobility to tailor ceremonial garments, or to decorate the tablecloths, curtains, and door curtains of their castles.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who used it to replace the original bone books, becoming the most popular parchment books among the nobility.</p><p></p><p>Because these nobles heard about the fantastic Fairy Country that Sander mentioned, they competed to imitate the lives and customs of these fairies.</p><p></p><p>They wore robes like the fairies, with various sacred patterns or designs, which were generally used in the worship of the gods or very important occasions.</p><p></p><p>They learned from the fairies to record knowledge and words on parchment books.</p><p></p><p>The Heniel Dynasty even established its first library.</p><p></p><p>Until the Textile Temple produced more and more ordinary textiles and luxurious fabrics, the luxurious fabrics were all taken by the nobles, but the ordinary textiles began to fall into the hands of merchants.</p><p></p><p>Some merchants manufactured them into quilts used for winter warmth, which quickly became popular throughout the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>Merchants also suddenly came up with the idea of manufacturing all kinds of things with the textiles, such as large and small bags for holding things, fishing nets, ropes, and dust covers for carts, etc.</p><p></p><p>So the textiles gradually entered the lives of ordinary Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that these miraculous objects, without any changes in the hands of the priests with divine powers, would explode into one miraculous thing after another in the hands of ordinary Trifoliate people, creating all kinds of things that changed the lives of the common people.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are the other temples such as the Glass Temple, the Oil Temple, and the Ice Temple, whose products have not yet been widely circulated.</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood at a high place watching the crowds leave the God-Gifted City, with one fusion monster after another clearing the path ahead. </p><p></p><p>The Trifolians returned to the sea once more. A few holders of wisdom and power controlled the fusion monsters, driving away the dense schools of fish that followed the setting sun, leaving this paradise that belonged to him, Leadri, and Shari.</p><p></p><p>The entire world fell silent, the once prosperous city becoming deserted and empty. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shen turned around and saw Leadri kneeling before his own statue.</p><p></p><p>"Leadri."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine to leave this place, we don't need so many people accompanying us."  </p><p></p><p>"The sea and land are the destiny of civilization, this is just an island."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to pat Leadri's shoulder like he used to, but his hand passed right through Leadri's body.</p><p></p><p>This made Yin Shen stunned for a moment before realizing the reason.</p><p></p><p>Leadri had given all his mythical blood to his descendants and the Crown of Wisdom, this body was just an ordinary shell, no longer possessing the power Yin Shen had bestowed upon Leadri, having also lost the ability to anchor.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at his luminous hand and was suddenly overwhelmed by intense, nameless rage.</p><p></p><p>"Am I dead or alive?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen wanted to smash everything in front of him, but lowered his raised hand, as anger and impatience were futile.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he could rely on was endless time and life.</p><p></p><p>He could change everything, accomplish anything, needing only to wait.</p><p></p><p>He went from fearing loneliness to loathing it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had grown accustomed to loneliness.</p><p></p><p>A god.  </p><p>Without companions.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the steps of the temple, gazing at the tranquil God-Gifted Land.</p><p></p><p>Watching the sun's light and shadows creep across the buildings of the God-Gifted City from the shore, seeing the moon traverse from one side of the night sea to the other.</p><p></p><p>After the sun rose and set a few cycles, he finally stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Shari!"</p><p></p><p>The girl turned her head towards him, her big eyes staring at him.</p><p></p><p>She trotted over to Yin Shen, craning her neck and making sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Goo roo roo!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen headed down the steps: "Let's go for a walk."</p><p></p><p>The two walked down from the temple, Shari cradling a flower pot.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood for a while before the statue Yeser built for Leadri, then wandered around the silent God-Gifted City, also visiting the marshes that once farmed the ancestral fish.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he stopped at the seashore.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Online.</p><p></p><p>The tides eroded the beach, with scattered rocks and gravel everywhere. Sally planted her beloved sunflower seeds not far from the beach. </p><p></p><p>Like tentacles, the root system kept spreading underground. After leaving the confining planter, this strange half-plant, half-animal life began releasing its powerful vitality.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, it grew over a meter tall. </p><p></p><p>Then, several seedlings sprouted up around it.</p><p></p><p>Propagating, spreading.</p><p></p><p>On the God-blessed land, one sunflower after another bloomed across the ground, covering the beach and coast, climbing up the hills and valleys. New69shu8.com</p><p></p><p>Eventually, they crept into the silent God-blessed city, allowing this empty city to regain the colors of life.</p><p></p><p>The entire God-blessed land turned into a golden sea of flowers. </p><p></p><p>And that towering golden pyramid temple stood right in the center of the flower sea.</p><p></p><p>In this era, this was truly a heavenly paradise and dreamland.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the golden radiant flower sea, with the gold swaying in the breeze, it was somewhat dazzling yet dreamily mesmerizing. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shen felt his mood greatly uplifted.</p><p></p><p>"So beautiful."</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if Sally liked it, but she would quietly wander down and immerse herself in that golden flower sea.</p><p></p><p>Inhaling the fragrant floral scent, she comfortably sunbathed on the flowers.</p><p></p><p>Finally one day, Yin Shen called Sally back from hiding in the flower sea.</p><p></p><p>He prepared to temporarily slow down his perception of time and fall into a slumber.</p><p></p><p>For him, this was also a way to leap across time.</p><p></p><p>Waking up from that sleep could be hundreds or even thousands of years later - it would be like traversing the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Sally, I'm going to sleep for a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Stay in the temple and don't wander off. Don't leave the God-blessed land."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me to wake up."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen entered the divine statue, and the radiance gradually retracted into the statue, no longer showing any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>He awaited for the power of mythical blood to undergo a qualitative change, or for some extraordinary power and authority to transform, perhaps at some point allowing him to alter this current state.</p><p></p><p>In the dark temple, Sally huddled beside the statue, swinging her little legs.</p><p></p><p>Her hollow gaze looked into the distance as she made her unique sound.</p><p></p><p>"Guruguruguru!"</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Land.</p><p></p><p>After the first successful arrival, the second time the Trifolians bypassed all the dangerous areas and successfully reached the origin land. This route was also called the Yeser Route, in memory of Yeser and his companions finding the way.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The great achievements of the land of origin.</p><p></p><p>The second Wise King Yeser led thousands upon thousands of people onto the land, and everyone was stunned by this vast expanse that was hard to imagine.</p><p></p><p>"The land of origin."  </p><p></p><p>"Is this...the place where the gods descended?"</p><p></p><p>"Does all of this belong to us?"</p><p></p><p>They knelt on the shore, kissing the earth and calling out the names of the gods and the first Wise King Leadley.</p><p></p><p>They still believed in the gods, even more devoutly than before. </p><p></p><p>Even though they were expelled from the land blessed by the gods, it was because the Trifolians had committed an unforgivable sin.</p><p></p><p>They were the ones who did wrong, not the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>For they had seen with their own eyes the boundless might of the divine beings, witnessed the terrible judgment that befell those who blasphemed against them.</p><p></p><p>And now, looking at this boundless expanse of land, they suddenly felt that they were not expelled by the gods, but rather the divine beings had bestowed upon them a vaster blessed land.</p><p></p><p>This was a place that could accommodate them and their descendants to live and survive forever.</p><p></p><p>The vast nearby sea had a warm climate, with abundant sea plants and creatures, most suitable for cultivating the progenitor fish gifted to them by the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yeser said, this was the most suitable place for them to live.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was hope and a future.</p><p></p><p>Yeser stood on the cliff by the shore, stretching out his hand towards all the Trifolians who had landed on the land of origin, saying:</p><p></p><p>"I told you."</p><p></p><p>"The gods have not abandoned us."</p><p></p><p>The people cheered joyfully, some were moved to tears, some buried their heads deep in the sand, as if feeling the breath of the gods left here.</p><p></p><p>As if by doing so, they could receive the blessings of the gods, just like the Blessed City.</p><p></p><p>Three giant fusion beasts were carving out huge rocks to build the main body of the new city, while other Trifolians assisted on the side, and also opened up fishing grounds for themselves along the coast.</p><p></p><p>After Ens and Bun died, their fusion beasts also belonged to the new king Yeser.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blazing land of origin and the constantly forming city, Yeser's eyes revealed joy.</p><p></p><p>Yeser's follower asked him, "King."</p><p></p><p>"What should we name this city?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser, wearing the crown of wisdom, fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place where the divine beings descended, and also the birthplace of the great first Wise King, the land of origin of us Trifolians."</p><p></p><p>"But all of this is because of the descent of the divine beings that everything came to be afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the City of Divine Descent."</p><p></p><p>Only one word different from the Blessed City.</p>

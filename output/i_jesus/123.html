        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams carries a brilliant dream and travels among the stars. ‚ï∞‚òÜ‚òÜ 69ShuX.com ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚ïÆ</p><p></p><p>The starlight chases and flutters behind her, gradually dissipating as she departs.</p><p></p><p>The dream moon, rotating like a silver wheel, captivates the will of all sentient beings, constantly projecting their dreams onto this sea of stars. Therefore, new dreams are constantly being born around the fairy.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place."</p><p></p><p>She finally stops in her tracks.</p><p></p><p>She has chosen the best location to hang the dream of a life.</p><p></p><p>This is at the center of the dream world, where she can see the scenery of the second layer, the Fairy Kingdom, and from the Divinely Bestowed Land, one can look up and see this brilliant dream of life.</p><p></p><p>This is not the first time the fairy has placed the dream of a three-leaf person's life into the dreamscape of the stars, but each time she feels it is particularly meaningful and she does it with great care.</p><p></p><p>Because she is permanently hanging the entire life of every individual, every trace of their existence through the years, in this sky.</p><p></p><p>Even if they have already passed away, even if they have completed their journey.</p><p></p><p>Even if.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has already forgotten them.</p><p></p><p>At least here, they will forever accompany the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>The fairy caresses this dream, whispering softly to it with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep well!"</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>She will say this to every life dream she has brought here. üêùüë§69ShuX.comüéâüêü</p><p></p><p>It is a farewell, as well as a blessing.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly senses something and immediately looks down.</p><p></p><p>She sees the golden pyramid of the Divinely Bestowed Land covered in a layer of silver light.</p><p></p><p>No brilliant sun, no lonely moon.</p><p></p><p>But the light has an eternal feeling, no matter time or the world, nothing can erode it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>In the light, there is a figure, standing before the temple, gazing at Stan Tito's life dream.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams immediately flies down from the sky, passing through the Fairy Kingdom, and lands on the pyramid temple.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"You have also come to witness Stan Tito's dream ceremony."</p><p></p><p>The divine being lowers his head and says to the fairy of dreams, "Have you completed what you wanted to do?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams shakes her head, "I've only just begun!"</p><p></p><p>"God."</p><p></p><p>Hila's eyes are full of laughter and radiance, she feels that she has accomplished a successful task, she is somewhat proud but also has greater aspirations.</p><p></p><p>"I can do much more, I can do even better."</p><p></p><p>The God nods, "You have done very well."</p><p></p><p>As the divine being speaks, he also glances at the newly born Fairy Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Hila, who has been staring intently at the God, immediately notices this, and she asks expectantly. ‚ôî‚úå69ShuX.comüí¢üçÆ</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"God?"</p><p></p><p>"This realm of the fairies."</p><p></p><p>------------</p><p></p><p>Yin God and Hila walk through the Fairy Kingdom, this dream bubble formed by the gathering of fairy eggs is very large.</p><p></p><p>Everything within the bubble is currently illusory, but it is precisely this that gives it infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>When the wisdom and power of the three-leaf people combine with the power of the fairies, the forces of reality and the dream world will intertwine and alternate, unleashing unimaginable miracles.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yin God and Hila appear, the fairies appear around them.</p><p></p><p>They dance and sing around the two.</p><p></p><p>Noisy, but it makes one feel happy.</p><p></p><p>The carefree nature of the fairies...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist teachings spread like a contagion.</p><p></p><p>This land of fairies is like a ruptured fairy tale world, with a sky that constantly snows, and a castle and cottages entirely built of ice.</p><p></p><p>There is a land of white clay, with all kinds of clay figurines on the ground, and new little figurines constantly growing out of the ground. There is a world completely covered in silk, with balls of thread rolling on the ground, chased by the fairies, and long white veils hanging down from the sky like floating clouds.</p><p></p><p>There are lakes and rivers entirely made of oil, with steel ships sailing on them, and the fairies quickly walking on the oil and the ships.</p><p></p><p>"God, look at me."</p><p></p><p>"This is what I made."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Hera, this is mine, this is mine."</p><p></p><p>The fairies crowd around, like children waiting for the adults to praise them.</p><p></p><p>Hera is the most popular, completely surrounded by the little fairies now.</p><p></p><p>Outside the fairy kingdom, even the ferrymen of the dream world have come, poling their boats and peering in through the shimmering oil-painted bubble walls.</p><p></p><p>Yun Shen looks at this scene, suddenly becoming interested.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's do some more interesting things!"</p><p></p><p>The fairies listen carefully, as Yun Shen said "interesting things", not "meaningful things".</p><p></p><p>She wants to ask what kind of things are considered "meaningful", but the words don't come out of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the concept of "meaning" only exists for mortals and them.</p><p></p><p>For the eternal gods, everything can only be considered "interesting"!</p><p></p><p>Yun Shen waves his hand, and the Dream Moon in the sky slowly descends.</p><p></p><p>The sun rises, and the stars hide in its brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>The sun of the dream world reveals its true form, and the divine dream in the God's Cup emerges.</p><p></p><p>Annotation texts appear above the divine dream, which will be sensed by the fairies or other intelligent beings when they come into contact with or receive these divine imprints.</p><p></p><p>"Ice divine art imprint, clay divine art imprint, oil divine art imprint..."</p><p></p><p>These existing powers that can directly manipulate the laws of reality are all derived from Yun Shen's dream, which is already miraculous enough for the Sanye people.</p><p></p><p>But for Yun Shen, it is far from enough.</p><p></p><p>He knows this power is too simple and crude, and there will surely be more powerful and refined variations in the future.</p><p></p><p>"This is my dream, but from today on, the God's Cup will begin to collect from all the power-holders."</p><p></p><p>"The priests of the Sanye people, the knights of the Mayen people, the fairies of the dream world can all obtain power from my dream."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, if the power-holders discover and create more methods of controlling and changing the laws of reality in the future,"</p><p></p><p>"Their memories will also be transformed into divine art imprint dreams, permanently stored in the God's Cup."</p><p></p><p>"Their names will also be engraved on the God's Cup forever, just like their imprints, eternally remembered."</p><p></p><p>Yun Shen issues his decree to the God's Cup.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine will acts upon this divine artifact, the sun and the dream moon appear together, and a force directly acts upon all intelligent beings.</p><p></p><p>The will of the god is the law of heaven.</p><p></p><p>It is the power imprinted on the very roots of every life created by the god, from which no one can escape.</p><p></p><p>Yun Shen's eyes hold a trace of expectation as he looks at the God's Cup that currently only holds his own beautiful dreams.</p><p></p><p>"One day, all kinds of divine art imprints will fill this God's Cup."</p><p></p><p>"Through these imprints, the extraordinary powers will also be able to interfere with the forces of reality, becoming stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>The fairies immediately say to the god, "It will definitely happen!"</p>

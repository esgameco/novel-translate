        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 97 No One Wants to Give Up the Power of the Colossal Monster</p><p></p><p>Henir led the new nobles of the Volcanic Kingdom to the Star Robe Palace in the City of the Divine Servants, and the Queen welcomed them with the grandest of ceremonies, with the cheers of the people echoing throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Under the enthusiastic applause and the gaze of the crowd, the new Grand Duke of the Volcanic Kingdom knelt on one knee and swore allegiance to the Star Robe Queen.</p><p></p><p>He reverently held the portion of "The Final Chapter" belonging to the Hoson family, his demeanor humble and his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine that this was the same person who had used the most violent and terrifying means to erase an ancient and magnificent city, and put an end to the Hoson family's centuries-old rule over the Volcanic Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Duke of the Volcanic Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"The Star Robe Kingdom and the Seiron family will never forget your achievements."</p><p></p><p>The Star Robe Queen took the "Final Chapter" by the great poet Tito that Henir had presented, and standing amidst the sea of sunflowers carved on the dome, she displayed this relic of the saint to the priests of the Sky Temple and the nobles of the Star Robe Kingdom, signifying that the Star Robe Kingdom was the true recipient of the divine glory.</p><p></p><p>The people present enthusiastically chanted the three syllables "Hisansei", and the sound echoed through the entire City of the Divine Servants, forming an ocean of voices.</p><p></p><p>"Hisansei!"</p><p>"Hisansei!"</p><p>"Hisansei!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew the meaning behind the chanting of these three syllables.</p><p></p><p>The Star Robe Kingdom and the Seiron family wanted to revive the situation of Hisansei's unification from hundreds of years ago, becoming the supreme ruler of all Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling before the Queen, Henir's expression remained unchanged, only his gaze slightly shifting.</p><p></p><p>He had become the sovereign of the Volcanic Duchy, the title of Grand Duke being the true king of the former Volcanic Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The taste of power and superiority was addictive.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, his eyes fixed on the scepter standing before him.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the wise kings like Raderiki, Yesir, Ariwang, and the Star Queen, whose names were recorded in the history books, had all once held this scepter.</p><p></p><p>This scepter had been the symbol of the King of Hisansei since the loss of the Crown of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Henir raised his head, respectfully gazing at the Star Robe Queen.</p><p></p><p>"The Crown of Hisansei has been lost for hundreds of years, Your Majesty the Queen. You will surely restore the kingdom of Hisansei and the glory of the Seiron family."</p><p></p><p>The Star Robe Queen was delighted by Henir's humble demeanor, and nodded approvingly at him in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>But she did not know that Henir's humble gaze was fixed on the Ruhe brand on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>There were two overlapping Ruhe brands on her forehead, and the one that controlled the sky colossus was gradually fading.</p><p></p><p>The war between the Star Robe Kingdom, the Samon Kingdom, and the Volcanic Kingdom had been extremely fierce. The Star Robe Queen had used the sky colossus many times, rushing to the Sun City and the Stone Forest City like putting out a fire.</p><p></p><p>And due to the approach of the desert worms from the Samon Kingdom, she had to quickly withdraw to the Holy Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Just recently, the Star Robe Kingdom had engaged in a major battle with the Samon Kingdom that lasted half a month, before finally welcoming the submission of the Volcanic Kingdom and this great victory.</p><p></p><p>However, the Star Robe Queen did not know that the divine had already taken back the destructive power of the colossus. Each time she used the Ruhe brand to control the colossus, it was consuming the divine grace bestowed upon the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>But Henir had already begun to prepare for the future, when the Ruhe colossus would become a force that could only be used for deterrence, and no longer easily consumed.</p><p></p><p>No one would be able to recklessly consume the divine grace as they had done in the past.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dream, the Star Robe Queen stood atop the sky colossus, watching the dreamlike starlight in the sky of the Holy Mountain gather into a colorful ribbon.</p><p></p><p>The sea of clouds and the ribbon of colors...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A grand, majestic door suddenly burst open, revealing a sacred and dreamlike world.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless sea of sunflowers, the fairies sang songs for themselves.</p><p></p><p>The messengers of the deities and the Mother of Life stood at the end of the sacred steps, emanating an eternal light like the stars, which was the will and gaze of the deities.</p><p></p><p>She was about to step onto this sacred path to witness the eternal Insai deities.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu had dreamed of opening the realm of the deities once again, and this time it was so vivid.</p><p></p><p>Unlike last time, she believed she would be able to see the deities.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>just as she stood before the gates of the realm of the deities, a voice came from behind her.</p><p></p><p>"You've come again."</p><p></p><p>In the void stood a beautiful creature.</p><p></p><p>It had the appearance of a deity, with flowing golden hair that shimmered with dreamlike starlight.</p><p></p><p>The magnificent golden robe was adorned with suns, stars, and beautiful dream bubbles.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" </p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu recognized the other, for she had seen this being in her dreams before, only having guesses about its identity.</p><p></p><p>But now, she could confirm it.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams approached her and told her, "My name is Shira, the true name you have called upon before."</p><p></p><p>"We meet again."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu said joyfully, "Then, messenger of the deities, have you come to escort me to the realm of the deities?"</p><p></p><p>But the fairy of dreams shook her head, "Not yet."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu asked, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams replied, "Only those willing to renounce the power of the giants and destruction can enter the realm of the deities and welcome the new era."</p><p></p><p>"Queen of the Xinglu Kingdom, descendant of Raideric."</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to give up the power of the giants?"</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu opened her mouth to say she was willing, but just as the words were about to come out, she hesitated.</p><p></p><p>If it had been before, she might have agreed without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, she hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"If Insai is to return to the Siren family, and without the Ruhei giant, will I be able to restore my former glory?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"At least until the crown of Insai reappears."</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams saw the hesitation in Queen Xinglu's eyes and a look of regret and disappointment crossed her face.</p><p></p><p>"It seems..."</p><p></p><p>"I have not come at the right time."</p><p></p><p>The fairy did not say anything more and turned to leave, disappearing in a trail of starlight.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu chased after her, calling out, "Messenger of the deities."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm unwilling, I just..."</p><p></p><p>"I just... want to wait a little longer..."</p><p></p><p>She desperately pursued the fading trail of starlight, but the shadow of the fairy grew more and more distant.</p><p></p><p>The gates of the realm of the deities also receded from her, and the melodious, ethereal songs of the fairies gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>She fell from the gates of the realm of the deities, plummeting down through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>she awoke from the dream,</p><p></p><p>sitting on a stone bed, feeling a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>She did not know whether she had done something wrong, or if she had lost something.</p><p></p><p>The Xinglu Kingdom had obtained the "Final Chapter" by the great poet Tito, as well as the complete key to opening the gates of the realm of the deities.</p><p></p><p>But the ritual to open the gates of the realm of the deities had once again been postponed.</p><p></p><p>The Queen sat on the throne and told her subjects,</p><p></p><p>"I wish to go to the realm of the deities as the King of Insai to witness the eternal Insai deities."</p><p></p><p>This reason seemed quite valid.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, one can only deceive others,</p><p></p><p>but not one's own heart.</p><p></p><p>Nor the deities.</p>

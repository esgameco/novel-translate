        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>It was still that same island, with irregular stone pillars to which the bodies of many Trifoliate people were bound. Their exoskeletons were broken and decaying, exposing their dried-up internal organs, like strange dried meat.</p><p></p><p>Tito was carried by two soldiers of the Abyss People and brought to the shore. Tito was badly injured and was thrown to the ground, limp and motionless. </p><p></p><p>He muttered incessantly in a way the Abyss People could not understand or hear clearly.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter... it doesn't matter.</p><p>This is all the guidance of fate.</p><p>I won't die, I will find the paradise granted by the gods, I will go to the temple of the divine spirits to see the great Insei.</p><p>Because... everything was... already predestined."</p><p></p><p>He also recited the Lederiki Oath, only this way could he forget the pain of his injuries and the fact that he had lost his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The gods said! Because of loneliness, the gods created the Wise King Lederiki, and because of Lederiki's loneliness, the gods then created the Trifoliate people. The race thus began, and the kingdom was established from that moment."</p><p></p><p>"The gods said... the gods said..."</p><p></p><p>The two Abyss People soldiers touched their tentacles together as they rummaged through Tito's belongings, trying to find anything of value. The sword gifted by the Queen of the Star Realm had already been taken by the Sala Lord, and the stone tablets engraved with the Epic of Insei had also been removed. Only empty bone tablets and seemingly useless junk remained.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?" one of the Abyss People soldiers picked up a corroded cup, holding it up to his eyes for a long time before showing it to his companion.</p><p></p><p>"Just more worthless trash," the companion said dismissively, swatting the cup to the ground with a loud crash.</p><p></p><p>Tito, hearing the sound of the cup hitting the ground, was suddenly stirred, as if stimulated. He recognized the sound - it was the sacred cup falling to the ground. Though he could not see, he was very familiar with it. </p><p></p><p>Tito desperately lunged towards the sound, but was held back by the two soldiers. "Give it back! Give it back!" The monster soldiers then tied Tito to the stone pillar, a common method used by the Abyss Kingdom to slowly kill captured Trifoliate people by leaving them to bake in the sun.</p><p></p><p>After securing Tito, the soldiers left. As night fell, Tito began to move, knowing the soldiers were no longer watching. He felt around with his bound feet and realized the sacred cup was still at his feet. Excitedly, he tried to pull it towards himself, but it slipped from his feet and fell with a splash into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Tito was suddenly stunned, and then his body started to tremble violently. He was furious and wanted to break free from the ropes that were helping him, wanting to rush down and retrieve the Cup of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Ahhhhh~"</p><p></p><p>He let out roars of anger, his whole body shaking, but he just couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't see it, he could feel the Cup of the Gods drifting further and further away with the waves, moving farther and farther from him.</p><p></p><p>That feeling was just like being abandoned.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know whether it was fate or the gods that had abandoned him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to shout, but his voice grew weaker and weaker, until it was just like hiccups, with continuous spasms.</p><p></p><p>"Heh~"</p><p>"Heh~heh~"</p><p>"Ugh ugh ugh...hehe~"</p><p></p><p>He felt like a ridiculous and powerless clown being toyed with by fate. </p><p></p><p>When true terror and despair descended upon him, he was so fragile.</p><p></p><p>His blood-stained eyes, along with his tears, flowed down. Tito had never been so desperate before.</p><p></p><p>Even when he had wandered through four countries, faced all kinds of difficulties and dangers, and endured the mockery of countless people, even when he had lost his eyes, he had still maintained his indomitable spirit.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had lost the divine artifact left to him by the Messenger of the Gods, Baro.</p><p></p><p>He had lost his direction.</p><p></p><p>And he had also lost the key to entering the realm of the gods.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Bound on the Island of the Dead for three days, Tito felt like the blood in his body was about to dry up. The scorching sun shining on him seemed to be evaporating the last drop of moisture and blood within him.</p><p></p><p>There was no such thing as a predetermined destiny, and he was not a chosen one. He was just an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>He even found that he was not as resolute as he had told his father when he set out.</p><p></p><p>He had said he had no regrets, but now he regretted it.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Tito."</p><p></p><p>"You are too arrogant and self-conceited. You don't know yourself at all."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can ascend to the divine hall, what kind of people are they? They are the two generations of Wise Kings - the first King Laderiki and the great Yesaer."</p><p></p><p>"They are the Mother of Life, Sali, and the Messenger of the Gods, Baro."</p><p></p><p>"Those who seek the land bestowed by the gods, which of them does not have noble bloodline and status? Which of them are not heroes who have made their mark on history?"</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think you are?"</p><p></p><p>"If Yesaer the King couldn't do it, how could you, a character like you, possibly accomplish it?"</p><p></p><p>He kept questioning and answering himself.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the guidance of fate? Where is there any guidance of fate?"</p><p></p><p>"Tito, you know that this is the false and grandiose rhetoric of mortals trying to justify their own righteousness, yet you speak of it so eloquently."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is deceiving themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this... all your own choice?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he pleaded to the gods again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh gods!"</p><p></p><p>"If you can truly hear my request, please save me."</p><p></p><p>"Save me."</p><p></p><p>No one responded to him, and only death awaited him.</p><p></p><p>In that moment on the verge of death, his mind inexplicably recalled another sentence from Laderiki's Oath, which he had recited countless times but never truly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Laderiki."</p><p></p><p>"I am the god who created you!"</p><p></p><p>"And you..."</p><p></p><p>"Are their king."</p><p></p><p>Just as Tito was about to sink into complete silence, welcoming his own end, an old and shriveled Abyss Dweller climbed onto the island, wearing a stone helmet that covered his face.</p>

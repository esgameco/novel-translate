        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fairy Kingdom. 🍑 ⋆ 🍭🎀𝟨𝟫𝓈𝒽𝓊𝓍.𝒸☯𝓂🎀🍭 ⋆ 🍑</p><p></p><p>Sander woke up.</p><p></p><p>He found himself lying on a brightly lit sailboat, sailing across an oil-paint-like river, with a massive colorful bubble in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The one propelling the boat was a shadowy figure, whose appearance was indistinct, and who did not speak.</p><p></p><p>He lay on the boat and passed through this gigantic bubble, and his vision suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>A magnificent, colorful world was revealed before his eyes, and Sander's pupils dilated.</p><p></p><p>The realm within this bubble was so beautiful and vibrant, completely different from the desolate and bleak world of the Trifolium people.</p><p></p><p>The flowing river was iridescent, with a snowy world and ice-covered cottages in the distance, towering cloud-piercing structures like trees, and giant nests woven from silk.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, fairies flew, dragging themselves along with balloons.</p><p></p><p>In the river, fairies raced their boats, while on the ground, fairies rode unicycles in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a few small heads popped out from the cabin of the sailboat behind him - they were little fairies in golden hooded robes, giggling as they looked at Sander.</p><p></p><p>"Hee hee hee hee!"</p><p>"Look at this person, so dazed."</p><p>"Even in his sleep, he's still clutching that broken wooden board, treating it like a treasure."</p><p>"Just like that poet before."</p><p></p><p>Sander didn't immediately recognize who the poet they were referring to, and could only ask in a confused manner. 😝🍬６❾ѕнⓊⓍ.ⓒỖм✎♩</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>The fairies loved it when people asked them questions - they could prattle on for an entire day, curious about any new thing.</p><p></p><p>"This is of course the Fairy Kingdom."</p><p>"That's right, that's right, it's the realm of us fairies."</p><p>"The new home that the gods gave us."</p><p>"I still prefer the sunflower sea."</p><p>"The sunflower sea isn't far, if you like it, just go back there."</p><p></p><p>Sander was completely bewildered, thinking he must still be dreaming.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that he realized he might not be dreaming, and that the strange creatures before him were indeed the legendary dream fairies, but he still didn't understand where this Fairy Kingdom was.</p><p></p><p>Even in the records of the Tito family, there had never been any mention of a place called the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Fairy Kingdom? Where is that?"</p><p></p><p>The fairies eagerly answered, their small heads crowded together, speaking over each other.</p><p></p><p>"In the world of dreams."</p><p>"The gods said this is the realm of the spirit."</p><p>"Lady Hira said this is the world of memories."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"You mortals often call it the world of the gods."</p><p></p><p>Sander was suddenly jolted from head to toe, becoming fully alert.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood. 💚♢❻❾𝐒ᕼ𝐔𝔁.𝐂𝕆ｍ😲💞</p><p></p><p>He had come to the realm of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Dazed, he followed the fairies as they advanced. He disembarked from the boat and onto the shore, watching the shadowy boatman pole the boat away, disappearing into the starry sky beyond the bubble.</p><p></p><p>He was surrounded by more and more fairies as they led him towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The fairies told him that a great personage awaited him there.</p><p></p><p>He saw a completely unfamiliar, transparent, and glittering structure that looked like a palace, but was too extraordinary and dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Is this made of gems? So many gems?"</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed in wonder, that such pure gems would be used to construct a palace - truly befitting of the realm of the divine.</p><p></p><p>These fairies were indeed extravagantly wealthy.</p><p></p><p>The fairy told him, "This is glass."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Palace of Joy, where we fairies' dreams are stored."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is our most precious and beloved dream," they said.</p><p></p><p>"If you put it inside, it won't fly away, and you can see it through the glass."</p><p></p><p>Sander peered carefully through the glass and saw all kinds of happy memories of laughter and play. Just looking at them made him feel joyful.</p><p></p><p>He also saw the oil lamp.</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought the light inside was from a luminous stone, but now he realized it was actually a flickering flame.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the oil lamp in alarm, exclaiming, "Fire!"</p><p></p><p>"Fire!"</p><p></p><p>"You've even extracted the power of volcanoes and celestial fire, and put it into this small bottle?"</p><p></p><p>The fairies burst into laughter, amused by Sander's exaggerated reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Of course oil can be used to make fire," they explained.</p><p></p><p>Sander then saw the massive metal bridge, which completely astounded him. </p><p></p><p>He had only seen this material in the records of the Tito family - it was the discarded carapaces and horns of giant monsters, used by the royalty to forge precious swords, known as Luhe blades.</p><p></p><p>"Luhe blade material, you've used it to build this enormous bridge?" he exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>This was an incredibly valuable resource in the world of the Trifoliate, only possessed by the royalty and highest nobility, yet the fairies treated it as utterly commonplace.</p><p></p><p>"It's just metal, we can easily conjure it up from mineral ores," they said casually.</p><p></p><p>Sander felt his eyes truly opening. He was starting to understand the sentiments of the great poet - if the Trifoliate also had access to these wonders, how different might their future have been?</p><p></p><p>Finally, he arrived at the central structure of the fairy kingdom, a towering edifice like a great tree.</p><p></p><p>The ancient yet vibrant doors opened, revealing an immense library, completely hollowed out from top to bottom. Lining the walls were countless shelves, stretching up to the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The shelves were filled with scrolls made of cloth, as weaving fairies were collecting the knowledge from the sea of dream-stars, hiding away the most useful parts here.</p><p></p><p>The fairies were preparing to build the ultimate repository of all knowledge - the Fairy Library.</p><p></p><p>And waiting for Sander was the legendary Fairy Queen, said to stand at the left hand of the divine, who had received the visitations of the great poet and the saint Stanislaw Tito.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Sander laid eyes on her, he could tell she was different - her robes were embroidered with the legendary dreams of the gods. She radiated a sacred and noble aura, as if all the beauty in the world was embodied in her.</p><p></p><p>Sander immediately felt unworthy, unable to even look directly at this divine emissary.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Queen of the Fairies?" he asked humbly.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sander, a slave."</p><p></p><p>The Fairy of Dreams told Sander, "The fairies are not of the Trifoliate. We have no king, we are all partners."</p><p></p><p>"The fairies have no slaves, all are equal."</p><p></p><p>Sander bowed low. "O great divine emissary, why have I come here?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy replied, "Because Stanislaw Tito has chosen you, to be the heir to his will and his dreams."</p><p></p><p>"The blessings given by the divine, he has left to you, for he believes you will bring hope and light to the world."</p><p></p><p>"He wishes for you to become... the Messenger."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Sander finally understood the meaning behind Tito giving him that name. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt the heavy burden upon his shoulders, weighing him down and making it hard to breathe.</p><p></p><p>But if it was Stanislaw Tito's will, he would do his utmost to fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," he said.</p>

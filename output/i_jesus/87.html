        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire City of the Divine Servants, including the holy mountain above and below, has recently entered a period of ritual bathing and purification. Thousands upon thousands of people kneel and pray facing the Sky Temple, their voices chanting the Lederik Oath merging together like waves echoing across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sky Temple, Queen Xinglu is kneeling nervously before the divine spirits, preparing for the ritual to open the gates to the Realm of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>Young Stan Tito stands behind her, somewhat reserved, as he notices the queen's tension and pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you also afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Stan's words, Queen Xinglu suddenly relaxes a great deal.</p><p></p><p>"Of course! How can one not have a sense of reverence when facing the great divine spirits?"</p><p></p><p>One is a descendant of the royal bloodline, the offspring of King Lederik. </p><p>The other is a saint who brought back divine artifacts from the Realm of the Gods after the Age of the Divine had ended, the heir of the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, only they are able to stand before the statue of the god Yesir, carved by the king's own hands.</p><p></p><p>Even the priests of the Sky Temple can only stand in the outer corridors at this time.</p><p></p><p>After completing all the preparations, Queen Xinglu takes up the bone tablet and chants the verses left behind by the great poet.</p><p></p><p>At the end, she recites the passage that connects to the dream world, praying for a response from the fairy guardian of the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>"Guardian of the Garden of the Gods, divine messenger of the dream world.</p><p>Oh fairy of hope, I humbly beseech you to answer my prayer."</p><p>"Hira!"</p><p>"I pray that you open the gates to the Realm of the Divine, to welcome the wanderers home."</p><p></p><p>As the queen utters the fairy's true name, the sky above the holy mountain immediately begins to change.</p><p></p><p>Colorful, dreamlike starlight gathers and swirls amidst the clouds, as if a rift has opened to another world, allowing it to flow out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the entire City of the Divine Servants erupts in excitement.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming!" the devout followers cry out, one after another.</p><p>"It's arriving!" They pound the floor with their foreheads, as if the harder they strike, the more fervent their faith.</p><p>"The gates to the Realm of the Gods are about to open," the priests in front of the temple shout, nearly frenzied.</p><p></p><p>They had never before witnessed the arrival of a miracle in the City of the Divine, but this time, they are all participants.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looks up, waiting for the final moment.</p><p></p><p>However, only the dreamlike starlight appears, and the gates to the divine realm do not open.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the starlight fades and disappears.</p><p></p><p>It disappears?</p><p></p><p>The excitement, clamor, and restlessness of the City of the Divine Servants gives way to utter silence.</p><p></p><p>The people stare at the sky, expressions blank.</p><p>The priests, their hands raised, forget to lower them.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu, watching the dissipating starlight and the clearing sky, is unable to accept what has happened.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" she asks, distraught, even panicked. "Why did this happen? </p><p>Is it that the divine spirits do not accept my faith? </p><p>Or have I done something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The queen begins to retreat, nearly falling to the ground. </p><p>Stan Tito supports her, and the temple priests gather around.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, Your Majesty, it is because a key element was missing," one of the priests speculates. </p><p>"We only obtained one page of the great poet's final chapter, while the saint Tito left behind an entire volume of poems.</p><p>Perhaps only when the complete poems of the great poet are present will we have the proof and talisman to open the gates to the divine."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu asks, "Is that truly the case?"</p><p></p><p>The priest replies, "I believe so."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It must be like this," the Queen of the Star Realm could only believe so. In an era when the gods did not issue decrees, they could only rely on speculation to guess the will of the divine.</p><p></p><p>They might also know deep down.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that it was wrong from the beginning, but they still couldn't stop their relentless pursuit.</p><p></p><p>It's as if there was a powerful force in the depths, pushing them forward like a moth to a flame.</p><p></p><p>Could that force be faith?</p><p></p><p>It could also be desire.</p><p></p><p>Or something else.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>A huge Ruhk monster suddenly appeared on the border of the Star Realm Kingdom, and although it only appeared once, it caused great alarm on the Star Realm Kingdom's border.</p><p></p><p>The armies of the Volcano Kingdom and the Samo Kingdom were also mobilized and gathered, one appearing near the Sun City, the other near the Stone Forest City.</p><p></p><p>The two kingdoms were restless, as if they were preparing to wage war on the Star Realm Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, it seems that the Volcano Kingdom and the Samo Kingdom have not yet reached a complete agreement, and the Samo Kingdom has only sent a Ruhk monster to intimidate them.</p><p></p><p>The Volcano Kingdom didn't even send out a Ruhk monster, only amassing nearly ten thousand troops outside the Sun City.</p><p></p><p>But everyone could feel that the situation had undergone a major change.</p><p></p><p>Any small move by the countries from now on could tear apart the fragile balance and peace that had been maintained for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>In the Dream Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the floating island border, the dream fairy looked up at the illusory starlight.</p><p></p><p>In the reflected vision, she saw the terrifying disaster in the Descended City, where two Ruhk monsters were recklessly wielding their power, as if a natural disaster had descended upon the human world.</p><p></p><p>She saw the great army of the Trifoliate People marching to the border, and the Trifoliate People from town after town and village after village fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>Just as the god had said, because she had inadvertently opened the door to the Dream Realm, she had brought disaster to countless Trifoliate People.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the beginning, not the end.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy was terribly afraid and deeply saddened.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>"I... I really didn't want this."</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the empty island, the fairy curled up in the corner, hiding herself.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a big bad guy."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm even worse than a bad guy."</p><p></p><p>A group of little fairies gathered around Hila, looking a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Hila."</p><p></p><p>"Don't cry."</p><p></p><p>"If a fairy cries, she will die."</p><p></p><p>Hila buried her head in the flower cup, as if she was a ostrich hiding its head.</p><p></p><p>A large group of little fairies rushed noisily into the temple, and the Mother of Life, Sali, glared at them, scaring them all away.</p><p></p><p>But there was still one little fairy who ran in and knelt before the divine being.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Hila is going to die."</p><p></p><p>"Great deity, please save her!"</p><p></p><p>Radiant light surged through the entire temple, spreading white over the ground and flowing out beyond the temple.</p><p></p><p>The saddened dream fairy hiding on the edge of the island felt something, and she turned around, just in time to witness a beautiful scene.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light slid down from the sky, like a falling star.</p><p></p><p>In the flower sea, the deity was walking.</p><p></p><p>He came to the edge of the island, standing beside Hila, looking out at the edge of the Dream Realm.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila was also a little afraid: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to die, just like Lord Baro?"</p><p></p><p>The deity let out a faint laugh: "Don't be afraid, a dreaming fairy's tears will not lead to death."</p><p></p><p>"Crying also shows the goodness of the heart, crying is not ugly, crying is also a kind of beauty."</p><p></p><p>"Only when the heart dies and falls can the dream be shattered."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila: "But it's because I opened the door to the Dream Realm that all this happened."</p><p></p><p>The god told the dream fairy Hila: "Hila!"</p><p></p><p>"If you feel you were truly wrong, then find a way to make amends."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yesaier did not expect that one departure would be a farewell. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>He had accomplished his long-cherished dream, conquered the sea and set foot on the continent and the place of origin, but he had not even seen his mother for the last time before she died.</p><p></p><p>He and his father watched as the queen's stone coffin was buried in the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>This place can see the sea, and it is also the oldest district of the city blessed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Laideli and his queen established this place, and every brick and tile here bears their traces, but most of the old people and companions have already passed away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yesaier asked his father, still feeling unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"The Wise King."</p><p></p><p>"Is it really Ens and Buen?"</p><p></p><p>Laideli neither confirmed nor denied.</p><p></p><p>He just said to his son, "The path to becoming a king is not only about gaining, but also about losing."</p><p></p><p>Laideli turned and left the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me!"</p><p></p><p>Yesaier: "Where to?"</p><p></p><p>Laideli looked at the pyramid at the end of the road and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Still relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"To see the gods."</p><p></p><p>Yesaier's body was a bit stiff, and he had already sensed what was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>The father walking in front did not need to turn back, but he could feel his son's emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Yesaier. New69book.com"</p><p></p><p>"You will do better than me, and you will surpass me to become an even greater king."</p><p></p><p>On the main road paved with stones in the city blessed by the gods, all the people spontaneously came out of their houses and stood on both sides of the road.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Laideli led his son, escorted by guards, towards the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>As Laideli and Yesaier passed in front of them, the people on both sides immediately knelt on one knee, bowed their heads, and placed their hands on their chests.</p><p></p><p>The two of them seemed to be walking on a path blessed and worshipped, and everyone knew that when the old king and the new king were replaced, they worshipped the old king and mourned the passing of the old ruler, while at the same time blessing the wise and just new king.</p><p></p><p>Laideli led his son up the stairs, and a group of people carried two stone coffins towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>The former was to come before the gods to inherit the power of the Wise King, while the latter were the sinners who had disturbed and desecrated the gods, as well as their offspring.</p><p></p><p>The stone coffins contained the two sons of the Wise King, Ens and Buen.</p><p></p><p>Ens was the mastermind, but Buen had also agreed to Ens' plan, and all this was evident before the Wise King and the gods.</p><p></p><p>The old and new kings entered the temple, while the sinners knelt outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>In the temple, the god Yin was waiting for Laideli.</p><p></p><p>He was looking at the portraits that Laideli had carved for him, as if it were just yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The newly born Laideli was carving stone statues in the temple, also imitating the voice of the god Yin.</p><p></p><p>The tone was strange, ridiculous, and exaggerated. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>"Time!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really gone by so fast!"</p><p></p><p>Laideli looked at the back of the god, and the flowing light seemed to sweep across his face like the hem of the god's robe. The tall shadow from his kneeling position was so majestic.</p><p></p><p>It was exactly the same as the first time he saw the god, without any change.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I would stand proudly before you, handing in a satisfactory report at the end of my life."</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, I let you see my most embarrassing and powerless moment, witnessing the ugly tragedy of a father-son fratricide."</p><p></p><p>The god Yin looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The aged and stooped figure,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His bone armor, as hard as sandstone, foretold that he had reached the end of his life.</p><p></p><p>Only his eyes remained as devout as they had been in the past.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand: "Laideli!"</p><p></p><p>"What else do you want?"</p><p></p><p>He even looked towards Sally, who stood like a doll in front of the pillar. Although the powers of the two bloodlines conflicted, perhaps Sally's sole life force and immortality could extend Laideli's life.</p><p></p><p>If Laideli pleaded with him, the God would be willing to grant it.</p><p></p><p>Laideli seemed to discern the God's intent, and he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"It's time to let go."</p><p></p><p>"I must let go, and you must let go as well."</p><p></p><p>"Because I couldn't bear to let go, I brought about today's bitter fruit, and ultimately killed my own firstborn son, Enes."</p><p></p><p>"I am also your firstborn son, and I have received more than enough of your favor."</p><p></p><p>The God put down his hand and said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"You decide!"</p><p></p><p>A childlike smile spread across Laideli's face. The God still favored him as before, even though he had defied the God's will, even though his thoughts and will were utterly ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>"Yaseir!"</p><p></p><p>"Come."</p><p></p><p>He looked at his son and pulled him to stand beside him, kneeling together before the God.</p><p></p><p>Yaseir knelt at the God's feet, but gazed at his father.</p><p></p><p>"King!"</p><p></p><p>But Laideli said, "Here, I am no longer your king."</p><p></p><p>Yaseir's voice suddenly became choked with emotion, and tears continuously fell from the corners of his eyes: "Father."</p><p></p><p>Laideli smiled contentedly. He raised both hands and slowly lifted the crown from his own head.</p><p></p><p>Then, he placed it on Yaseir's head.</p><p></p><p>"From now on!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the king!"</p><p></p><p>"The second Wise King of the Xingxai Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Yaseir wept uncontrollably, his shoulders shaking.</p><p></p><p>He was Laideli's youngest son, a prince who had grown up under high expectations and favoritism. His father's attention and preference had been like a great mountain sheltering him, giving him the courage and strength to realize all his dreams, making him fearless in the face of any difficulty.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>This great mountain was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>He said helplessly, "No!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the king, you will always be the king of the Trifoliate people, the king of the Xingxai Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"The eternal Wise King."</p><p></p><p>Laideli laughed, his eyes slowly closing.</p><p></p><p>"Eternity belongs only to the divine."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how much we gain, we will ultimately... wither and lose it all."</p><p></p><p>As Laideli spoke these words, he completely closed his eyes and never opened them again.</p><p></p><p>Laideli's last will and strength surged forth, forming a illusory luminous outline that finally merged into the Wise King's crown.</p><p></p><p>The black crown connected with Yaseir's bone armor, linked to his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Yaseir could feel all the will and consciousness of the Trifoliate people emerging in his mind at this moment. His consciousness was like a galaxy, and each star in the galaxy was the consciousness of a Trifoliate person.</p><p></p><p>He stood as the ruler of this galaxy, able to command the movement of this stellar river.</p><p></p><p>He had inherited the power of the Wise King from the ancient King Laideli, along with his father's will and ideals.</p><p></p><p>The now-bereft Laideli began to ossify throughout his entire body, finally transforming into a statue kneeling before the God.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had promised.</p><p></p><p>He would guard the divine here forever.</p><p></p><p>Until the sun is extinguished, until the end of time.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of fearless soldiers from the Demon Abyss Kingdom charged forward, led by the Demon Abyss Knights. They nimbly evaded the tentacles that extended from the underground Demon Worm's belly, but in the process, three or four dozen people were killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>It was during this exchange that the Demon Abyss Knight felt the power of the Demon Worm.</p><p></p><p>Her expression changed instantly, her pupils contracting violently.</p><p></p><p>This was not a clumsy, bulky creature; it possessed extremely agile transformation and strength.</p><p></p><p>"Scatter! Nimbly form teams and seek its weaknesses," the Demon Abyss Knight commanded, and her orders were quickly relayed to every corner, as if the soldiers were extensions of her will.</p><p></p><p>But all of this was insignificant in the eyes of Weis Hosen.</p><p></p><p>The history of Hisence had seen countless conflicts and wars, but they had repeatedly proven that the power of the Titans was invincible. They were the pinnacle of life and strength, disregarding all techniques and embellishments.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they descended, it was destruction and natural disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Worm, shake them to death," Weis Hosen waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Worm's hideous mouth opened, and it let out a roar. Invisible sound waves rippled out, stirring up violent waves from the seabed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the thousands of Demon Abyss people surrounding it were swept away like leaves in a flood, with hundreds of the closest soldiers having their internal organs destroyed, already dead beyond death.</p><p></p><p>This power had little effect on the Titans and Priests, so it had not been used during the previous battle between Weis Hosen and Queen Xinglu. But for ordinary people, it was a slaughter weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Knight saw this scene, and her eyes instantly turned red.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Hisence people, I will make you pay the price."</p><p></p><p>Her mount, the strange shrimp, was instantly killed by the shockwaves, but she pushed it away and charged forward against the sound waves.</p><p></p><p>Her face was ferocious, and her whole body was bursting with power. Dozens of black bone spears exploded in her hands, turning into afterimages that attacked the Titan's head from all directions, reaching Weis Hosen.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, she really threatened Weis Hosen.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power!" The prince was shocked, not because of the opponent's strength, but because the Demon Abyss Kingdom had mastered the method of entering the realm of high-level priests.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Art: Spiritual Power Shield" An invisible spiritual power field deflected the dozens of black bone spears, instantly turning the Demon Abyss Knight's expectation into gloom and despair.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Weis Hosen understood: "The Sun Cup!"</p><p></p><p>"You obtained the Sun Cup that flowed out from the burial place of the great poet, and then drank the power of the Divine Cup, gaining the second-tier ability."</p><p></p><p>The prince was pleasantly surprised, as he had finally found the trail of the Divine Ship: "The Divine Ship must have been heading to this place."</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup was the supreme divine object of all countries, only cultivated in the forbidden lands of the capital. The Demon Abyss people could never have obtained such a thing.</p><p></p><p>And the opponent had clearly awakened the second-tier ability, manifesting wisdom as spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This immediately made Weis Hosen think of the Sun Cup flower cluster from the burial place of the great poet, where the Divine Ship had charged into the sea, carrying a small amount of the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>This discovery made Weis Hosen less eager to kill, as he no longer planned to kill the Demon Abyss Knight. He wanted to capture her and learn from her mouth where the Sun Cup came from.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could even learn the location of the Divine Ship from the Demon Abyss Knight's mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss people charged fearlessly, but the end result was heavy casualties, with no hope of victory.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-meter-long, terrifying size of the Demon Worm, its powerful regenerative ability, its transforming tentacles and blade-like tips, and the invisible yet easily lethal destructive sound waves all made the Demon Abyss people feel hopeless.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Knight was furious, but she was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Facing the powerlessness against the Titan Ruhel, she was once again reminded of the fear hidden in her bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat! All retreat back to the deep sea!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sir Houson looked mockingly at the fleeing Abyssal people. The burrowing earth worms quickly swam through the sea, chasing after the female Abyssal knight, cornering them into a dead end.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p>"Bring me the monster lord of that Abyssal nation."</p><p></p><p>Weis Houson issued the order, telling his subordinates and followers to capture that female Abyssal knight.</p><p>He feared the giant monster's powerful strength, as a single touch could crush these weak ants.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>The two priests and over a dozen strong three-leaf soldier guards charged down from the body of the Ruhir giant.</p><p></p><p>Watching the entire ocean submit to his command, seeing thousands upon thousands of Abyssal people fleeing in panic before him, seeing everything within his sight under his control - in this moment, he even had a feeling.</p><p>He was like a god!</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling of the royal bloodline of the Four Great Powers, their immense power allowing them to look down upon all living beings, ignoring any voices that dared to defy their will or oppose them.</p><p>Some found themselves and their direction through power, while others lost themselves and fell into depravity.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that his brother Heniel suddenly looked up at him from behind.</p><p></p><p>In Weis Houson's moment of distraction, a Ruhir sacred sword pierced through his chest from behind.</p><p></p><p>"You!" Weis Houson's body stiffened as he twisted his head to look at Heniel.</p><p>Heniel did not hesitate, cruelly jamming his fingers into the crevices of Weis Houson's facial armor, forcefully shattering the faceplate and gouging out the bone from between Weis Houson's eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>That piece of bone, branded with the Ruhir seal and controlling the mythical monster, gushed with fresh blood as Weis Houson was engulfed in excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's previously calm expression slowly twisted, his mouth opening wide in an unrestrained, almost explosive release of what had been suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The remaining seven or eight guards were shocked, quickly rushing to surround and attack Heniel, trying to rescue their prince.</p><p>But with a mere raise of his hand, Heniel sent them all flying, bone spikes piercing through their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Weis Houson stumbled backwards, howling in agony. Opening his mouth underwater, he forgot to use his wisdom abilities and simply spoke, his voice inaudible in the depths.</p><p>But Heniel, watching him, knew what he was asking: "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Weis Houson had always treated Heniel like a brother, even promising to make him the palace minister once he became king. He did not understand.</p><p></p><p>Heniel's previously peaceful eyes now slowly oozed with hatred, no longer concealed, or perhaps no longer able to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Why? Because I hate you all!"</p><p>"Heniel, the black mud - look at the name your king gave me. In your eyes, I am just a blob of black mud, a stain at the feet of the Houson family."</p><p>"I'm telling you, telling your king, and all the Houson family - even if I'm just a blob of black mud, I will be the black swamp that swallows the entire Houson family."</p><p>He whispered into Weis Houson's ear, "You know?"</p><p>"Your lofty appearance is so disgusting."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Weis Houson recalled another figure, the one who had opened the gateway to the divine realm.</p><p>Enraged, he roared with all his might.</p><p>"You traitors!"</p><p></p><p>But Heniel didn't even let him finish, forcefully pulling his Ruhir sacred sword out of Weis Houson's body and kicking him down into the depths of the sea.</p><p>"Die, Weis Houson of the Houson family!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's sudden betrayal not only caught the three-leaf guards off guard, but also stunned the entire Abyssal people of the Salah region.</p><p>Heniel looked at the eyebrow bone in his hand, with its mysterious and complex Ruhir seal.</p><p>"What royal bloodline family? What descendants of the Laidley King?"</p><p>"The one who controls the power of the giants - that is the true king."</p><p></p><p>With that, he swallowed the blood-stained eyebrow bone.</p><p>Heniel had taken the burrowing earth worms, but didn't even glance at the Abyssal people. Instead, he used the earth worms to kill all the three-leaf guards present, then rode the worms and left the area.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, he had never intended to search for any sacred ship, nor to support Weis Houson's ascension to the throne.</p><p>He had his own plans.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The distant horizon was the vast open sea, and even though he could not hear the sound of the waves, Stan Tito could feel the rhythm of the tides echoing in his ears just by looking at it. ஜ۩۞۩ஜ ❻➈şｈυ𝔵.¢๏ᗰ ஜ۩۞۩ஜ</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Divinely Descended City!"</p><p></p><p>The familiar city, the familiar sea breeze scent.</p><p></p><p>All of it made him so nostalgic.</p><p></p><p>He had not been away from here for long, but it felt as if he had been gone for many years.</p><p></p><p>As he walked forward, he saw a large crowd gathered in front of a series of small and large stone mounds outside the city - these were the graves of the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>The mounds were formed by piling up stones of varying sizes, accumulating into a cemetery.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gathered here had sorrowful expressions, passing by and placing a stone on top as they mourned the deceased, a custom of the Trifoliate people to honor their dead.</p><p></p><p>The fortunate son returning home asked, "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Someone replied to him, "We are mourning the recent loss of our loved ones who perished in the calamity of the giant monster. Those unfortunate souls who fell victim to the natural disaster."</p><p></p><p>To ordinary people, the giant monster was a natural disaster, a divine punishment.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito: "All of these are...?"</p><p></p><p>The other person nodded, "All of them."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked at the layered mounds, at least hundreds, if not thousands, at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The joy and excitement of homecoming were instantly dispersed: "The disaster is only the beginning, the suffering continues."</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the destruction and devastation brought by the giant monster, and now he was seeing the painful aftermath.</p><p></p><p>He no longer had the heart to enter the Divinely Descended City, and instead returned directly to Tito Town.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see the people of his hometown, although there were not many who recognized him in Tito Town, as he was just the unassuming son of a craftsman.</p><p></p><p>However, when he returned, he found that the once prosperous town had now become a deserted city.</p><p></p><p>Abandoned and empty.</p><p></p><p>Not a single sign of life.</p><p></p><p>He walked through the desolate town, feeling somewhat bewildered. 🏆♤➅➈ˢ𝓱Ữ𝓧.ｃ𝑜м☯♗</p><p></p><p>Outside the town, he found an elderly resident of the former Tito Town.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the people of the town?"</p><p></p><p>The old man replied, "Most of the craftsmen have been conscripted to repair the collapsed palace, and the remaining people have scattered, some seeking refuge in other branches."</p><p></p><p>"No one wants our goods anymore, and we don't have our own fishing grounds, so we have no choice but to seek other means of survival."</p><p></p><p>The old man sighed, "Tito Town."</p><p></p><p>"It's gone."</p><p></p><p>As the prosperity of Tito Town faded, everything had dissipated like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito felt somewhat absurd: "The Queen is no longer here, so why are they repairing the palace?"</p><p></p><p>The response came, "The Queen is gone, but they say there's a new king now."</p><p></p><p>"The lord of the Divinely Descended City is trying to curry favor with him by rebuilding the palace to welcome the new king's arrival."</p><p></p><p>"That's what they say."</p><p></p><p>"Only this way can the glory and prestige of the Divinely Descended City be maintained!"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito: "Heniel?"</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded, "Yes, that's the name."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito couldn't understand, "Heniel has just ascended the throne, how could he have time to come to the Divinely Descended City and concern himself with them?"</p><p></p><p>The old man shrugged, "The affairs of the great ones, how could we understand them?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito laughed, but it was a bitter laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Was it the giant monster that brought destruction, or the greed and desires of the human heart that invited the calamity?"</p><p></p><p>---------------------</p><p></p><p>A stone slab as tall as a person, through the skillful hands wielding chisels and hammers, was gradually transformed into a exquisite carving.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman carved this work of art on the stone slab, putting all his effort into it.</p><p></p><p>In the painting.</p><p></p><p>In the cemetery at the foot of the city wall, people were grieving and weeping for the loss of their loved ones.

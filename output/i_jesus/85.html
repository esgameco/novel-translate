        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky beast's entire body is semi-transparent, and the people who are swallowed into its air sac feel as if they are standing in the vast sky, and can even see the outside scenery through its body. ‚û∂‚û∂‚û∂‚û∂‚û∂ 69≈û·ïº·µò‰πÇ.œÇ√ò·ó∞ ‚û∑‚û∑‚û∑‚û∑‚û∑</p><p></p><p>The clouds flow under the membrane of the giant monster, and the young craftsman Stan rides the sky beast through the vast sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!" The pupil of the craftsman's eyes suddenly went blank.</p><p></p><p>He feels that all of this is so unreal, this should be a sight that only the gods can appreciate, is this really something that an ordinary mortal like him can see?</p><p></p><p>He sees the vast wilderness constantly passing under his feet, until a lake that looks like a sea appears at the end of the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Lake?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately in front of the Holy Lake, there is a mountain, and the temple in the sea of clouds is vaguely visible.</p><p></p><p>"And the Holy Mountain, that is... the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Sky Temple before, but at the moment he saw this temple, he finally understood why the aging believers from the City of the Descended Gods would come on a pilgrimage from afar.</p><p></p><p>Just to die at the foot of the Holy Mountain, and rest in the sacred lake under the gaze of the gods.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thought suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If I have to die one day, I must die here."</p><p></p><p>"Die under the feet of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Just like... King Laideli."</p><p></p><p>Finally, the sky beast landed above the City of the Divine Servants.</p><p></p><p>He floated down to the square in front of the palace, and followed the lord of the City of the Descended Gods and the high priest of the Insei Temple to enter the grand and majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>But when he reached the gate of the palace, he stopped and did not dare to enter.</p><p></p><p>The high priest of the Insei Temple said kindly to him, "It's okay. üòæ‚ôó6‚ûàùïäÔº®·ëåùê±.ùì¨ùïÜ–ºüçü‚ôü"</p><p></p><p>"Come in, young man."</p><p></p><p>"The Queen is waiting to summon you."</p><p></p><p>Stan was suddenly flustered and stammered, "The... the... the Queen?"</p><p></p><p>The Tito family is descended from the City of the Divine Servants and was once one of the most prominent families here.</p><p></p><p>But this is the first time Stan has come here, and the first time he has met the Queen.</p><p></p><p>He walked into the palace with trepidation and excitement, standing before Queen Xinglu. He tried to imitate the etiquette of others, but it was obvious that he was a crude country boy.</p><p></p><p>"Great Queen!"</p><p></p><p>But the Queen did not mind, and instead looked at him with interest and asked, "What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Stan!" He first said his own name, then hesitated for a moment and repeated it.</p><p></p><p>This time, he added his surname.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was just a commoner, a commoner who was not entitled to a surname.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Stan, Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>The lord of the City of the Descended Gods said beside him, "He is the descendant of the great poet, the lucky son who found the final chapter."</p><p></p><p>"This is the guidance of fate, and the will of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>"The final glory must ultimately belong to the great Queen Xinglu."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu looked at the young man, and she suddenly understood why the lord had to bring this young man when he delivered the final chapter left by the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can the Xilun family rightfully take over the "final chapter" left by the saint Tito family.</p><p></p><p>"You are quite good. ‚ôòüê∫‚ûÖ9sùïô‚ì§ÔΩò.·∂úùï†Ôº≠‡∂èüêâ"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's blood boiled, he did not understand why he was so valued.</p><p></p><p>But this is the first time he has felt that he is respected and needed by others.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Stan Tito received the most orthodox noble etiquette training, and was even personally taught by the high priest of the Insei Temple of the City of the Descended Gods.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood what the bone tablet he found was.</p><p></p><p>It was a sacred relic left by his ancestor, the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>It recorded the way to the kingdom of the gods.</p><p></p><p>He immediately became hesitant, if he handed over his ancestor's belongings, how would his ancestor see him?</p><p></p><p>The priest saw his thoughts: "How do you know that it was you who found the sacred relic, and not the relic that chose you?"</p><p></p><p>"It is it that has brought you to the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the empty divine temple, it wanted to come before the Queen.</p><p></p><p>"It is the embodiment of the divine will, and no one can defy the destiny ordained by the gods."</p><p></p><p>The priest looked into his eyes and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Stans."</p><p></p><p>"Fate is not something you can choose, but rather fate has chosen you."</p><p></p><p>"This is also the reason you are standing here now."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the priest's words, Stans immediately felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>"If this is the will of the gods, I am willing to become the chosen one."</p><p></p><p>On a sunny morning, the sunlight shone through the windows on both sides and onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, Stans Tito slowly walked up to the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>He carried the bone tablets and reverently placed the stone tablets and "The Hymn of the King of Wisdom" on the divine altar, at the feet of the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling before the most powerful figures in the Star Kingdom, he addressed the Star Queen.</p><p></p><p>"Great Star Queen, the earthly representative of the divine will."</p><p></p><p>"All glory belongs to you, to the great divine."</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen raised her scepter and pointed it at the craftsman Stans.</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of the Saint Tito."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are Stans Tito."</p><p></p><p>"The inheritor of the will of the great poet Tito."</p><p></p><p>With a single word, the Star Queen determined Stans' identity, instantly elevating him from a lowly craftsman to the peak of the Star Kingdom's nobility.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Volcano Kingdom, situated beneath a dormant volcano, a terrifying Ruhek giant crouched atop the crater.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the pointing and whispering, Weis Hosen passed through the long corridor before the palace, seeing his father and several uncles and brothers.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the face of the father seated on the throne was extremely grim, while the brothers standing below wore expressions of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>The usually favored Prince Weis had committed a grave error this time, and he would undoubtedly lose his father's trust, and perhaps even his right to inherit the throne.</p><p></p><p>This was a delightful sight for the others.</p><p></p><p>The king's cold gaze fell upon the prince: "How dare you return?"</p><p></p><p>"What did you promise me before?"</p><p></p><p>"I gave you the diamond worms and the dark ones from the City of the Descent, and this is how you repay me?"</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen knelt on the ground: "Although the Star Kingdom has obtained the final chapter of the great poet, they have only obtained the method to open the door to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>"We have not lost yet, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>The king paused: "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen continued: "Opening the door to the divine realm is only the first step. The sky above the City of the Descent has also opened the door to the divine realm before, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"Who can enter it?"</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, standing tall.</p><p></p><p>"But I."</p><p></p><p>"Know how to enter the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>The king's expression changed instantly: "How to enter the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>The prince of the Volcano Kingdom answered: "A ship, a ship bestowed by the divine messenger!"</p><p></p><p>He took out the "Tito's Travelogue" and exclaimed passionately.</p><p></p><p>"It is all recorded here, all hidden in the burial place of the Saint Tito."</p><p></p><p>"The divine messenger who stood by the side of Insei and was on par with the Mother of Life once bestowed upon Saint Tito a ship, a ship sailing from the divine realm to the mortal world."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"We have not wasted our efforts, for without this ship, no one can enter the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the palace stood up, including the king of the Volcano Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The sacred ship."</p><p></p><p>They all made the connection at once.</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger Tito wrote the eternal chapters while also commanding the divine messenger to leave the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>His final chapter must have recorded the method to open the door to the divine realm, so he must have also left behind the way to enter the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>They all cried out in unison: "That is the ship to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen nodded, looking at his father.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>"Great king, I am willing to find this sacred ship that leads to the divine realm for you."</p>

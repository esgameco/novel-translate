        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Temple, Sander stood in the corridor connecting the side hall. </p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the colorful ceramic vase placed in front of the window, which was painted with scenes of the pilgrimage of the first generation of saints.</p><p></p><p>The sea of sunflowers, the statue of King Laideli, the sacred stairs, and the fairy messengers welcoming him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the painter had not actually seen the scenes from hundreds of years ago, so this sacred scene was nothing more than imagination.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Temple was also completely different from what it used to be, having transformed from rustic and rugged to exquisite and luxurious.</p><p></p><p>Colorful stained glass windows, snow-white curtains, and ceramic sacrificial vessels decorated the temple.</p><p></p><p>The temple gate was made of bronze, and even the original columns had been gilded and inlaid with silver. Some of the exquisite sacrificial utensils were enough to shock even the minor local nobility.</p><p></p><p>A group of hurrying priests in their ritual robes saw Sander and quickly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"High Priest."</p><p></p><p>But after the greetings, they hurried away. They did not dare to get too close to Sander.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the ritual power he brought to the Hinsai, Sander had finally become the High Priest of the Sky Temple a few years later. However, his situation was not good. The various priestly families with bloodlines tracing back to the royal clan had joined forces to counteract Sander's influence, and the major temples were all weakening the power of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>The royal bloodline seemed to have disappeared, but the royal family was still continuing in another way.</p><p></p><p>They felt that someone like Sander becoming a priest was an insult to the priestly families and the noble bloodline. The young priests of those priestly families disdained to enter the Sky Temple and instead flocked to other temples in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>Although Sander had become the High Priest of the Sky Temple, he could only control the Sky Temple, and he could not even fully control the Sky Temple itself.</p><p></p><p>As the nominal High Priest of the Sky Temple, he was the leader of all the priests. But in reality, as other temples gradually rose, the Sky Temple was gradually losing its original function and becoming a symbolic existence.</p><p></p><p>In this, there was also the tacit approval of King Heniel.</p><p></p><p>Heniel had also noticed that he was intentionally dividing the power of the priests, and Sander's arrival and the establishment of the nine ritual temples were the beginning.</p><p></p><p>But Sander did not care about these things.</p><p></p><p>What Sander cared about was that the power of the priests had not changed much over the years.</p><p></p><p>The power of the rituals was hoarded by the various temples, and the many high-level priests still could not become spirit world priests, unable to learn the knowledge they had brought back from the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The various temples, in order to maintain their own interests and power, prohibited the priests of other temples from learning and using their own rituals, as if treating the power of the rituals as their own possession.</p><p></p><p>They collected and stored the power of the rituals, only allowing their own people to learn, and had no interest in widespread dissemination and exploration of the power of the rituals.</p><p></p><p>Some even believed that allowing miraculous things to become something that ordinary people could use was a desecration of priestly power.</p><p></p><p>Sander, of course, knew what these people were thinking, but he was still very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it always like this!"</p><p></p><p>A young priest heard Sander's words and came out, bowing behind Sander and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Because people like you and the saints are the rare few."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"Only people like the saints and you can change this world."</p><p></p><p>The young priest came from a minor noble family in the city. His family's branch had belonged to the Hosen family hundreds of years ago, but had long since lost its power.</p><p></p><p>For two hundred years, only he had suddenly awakened the power of wisdom and become a priest and entered the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>He was the glory of his family.</p><p></p><p>He was not alone, as there were many other merchants' or commoners' children who had awakened their powers at birth.</p><p></p><p>The power of wisdom had been passed down since the reign of King Laideli, and over the generations, as the three-leaf people multiplied and the royal family branched out, the mythical blood had become more and more widespread, and those with latent bloodlines had become more and more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, more and more priests with wisdom powers who came from the lower classes had emerged.</p><p></p><p>Most priestly families relied on the hereditary power bestowed by their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>While these priests who had naturally awakened came mostly from humble origins.</p><p></p><p>In theory, these naturally awakened priests with innate talents should be more valued and cultivated.</p><p></p><p>However, the reality was that these priests with natural talents were subjected to exclusion, and they were strongly suppressed and rejected by the major priestly families.</p><p></p><p>Sander shook his head and repeated an old saying.</p><p></p><p>"It is the saints and the divine spirits who bestow all upon the three-leaf people who can change the world."</p><p></p><p>"I am merely an agent of the will of the saints."</p><p></p><p>Sander turned and pushed open the door of the corridor, walking towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>"I am the shadow of the saints, the heir to their ideals."</p><p></p><p>The priest's eyes shone with light, and he greatly admired Sander, believing him to be a great priest.</p><p></p><p>Sander had brought light and hope to the world, and although he came from humble origins, he possessed a broad mind and ideals.</p><p></p><p>The priest hurried after him and said to Sander:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sander, I understand your thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"You want to put the ideals of the saints into practice, you want more people to become the force that opens up a new era, you want miracles to spread to every corner of the world."</p><p></p><p>"You want..."</p><p></p><p>"The civilization of the three-leaf people to enter a new era."</p><p></p><p>Sander turned back and carefully examined the other.</p><p></p><p>From his eyes, he could see sincerity and passion.</p><p></p><p>Just like...</p><p></p><p>his former self.</p><p></p><p>The young priest continued: "In my hometown and many other cities, the priests also yearn to become spirit world priests, to become part of the force that changes this world."</p><p></p><p>"They can become your followers, the heirs to your and the saints' ideals."</p><p></p><p>"And I..."</p><p></p><p>"Can recruit them to you."</p><p></p><p>Sander's eyes gradually lit up, and his expression changed completely.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"They can come to the Sky Temple, anyone can."</p><p></p><p>"I can teach them all the ritual formations, I will not be stingy with all the knowledge I possess."</p><p></p><p>The young priest knelt on the ground, his hands on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sander."</p><p></p><p>"We will always be grateful for your great vision, you are the true messenger."</p><p></p><p>Sander had found his fellow travelers and followers, and the two of them set out...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sander suddenly felt that his life was a bit different.</p><p></p><p>He had his own things he wanted to do, and at the same time, he vaguely saw the direction to move forward.</p><p></p><p>The priest left the Sky Temple full of ambition to recruit those priests who were willing to serve Sander.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Sander was eagerly waiting for the priest to return, in the dark dawn, the priest was carried back to the Sky Temple, barely alive and covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>Sander hurriedly put on a robe embroidered with nine mysterious symbols and rushed to the side room of the temple.</p><p></p><p>The priest, with only a breath left, forcefully opened his eyes and looked at Sander.</p><p></p><p>Sander's voice was a bit hoarse: "Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>The priest weakly smiled: "It was just an accident."</p><p></p><p>Sander did not believe him. He could guess who did it - those priestly families that were hostile to him, those temple priests who did not allow the ritual formations to be passed on. And the most hostile to him was the Tito family.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that even if he knew it was them, he had no way to directly deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Those around him cried and said, "It was a group of priests who attacked us. They used the power of the rituals."</p><p></p><p>The young priest kept spitting out fresh blood, and Sander was powerless.</p><p></p><p>In this era, the crude medical skills were completely useless for such serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sander!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry I couldn't accomplish anything for your ideals."</p><p></p><p>Sander's eyes suddenly filled with tears, and he tightly grasped the priest's hand.</p><p></p><p>"You have done enough."</p><p></p><p>The priest finally said with a smile, "I am honored to be your follower."</p><p></p><p>Sander had the doctor try every possible way to save the priest, but in the end, he still died.</p><p></p><p>He had the body of the priest carried away. Alone, with his eyes reddened, he went to the highest point of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>This was a cliff, from which one could overlook the entire Holy Lake, dangerously dizzying.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, standing here, one could feel that the sea of clouds and the Holy Lake were at one's feet.</p><p></p><p>Even some called this the Seat of the Gods, because they felt that only divine beings were worthy of appreciating such a view.</p><p></p><p>No one was here, not even the priests could easily approach this place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sander completely erupted. He waved his arms frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why, even though I'm like this, you still don't accept me?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you want? That is the power of the gods, something the saints have exchanged their lives for."</p><p></p><p>"Have you really made it your own?"</p><p></p><p>He shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"By what right?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you worthy?"</p><p></p><p>"You filthy, ugly things."</p><p></p><p>Sander considered himself a fair priest serving the gods. He had unreservedly passed on his knowledge to everyone, and he only wanted to fulfill the ideals of the saints.</p><p></p><p>He had never thought of doing anything for himself - everything he wanted to do was for everyone.</p><p></p><p>"You people, you people, why are you so ugly."</p><p></p><p>"The Trifoliate people!"</p><p></p><p>"You are so evil and disgusting, so despicable and sickening!"</p><p></p><p>"Original sin!"</p><p></p><p>"You are people born with original sin, you are the descendants who were driven out of God's paradise."</p><p></p><p>After venting his anger, Sander sat on the ground, covering his face helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He was furious at the ugliness of those people, but at the same time he was also furious at his own powerlessness and inaction.</p><p></p><p>He began to carefully reflect on these years of himself, relying on the gift of Saint Stanislav to become the controlling figure of the Sky Temple. It seemed that he had really not accomplished anything.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly with many achievements, seemingly the kingdom of Hinsai had undergone tremendous changes because of him. But these, any ordinary person could have done.</p><p></p><p>Any ordinary person could have perfectly completed this simple task.</p><p></p><p>"From when did you start becoming like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"Sander?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the person chosen by the saints? Did the saints want to see a person like you become the heir to their ideals and will, to become the high priest of the Sky Temple?"</p><p></p><p>He was bewildered and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"What difference is there between me and those idle priests, those greedy and extravagant nobles?"</p><p></p><p>Sander felt that he could no longer continue like this.</p><p></p><p>The steadfast scholar finally revealed his anger - the illusion of the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>Here was the library left behind by the great poet, and also the sacred dream recorded by the second-generation Saint Stanislav, which was the most precious thing to Sander, even more than "The Last Chapter".</p><p></p><p>Sander came to the dream where Stanislav saw the divine messenger again.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he was at a loss, whenever he couldn't find the answer, whenever he felt he couldn't persevere anymore, he would come here.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't get a response, just seeing Saint Stanislav and the divine messenger made him feel that he had found a direction.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient palace, Stanislav's works were hung all around.</p><p></p><p>Still that painting of "The Puppet of Fate" below, the craftsman carving his work meticulously.</p><p></p><p>He went to Stanislav's back, kneeling on the ground and holding his hands to his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you choose me, choose such an ordinary and mediocre person?"</p><p></p><p>"Choosing any other person, choosing others, they could all do better than me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Sander asked Stanislav.</p><p></p><p>Only he himself knew the taste of this slave-born person sitting in the position of the high priest of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>This time, there was a change.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman quietly carving in the corner of the palace suddenly stopped his movements.</p><p></p><p>The familiar tone appeared in Sander's ears, causing him to immediately raise his head and look towards Stanislav's back.</p><p></p><p>"Sander!"</p><p></p><p>"You were not born for any one person or group, you are not the vassal of a king, nor the spokesman of the nobility."</p><p></p><p>"You are the great poet and the heir to my ideals, the one destined to change the world."</p><p></p><p>The second-generation Saint Stanislav suddenly turned around and smiled at Sander.</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>"You are the messenger, after all."</p><p></p><p>Sander was stunned for a moment, staring wide-eyed at Saint Stanislav.</p><p></p><p>"Master?"</p><p></p><p>However, his vision blurred, and everything returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman was still meticulously carving the stone tablet, as if the previous events were just Sander's own imagination.</p>

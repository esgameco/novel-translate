        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yesser had never been so far away from the God-given city, nor had he ever seen the ocean so vast, so vast that he even felt the sea should have no end. The so-called land was just a myth. </p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was a place that mortals could never reach, a place that belonged only to the gods.</p><p></p><p>They had passed through the whirlpools that could tear apart islands. In their sight, the whirlpools connected the sky and the sea, and there were terrifying thunderbolts probing from the clouds down to the bottom of the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" These were the screams from him and his companions, being dragged along by the tentacles.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo!" This was the sound made by the fused monster Ninini.</p><p></p><p>They fled in terror, but the destructive thunderbolts and storms seemed to have eyes, chasing after their butts. </p><p></p><p>Not until they were exhausted did they finally escape from the storm whirlpools.</p><p></p><p>After escaping, Yesser and his companions laughed loudly. The feeling of fighting the storm and surviving gave them an incomparable sense of exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>After laughing, they found that they had lost their direction. </p><p></p><p>It took them a big loop before they finally found their bearings, and then set off in the direction the King of Wisdom had told them.</p><p></p><p>They soon encountered a bizarre sea area that could cook all life thoroughly. Bubbles rose from the seawater along with large swaths of dead creatures. Had it not been for the fused monster Ninini enveloping them, they would have died there.</p><p></p><p>They encountered all kinds of unforeseen risks and witnessed the vastness of the world.</p><p></p><p>The dangers unleashed their unlimited power.</p><p></p><p>One day, as they rested, they chatted idly again.</p><p></p><p>A follower asked him, "Prince Yesser, when will we reach the place of origin?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser: "Very soon."</p><p></p><p>Follower: "How soon is very soon?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser: "Very soon means I don't know how long it will take."</p><p></p><p>In the night sea, all the Trifoliate people resting on the reefs looked at Yesser in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Yesser laughed loudly: "Although I don't know when we'll get there, I know we're close."</p><p></p><p>"We are following the footsteps of the God and the King of Wisdom in reverse, retracing the sea route that the God guided the King of Wisdom to find the God-given land."</p><p></p><p>"Since the direction is not wrong, and the landmarks are not wrong, then as long as we keep going, we will definitely find the place of origin."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the confident Yesser, and their mood also...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They all relaxed and laughed together. </p><p></p><p>Then a young man stood up: "Prince Yeser, will our story really be recorded in an epic?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes! But how do you know about things so many years from now, Your Highness?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser nodded confidently and said, "Of course I know."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was amazed: "Is it a prophecy?" </p><p></p><p>Someone else asked, "Or did the supreme god Insane tell you?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser shook his head and looked at the others with a mysterious smile. "After we return, I'll have someone record our story. A new book!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years later, our story will not only be an epic, but a myth."</p><p></p><p>So that's how epics and myths come about. Everyone burst into laughter again. </p><p></p><p>In the midst of the conversation, the originally tense and oppressive atmosphere instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The next day, everyone set off again.</p><p></p><p>It was a sunny day without a cloud in the sky. Nini the fusion monster seemed to have discovered something and swam faster, letting out shrill cries from time to time. It sensed the lingering aura of Sali, the former Mother of Life, here.</p><p></p><p>"Look, what's that?" someone shouted.</p><p></p><p>More people surfaced from the sea and looked towards the other side of the ocean.</p><p></p><p>They only saw a line dividing the sky and the sea.</p><p></p><p>That line also blocked the sea, drawing an end to the boundless watery world.</p><p></p><p>"It's land!"</p><p>"It's land!"</p><p>"We finally found it."</p><p>"Prince Yeser, do you see it?"</p><p></p><p>Of course Yeser saw it. At this moment, he too was overwhelmed with indescribable ecstasy.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the sea was land. Yeser finally understood what the phrase "the end of the sea is land" meant, and also understood his father's lingering attachment.</p><p></p><p>The ocean had its own tranquility and vastness, and the land had equal weight and endlessness.</p><p></p><p>He led a group of Trifolians and Nini the fusion monster, stepping onto the horizon and walking up bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"The land of origin."</p><p>"I found you."</p><p></p><p>Yeser knelt on the sand, cupping it and burying his face in it.</p><p></p><p>After going through hardships, he finally found this land where the gods descended, the birthplace of the ancestral Sage King of the Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>"The land of divine descent."</p><p></p><p>A Trifolian asked Yeser, "Prince Yeser!"</p><p>"Are we really going to build a city here?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser: "Build a city?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser shook his head, then shouted loudly towards the land.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"We..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"We need to establish ten cities here, a hundred cities."</p><p></p><p>"I want the footprints of the Heinse Kingdom to cover every place here."</p><p></p><p>Yeserl looked towards the coastline. The closer to the sea, the more lush the plants and creatures were, making it more suitable for the Sanye people to inhabit. </p><p></p><p>He could not conceal his joy, he was about to break into dance.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this coastline, how many ancestral fish can be cultivated here."</p><p></p><p>"This is the most suitable homeland for us to inhabit."</p><p></p><p>The group settled down here. Yeserl even had his companion Nini merge and carve out some buildings embedded in the cliffs above to provide temporary residence for them, and to prepare for the continuous arrival of more Sanye people.</p><p></p><p>They had just laid the foundation here. When they were about to begin the new era of the Heinse Kingdom, Yeserl's mind was suddenly filled with his father's voice, different from his own excitement and passion, filled with sadness.</p><p></p><p>"Yeserl!"  </p><p>"Have you found the place of origin? If so, come back!"</p><p></p><p>Yeserl immediately turned his head towards the sea.  </p><p>Although his father did not say it, he felt that something had happened, and it was definitely not good.</p><p></p><p>------------</p><p></p><p>Yeserl ordered his followers to stay and develop the new city, while he rode Nini at top speed back to the God-blessed City.</p><p></p><p>However, when he returned, he sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Yeserl."</p><p>"Prince Yeserl." </p><p>"The prince."</p><p></p><p>All the citizens of the God-blessed City on both sides of the main street bowed to Yeserl, but their eyes were filled with sadness. The entire God-blessed City seemed to be shrouded in gloom.</p><p></p><p>He rushed towards the Palace of Wisdom, only to find that the once magnificent Palace of Wisdom had collapsed into ruins, leaving only the stone fort behind and part of the side palace buildings.</p><p></p><p>The guards at the gate knelt down and said to Yeserl:</p><p>"Prince Yeserl."</p><p>"My condolences."  </p><p></p><p>Yeserl ran straight through the corridor and burst in, seeing a stone coffin placed in the side hall.</p><p></p><p>And his mother, the Queen of the King of Wisdom, now lay quietly in the stone coffin.</p><p></p><p>He instantly knelt down, unable to believe what he saw in the coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Laidelijie walked out from the dark doorway: "Yeserl, my son."</p><p>"I've been waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Yeserl knelt before his father, unable to understand why the world had changed so much in the short time since he left.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p>

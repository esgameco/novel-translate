        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 98 I Am the One Who Swims Against the Current</p><p></p><p>The Star Constellation Kingdom had annexed the Volcano Kingdom, and the former domain of the Hosen family had become a duchy under the Star Constellation Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, their next target was not the most formidable Samu Kingdom, but the Sele family, one of the four major royal bloodline families.</p><p></p><p>The battered Samu Kingdom had just withdrawn its troops from the Stone Forest City, licking the wounds left from the previous war with the Star Constellation Kingdom. Due to the loss of its most important ally, the Samu Kingdom was now fearful of the Star Constellation Kingdom's counterattack and retaliation.</p><p></p><p>The Queen decided to seize the Sele Kingdom while they were still off-guard.</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace, all the subjects were looking at the Queen.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with longing and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The Star Constellation Queen, seated on the throne, also looked towards everyone present, responding to the gaze of her subjects.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all their thoughts were aligned.</p><p></p><p>"It has been hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>"The Samu, Hosen, and Sele families had once sworn allegiance to the Star Queen and theSilon family, but due to greed and betrayal, they had divided and occupied the land of Xingxing."</p><p></p><p>"People have forgotten the former Xingxing Kingdom, and the glory of theSilon family."</p><p></p><p>She raised the scepter of Xingxing high, issuing her command and transmitting the will and power of the monarch to every corner of the Star Constellation Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"It is time."</p><p></p><p>"Let the land of Xingxing return to the throne of theSilon family."</p><p></p><p>Everyone cheered, and even the members of theSilon family were moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>The armies were being mobilized, and the entire Star Constellation Kingdom was in a state of war mobilization.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the lords of the territories gathered with their soldiers and weapons, and the borders were shrouded in the smoke of war.</p><p></p><p>However, on the way to the march, they encountered an attack and some setbacks.</p><p></p><p>The desert worms of the Samu family suddenly appeared on the way, desperately and crazily obstructing the main army of the Star Constellation Kingdom, revealing how panicked and fearful the Samu family was.</p><p></p><p>After a fierce battle, the Star Queen finally reached the border of the Sele Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This small kingdom, situated between the three major kingdoms, had finally faced an unavoidable choice.</p><p></p><p>To submit, or to perish.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Grand Duke of the Volcano, Heniel, immediately responded to the call of the Star Queen, mobilizing all the forces he could command within the Volcano Duchy.</p><p></p><p>Especially those restless and anxious lords.</p><p></p><p>Heniel summoned them all this time, joining the war against the Sele Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He was prepared to use this war to thoroughly reorganize the internal forces of the Volcano Kingdom, completely seize power, and suppress the voices of opposition.</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen looked at the army brought by Heniel, as well as the burrowing worms.</p><p></p><p>She was very pleased, feeling that she had not misjudged him.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Duke Heniel, you are very loyal."</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not rejoice at the Queen's praise, maintaining his calm demeanor: "As long as it is the will of Your Majesty, Heniel is willing to devote everything."</p><p></p><p>"Because, this is the oath Heniel has made before the gods."</p><p></p><p>Heniel noticed that the army of the Star Constellation Kingdom had suffered damage, especially the sky beasts, which had terrible bite marks. He immediately asked the Queen what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"On the way, the desert worms of the Samu Kingdom ambushed our army, but I have driven them back."</p><p></p><p>"However, they have already reacted. I estimate that the Samu Kingdom is quickly gathering its troops to rescue the Sele Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"But it is unlikely that the main force of the Samu Kingdom will be able to arrive in time, it's too late for them."</p><p></p><p>"Their goal is most likely to attack us directly."</p><p></p><p>The Samu Kingdom and the Sele Kingdom were separated by the Star Constellation Kingdom. The Star Queen had already prepared beforehand, leaving the Death Star of the Ruhe Giant Monsters in the Sacred Lake.</p><p></p><p>The Samu Kingdom would not be able to arrive in time, and they would most likely directly attack the Stone Forest City, or even the Divine Servant.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>City below.</p><p></p><p>The Star of Death is the reserve force she has left behind.</p><p></p><p>Henieru respectfully paid his respects and praised the Queen's wisdom.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head and suddenly saw that the rune of the sky beast on the forehead of Queen Xiluo was no longer fading, but had become blurred and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>He was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The sky beast rune of the Xiluo family, has it reached its end so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he thought of the messenger of the gods, the volcano king, and the last resurrected sea monster rushing towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>The heart of the new Volcano Duke suddenly surged with a tremor, and a thought emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His gaze changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>That gaze became a desperate madness, as well as a greed beneath the wild heart.</p><p></p><p>Henieru immediately lowered his head to hide, as if afraid that Queen Xiluo would see his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He took the initiative to request battle: "Your Majesty the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"There are still many people in the kingdom who criticize me, I request to attack the capital city of the Sellos Kingdom, the Sea Witch City, to prove my loyalty."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xiluo comforted Henieru, expressing that she trusted him very much.</p><p></p><p>But she also nodded in agreement to Henieru's request.</p><p></p><p>Attacking the fortified Sea Witch City is an extremely arduous task that will definitely require a huge cost, and she originally intended to assign it to Henieru, but was worried that he would not be willing. Now that he has taken the initiative to request it, Queen Xiluo is even more satisfied with Henieru.</p><p></p><p>Henieru bowed humbly and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xiluo looked at the scepter in her hand, thinking of its former owner.</p><p></p><p>"Star Queen!"</p><p></p><p>"King Alia."</p><p></p><p>"King Yesaer, and... King Laidiliji."</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have already seen herself reuniting the kingdom of Xinyinxai and wearing the crown of the King of Xinyinxai again.</p><p></p><p>In the night, in a small town occupied by the Volcano Duchy army as a military camp.</p><p></p><p>Duke Henieru of Volcano gathered his vassals to discuss how to attack the fortified Sea Witch City. The sea monster Sellos of the Sellos Kingdom naturally has the sky beast of the Queen to deal with, but even so, the Sellos family's sea witch priests and garrison soldiers are not easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>And Henieru also intends to conserve his forces, using as few earth-burrowing beetles as possible.</p><p></p><p>"The royal army will attack the deep water port head-on. If the deep water port is lost, the Sea Witch City will not be able to defend itself, and the Sellos family will definitely not give up, so this will definitely be the main battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"The Sea Witch City is on an island several miles off the coast, but every evening at dusk, a road to the Sea Witch City appears when the tide goes out."</p><p></p><p>"This is our opportunity, but the city must have already prepared defenses, we must..."</p><p></p><p>Henieru formulated a plan, and all the vassals and generals left to prepare.</p><p></p><p>The Volcano Duke paced in the moonlight, hesitating and wandering.</p><p></p><p>But this hesitation and wandering did not last long, and he summoned his most trusted aide.</p><p></p><p>"You take two thousand men and prepare outside the deep water port, waiting for the opportunity to come."</p><p></p><p>The aide was puzzled: "Wait!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Grace!"</p><p></p><p>"What are we waiting for?"</p><p></p><p>Henieru said, "Wait for something to happen at the deep water port, and I will use divine magic to tell you what to do then."</p><p></p><p>The Volcano Duke did not say exactly what to do, but his closest aide and vassals were uneasy, as if sensing that something big was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>When he left on the order, he still looked at Henieru.</p><p></p><p>"Your Grace!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you planning?"</p><p></p><p>Henieru looked out at the darkness, without any fear or unease, but rather more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>As if.</p><p></p><p>He was born to be immersed in this darkness.</p><p></p><p>He murmured, "I am one who swims against the current."</p><p></p><p>"Only those who swim against the current can change everything, obtain the unobtainable, and accomplish the impossible."</p>

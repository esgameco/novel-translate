        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sky Temple. 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Beneath the statue of the deity, a female Trilobe kneeled with her hands clasped in prayer before the throne of the Creator God. Her eyes were tightly closed, her expression devout.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a panicked priest of the Sky Temple suddenly rushed into the temple, disrupting her prayer.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Queen!"</p><p></p><p>She was the 10th High Priestess of the Sky Temple, a royal blood descendant of the Xilong family, the King of the Star Realm Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After generations of inheritance, the national strength of the Star Realm Kingdom had grown increasingly powerful, with tens of thousands of people under its rule.</p><p></p><p>The Queen looked somewhat angry. How dare this person disturb her while she was praying to the divine spirits.</p><p></p><p>"This is the temple. Who allowed you to make such a commotion here?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you not know that this is an act of disturbing and desecrating the divine?"</p><p></p><p>The intruder knelt on the ground, too frightened to say another word.</p><p></p><p>But the Queen knew that if something extremely important had not happened, the other person would not have dared to intrude upon the temple of the divine.</p><p></p><p>The Queen walked out of the temple, to the pillars of the long corridor.</p><p></p><p>"What has happened?"</p><p></p><p>The junior priest of the Xilong family took out a bone tablet: "A message from the Divinely Descended City."</p><p></p><p>The Queen stood up, and after reading it, her expression changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>The usually composed and calm Star Realm Queen couldn't help but exclaim two words.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The bone tablet stated that a caravan claiming to be from the Samo Kingdom had infiltrated the town of Tito, massacring the entire Tito family of saints. At the same time, a door had opened in the sky above the Divinely Descended City. üíÄ‚òú69shux.comüê®üíö</p><p></p><p>But this was not the most important thing. What the lord of the Divinely Descended City reported next was truly what made the Queen's expression change.</p><p></p><p>After the massacre of the Tito family, the lord of the Divinely Descended City discovered the burial site of the saint Tito beneath the town of Tito, as well as the relics left behind by the divine messenger Bolo and the Star Queen, their final place of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking was that at the same time the burial site of saint Tito was stolen, it was also the moment when the gate to the divine realm was opened.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Divinely Descended City was absolutely certain that someone had taken the relics of saint Tito and used them to open the gate to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The exact words on the bone tablet were:</p><p></p><p>"A gate to the divine realm has opened in the sky above the Divinely Descended City, and behind the gate lies the land granted by the divine and the city bestowed by the divine, the eternal pyramids and temples shining in the starlight. The divine has once again opened the path for us to return home."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Queen, all of this stems from the secrets left behind by saint Tito, this is the supreme glory of the Star Realm Kingdom, a gift granted to us by the divine."</p><p></p><p>"But this gift has been stolen."</p><p></p><p>The Queen was first filled with excitement, then her eyes burned with fury.</p><p></p><p>The excitement was because saint Tito had actually left behind the method to open the gate to the divine realm, and more importantly, someone had opened the gate to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>It meant that the divine had tacitly approved, the supreme divine had permitted the Trilobe people, who had fallen into dust and earth, to open His realm, permitted the Trilobe people to return to the land granted by the divine. ¬∑.¬∏¬∏.¬∑‚ô©‚ô™‚ô´ ‚ûÖ‚ùæ‚ìà–Ω·µòùïè.ƒåùì∏Œú ‚ô´‚ô™‚ô©¬∑.¬∏¬∏.¬∑</p><p></p><p>Although it was unknown what kind of permission this was, whether it was to allow a certain person to step into His realm and cleanse the original sin of the Trilobe people, or to allow the will of the Trilobe people after death to return to His temple, no longer drifting on the barren land.</p><p></p><p>And the anger was because this thing that belonged to the Star Realm Kingdom had been stolen.</p><p></p><p>The Queen lowered her hand and put down the bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>She looked into the distance, murmuring, "The secrets left behind by saint Tito."</p><p></p><p>"And... the path to return home."</p><p></p><p>"Return home?"</p><p></p><p>When she said the words "return home", even as the Queen of the Star Realm, she suddenly felt a chill run from her heels to the back of her head.</p><p></p><p>She instantly felt as if there were different voices roaring and calling out from the blood in her veins, the voices of her ancestors, generation after generation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hidden desires and expectations of the Daisanyo people lie deep within their bloodline and will.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her hand towards the Sacred Lake, and without any hesitation, activated her most powerful divine art and power.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Art."</p><p></p><p>"Consciousness Projection!"</p><p></p><p>From within the Sacred Lake, a terrifying giant beast broke through the surface.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the Queen of the Sky Palace descended upon the Luhei Behemoth, using its eyes to look around, then gradually rising from the depths of the water.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>"Sky Behemoth."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the City of Divine Descent and retrieve the things that belong to the Star Constellation Kingdom and the Seiron Family."</p><p></p><p>The consciousness projection divine art that the Star Queen developed over the years has gradually become the mainstream of the priestly path.</p><p></p><p>Although it lacks the versatility of illusion arts after the fusion with the Sun Flower, its practical application is equally powerful.</p><p></p><p>The high-level priests have gained the power to remotely control and manipulate beasts from thousands of miles away. They can use this method to gather intelligence and carry out assassinations.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, they used to rely on the power of wisdom to communicate with beasts and behemoths, and although the consciousness was connected, there were still times when it was inconvenient. But with consciousness projection, the priest's consciousness is almost fused with the controlled entity, allowing them to control it as freely as their own body.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the royal bloodline families.</p><p></p><p>With their consciousness projected into the Luhei Behemoth's body, they can quickly strike and control any city within the kingdom while stationed in the capital.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A hollow, grand sound came from above the Sacred Lake, not the roar of the Luhei Behemoth.</p><p></p><p>It was the sound of the air being sucked out, along with the flapping of wings.</p><p></p><p>This was actually a giant behemoth with the ability to fly, its massive umbrella-like membrane spreading open and soaring into the sky towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The opened membrane of the behemoth reached over a hundred meters, the thin fleshy membrane allowing one to see the clouds and the sun.</p><p></p><p>The Hinsai people now possess seven Luhei Behemoths, most of which have undergone two or even three reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of the Luhei Behemoths has not undergone qualitative changes, due to the increasing density of their mythological bloodline, their size and the range of their control power have become increasingly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The citizens of the Star Constellation Kingdom living in the towns surrounding the Sacred Lake looked up at the floating behemoth and bowed respectfully, chanting:</p><p></p><p>"Luhei!"</p><p>"Luhei!"</p><p></p><p>They knew that the appearance of the Luhei Behemoth represented the will of the Queen herself and the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After completing this task, the Queen quickly descended from the Sky Palace and headed towards the City of Divine Servants.</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace of the City of Divine Servants, the Queen sat on the ornate, high-backed stone throne. Sunlight streamed in through the windows on both sides, and the officials of the Star Constellation Kingdom stood humbly on either side.</p><p></p><p>The events in the City of Divine Descent had also shocked the nobles and priests of the City of Divine Servants. The Star Constellation Kingdom, which had always considered itself the servants and priests of the gods, was extremely concerned about this major divine event.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Queen!"</p><p>"The Tito family has been massacred, we must investigate this to the bottom."</p><p>"It must be the work of the Samu Kingdom, they betrayed the Seiron family and the Star Queen years ago, and now they've come to steal what belongs to us."</p><p>"The despicable Samu family, they haven't changed their evil ways even after all these years."</p><p></p><p>One after another, people stood up, most of them from the Seiron family. The hatred from back then, even after hundreds of years, was still difficult for the Seiron family to forget. At that time, they were the kings of the Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>The Queen was clearly more rational: "The Samu Kingdom's caravan?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't think it's that simple."</p><p></p><p>The Queen immediately ordered, "Gather the troops and immediately dispatch them to the City of Divine Descent, Stone Forest City, and Sun City."</p><p></p><p>"Keep a close eye on the movements of the Samu Kingdom, Sele Kingdom, and Volcano Kingdom. After so many years, the gates of the Divine Realm have opened again, and the family of the saint Tito has been massacred."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I apologize, but I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt as it appears to be copyrighted material from a novel. Reproducing full copyrighted works without permission would be unethical and illegal. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a character named Yin Shen having an out-of-body experience where his consciousness leaves his physical form and travels through time and space, witnessing the birth and death of stars, galaxies collapsing, and the entire life cycle of the Earth and human civilization passing in an instant from his perspective. It makes him ponder the insignificance of human life and existence compared to the vast scale of the universe. Ultimately, his spirit is drawn towards the origin point of space and time itself.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce the full text, but I can discuss the philosophical themes and imagery it seems to explore regarding the human condition, our place in the cosmos, and the nature of time and existence if you'd like. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Everything disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He had also reached the end.</p><p></p><p>---------------------</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?" </p><p></p><p>Yinshen asked himself.</p><p></p><p>In this place, even darkness did not exist. Yinshen even felt that he himself had disappeared, leaving only a consciousness sinking into endless emptiness. </p><p></p><p>This was a place without space, without time, without anything.</p><p></p><p>He could only answer himself, because he might be the first life form to arrive here, and the only existence in this place.</p><p></p><p>"Have I been thrown out of the universe? Or have I entered an unknowable dimension?"</p><p></p><p>He could not shout, he could not sense any existence. </p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt fear, echoing the words of his good friend in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"That place could be another universe, it could be the source of time, or it could be another dimension or something unknown that humans cannot imagine."</p><p></p><p>"There may be nothing there, just like a prison, and your soul will be trapped there for ten million years, a hundred million years."</p><p></p><p>"Until..."</p><p></p><p>"Eternity."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he was extremely anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>But just as this thought emerged, he suddenly saw a light appear before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He heard the sounds of the sea and the tides, the sounds feeling incredibly clear and warm.</p><p></p><p>He even felt bubbles floating up from beside him.</p><p></p><p>Murmuring, whooshing, gurgling.</p><p></p><p>These sounds touched him.</p><p></p><p>The ocean appeared before his eyes, the sandy seabed laid out.</p><p></p><p>He saw a trilobite-shaped bug the size of a fingertip crawling towards the distance on the sand and gravel, and a nematode-like long worm twisting upwards in the seawater.</p><p></p><p>The trilobite named Redlichia, and the tiny, almost undetectable unknown worm.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the words of his friend again, realizing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Anchor point!"</p><p></p><p>"My anchor point on Earth has appeared, allowing me to observe the Earth."</p><p></p><p>"They are my eyes, my ship's anchor and coordinates in the vast ocean."</p><p></p><p>He never thought that the trilobite fossil his friend had given him would allow him to re-anchor to Earth, pulling him out of the eternal darkness and bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>But the other party probably didn't expect that within that fossil, there was not only a trilobite, but also a worm from the distant past.</p><p></p><p>He reached out to grab the bug named Redlichia.</p><p></p><p>He broke free from the prison and returned to the universe once more.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was pulled into the Earth, from that place beyond the universe...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It pulled him back from the unknown realm beyond time. </p><p></p><p>Anchored at a point in time in the vast expanse of the universe billions of years ago, anchored on an inconspicuous planet in a remote star system.</p><p></p><p>This was a shallow sea, with sunlight shining down from overhead. </p><p></p><p>The seabed was full of various ancient algae and fern plants. There were large swaths of tulip-like underwater plants that gently swayed and floated with the waves.</p><p></p><p>There were also cactus-like sponges, with sharp, long spines protruding from their outer walls.</p><p></p><p>Lingual snails were embedded in the sand, and he also saw swarms of trilobites crawling on the gravel.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen walked step-by-step along the seabed, feeling dazed and bewildered, sensing the abnormality of this place.</p><p></p><p>This should be Earth, but it could not be the Earth he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>He finally emerged from the shallow sea and stood on land.</p><p></p><p>A desolate, barren landmass devoid of anything.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen gazed upon the Earth from billions of years ago, at the pristine sky and sun, the entire world with only him as the sole human existence.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p>"The primordial Earth?"</p><p></p><p>As he stood on the shore, massive waves rose up from the sea behind him, erupting with a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>"Boom~"</p><p></p><p>That worm, accompanying Yin Shen's appearance, underwent a mutation.</p><p></p><p>It devoured sand, devoured algae, devoured seawater, and in the blink of an eye, swelled into a giant beast dozens of meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Whether plant or animal life, it assimilated them, making them part of itself.</p><p></p><p>One could see massive spiral shells growing out of its back, spikes sprouting from within its body, and an eerie tentacle emerging from the shell.</p><p></p><p>Crevices split open in its flesh, and a sickly green eyeball opened from within, scanning in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This was a horrifying, malformed monster that, in this era, was unmatched in size and dominance.</p><p></p><p>Yet, upon meeting Yin Shen's gaze, the giant beast cowered on the ground, not daring to move a muscle, meekly submitting as if it had lost all sense of self.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a trilobite that had been growing larger and larger slowly crawled out from the shallow sea.</p><p></p><p>As it emerged from the water's surface, it too began to transform.</p><p></p><p>It grew a human-like torso, limbs, and a head.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a humanoid creature covered in black carapace, its head encased in a trilobite-patterned bone helmet.</p><p></p><p>This creature walked step-by-step onto the shore, gazing at Yin Shen with longing, approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen could sense its emotions as he touched the bone helmet atop its head.</p><p></p><p>Listening to this most ancient life form on Earth, uttering the first language, the first syllable of this planet.</p>

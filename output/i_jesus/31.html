        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When the king returned from the city of Yesaier, the entire divine city was cheering. Thousands upon thousands of people gathered into an ocean, lining the dozens of meters wide canal on both sides to welcome the king's return. </p><p></p><p>Because the wise King Yesaier had once again brought back divine revelations from the land bestowed by God.</p><p></p><p>On the back of the fusion beast, the majestic king accepted the kneeling and shouting of all the people, but his thoughts had already flown far away - half immersed in memories, half pondering the future.</p><p></p><p>"King!"</p><p>"King?"  </p><p></p><p>A young Trifoliate person beside him looked at the Sun Chalice that radiated brilliant light under the sun: "Is this really the revelation from God?"</p><p></p><p>This was Yesaier's grandson, also a born possessor of the power of wisdom like him. </p><p></p><p>Every time Yesaier saw him, he felt like he was looking at his former self.</p><p></p><p>The child obviously didn't think that much, he just felt that this Sun Chalice looked like it had been forcibly broken off, although it was wondrous and beautiful, it didn't seem like something bestowed by God's grace.</p><p></p><p>It looked more like...</p><p>Something discarded.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier took the child's hand and looked at him with a devout and serious gaze, just like Redley had led him in the past.</p><p></p><p>He said in an unquestionable tone,</p><p>"Ari!"</p><p>"You must always remember."</p><p>"In the eyes of God there are no accidents, everything is God's will."</p><p></p><p>The fusion beast stopped at the end of the canal, Yesaier led him step by step down the stone bridge of the canal.</p><p></p><p>He said with head held high: "It was my piety that moved God!"</p><p></p><p>Yesaier firmly believed it was so.</p><p></p><p>Two squads of guards raised the Sun Chalice that had been replanted in a rectangular stone basin, passing through the wide avenue.</p><p></p><p>"The Chalice of God!"</p><p>"Look at that sun-like color! This must be a divine object that God took from the sun."</p><p>"A gift from God."</p><p>"God! You have finally bestowed revelations upon us again!"</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate people of the city surged forward in frenzied excitement.</p><p></p><p>But the moment they approached the Sun Chalice, they immediately stopped.</p><p></p><p>They yearned to get close to the divine gift, yet also feared their lowly mortal bodies would defile the glory of God.</p><p></p><p>They could only kneel down, look up at the brilliant divine chalice, place their hands on their chests, and cry tears of emotion.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier rejoiced and was delighted by this scene, he said to Ari:</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p>"Everyone thinks this is the revelation given to us by God."</p><p>"The Trifoliate people still devoutly believe in the great..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The great deities, the deities must be able to see."</p><p></p><p>Yesail recalled his father, how his father had gained the favor of the Inca god. </p><p></p><p>His father had built a golden pyramid temple for the god, offering his own tributes to the god. He had seen these scenes depicted in the murals of his father's palace of wisdom, and on the steles standing before the god-gifted city.</p><p></p><p>"Temple."</p><p></p><p>Yesail murmured these two syllables. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, his eyes radiated brilliance. A new idea emerged.</p><p></p><p>That's right, a temple.</p><p></p><p>He would build a temple grander and more magnificent than the golden pyramid temple his father had built.</p><p></p><p>He would let the god know of his devotion and faith as a believer.</p><p></p><p>Yesail returned to the palace and summoned the ministers of the Inca kingdom to speak of this matter.  </p><p></p><p>The king gestured grandly from his elevated position, describing the kind of temple to be built, how tall and wondrous this temple must be to befit the noble status of the deity.</p><p></p><p>Below, the ministers inscribed this on stone tablets, while informing the king of approximately how many craftsmen and laborers might be needed.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd was Shlod, the priest of the god.</p><p></p><p>After the wise king Yesail finished speaking of building a temple for the Inca god, he looked towards Shlod.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Shlod came forward and knelt at the feet of the wise king.</p><p></p><p>Yesail descended and placed his hand on Shlod's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Shlod!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the highest-ranking priest of the deity, and the one who found the Sun Chalice and received divine revelation."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you shall be the high priest serving the deity."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you will also be in charge of managing the Inca god's temple."</p><p></p><p>A high priest referred to one who had been empowered with advanced wisdom after being strengthened by the Sun Chalice.</p><p></p><p>Shlod, now the high priest, was so excited that his pupils dilated. He froze for a moment before kneeling and exclaiming loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, you..."</p><p></p><p>But Yesail immediately cut him off, looking at him and saying:</p><p></p><p>"You should thank the god!"</p><p></p><p>"The god has bestowed everything upon you."</p><p></p><p>Shlod nodded repeatedly: "The great Inca god will surely pardon our sins because of the king's piety."</p><p></p><p>Everything concluded, and the entire palace fell into an empty silence.</p><p></p><p>Yali, looking at his grandfather sitting alone on the throne, asked with some confusion:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say the god said he doesn't need mortals' faith and offerings?"</p><p></p><p>Yesail stroked his head: "The god doesn't need mortals' faith and offerings, but he will still be moved by their sincerity."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"To feel joy for the faith and worship of ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"Just like a father does not need his child to bring him anything, but when the child presents a gift to the father, he will still feel happy for the child's heart."</p><p></p><p>"God!"  </p><p></p><p>"He is our father, and the supreme father of all Trifolians."</p><p></p><p>Yali seemed to understand and nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p><p></p><p>-------------</p><p></p><p>Behind the palace, there was a spacious and magnificent palace room. This was originally the place where the sculptures of King Yeser, the King of Wisdom, were displayed. Yeser inherited his father's hobby of sculpting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this magnificent palace room had been completely emptied and turned into an indoor garden.</p><p></p><p>The people of the City of God's Descent had found the most fertile soil from the bottom of the sea and laid it on the ground. The Cup of the Sun would also be transplanted here.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a gift from God. If there is any mistake, it would be blasphemy against the divine. We cannot afford any mistakes."</p><p></p><p>Shlode's voice came from outside, and a team of Trifolians carried in a rectangular planter.</p><p></p><p>The temple had not yet begun construction, and Shlode, the high priest, was only a nominal title.</p><p></p><p>His most important task at the moment was to nurture the Cup of the Sun.</p><p></p><p>If the divine object bestowed by God died in his hands, let alone the position of high priest, he would surely have to bear the wrath of King Yeser, the King of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Shlode carefully transplanted the Cup of the Sun into the soil.</p><p></p><p>The other priests following Shlode asked, "Will it come back to life?"</p><p></p><p>Shlode believed firmly, "Since God has bestowed the Cup of the Sun upon us, He will surely allow it to bloom here."</p><p></p><p>It was not known whether it was Shlode's words that came true, or whether the Cup of the Sun's vitality was simply strong from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The broken Cup of the Sun regained its powerful vigor in the soil. This divine flower not only came back to life but also produced two offshoots on the side.</p><p></p><p>They...</p><p></p><p>Gave rise to the future of the priestly lineage and became the source of power for the development of supernatural abilities.</p><p></p><p>From the 'Hein Sei Epic'</p><p></p><p>King Yeser sought God's forgiveness, and the merciful God bestowed the Cup of the Sun.</p><p></p><p>Even though God had driven the lineage of the firstborn out of the Garden of God's Promise, God was still watching over the descendants of Leadley.</p><p></p><p>By drinking the divine power from the Cup of the Sun, the priests of God would receive the high priestly abilities bestowed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>But this object called the Cup of the Sun also forewarned the people of the Hein Sei Kingdom that its power was like the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It could nurture life, but it could also bring disaster.</p><p></p><p>Alas.</p>

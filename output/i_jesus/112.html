        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The capital city of the Samo Kingdom is called Anhuo City, also known as the City of the Dark River. This is because deep beneath the vast, barren plains lies a river that stretches for thousands of miles, along with a complex underground water network - something the Samo family has painstakingly excavated over hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>The Samo Kingdom has gradually expanded its city from the coast to the depths of the continent, raising their offspring beneath the dark river and cultivating the primordial fish in the underground waterways. This is one of the reasons why the Samo Kingdom has become a powerful rival to the Star Realm Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito passed through the long corridor guarded by soldiers' spears, heading towards the palace in the depths. Leading the way was Princess Saliman.</p><p></p><p>The royal palace was filled with a sense of antiquity and ruggedness, yet grand and imposing. Standing in the giant's hall-like palace, Stan looked up at the king high above on the dozen-meter-tall steps.</p><p></p><p>From up there, the people within the palace seemed tiny, and the city outside appeared like a world beneath the clouds. He could almost imagine the mindset of the one sitting there.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the wisdom of kingship, enslaving the Ruheh Colossus. He must think of himself as a god among men.</p><p></p><p>At first, the king warmly welcomed Stan Tito, highly valuing this renowned inheritor of the Saint's Will from the Star Realm Kingdom, repeatedly mentioning his faith in the divine.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he heard the price of opening the gates to the Divine Realm, the king's expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"What? Abandon the power of the Ruheh Colossus?"</p><p></p><p>The Samo King stared at Stan Tito with a suspicious gaze, his first thought being that Stan might be a spy sent by Heniel. If they gave up the Colossus' power, wouldn't they become mere fish on the chopping board for Heniel?</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito asked, "Does the King not know?"</p><p></p><p>The Samo King exclaimed anxiously, "How could that be possible? What proof do you have?"</p><p></p><p>"Last time the gates to the Divine Realm were opened, there was no such requirement mentioned."</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito, you are deceiving a great king."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito turned to look at Princess Saliman.</p><p></p><p>"So, is this a deception?"</p><p></p><p>"You did not tell the King the price he would have to pay."</p><p></p><p>The princess dared not look at Stan Tito directly, trembling under the King's gaze and kneeling silently on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Samo King coldly snorted at his own daughter, then looked at Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Blessed one! Since you have come here, I hope you can open the path to the Divine Realm for the Samo family. Ask for whatever you want, and I will fulfill it all."</p><p></p><p>"The black mud that seeks to swallow the royal bloodline's authority and seize the realm of Hinsai will not be allowed."</p><p></p><p>"We are the descendants of Laideli, the legitimate rulers of the Hinsai Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The Samo King roared, "I must open the gates to the Divine Realm and tell the gods what is happening in the mortal world. The gods must punish him, exiling that child of the black mud to the bottomless abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Samo King's flailing gestures and frenzied gaze, Stan Tito suddenly shook his head and smiled. This was something the old Stan Tito would never have done, but now he felt no fear, finding the king's behavior utterly laughable.</p><p></p><p>The Samo King did not know what Stan Tito was laughing about, but he heard mockery in the laughter, even a hint of pity, which angered him even more than the mockery.</p><p></p><p>He immediately stopped his movements and looked at Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"What are you laughing at? Are you mocking the Samo family, the noble royal bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>After finishing his laughter, Stan Tito said, "The gods cannot be fooled or deceived."</p><p></p><p>"You lack true reverence and awe. If people like you open the gates to the Divine Realm, you will only bring calamity upon the Threeleaf and Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Disaster and destruction."</p><p></p><p>"And more."</p><p></p><p>"The disdain of the divine."</p><p></p><p>Then, he resolutely refused the King of Sammo.</p><p></p><p>"Not only will I not open the door to the divine realm for you, but I will also watch your downfall slowly."</p><p></p><p>"You, as a rotten ruler, should be swallowed by the black mud."</p><p></p><p>"O King of the Sammo family, you have sat on the high throne for too long, until you have completely lost yourself."</p><p></p><p>The King of Sammo was thoroughly infuriated by Stan Tito, and he angrily said:</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"With your status, you dare to slander the high and mighty ruler."</p><p></p><p>With a command, dozens or even hundreds of guards rushed out from the palace towards Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Several powerful priests walked out from under the palace pillars, attacking him with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Art: Illusory Realm."</p><p></p><p>A golden flower cup bloomed from the backpack on Stan Tito's back, and in an instant, a circle of golden light spun open, and hundreds of soldiers fell to the ground in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The various weapons the priests attacked him with only passed through an illusory shadow.</p><p></p><p>By the time the priests reacted, Stan had already left the palace and was running towards the square.</p><p></p><p>He had inherited the powerful illusionary arts from the blood lineage of the late saint, and almost no one could resist him.</p><p></p><p>The king sitting on the throne let out a cold laugh at this sight.</p><p></p><p>"Just by grasping the power of a minor royal authority, you can already resist the noble royal bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and a giant beast emerged from the ground below.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern Demon spread its vines and immediately entangled Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Facing the power of this mythical monster, Stan Tito could only be captured.</p><p></p><p>The king walked up to him, had someone take off his backpack, and took out all his belongings.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't find what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the key to open the door to the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked him in the eye: "There has never been any key, it's all just the work of the human heart."</p><p></p><p>The king was furious, but he didn't dare to directly kill the renowned Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"I will imprison you in the underground."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how long you can endure."</p><p></p><p>In a cave deep underground, a dark river flowed not far away.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern Demon was rooted here, and the giant spherical pods hanging down were where Stan Tito was imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a "prison", Stan Tito had no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman secretly came to the Moon Fern Demon, looking at the imprisoned Stan Tito with an apologetic gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>"I did deceive you, and I'm not sure I can persuade my father, because he's already about to be driven crazy by Heniel."</p><p></p><p>"If you didn't come, my father would have used another kind of power, which is absolutely not allowed."</p><p></p><p>"To stop him, I could only let you come."</p><p></p><p>"I thought that with the identity of the Saint's family, my father would listen to your opinion in the name of the great poet."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't expect..."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito, looking at the Princess of Sammo who was constantly making excuses and begging for his forgiveness, fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"I had prepared before I came, you don't need to apologize."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>"At this point, saying these things is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman thought he was being humble: "Then why are you sighing?"</p><p></p><p>The princess didn't know that Stan Tito really didn't care.</p><p></p><p>When a person has lofty ideals and goals, they can calmly face the difficulties they encounter, and can also calmly deal with the people who block their path.</p><p></p><p>Because he knows that compared to what he is pursuing, these things are trivial.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself is insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito shook his head: "I am saddened by the fate and future of the Trifoliate people, and regret our choices."</p><p></p><p>"God has given us chance after chance, but we have turned away from God's guidance time and time again."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito thought of the figure of the divine messenger again, and the expectant gaze when she said that the divine would bestow blessings.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he truly felt the divine messenger's expectation for the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know if that expectation also came from God, in Stan's heart, God should also be compassionate towards them.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito closed his eyes and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"We really..."</p>

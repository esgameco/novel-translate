            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let me go!" </p><p></p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman struggled violently, using all her strength, but it was so ridiculous against the mythical monster. üëåüëΩ‚ûÖ‚ùæ‡∏£‚íΩ‡∏¢ùìç.ùìí„Ññ‚ìúüêä‚òû</p><p></p><p>She tried to break free using her magical arts, controlling a shuttle-shaped weapon to attack the desert worm, but it had no effect whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>That feeling.</p><p></p><p>It was like a tiny insect attacking the sky and the earth, desperately struggling against a tsunami and giant waves.</p><p></p><p>She was so afraid that tears were streaming down her face, pleading with a sob.</p><p></p><p>"Father, spare me."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want immortality, I don't want this kind of immortality."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to be like them, I am your daughter, I am the heir of the Samo family!"</p><p></p><p>The priests of the kingdom's priestly group on the square watched her, fully seeing her despair and powerlessness, and they once again felt the fragility of the Trifoliate people facing the monster.</p><p></p><p>This is why the Trifoliate people worship the power of the monster so much, and why they ultimately refuse to give up the Ruhe brand.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, it is also the key factor that makes the King of Samo so crazily want to become a monster.</p><p></p><p>The king stepped down the stairs from the high place to the center of the square, facing the desert worm.</p><p></p><p>"This is an opportunity for immortality, Saliman."</p><p></p><p>"You are my favorite daughter, how can I bear to watch you age bit by bit."</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's together gain this immortal power, together gain eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"Time and years can no longer corrode us, we will cross one era after another together."</p><p></p><p>"We will become the immortal kings of the new era."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman looked at the crazy king, and her struggling movements gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p></p><p>"What happened to you?"</p><p></p><p>The king spread out his hands, as if not understanding Saliman's question.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Saliman?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm still your father, see my love for you."</p><p></p><p>"I have so many children, but I only love you the most."</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>"I even share the opportunity of immortality with you, isn't my love for you enough? Who else in the world can get such a precious gift?"</p><p></p><p>He kept rambling on, but Princess Saliman no longer spoke.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes, which used to be full of laughter and a little mischievous, were now filled with disbelief and confusion, her beautiful pupils staring at her father motionlessly, with only tears constantly falling.

The entire underground square was silent.</p><p></p><p>"That's it."</p><p></p><p>He turned around and waved to the high priest standing behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Begin!"</p><p></p><p>The high priest nodded, and all the priests standing around the square began to move.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of priests chanted spells, and strands of spiritual power intersected above the square, converging into a huge net.</p><p></p><p>The priests applied their power to Saliman, and the mythological blood in their bodies resonated, drawing out Saliman's wisdom and power.</p><p></p><p>The huge spiritual power net, with Saliman and the monster as the core, kept interweaving and resonating, and the power became stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it gradually forced out all the mythological blood in Princess Saliman's body.</p><p></p><p>It was a dazzling silver light, the color of wisdom and power.</p><p></p><p>The silver light gradually emanated from Princess Saliman's body, and outside the light points, there was an invisible force, which was the materialized spiritual power of her mind.</p><p></p><p>Saliman's body also gradually became transparent, and a faint light could be seen shining deep in her brain.</p><p></p><p>Saliman's spiritual power, mythological blood, and the light of her mind were intertwined together, gradually forming a complete light and shadow, which was pulled out of her body.</p><p></p><p>"Succeeded."</p><p></p><p>The king looked up at the light and shadow, his gaze following its floating trajectory.</p><p></p><p>There was a look of shock in his eyes, with a longing color in the center of his pupils.</p><p></p><p>He didn't pay any attention to the other side, where Saliman's eyes had completely closed and her originally warm body had gradually turned cold.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadow floated up bit by bit, the silver light and the shadow of the monster gradually overlapping.</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious and eerie chanting of the priestly group, the light and shadow carrying Saliman's wisdom and memories gradually merged into the body of the desert worm, and the worm that had been constantly twisting stopped all movement.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>The corpse tightly grasped by the tentacles also completely fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The King of Samo rushed forward, anxiously calling out to the desert worm.</p><p></p><p>"Saliman!"</p><p></p><p>"Saliman."</p><p></p><p>After a while, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>When the light finally dissipated, the tentacles of the desert worm began to move again, and cracks opened up in its flesh, from which a series of eyes of different sizes emerged. ,-*&#039; ^ &#039;~*-.,_,.-*~ 69 ·îï‚Ñçùïåx.ÔΩÉùïÜ‡πì ~*-.,_,.-*~&#039; ^ &#039;*-,</p><p></p><p>The largest of these eyes kept turning, observing the surroundings, and finally fixed on the King of Samo.</p><p></p><p>The monster opened its terrifying mouth and let out a strange, yet familiar, voice.</p><p></p><p>"Fa...ther..."</p><p></p><p>"Fa...ther..."</p><p></p><p>"King~"</p><p></p><p>The pupil of the desert worm even reflected the shadow of Saliman, the slender figure with white bone armor.</p><p></p><p>The king was suddenly overwhelmed with joy. He opened his mouth wide and approached bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Then he gently stroked the eye of the monster.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was touching his most precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>"Saliman, I am your father, I am your king."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the monster blankly, at the desert worm that called him father.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the power of immortality."</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"I succeeded, I really succeeded."</p><p></p><p>As long as Saliman's fusion with the desert worm was successful, he could immediately proceed with and begin his own immortality ritual, fusing with the other members of the Samo family.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The mighty Luhei monster possessed the power of the Moonwort Fern. </p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of Saliman taking control of the power, for the Luhei brand of the Desert Worm was still upon him.</p><p></p><p>The king spoke more and more crazily, his expression becoming increasingly lofty, as if overlooking all of the mortal world from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen himself completely controlling the power of the monster, becoming an immortal, undying existence.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" He couldn't help but laugh out loud, bending over with laughter, tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I should thank that son of the black mud."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have been able to make up my mind."</p><p></p><p>"I am the one who will usher in a new era, I will become the first immortal mortal, establishing a realm never seen before."</p><p></p><p>He kept expounding on his ambitions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no words could express the joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not see that within the body of the Desert Worm before him, an unimaginable transformation was taking place - two completely different mythological bloodlines were violently colliding inside the monster.</p><p></p><p>The worm's terrifying eyeballs began to release an eerie light.</p><p></p><p>It was not the life force of the monster, but neither was it the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The eye on the back of the Desert Worm moved, and a beam of light swept across several of the priests in the congregation.</p><p></p><p>One priest immediately noticed something was wrong, looking down at his chest that had been swept by the light.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly began to swell and distort, with an extra arm growing out of his chest. In the blink of an eye, he had transformed into a monstrous freak.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! The hand, how did a hand grow out?" </p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He let out a heart-wrenching scream, not knowing whether it was from the physical pain or the terror in his mind. Or perhaps, both.</p><p></p><p>"The light, was it that beam of light?"</p><p>"It's over, it's over."</p><p>"Save me, save me!"</p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>The other people hit by the light beam were similar - some instantly regressed into giant trilobites, some grew extra insect legs, some sprouted multiple heads on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they all perished in the distorted, deformed transformations. No one could withstand such grotesque mutations.</p><p></p><p>This was not the end - as the eyes of the Desert Worm continued to rotate, the beams of light kept shooting out.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the powers of wisdom and life force twisted and entangled, and the mutated light beams could transform and corrupt all nearby life forms.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Even as the King of Samo was laughing, he suddenly noticed something was wrong. But just as he straightened up, he saw the terrifying eyeball staring directly at him.</p><p></p><p>The laughter abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Because the most scorching beam of mutation light had fallen upon the King of Samo.</p><p></p><p>"Run for your lives!"</p><p></p><p>The priests around the king also realized something was amiss, and they frantically fled up the stairs.</p><p></p><p>But the mutations on the monster's body were getting worse and worse - its hundreds of eyes opened simultaneously, and the intersecting beams of light illuminated the entire underground plaza in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Not a single person there escaped, all of them consumed by the mutating light.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing, desperate screams rang out - some people writhing in pain on the ground, some falling from the stairs and transforming into hideous monsters.</p><p></p><p>A horrific hell with no escape.</p><p></p><p>"Curse, this is a curse, a curse for us touching the power of the divine." Someone howled before dying.</p><p></p><p>"This is the punishment from the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Oh king! Didn't you say the gods would not look upon the mortal world?" </p><p></p><p>Someone on the ground twisted and crawled, shouting towards the King of Samo.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying insect legs burst out from the king's body, tearing through his armor and flesh. </p><p></p><p>Soon, several grotesque insect heads emerged from his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>His form gradually lowered towards the ground, until the upright three-leaf man transformed into an ugly, deformed insect.</p><p></p><p>The king's confident secret of immortality had summoned a horror he could never have imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p>"My immortality secret..."</p><p>"My immortality secret cannot have any flaws, how could my immortality secret fail?"</p><p></p><p>The king, now a bug, looked up just in time to see the Desert Worm slowly slithering towards him.</p><p></p><p>The king's expression completely changed - he had no desire to be devoured by such a monster, for he knew the fate that awaited those consumed, as evidenced by the test subjects in the dungeons.</p><p></p><p>"No! </p><p>Don't come over here."</p><p></p><p>He fearfully shouted, trying to turn and flee. But he couldn't move at all, only able to watch as the massive flesh mountain engulfed him.</p><p></p><p>Tentacles reached out from beneath the worm, dragging him into the depths of its body.</p><p></p><p>Completely consumed.</p><p></p><p>"Fa...ther..."</p><p>"Father... it's me... Saliman..."</p><p></p><p>As the Desert Worm devoured the King of Samo, it called out in Saliman's voice.</p><p></p><p>But not long after swallowing the king, the worm's voice suddenly changed to another, a coarse and crazed tone:</p><p></p><p>"I am the king of the Samo family, I am the eternal, immortal being."</p><p></p><p>As it continued to slither forward, devouring one mutated three-leaf person after another, the voices it spoke with became increasingly diverse:</p><p></p><p>"No, I am the high priest of the royal priesthood."</p><p>"I am..."</p><p></p><p>One horrific face after another emerged on the worm's surface, as if different wills were vying for control of the monster's body.</p><p></p><p>Chaos, evil, greed, anger - all entangled and intertwined. The monstrous creature crawled out from underground, bringing death with it.</p><p></p><p>The power of Wisdom King Laideli and the power of Life Mother Sallie were engaged in a violent collision - a problem even the gods could not resolve, yet the Kingdom of Samo had unknowingly trespassed upon this forbidden realm.</p><p></p><p>The radiance of wisdom and the powerful fusion of life force clashed and repelled each other, twisting and infecting the life forms of all nearby creatures.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Bolo looked at Xing with an amused and smiling expression, noticing that she had her mouth wide open but wasn't saying anything. </p><p></p><p>Puzzled in his heart: "Has this person been scared silly? Why isn't she talking?"</p><p></p><p>Xing's mouth was wide open, extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't the Sun Cup bite him?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo continued to ask: "Hey!" </p><p></p><p>"How did you manage to do that?"</p><p>"To actually project your consciousness so far away, controlling the fish in the lake."</p><p></p><p>After all, Bolo was a mythical being, the master of the power of dreams.</p><p>With one glance he saw through Xing's divine technique, he could even roam between consciousness and the dream realm, finding that fish controlled by Xing.</p><p></p><p>Xing was even more frightened by Bolo's words, her heart filled with shock.</p><p>"How could he possibly know about my divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>She retreated several steps, looking at Bolo warily: "Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo spread his arms, his body floating up effortlessly, then descending slowly to the ground like a falling flower.</p><p>He walked over to Xing, not caring at all about her vigilance, as if they were already old friends.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Bolo."</p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p>"You're quite powerful! Can this projection power allow anyone's consciousness to project into this world?"</p><p>"After projecting, can you feel the wind? Can you taste food? Can you smell the fragrance of flowers and ocean breeze?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo's machine gun-like barrage of questions didn't get any answers, but Xing also saw that he didn't mean any harm.</p><p></p><p>"That's my divine technique, but it's not complete yet."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Bolo with a strange gaze, realizing he was just a young brat, but a being she had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Xing, you...what exactly are you?"</p><p>"You look so strange! Different from all of us!"</p><p>"And you can even speak, an existence that's not of the Sanlye people yet can speak, it's really too strange."</p><p></p><p>Bolo looked at Xing disdainfully, like she was an unsophisticated country bumpkin.</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a god? Been to the realm of the gods?"</p><p></p><p>Xing: "This is the realm of the gods!"</p><p></p><p>Bolo arrogantly: "I mean the land blessed by the gods, the Inca Temple built by the first Wise King Laidley."</p><p></p><p>"If you've seen the murals carved by Laidley for the god Ying, then you should know."</p><p>"This!"</p><p>"Is the appearance of the divine race."</p><p></p><p>In this short period of time, Xing had experienced more shocks than she had since being born. But it wasn't strange, although born noble, she had never left...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He had been to this sacred mountain before.</p><p></p><p>"Have you been to the place blessed by the gods?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you refer to the great King of Wisdom in that way."</p><p></p><p>Polo arrogantly raised his head: "I am the messenger of God."</p><p></p><p>"Coming from the place blessed by God, carrying the mission bestowed upon me by God."</p><p></p><p>Xing still wanted to ask something more, but Polo was not prepared to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Xing!"</p><p></p><p>"If you have decided, come and become my companion!"</p><p></p><p>"Just call my name, and I will come find you. New69bookbarâ†’69book.com"</p><p></p><p>"Let's do something together, something incomparably great."</p><p></p><p>Polo's robe rippled, rolling up layer after layer of dreamy starlight. A powerful supernatural force surged in the divine chalice garden.</p><p></p><p>In Xing's awestruck gaze, Polo vanished into another world.</p><p></p><p>A world of his dreams.</p><p></p><p>Xing chased after the dreamy light, watching the corner of the other's robe brush past her body, the agile dancing figure disappearing high above.</p><p></p><p>She stood there for a long time, not knowing how to describe the dreamy encounter she had just experienced.</p><p></p><p>She was a high-level priestess, the heir of the Xilun family.</p><p></p><p>Yet she could not sense the other's existence, could not see how the other came, nor how the other left.</p><p></p><p>The power possessed by the other was far above her own.</p><p></p><p>"Really a messenger of God?"</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly ran all the way, passing through the colonnades, passing through the steep stairs.</p><p></p><p>She ran into the temple and knelt on the floor.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"So You are still watching over us?"</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the statue of the racing god and recited the Ledrelic Oath,</p><p></p><p>"God said."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>When she had recited these words of the oath before, her heart was filled with bewilderment, merely following what others said.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the bewilderment in her heart gradually disappeared. She felt an incomparable sense of fulfillment and security. This was a world with God, and they were a race blessed by God.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat tempted by Polo's invitation but also afraid. She had never left the Sky Temple and the sacred mountain before; this was her home and her entire world.</p><p></p><p>Although curious about the outside world, she was equally afraid of leaving the world she was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>--------------</p><p></p><p>The City Blessed by God.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the palace knelt down to pay respects, and there was a cloud of mourning inside and outside the palace.</p><p></p><p>"The king is dead!"</p><p></p><p>And Yali was undoubtedly the new king. He stood in the palace watching the deceased king being placed in a stone coffin. He personally carried the stone coffin to bury his father in the royal cemetery.</p><p></p><p>Yali was not too saddened by his father's passing. He had long</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The grief he felt was far from the tremendous impact on him when his grandfather Yesser passed away. </p><p></p><p>Ever since he was little, he had been by King Yesser's side, growing up listening to and witnessing the great deeds and legends of King Yesser. He looked down upon his somewhat weak father, aspiring to accomplish feats like King Yesser's.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of the King of Heinse was gradually declining. </p><p></p><p>Having lost the supreme power of the wise king, the King of Heinse discarded the crown of the wise king, no longer able to easily command all the royal families as before. The various city-states of the Kingdom of Heinse also no longer completely obeyed as they once did.</p><p></p><p>Ari, wearing a new crown, summoned the ministers of the Kingdom of Heinse in his palace chamber.</p><p></p><p>"How about the Sky Temple?"  </p><p></p><p>"Is the Seron family willing to hand over the Ruh Giant?"</p><p></p><p>In order to consolidate the power of the King of Heinse and suppress the other four powerful royal lineages that controlled the fusion monsters and were growing stronger, Ari prepared to reclaim the seven fusion monsters.</p><p></p><p>The first target was the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster of the Seron family was a must-have, especially since the Sky Temple also had many priests of the gods, which was also a formidable force.</p><p></p><p>The minister trembled in fear: "But that is the temple of the gods."</p><p></p><p>Ari nodded but did not confirm or deny.</p><p></p><p>"The gods do exist."</p><p></p><p>"But so what?"</p><p></p><p>"The gods are like those high stars, finding it superfluous to even glance at the human world."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think They care about what we do? Do They care if we are pious or hypocritical?"</p><p></p><p>Ari turned his head and bent down to look at the minister kneeling and trembling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think we are? King Leadley, the favored son of the gods?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"They only see us as an ugly, lowly group of insects, finding it repulsive to even look at us once."</p><p></p><p>"Will They step out to punish me? Will They despise me for this?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"The gods will not."</p><p></p><p>"We don't even have the qualification to be despised or punished by Them."</p><p></p><p>"Why would the lofty gods bother to cast Their precious gaze upon us? The gods only favor Their eldest son, not even the great King Yesser could attain a shred of Their favor."</p><p></p><p>Ari spoke lightly, but his chest was pounding, and his breath had become heavy.</p><p></p><p>He had personally witnessed how devoutly King Yesser had believed in the gods, offering everything to Them, only to lose everything in the end.</p><p></p><p>He had also once believed in the gods immensely, and even now, he did not deny Their greatness.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>He would not offer Them his all like King Leadley and his grandfather Yesser had.</p><p></p><p>He said indifferently.</p>

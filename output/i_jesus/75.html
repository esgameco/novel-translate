        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beneath the castle was a vast underground cave. </p><p></p><p>A group of fierce and violent three-legged people, armed with weapons, advanced cautiously. They were getting closer and closer to the Sun Cup flower thicket, and their breathing became more and more rapid.</p><p></p><p>These battle-hardened veterans, who had once been fearless, were now nervous like new recruits on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Their hands gripped tightly around bone spears and stone hammers, and they kept swallowing saliva. With each step, they would glance at their companions, their gazes exchanging silent encouragement.</p><p></p><p>They were approaching the greatest secret of the Hinsai people - the final resting place of the saintly and great poet Tito, the last to enter the realm of the divine.</p><p></p><p>They were about to unveil the mystery of Tito's legacy from centuries ago.</p><p></p><p>More than that, they were exploring the secrets of the divine.</p><p></p><p>All of this stirred their blood, but at the same time, they were deeply anxious, uneasy, and even fearful.</p><p></p><p>Their line of sight was level with the golden flower cup.</p><p></p><p>In the underground cave, they saw a small courtyard, a dwelling hidden behind the Sun Cup flowers. The Sun Cup flowers were spreading out from the courtyard, with luminescent light flowing from them like a glowing river.</p><p></p><p>This was the small house where Star and Bolo had once lived.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, looking to their leader.</p><p></p><p>"It's true! It's really here!" said the tall three-legged man holding a bone spear, pointing at the building amidst the flower sea.</p><p></p><p>"We've found it, we've hit the jackpot," said the battle-hardened soldier carrying a stone hammer, already envisioning his future wealth and nobility.</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader was clearly no ordinary person - he knew more.</p><p></p><p>His pupils dilated, and his expression became dazed.</p><p></p><p>After opening and closing his mouth several times, he finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"This is the resting place of the divine messenger Bolo and the Star Queen, the relic of myth. It is also the starting point of the pilgrimage of the saint Tito, the origin of 'The Ode to the Wise King'."</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader turned and smiled at his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, welcome to the birthplace of myth and epic."</p><p></p><p>They cheered joyfully, their steps quickening.</p><p></p><p>However, the flower thicket before them began to sway with their movement.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful Sun Cup flowers suddenly opened their gaping maws and lunged at them, transforming the serene scene into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The quick-thinking caravan leader had prepared, quickly sprinkling a special bone powder on his group. Instantly, the Sun Cup flowers calmed down, as if they could no longer sense their presence.</p><p></p><p>They passed through the flower thicket and entered the arched courtyard, stepping through the stone gate.</p><p></p><p>Their hurried steps came to an abrupt halt as everyone stood before the garden, not daring to advance further.</p><p></p><p>For they saw the remains of the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>He was surrounded by a vast thicket of Sun Cup flowers, with a boat shimmering with silver light behind him. The once-white sails had become tattered and dirty, but this only added to the ancient, weathered aura.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a sense of sacred power permeating the flower thicket, enveloping the trespassing three-legged people.</p><p></p><p>The poet rested quietly on the boat, his head tilted, in eternal slumber. In his embrace was the final chapter he had written.</p><p></p><p>The moment the bone book appeared, it captivated everyone's gaze.</p><p></p><p>For two hundred years, the legends and speculations about the great poet had circulated among the Hinsai people. Now, at this moment, the truth was finally revealed.</p><p></p><p>"The great poet Tito."</p><p>"The saint Tito."</p><p>"The last to enter the divine realm and witness the gods."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The emissary and the divine saint." </p><p></p><p>"What he holds in his arms is the 'Final Chapter'."</p><p></p><p>"The legendary bone book."</p><p></p><p>All the people couldn't help but shout in unison, each one louder than the other.</p><p></p><p>"And also, the sacred ship!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't you see? That is the sacred ship!"</p><p></p><p>"It is a precious treasure bestowed by the divine emissary. I heard it was taken from the divine emissary's dream, an unparalleled treasure."</p><p></p><p>Someone even recalled the stories they had heard since childhood: "The great poet rode the wind, passing through the demonic abyss country, and the sinful people dared not block his path."</p><p></p><p>The people in the venue were in an uproar, but none of them dared to approach further.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the caravan leader cautiously stepped forward, coming before the sacred ship and the great poet, kneeling reverently before the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Great saint Tito!"</p><p></p><p>"Forgive my offense, my sins are unforgivable."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"Our kingdom needs the secrets you left behind, needs the legendary power."</p><p></p><p>"It is all for the return to the glory of the divine, all for the restoration of the divine's splendor."</p><p></p><p>He did not dare to look directly at the holy remains of the great poet Tito, lowering his head and reaching his hand up towards the bone book, wanting to take it from the great poet's embrace.</p><p></p><p>But the moment his fingers touched the bone book, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>The corpse of the great poet Tito instantly turned to ashes, the flying ashes blown up by a nameless wind.</p><p></p><p>The flower bushes stirred, and all the sun cups released pollen into the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a scene appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was a mythical life form wearing a golden robe with a divine countenance, holding a female three-leaf person in his arms, lying in a vortex of stars.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up, surrounding the kneeling leader.</p><p></p><p>The leader knelt on the ground, looking up at the illusion above.</p><p></p><p>"It is the scene of the divine emissary Bolo and the Star Queen Jimo, and it turns out that the great poet Tito never forgot this moment, even imprinting this image on the sun cups."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the nameless wind that had stirred up the ashes suddenly transformed into the illusion of the great poet.</p><p></p><p>A mournful and ethereal voice came from the air.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"It was just my dream."</p><p></p><p>"I've woken up."</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the poet Tito followed the rotating starry river, following the divine emissary Bolo and the Star Queen, dissipating into the air above the sun cup flower bushes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned by this shocking and beautiful scene, and the entire underground cave fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble."</p><p></p><p>With a loud roar, the cave collapsed completely.</p><p></p><p>Giant waves surged in, the swirling seawater devouring and destroying everything.</p><p></p><p>In the waves and vortex, the caravan leader grabbed the bone book.</p><p></p><p>He anxiously looked back at another precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The sacred ship."</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader, of course, knew the significance of the sacred ship, a item passed down from the divine realm, a unique treasure in the world. No one knew if there were still other secrets on it, whether it possessed unknown powers and functions.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he could only watch helplessly as the sacred ship, a treasure from the divine realm, was washed away, the silver boat swept into the depths of the sea by the giant waves.</p><p></p><p>On the surface.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet night of Tito Town, the loud roar also woke the residents.</p><p></p><p>Seawater gushed out from the ground, spraying up as fountains.</p><p></p><p>The awakened townspeople and craftsmen rushed out, looking towards the direction of the castle.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>"It's collapsing!"</p><p></p><p>"It's collapsing!"</p><p></p><p>The tall and majestic castle, with the sinking of the ground and the rumbling roar, crumbled into ruins.</p><p></p><p>The Tito family had spent more than a hundred years and generations of people constantly expanding to build this grand castle.</p><p></p><p>But its disappearance...</p>

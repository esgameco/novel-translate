        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Night. 👊😳69shu𝑋.cσm🎁💋</p><p></p><p>The moon at the end of the sea was exceptionally large, and its reflection was distorted in the waves and ripples.</p><p></p><p>A sacred boat sailed across the reflection and drifted away with the currents and waves.</p><p></p><p>A stream of starlight flowed down from the night sky, and a beautiful figure in a magnificent golden robe appeared on the sea.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams looked at the sacred boat, her eyes filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>She walked on the surface of the water, caressing the hull of the silver sailboat.</p><p></p><p>It was as if she was stroking the hair of a child who had finally returned after a long absence.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally found you!"</p><p></p><p>"So you've come here."</p><p></p><p>However, another sleeping life on the sacred boat suddenly awoke. It sensed the presence of the dream fairy and her immense power.</p><p></p><p>Even though the fairy had lost the dreams of the gods, she was still a being that ordinary mortals could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>It was frightened and wanted to hide, but the small sacred boat could not completely conceal its presence.</p><p></p><p>The fairy noticed a blooming sun cup of wisdom on the sacred boat, and she was very curious.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams asked curiously, "What are you?"</p><p></p><p>"You are not a dream fairy."</p><p></p><p>Although the fairy of dreams was born from the sun cup, her more important origin was the mythological blood of Boreas.</p><p></p><p>The being before her was not a dream fairy, but a plant that had usurped the bloodline of Leidensky's wisdom and gained consciousness. Its power and bloodline came from the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness in the sun cup trembled, like a child who had done something wrong, standing before the fairy of dreams. ∙∙·▫▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ 69shu𝑥.Ć𝔬m ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫▫·∙∙</p><p></p><p>The fairy could sense its inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Are you called Leis?"</p><p></p><p>"No, are you called Weisen?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not it either."</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten your own name, or have you obtained a memory that doesn't belong to you?"</p><p></p><p>In the calm sea and on the ancient sailboat, the only sound that could be heard was the voice of a person speaking, but it was a conversation between two fantastical beings.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams confirmed, "You are an existence between human and flower, you are not a fairy, but you are also not a three-leaf person."</p><p></p><p>"You have the body of a fairy, but the bloodline of Leidensky."</p><p></p><p>The sun cup of the flower swayed, as if nodding.</p><p></p><p>The fairy's golden robe arched up and touched the sun cup.</p><p></p><p>The starlight of the dream rose, and a powerful force enveloped the fairy and the sun cup. The fairy's smooth golden hair flew in the air.</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, which had a touch of sadness.</p><p></p><p>The fairy looked at this newborn life and said, "You are having a nightmare, your dreams are filled with darkness and pain."</p><p></p><p>"You originally slumbered in the garden of Lord Boreas and the Queen of Stars, but you were forcibly planted into the body of a prince named Weiss Hausen. You have inherited his nightmares and despair."</p><p></p><p>The sun cup of the flower bloomed fully, as if crying out in agony. °🎀69shu𝑥.𝒸☯m🎀°</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams comforted it, telling it not to be afraid.</p><p></p><p>"I can lend you my dream egg, and put your nightmares inside it."</p><p></p><p>"That way, you won't be afraid or in pain anymore, you can escape the despair of the nightmare."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"My dream egg is very important, I originally had an important purpose for keeping it."</p><p></p><p>"After I give it to you, you will have to do something in my place."</p><p></p><p>The sun cup nodded, agreeing to the fairy's conditions.</p><p></p><p>The fairy smiled, her chest glowing with light.</p><p></p><p>The dream egg emerged from her body,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's as if I've taken my own heart out of my body.</p><p></p><p>The dream fragments of the dream demon Xila have merged into the dream world, and her dream egg has only a shell left, which no longer serves any purpose for her.</p><p></p><p>She originally wanted to use the dream egg on the sacred boat, but now she has a better idea.</p><p></p><p>She cupped the dream egg and placed it in the cup of the sunflower.</p><p></p><p>"Nightmares and despair!"</p><p></p><p>"May everything be transformed into dream bubbles, forever bound within this illusory shell!"</p><p></p><p>The existence between human and flower, after obtaining the dream demon's dream egg, the nightmares and fears that were once hidden deep within it gradually seeped out and were captured within the dream egg.</p><p></p><p>And the golden body of the sunflower cup also gradually became dimmer.</p><p></p><p>On the bow of the sacred boat, a dark golden flower is blooming, and the dream egg in the cup holds a black dream, but there is light within the black dream.</p><p></p><p>This feeling.</p><p></p><p>It's as if there is a magical guiding light on the bow of the boat.</p><p></p><p>The dream bubbles extending from the light envelop the sacred boat, just like how Xila's dream once enveloped the temple.</p><p></p><p>Its power is the second-tier wisdom ability, originating from Laideli, but now with the spiritual power fused into the dream egg, a black shadow has materialized and stands on the sacred boat enveloped by the dream bubbles, under the lamp of the flower cup.</p><p></p><p>This is the projection of consciousness, a change that has appeared attached to the dream egg.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power and the dream have merged together, and it can use the spiritual power to propel the sacred boat forward, and also use the dream demon's dream egg to traverse and jump between the dream world.</p><p></p><p>As the nightmares are bound within the shell, their original agonizing wails and the fear that had nowhere to hide have instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow looks at Xila the dream demon and says in a halting voice:</p><p></p><p>"Thank... thank..."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The dream demon Xila smiles and says, "Wasn't that our agreement?"</p><p></p><p>The demon waves her hand, and the door to the dream world opens.</p><p></p><p>"You, the sacred boat that travels between dreams, and the dream ferryman who guides memories!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can replace me in the future, traversing between the dream realms, guiding all the memories that return to the sea of dream stars."</p><p></p><p>Under the night sky and the vast sea, the demon's ethereal chant echoes farther and farther away.</p><p></p><p>"Life has not dissipated, their memories and what they once were..."</p><p></p><p>"Will all become stars to forever accompany the divine."</p><p></p><p>Under the guiding light,</p><p></p><p>The black shadow controls the sacred boat enveloped in dream bubbles and passes through the portal, entering the dream world.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The sailboat sails between the dream moon and the sea of dream stars,</p><p></p><p>On board is a strange ferryman, whose form cannot be clearly seen by the naked eye, only a blurry black shadow under the guiding light.</p><p></p><p>The silver boat, shrouded in the murky, hazy bubbles, rotates following the dream moon and the sea of dream stars.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't know how long it will have to do this, it only knows that this is its agreement with the demon.</p><p></p><p>Since it's an agreement,</p><p></p><p>Then it must be upheld forever.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it arrives at the center of the dream world.</p><p></p><p>That massive dream fragment, by the island where the divine beings reside.</p><p></p><p>A girl in a white veil stands barefoot on the edge of the island, looking at it.</p><p></p><p>"Guruguru!"</p><p></p><p>Facing this powerful and terrifying existence, it has no fear or trepidation this time, those negative emotions are hidden within the nightmares.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't know the Mother of Life, Sali, and doesn't know that she is just habitually making a verbal expression.</p><p></p><p>It thinks she is asking who it is.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>"I have no name."</p><p></p><p>"I am just a ferryman who walks the dream world, guiding memories."</p><p></p><p>It looks up and invites Sali to be its first passenger.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Yesaer Waterway. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Tito burst out of the sea like a mermaid, grasping a primordial fish.</p><p></p><p>The journey was progressing smoothly, he had already left the near-shore waters controlled by the Trifoliate people and entered the middle of the Yesaer Waterway.</p><p></p><p>This was already within the domain of the Abyss Nation, the realm of the monsters that had crawled out of the deep sea trenches.</p><p></p><p>Although he had encountered many troubles and difficulties along the way, and even encountered patrolling Shrimp Knights at the border of the Abyss Nation, he had managed to overcome these difficulties and dangers through his early preparations and quick wit.</p><p></p><p>Tito was a person good at planning, which greatly helped his journey.</p><p></p><p>"An island?"</p><p></p><p>Holding the fish, Tito suddenly noticed an island in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He took out the stone tablet map and compared it to find the location of this island, which was the site of an abandoned Trifoliate town in the past, and this island had also once been a gathering place for the Trifoliate people many years ago.</p><p></p><p>He immediately became interested, as a poet who wrote epics, he saw these ancient cultural relics like a starving person seeing a sumptuous feast.</p><p></p><p>He approached the island, but discovered an unusual sight.</p><p></p><p>There were rows of stone posts on the island, with something bound to them.</p><p></p><p>As he drew closer, Tito couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>The stone posts were bound with corpses, and they were clearly Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>He turned to leave, but ripples were already appearing in the water behind him.</p><p></p><p>The poet immediately abandoned the idea of turning back and directly rushed ashore.</p><p></p><p>He knew what was coming.</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword and stood guard on the island. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>At this time, going into the water would only lead to certain death, but staying on the island gave him a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>His courage and strategy were quite good, but he was not a person adept at killing and fighting, and he was facing the bloodthirsty denizens of the Abyss Nation who had been fighting for years.</p><p></p><p>One Abyss Nation denizen after another surfaced from the water, their long and powerful tails swinging and creating waves that sent them crashing against the side of the island like small boats.</p><p></p><p>They were rushing along the shore, not directly attacking the poet.</p><p></p><p>After a few had drawn the poet's attention, others on the other side collaborated to throw a net and trap Tito, rendering him unable to exert his strength.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Tito, who was familiar with the cruel and evil deeds of these monsters, immediately had this thought.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers of the Abyss Nation rummaged through his backpack, surrounding Tito without speaking, but the long tentacles on their heads colliding with each other, and Tito knew they were communicating in their own special way.</p><p></p><p>Tito thought they might be discussing how to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Or even...</p><p></p><p>Discussing how to eat him.</p><p></p><p>"How did a Hinsai person end up here?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably got lost."</p><p></p><p>"The sword forged by the Ruhek Giant, his identity is not simple."</p><p></p><p>These Abyss Nation denizens did not kill Tito, but instead took him back with them.</p><p></p><p>Tito was taken to the depths of the sea, and in the midst of a group of reefs, ancient cups, and ferns, he saw an underwater city that looked more like a nest than a city.</p><p></p><p>He also saw the master of this underwater city.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight was refracted and shone here, and the monster lay on a stone seat in the stone-built structure, looking at him with curious eyes. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Tito suddenly realized that these monsters were not quite what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>That gaze, was actually not much different from the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps...</p><p></p><p>When they regained their intelligence, they were no longer monsters.</p><p></p><p>Then what were they?</p><p></p><p>Surely not the same as us, humans?</p><p></p><p>"I am the lord of the Sal Province of the Abyss Nation. You, the Hinsai person who dares to invade my territory, state your identity and purpose."</p><p></p><p>The voice directly pierced his ears and resonated in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Tito immediately knew that this was an Abyss Nation denizen with the power of intelligence, the descendants of the Guilty Kings blessed with the bloodline of the ancient King Ari, after so many generations, had they...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quite a few had also awakened to the power of their abilities on their own.</p><p></p><p>Tito did not speak, but the other side was able to directly read his thoughts from his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Tito!"</p><p></p><p>"You are a poet? And you also have the royal bloodline of the Hinsai people!"</p><p></p><p>The lord of the monsters picked up Tito's backpack and looked at the few bone tablets, not noticing a faint glow coming from the decaying cup pressed at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what you wrote?"</p><p></p><p>Tito immediately became anxious, fearing the other would take the divine cup.</p><p></p><p>He struggled forward, bubbles coming from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>It could faintly be heard that he said, "Give it back to me!"</p><p></p><p>The moment he spoke, Tito immediately panicked, realizing he had made a fatal mistake.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the power of wisdom, worried the other might read the existence of the divine cup from his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He immediately tried to suppress all consciousness related to the divine cup, even trying to empty his mind of any thoughts, even though it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, the other made no move. </p><p></p><p>Instead, they completely focused their attention on the poems Tito had written.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, they did not extract even the slightest information about the divine cup from his consciousness, as if some unseen force was blocking anyone from knowing of its existence.</p><p></p><p>Tito tried to communicate with the other mentally, guiding their attention to the poems he had written.</p><p></p><p>"I am a poet, preparing to search for the legendary land bestowed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"I am planning to write a great mythology about the legend of King Laideli."</p><p></p><p>"This is not only about the mythology of the Hinsai people, but also about your ancestors and origins."</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Abyss people looked at Tito, as if confirming he was not joking.</p><p></p><p>"No one has ever seen the land bestowed by the gods, that is just a myth."</p><p></p><p>The lord liked Tito's poems and appreciated his literary talent. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also hoped that Tito, with his royal bloodline, would stay and join them, rather than go searching for the land bestowed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>"Stay here!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't kill you, and I can even make you a citizen of the Abyss Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"You can write chapters and record the history for us in the future."</p>

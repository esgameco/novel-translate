        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Within the chaotic stone forest of piled up boulders, Tito, who had carefully copied the bone tablets and put them in his backpack, suddenly turned his head and looked at the old man in the stone helmet.</p><p></p><p>He heard the words of the knight of the Abyss Kingdom, and now the only ones who had intruded here were him and the old man in the stone helmet.</p><p></p><p>"Are they talking about you?" Tito asked without waiting for the old man in the stone helmet to respond.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the previous king of the Abyss Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Tito had always been guessing the identity of the old man in the stone helmet, and now he recalled the other's previous words, including that sentence "you have finally returned," which proved the other's identity.</p><p></p><p>"You had also said before that you were the great-grandfather of the Lord of Sala."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, you are not only their king, but also the founding monarch of this kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet did not admit it, but he did not refute it either.</p><p></p><p>Tito stood up, and it was only then that he truly knew the true identity of the aged Abyss people before him.</p><p></p><p>He felt incredibly shocked, as he had never imagined that this person was actually a monarch, and the founding king of a dynasty.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>He was not only exiled by his own people in the end, but also driven off the throne by his own children and former subjects.</p><p></p><p>The reason for his exile was not due to food shortages or an inability to support a large enough population.</p><p></p><p>It was because he had grown old, yet still sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet had a somewhat carefree expression: "Laideli, the king who once created everything, ultimately met a tragic late life."</p><p></p><p>"The invincible Yesaer King, in the end could only die miserably in the Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"All the prosperity has withered, leaving only ashes."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to their glory and suffering, what is this tiny bit of honor and pain of mine worth?"</p><p></p><p>Tito could not see the old man's expression, but he could hear the sorrow in his words.</p><p></p><p>He too had once had a legendary story, and had once sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>But Tito did not know.</p><p></p><p>He had once stood on the high platform of Yesaer City and proclaimed to all the people of the Abyss Kingdom that they were no longer monsters, and that they would establish a kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if he had ever imagined that he would one day end up in such a situation, or if he had foreseen that his aging self would fall to such a fate.</p><p></p><p>More and more soldiers of the Abyss Kingdom gathered, searching for their traces among the underwater vegetation and rubble.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet precisely grasped the opportunity, dragging Tito to escape from these searchers, taking a different direction.</p><p></p><p>Tito asked the old man in the stone helmet, "You know it's dangerous here, why did you still come?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet looked at Tito: "You know searching for the God-given land will get you killed, why do you still go?"</p><p></p><p>The old man turned back and continued walking.</p><p></p><p>"You are searching for the God-given land, and I am searching for an answer."</p><p></p><p>"We are both willing to pay the price for it."</p><p></p><p>Tito was stunned, then a faint smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He finally felt that the old man in the stone helmet and himself were truly kindred spirits.</p><p></p><p>The two of them bypassed the search group, and Tito could feel that the old man in the stone helmet was extremely familiar with this area, knowing exactly how the patrolling soldiers would move and how to avoid them.</p><p></p><p>Even the appearance of the chaos had caused these patrolling soldiers to be constantly redirected to the chaotic stone area, making their passage through the waters of Yesaer City even smoother.</p><p></p><p>Tito guessed that this might also be part of the old man in the stone helmet's calculations.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was once a monarch.</p><p></p><p>They hugged the foot of Yesaer City and circled the soldiers underwater, staying in the dark areas out of everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were about to leave the control range of the Abyss Kingdom...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The masses of the Abyss Dwellers suddenly rushed in from the high seas, surrounding the blind poet and the old man in the stone helmet. </p><p></p><p>It seemed that they had been waiting for the arrival of the two all along.</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p>"You have returned."</p><p></p><p>A tall Abyss Dweller wearing a black crown stepped out, his imposing figure and powerful aura emanating towards them.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet looked at him and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Let us pass, I have not come to reclaim the throne."</p><p>"I do not wish to fight you either."</p><p></p><p>However, the king of the Abyss Dwellers shook his head: "Father, you know the rules, the ones you set."</p><p></p><p>"It was you who told me that this world is cruel."</p><p>"A ruler, for the sake of the country and the survival of all, can sacrifice anyone."</p><p>"It was you who told me that the Abyss Dwellers need a strong and ambitious king to lead everyone towards the future."</p><p>"You have said so yourself."</p><p>"There can only be one person sitting on the throne, one king in the royal city."</p><p>"And now you have stepped into the domain of the king."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet fell silent, then said after a long while:</p><p>"The rules are made by man."</p><p>"And man..."</p><p>"Can change."</p><p></p><p>He smiled: "Perhaps the rules I set back then were wrong?"</p><p></p><p>However, the young king did not buy it, he only believed in the truths he heard in his youth.</p><p>He believed in the words spoken by the powerful king, not the words of the aged and destitute old man.</p><p></p><p>"Then let the wrong become right, for a king..."</p><p>"Does not make mistakes."</p><p></p><p>All the soldiers of the Abyss Dwellers stepped aside, surrounding the two but not daring to approach.</p><p>They were only preventing the old king from entering the city, but since he had already stepped into the domain of the royal city, the rules of the Abyss Dwellers must be followed.</p><p></p><p>The new king and the old king must engage in a battle between rulers.</p><p>The victor shall be king, the loser shall be banished.</p><p></p><p>The old and the young engaged in a fierce battle, just like their previous fight for the throne.</p><p>Their wisdom and abilities, without the pollen from the Sun Cup to evolve, did not play a major role, in the end relying on the powerful physiques of the Abyss Dwellers and their combat wisdom.</p><p></p><p>In everyone's expectation, the young king would once again defeat the old king, as he had done before.</p><p>However, beyond anyone's imagination, the young king was at a disadvantage from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>The young king was stronger and more powerful.</p><p>But the old man in the stone helmet's fighting skills were more refined, he knew every move of the young king and easily evaded and counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>In just a few exchanges, the old man had knocked the young king to the ground, even causing his crown to fall off.</p><p></p><p>He raised his arm like a spear, ready to strike the young king's vulnerable spot and kill the rebellious son, reclaiming his throne.</p><p>But he withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>The young king then realized that the last time he challenged his father, his father had let him ascend the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" the young king did not understand, why would his father do this? </p><p>Why not kill a son who defied him, a rebel who dared to challenge the king's authority?</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet looked at his son: "We are not monsters, child."</p><p>"We were once human too, we once had the love of the gods and Laideli, living in the divine halls."</p><p>"As humans, we cannot live like monsters."</p><p></p><p>The son looked bewildered: "I do not understand what you are saying."</p><p></p><p>The old man: "Someday, you will understand."</p><p></p><p>With that, the old man turned and left.</p><p>He gave up the chance to reclaim the throne, because it held no meaning for him anymore.</p>

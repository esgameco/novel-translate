        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In front of the giant well connecting the God-gifted City to the sea, many people had gathered today, as if a grand ceremony was taking place. Amid the watching of thousands upon thousands of Trifolians, a short, stumbling Trifolian emerged from the underwater city at the bottom of the well. His figure stepped through the submerged stone steps one by one, setting foot on the land under the sun.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time seeing sunlight, and also the first time he laid eyes on the majestic God-gifted City. </p><p></p><p>The scorching radiance overhead made him feel dizzy, and the cheers of millions made him excited and flushed.</p><p></p><p>He saw the figure in the center of the human enclosure, a tall Trifolian wearing a stone crown.</p><p></p><p>The other party extended a hand towards him from up high.</p><p></p><p>"Come here!"</p><p></p><p>The young Trifolian stepped forward and knelt before the figure wearing the stone crown, and the crowd also fell silent, witnessing this great miraculous moment.</p><p></p><p>The King of Wisdom extended his hand and placed it on the young Trifolian's head.</p><p></p><p>"My child."</p><p></p><p>"I bestow upon you wisdom and knowledge."</p><p></p><p>"You, who inherit my bloodline, shall become part of the God-gifted City from today onwards."</p><p></p><p>All the Trifolians in the crowd watched intently. Even if they had witnessed this before, and many had even experienced it personally, they still could not ignore the wonder of this power.</p><p></p><p>It made them revere and admire, letting them know what the King of Wisdom was, what a mythical power meant.</p><p></p><p>Leadlebee imparted the words, language and some knowledge from his memories into the young Trifolian's mind. This was the innate power he possessed as the King of Wisdom, the gift bestowed upon him by the divine.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he pass on knowledge and heritage to his direct bloodline in this way, but he also allowed many people of the God-gifted City to quickly learn how to speak.</p><p></p><p>The young Trifolian opened his mouth for a long while before finally uttering words.</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p></p><p>Leadlebee: "I am your father, but I am also the King of Wisdom of the God-gifted City, and your king."</p><p></p><p>"When in public, you should address me as King."</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>The King of Wisdom's family gathered around a long stone table, on which were laid out several processed ancestral fish.</p><p></p><p>This large family already had many members, Leadlebee had grandchildren and even great-grandchildren. But today's protagonist was his youngest son.</p><p></p><p>The King of Wisdom was celebrating his youngest son entering adolescence, which also marked his transformation from an insect form in the sea to a human form.</p><p></p><p>He sat...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Laidlike's eldest brother on the left looked at him passionately: "Welcome to joining our family, my brother."</p><p></p><p>Another elder brother directly patted him on the shoulder: "After some time, come find me at the warehouse, I'll show you some good stuff."</p><p></p><p>The sister across from him looked at him with a gentle expression: "Tomorrow sister will take you to see the ancestral fish in the water."  </p><p></p><p>"You haven't seen it before, right! The sunlight penetrates the water bottom, thousands upon thousands of fish swimming by underneath, indescribably beautiful."</p><p></p><p>When dinner ended, night had fallen. </p><p></p><p>The moonlight tonight was very beautiful, illuminating the entire palace transparently.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike: "You've grown up now, you should also have your own name."</p><p></p><p>The King and Queen of Wisdom exchanged a smile, prepared for his mother to tell him the name herself, because this name was the one the Queen chose.</p><p></p><p>But before the Queen could open her mouth, the teenage Trifoliate spoke it out.</p><p></p><p>"Jeser!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Jeser? Meaning moonlight?"</p><p></p><p>Jeser does mean moonlight, a very beautiful name.</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate language originated from the communication between Yinshen and Laidlike. Laidlike's accent, to Yinshen, was understandable but could only be described as unbearable to listen to.</p><p></p><p>From this accent and invented writing system, a language system formed that even Yinshen didn't know how to explain.</p><p></p><p>But this moment was clearly not the time to dwell on literal meanings. The Queen looked at her young son in astonishment.  </p><p></p><p>"How did you know? Besides your father, I haven't told anyone."</p><p></p><p>The teenage Trifoliate just said: "You told me! I heard your body calling out my name."</p><p></p><p>Jeser also looked towards his brothers, smiling and saying:</p><p></p><p>"The warehouse is huge, I must go see it tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>He also nodded towards his sister across from him: "The scene of the fish swimming by is indeed beautiful, I've already seen it."</p><p></p><p>Laidlike looked at his son: "You can directly see others' consciousness and thoughts."</p><p></p><p>The whole family looked at Jeser in shock, this was a power only the King of Wisdom possessed.</p><p></p><p>The teenage Trifoliate clearly didn't understand the distinction, he just thought this was an unremarkable ability that others should also have.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know that currently, this mythical power had only been inherited by him from the King of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike sat at the head of the stone long table, looking at his young son, his eyes revealing delight.</p><p></p><p>"Jeser..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Er."  </p><p>"You're great."</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p>"Really great!"</p><p></p><p>Laidlike rarely showed very strong emotions in front of the other Trifolians, even his own family members. </p><p></p><p>But today he was really very happy, overjoyed beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Trifolians, only he possessed the power of myth, receiving divine revelations from the God of Games, wanting to build a great civilization.</p><p></p><p>But no one could understand him, no one could truly walk with him, and no one could inherit his power and ideals.  </p><p></p><p>He was the King of Wisdom, the king of the Trifolians, with thousands upon thousands of his own kind.</p><p></p><p>But he felt the same loneliness as the gods.</p><p></p><p>This moment was different, it seemed he saw someone who could inherit his will and ideals.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Yeser followed his father up the stairs that seemed they could never finish climbing, crossing over pyramid-like peaks, heading towards the highest temple.</p><p></p><p>This path over the stairs made him feel a sacred emotion welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since Laidlike brought his eldest son here once before in disappointment, he had never brought anyone up here again.  </p><p></p><p>Even his son, those without the power of myth were unworthy to come before the gods.</p><p></p><p>In his view.</p><p></p><p>Those who did not even have the power to see the gods and receive revelations would only defile the will of the gods, polluting the gods' temple.</p><p></p><p>In front of the temple, two Trifolians, one large and one small, knelt down.</p><p></p><p>The wise king Laidlike looked at Yeser excitedly and full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p>"Do you see?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser knelt and looked into the temple, carefully raising his head to let his gaze extend along the floor deep inside.</p><p></p><p>He saw the shell radiating the light of myth, the supreme instrument for creating life.  </p><p></p><p>Beneath the altar sat a young girl, the fusion monster Shallie surging with terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the girl, a huge beast-like mountain appeared before his eyes, with countless hands and hundreds of terrifying eyes staring at him, making him fall into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>He saw the gods.</p><p></p><p>The gods transcending ancient eons and controlling the laws of time radiated a brilliant light like the stars, the radiance engulfing him, everything in his sight turning dazzling white.</p><p></p><p>Yeser's gaze was blank, his consciousness became empty.  </p><p></p><p>He and his father cried out the sounds uttered when first seeing the gods.</p>

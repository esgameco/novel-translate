        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Heneir gripped the scepter of Xin Sai, and he suddenly recalled the scene he had just witnessed of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was still just a small figure who had risen up by seizing the Ruhei Giant, a bastard child who was despised and scorned by others.</p><p></p><p>Due to the tense war and political situation, he gained the favor of the Queen of the Stars, and in the palace, he received the Queen's enfeoffment, becoming a nominal Duke of the Volcano Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Because at that time, the Volcano Kingdom still belonged to the Hosen family.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stood among the crowd, just as out of place as Heneir, both of them disliked by the people.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Heneir immediately noticed this legendary lucky son.</p><p></p><p>Was it because he lacked the aura of nobility?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>It was because he was simple and pure.</p><p></p><p>He called himself a marionette, not knowing what he wanted, but he was a very pure person.</p><p></p><p>He could only simply distinguish right from wrong, knowing that he should repay the Queen's grace, and that he should stand up for his friends in times of trouble.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Such a person should not have appeared at the noble banquet.</p><p></p><p>What did he say to him back then?</p><p></p><p>He remembered.</p><p></p><p>"When the day comes when no one calls you the lucky son anymore, you will no longer be a marionette."</p><p></p><p>"At that time."</p><p></p><p>"You will become a truly powerful person, worthy of being worshipped and feared by all."</p><p></p><p>Heneir laughed: "Unexpectedly, you have become such a person."</p><p></p><p>He reminisced and laughed, then turned and walked towards the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, he was the King of Xin Sai.</p><p></p><p>But this throne was not as lofty as he had imagined, allowing him to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Without the Ruhei Giants, in the era when the bloodline monarchy was terminated, anyone could become the king.</p><p></p><p>Just as Stan Tito had said, if he could not do a good job as the king, others would come to do it.</p><p></p><p>He had just stepped up the stairs and looked up to see the statue of the Xin Sai deity in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky burst forth with dazzling light, rotating and projecting downwards.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the sacred lake, a vast dreamlike starlight poured out from another realm, forming a vortex in the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>A huge door rose up, accompanied by dreamlike colorful light.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"The gate to the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>Heneir looked puzzled, but also pensive.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect that at this moment, the gate to the divine realm would open.</p><p></p><p>But he also looked towards the distant direction of the sea, vaguely guessing something.</p><p></p><p>In front of the gate of the divine realm, as the light gradually faded, a divine messenger in golden robes appeared under the giant door.</p><p></p><p>She stood silently, her gaze towards the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the divine messenger's hand, a beam of light from the divine realm shone upon the mortal world, enveloping the dissolving figure of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's figure re-solidified within the light, looking up at the gate to the divine realm that had opened for him.</p><p></p><p>The ethereal voice of the divine messenger came from the other world, echoing in the realm of Xin Sai.</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you have passed the test, and you will receive the grace you desire."</p><p></p><p>The wind lifted the golden hair of the divine messenger, and the divine dreams painted on her robe transformed into bubble projections of various scenes, such as snowy nights, forests, and weaving kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her, it was as if one was seeing beauty itself, involuntarily evoking a longing in the heart.</p><p></p><p>"And from now on," </p><p></p><p>"the gate to the divine realm will be open to you."</p><p></p><p>"Every Trilobe person and Abyss Dweller who is about to die will embark on a pilgrimage and enter the eternal dreamlike starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Along with their memories, they will forever return toâ€”"</p><p></p><p>"the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the giant gate behind the divine messenger thunderously opened, revealing the world of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The vast and endless dreamlike starry sea, with the sun-like divine cup and the dream-like moon formed by the wisdom crown at the highest point of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>And beneath the starry sea, the legendary land bestowed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only Heniel saw this scene, but all corners with intelligent life were able to witness the opening of the gates to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>[https://]</p><p></p><p>Unknown to how many, their pupils dilated in an instant, left speechless and stunned.</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger, bathed in sacred light, slowly spoke the final words.</p><p></p><p>"The virtuous, eternal dreams."</p><p>"The wicked, fall into the abyss."</p><p></p><p>The city of Anhuo.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ruins and rubble of the city, the sound of mournful weeping could be heard in every corner.</p><p></p><p>Some were aimlessly searching the ruins for the corpses of their loved ones, injured people lay on the square crying in agony, and others sat lifelessly beside the bodies of their loved ones.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the gates of the divine realm thunderously opened in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The light illuminated the darkness and dispersed the gloom.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up in bewilderment, only to find that the bodies of their loved ones were now emitting the light of dreams, with colorful bubbles floating upwards.</p><p></p><p>Within the bubbles, the figures of their loved ones appeared, waving goodbye to them.</p><p></p><p>All the Trilean people who died in this disaster were transformed into swirling memories of dreams, floating towards the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the abyss nation in the deep sea had countless abyss people rise to the surface, looking up at the dreamscape world above the sea of clouds, watching as the divine messenger guided the countless memory dreams towards the grand gates.</p><p></p><p>This scene left all intelligent beings, be they Hinsai or the abyss nation, completely awestruck.</p><p></p><p>"Look!" </p><p>"This is the divine salvation."</p><p></p><p>The people of Anhuo who survived the disaster knelt on the ground, weeping bitterly. The beautiful vision in the sky had given them renewed hope.</p><p></p><p>Before the celestial temple, Heniel was also profoundly shaken by this sight.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that he too had once had such an opportunity.</p><p>He too could have been the one to have the gates of the divine realm opened for him.</p><p></p><p>"Those with the Ruhel mark all had the chance, but only one succeeded in the end."</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger had given everyone the opportunity to renounce, but it was always at the moment when they most needed the power of the Ruhel giant.</p><p></p><p>So the test was not just about the actions, but the heart.</p><p>It was not enough to simply renounce the Ruhel giant, but one had to do so at the time when they could not afford to give it up, choosing the future and light for the Trilean people instead of the powerful destructive force.</p><p></p><p>Among these people, only Stan Tito's heart passed the divine messenger's test.</p><p></p><p>Heniel performed a farewell gesture towards Stan Tito, who was stepping into the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>He drew a few circles in the air, then placed his hand on his chest and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations!"</p><p>"The new saint - Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito floated towards the gates of the divine realm, following the memory dreams of the countless Trilean people into the fantastical star sea.</p><p></p><p>As he stepped into the gates, he found himself in a world completely enveloped in golden light.</p><p></p><p>An endless sea of sunflowers swayed before him, fairies holding hands and singing to welcome his arrival. The sunflowers parted, revealing an ancient sacred golden pyramid at the end of the path.</p><p></p><p>He walked through the golden flower fields, treading the ancient divine-blessed city stones.</p><p></p><p>He saw the legendary Hinsai stele, and the giant statue of the first king Rederiki built by King Yesser.</p><p></p><p>Climbing the stairs, he stood before the grand divine gates.</p><p></p><p>Slowly raising his gaze, his heart raced with excitement.</p><p>For he was about to behold the divine being.</p><p></p><p>However, what he saw was not a divine statue or the mural of Rederiki behind the temple.</p><p></p><p>His vision pierced through to the world beyond, seeing an eternal star that stood outside of the universe and time.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he had fallen into a boundless void, the interstices of the river of time, the crevices beyond the universe.</p><p></p><p>His vision was filled with a dazzling white, yet he heard the voice of the divine messenger Hira.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p>

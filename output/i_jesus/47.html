        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The King of Xin'an, Yali, returned with his royal guards from the Sky Temple, gazing from afar at the vast sea and the magnificent city by the shore. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Although they had recovered the Sky Temple, the City of Divine Descent was still the capital of the Xin'an Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>He relayed the intelligence sent from afar: "Stedian has sent word that the Xilun and Samo clans are in cahoots."</p><p></p><p>"Just as I thought."</p><p></p><p>"The second clan to betray the kingdom is the Samo clan."</p><p></p><p>The minister beside him greatly admired Yali's methods, expressing his allegiance and reverence.</p><p></p><p>"If we can also recapture the Luhu Giant from the Samo clan, the other two royal bloodline clans will have no choice but to fully submit."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Yali's face. Though he did not speak, he was lost in reverie.</p><p></p><p>At that time.</p><p></p><p>He would possess power and glory akin to his grandfather, King Yeser. The entire Xin'an Kingdom would have only one will.</p><p></p><p>That of King Yali himself.</p><p></p><p>"Argh!"</p><p></p><p>A massive beast burst from the ground, splitting the royal guards' formation in two. Over twenty men were caught off guard and fell into the sandy pit.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding guards immediately shouted at the top of their lungs.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"  </p><p></p><p>"Form ranks!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone scattered, surrounding the king and the Luhu Giant.</p><p></p><p>However, what horrified them further was:</p><p></p><p>Another Luhu Giant emerged from the sea, heading towards the king.</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians from both land and sea surrounded them - people from the Xilun and Samo royal bloodline clans.</p><p></p><p>The king calmly engaged the enemy's Luhu Giant while giving orders: New69book.com</p><p></p><p>"Sound the horn."</p><p></p><p>"Let the city guards come out to greet us."</p><p></p><p>The horn blared, signaling to the distant City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need to signal - such a commotion could not have gone unnoticed in the entire city.</p><p></p><p>"The king is under attack."</p><p></p><p>"Open the gates, support King Yali."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone assemble, prepare for battle."</p><p></p><p>Chaos erupted above and below the city walls, with people shouting and running about.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a golden figure descended from above, standing atop the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Its brilliant color and strange divine appearance drew everyone's gaze.</p><p></p><p>He spread his hands, and a golden apparition dozens of meters tall enveloped the area outside the walls, following his movements.</p><p></p><p>The massive illusion had no actual harm but instilled great intimidation in all within the city.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, everyone immediately froze in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers who had intended to charge out retreated in fright, one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He turned back.</p><p></p><p>"This...this..."</p><p></p><p>"Look at the city walls quickly." </p><p></p><p>"What is that thing?"</p><p></p><p>A huge shadow loomed over the City of God's Descent from outside the city.</p><p></p><p>It terrified the guards on the city walls and also caused great panic. </p><p></p><p>People on the streets kept fleeing into the distance: "Run!"</p><p></p><p>The soldiers of the City of God's Descent retreated in fear, or huddled trembling in corners, afraid that the huge shadow would notice them.</p><p></p><p>But several priests of the Yeser family charged out. They looked at Polo.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are you?" </p><p></p><p>The huge shadow opened its mouth and said: "I am the messenger of God!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who abandon the faith in God will eventually suffer divine punishment."</p><p></p><p>The priests did not believe it at all, but the other party's supernatural power had already exceeded their imagination. Even the Yeser king who planted the Sun's Chalice in the past could not achieve such a huge illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"You're fake!"</p><p></p><p>"Fake."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't be afraid of him. The power bestowed by God must be able to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>Several priests summoned soldiers to charge out of the city, while they themselves launched attacks towards Polo.</p><p></p><p>The huge shadow waved its hand, and the power of dreams drifted down from above.</p><p></p><p>"The power bestowed by God?"</p><p></p><p>"The gift God gave me surpasses yours."</p><p></p><p>Swaths of people fell into a daze, hundreds upon hundreds of people collapsed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to approach anymore, as numbers became meaningless in the face of such power.</p><p></p><p>One person.</p><p></p><p>Blocked an entire city, causing thousands upon thousands to lose the courage to resist.</p><p></p><p>No reinforcements came out from the city to rescue Ali, and the King of Heinze was left isolated without aid.</p><p></p><p>Ali gradually fell into a precarious situation amid the siege of the Seron and Samo families, but at this moment, no one could come to his rescue.</p><p></p><p>One Rukh giant against two, this situation was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he felt an intense sense of absurdity in his heart. So quickly, he experienced the feeling of the old priest of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he was being toyed with in the palms of a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>That force was called fate.</p><p></p><p>Or rather.</p><p></p><p>It was the will of God.</p><p></p><p>Ali also noticed the commotion in the City of God's Descent. That huge, unknown shadow blocked the reinforcements from inside the city, completely dashing his hopes.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that the Sky Temple and the Holy Mountain were a dead end, while the City of God's Descent faced the sea.</p><p></p><p>The king waved his scepter, using his most powerful wisdom and power in an all-out strike that blasted one of the Rukh giants in the eye. Meanwhile, the giant Nini under his command immediately forced the other Rukh giant to retreat, fleeing from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As for Ali and the Seron and Samo families...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The royal guards of the warring Ting clan never expected Yali to directly abandon them and leave.</p><p></p><p>"King!"  </p><p>"King!"</p><p>"The God-descended city is over there, over there!"</p><p></p><p>Yali fled. </p><p>He fled back into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Xing stood on the giant's head, looking down at the royal guards below.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xing of the Xilun clan, the bloodline of the king's authority, the new high priestess of the Celestial Temple."</p><p>"The servant of God and the messenger of His will."</p><p>"Your king has lost, surrender!"</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, her demeanor had undergone a tremendous change. Facing so many people, she was not daunted at all. Facing death and crisis, she no longer cried.</p><p></p><p>It has never been time that allows a person to undergo great change, but rather what is lost and gained in the years.</p><p></p><p>-------------------</p><p></p><p>The distant sea.</p><p></p><p>Most fish shoals roam in the warm nearshore waters, here far from land even life begins to become sparse. </p><p></p><p>A group of unexpected guests broke into an abandoned Trifoliate village from decades ago.</p><p></p><p>The one in the lead, wearing a crown, was in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>Since the lost battle of the Wisdom Kingship decades ago, the Kingdom of Hynxai had gradually abandoned its cities in the distant seas. Yali had thought of returning, but never imagined it would be in this way.</p><p></p><p>Yali waited on the sea surface for his two sons, hoping they would bring back the Ruh giant, so he could still change the situation of his defeat.</p><p></p><p>In the end, what he received was the news of one son's death and the other's surrender.</p><p></p><p>"Dandi is dead?"</p><p></p><p>His three sons, their names meaning sky, land, and ocean respectively, also embodied Yali's former ambition.</p><p></p><p>And now the sky and land were gone, leaving only the ocean.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p>"Is it telling me, or mocking me?"</p><p>"Is it saying that the sky and land do not belong to me?"</p><p>"That my destiny is to hide in the cold depths of the sea?"</p><p></p><p>He laughed loudly, no matter how hard he tried, he could not stop the desolation from welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Of the three fusion monsters belonging to the Yeserl clan, only one remained in the end.</p><p></p><p>It was also the one that God originally bestowed upon Yeserl.</p><p></p><p>He gazed unwillingly at the coastline of the land of origin: "My kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Hynxai of King Yeserl, how did it end up in my hands?"</p><p></p><p>Yali could not accept his failure, he had lost his rights, glory, and power.</p><p></p><p>This was more painful for him than losing his life.</p><p></p><p>Turning around, he led his remaining followers into the vastness of the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of King Yeserl retreated back into the ocean.</p><p></p><p>The second Wisdom King Yeserl crossed the sea to come here, found the land of origin where the gods and the first King Redric descended, and laid the foundation for the Kingdom of Hynxai.</p>

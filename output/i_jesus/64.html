        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Tito had lost his eyes, but his ears had become especially acute.</p><p></p><p>"An old man who is about to die," replied the aged Abyss Dweller.</p><p></p><p>The old man wore a stone helmet, so let's just call him the Stone Helmet Old Man.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man took out a decaying cup, but there was still nothing special about it.</p><p></p><p>"This is yours."</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me why you care about it so much? Or does it have some special meaning?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps if I knew, I would let you go."</p><p></p><p>The other party must have been observing him for a long time, only now coming up.</p><p></p><p>Tito weakly raised his head: "Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man: "I am an exiled old man, a wise monster."</p><p></p><p>The other party possessed the power of wisdom, so Tito, no matter how foolish, would not think he was an ordinary person: "Are you also an Abyss Dweller? Why do you call yourself a monster?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man's words were full of indifference, or the wisdom that comes with weathering many storms.</p><p></p><p>"Because when I was born, I was just a monster from the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"They are different, they were already Abyss Dwellers when they were born."</p><p></p><p>Tito gave an ambiguous response: "This is the thing that gives me a mission and guidance."</p><p></p><p>The other party let Tito down and fed him some water or food.</p><p></p><p>Tito finally caught his breath.</p><p></p><p>After resting in the cool corner under the island for a night, he gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>He took the Cup of the Gods back from the Stone Helmet Old Man, and the moment his fingers touched the Cup of the Gods, a light shone in the dark world.</p><p></p><p>The guiding light of the Cup of the Gods was still there, even though he could see nothing else.</p><p></p><p>He stood up.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the sound of the tidal waves, listening to the echoes of the wind whistling through the stone columns.</p><p></p><p>After losing his eyes, he was actually able to better contemplate everything about himself.</p><p></p><p>Why he came here.</p><p></p><p>What he really wanted.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he decided to set out again.</p><p></p><p>He carefully placed the regained Cup of the Gods in his backpack, along with a few broken bone plates and his own carving knife.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man looked at him and asked,</p><p></p><p>"In your current state, do you still want to go and find the God-given land?"</p><p></p><p>This Abyss Dweller was very curious about what was driving Tito to go this far.</p><p></p><p>His perseverance, effort, and fearlessness, where did they come from?</p><p></p><p>Tito immediately became a little defensive: "Do you know what I'm looking for?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man laughed: "I heard everything you said to that little brat."</p><p></p><p>Tito: "You know the lord of the Sala region."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man: "He is my great-grandson."</p><p></p><p>Tito was stunned: "Then why were you exiled?"</p><p></p><p>The other party paused for a moment, then laughed and said,</p><p></p><p>"Abyss Dwellers and Hinsai are different. We revere strength, we despise weakness."</p><p></p><p>"We reproduce quickly, but the food in the sea is limited, and our technology for raising the Progenitor Fish is far behind yours Hinsai, not to mention you also occupy the most abundant nearshore areas, the most suitable for the Progenitor Fish to thrive."</p><p></p><p>"The aging Abyss Dwellers are useless, when they reach a certain age they will leave their homeland on their own, going out to the sea to live and die."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they don't want to leave, they will be driven out of their homeland."</p><p></p><p>Tito: "So you were exiled? By your own people?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man: "In this cruel world, it's not easy to survive."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Helmet Old Man obviously didn't want to continue this topic, and he looked at Tito with interest.</p><p></p><p>"You still haven't answered me, why do you have to go and find the God-given land?"</p><p></p><p>"You've even lost your eyes, why are you still so obsessed?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand the meaning of the mission?" Tito pondered.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet paused for a moment: "I don't quite understand."</p><p></p><p>Tito laughed, the sound mocking his former self.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I don't understand either. I was just spouting pretty words before."</p><p></p><p>"Just..."</p><p></p><p>"The more I spouted pretty words, the more I started to believe them myself."</p><p></p><p>"Shouting that everything is fate, everything is God's guidance, in the end I ended up pushing all my mistakes and faults onto the divine."</p><p></p><p>"I yearned to become a greater poet, yearned for the cheers of others."</p><p></p><p>"I yearned for my name to be recorded in history, so that every person in the future would know me."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet: "So what is this mission?"</p><p></p><p>Tito was also asking himself: "What is the mission?"</p><p></p><p>This time he gave a response, which was also an answer to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The mission is not some supreme honor, nor is it God's guidance."</p><p></p><p>"It is simply what I want to do, what I feel I should do."</p><p></p><p>"Before, I didn't understand. I firmly believed that everything in this world was predestined."</p><p></p><p>"But when I lost everything, I suddenly understood."</p><p></p><p>"I finally understood."</p><p></p><p>"Why did God say those words to Ledelike?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet listened intently, as if he was extremely interested in this kind of thing, because he too was perplexed, and like Tito, he was searching for answers.</p><p></p><p>"What words?"</p><p></p><p>Tito faced the sea and shouldered his backpack again.</p><p></p><p>"God told King Ledelike, 'I am the God who created you, and you are the king of them.'"</p><p></p><p>"God created all things and life, but only gave the Trifoliate people wisdom, because wisdom is the power to break free from fate, wisdom is the miracle of creation."</p><p></p><p>"From that moment on, God let go of the fate of the Trifoliate people."</p><p></p><p>"From that time on, God let go, he told King Ledelike, history will be created by the Trifoliate people themselves."</p><p></p><p>A smile, or rather a sense of ease, appeared on Tito's face.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that we can't let go, we can't bear God's letting go, we don't believe we can create history."</p><p></p><p>"Because we... are really too small."</p><p></p><p>"But God believes that we, the small ones, can create miracles."</p><p></p><p>Tito stepped forward, step by step, into the sea, the water submerging his footsteps.</p><p></p><p>"I no longer crave anything, nor do I wait for the arrangement of fate and the guidance of God."</p><p></p><p>"Because..."</p><p></p><p>"I am creating history, creating my own history."</p><p></p><p>"This is my mission."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Tito's words, the old man in the stone helmet suddenly felt a nameless shock.</p><p></p><p>No passionate enthusiasm, no stirring rhetoric, the calm and direct statement struck the heart more deeply.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the answer he was seeking was right here.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and looked at Tito's back, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Tito."</p><p></p><p>"Do you really believe... in God?"</p><p></p><p>Tito did not answer, but the old man in the stone helmet chased after him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll come with you too!"</p><p></p><p>"I also want to go and see what the kingdom of the divine is like."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to know if we too were once the firstborn of the divine."</p><p></p><p>Tito still did not respond, but the old man in the stone helmet persisted.</p><p></p><p>"The path you are taking will pass through the capital of the Abyss Kingdom, the former city of Yesaer."</p><p></p><p>"Without my guidance and help, you won't be able to cross that place."</p><p></p><p>Tito turned back: "Are you sure you want to go to the land God has blessed? God may not welcome a sinner to enter his paradise."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet: "That's my business."</p><p></p><p>Tito submerged into the sea, and the mysterious old Abyss dweller also followed closely behind him into the deeper parts of the sea.</p><p></p><p>An aged, forsaken sinner, and a poet who had lost his eyes.</p>

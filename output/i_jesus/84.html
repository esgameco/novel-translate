        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky beast of the Xilun family, the burrowing demon worm of the Hosen family. 👌👽➅❾รⒽย𝓍.𝓒ㄖⓜ🐊☞</p><p></p><p>Two mythical life forms of the same clan, two different evolutionary forms, are now engaged in an unrestrained contest in the City of the Descended God, as if they want to prove here which is the correct direction on the evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>The people inside the City of the Descended God have been frightened out of their wits by these two overlord-level monsters, and thousands of people rushed out of their homes, fleeing the city with their belongings.</p><p></p><p>"The south gate is blocked!" The crowd surged in the south, and there were stampedes and fights at the city gate.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly... go to the north!" Someone changed direction.</p><p></p><p>"The monsters have blocked the city, we can't get through, we can't get through!" But when they turned back, they immediately saw the fierce battle of the Luhe giant monster in the middle of the street.</p><p></p><p>"God! Is this the divine punishment You have bestowed?" In front of the broken streets, someone hugged the corpses of their loved ones and wept bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Fire Kingdom, I curse you..." </p><p></p><p>"Why would the gods bestow such monsters, why are there such terrible things in the world." However, they did not realize that when the gods bestowed the Luhe giant monsters, they hoped that the Trifoliate people could use them to build their own cities, using the power of the giants to open up their own homes.</p><p></p><p>Cities like the God-given Land, Yesaer City, the City of the Descended God, etc., were all established by the Luhe giant monsters.</p><p></p><p>It was the Trifoliate people themselves who used this power to slaughter their own kind.</p><p></p><p>The crowds were jammed at each city gate, and the cries, wails, and roars echoed through the streets.</p><p></p><p>The burrowing demon worm tore open the ground and leaped up, biting a large chunk of flesh from the floating sky beast in the low sky, and the viscous, semi-transparent fresh blood rained down like rain. 🍓 ⋆ 🍦🎀𝟨𝟫𝓈𝒽𝓊𝓍.𝒸🌸𝓂🎀🍦 ⋆ 🍓</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The sky beast spewed out a violent wind, with hundreds of tentacles coiling around the body of the burrowing demon worm, preventing it from burrowing back into the ground and trying to drag it out from underground.</p><p></p><p>The burrowing demon worm twisted its massive body, crushing and destroying everything on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom~Boom~Boom~!"</p><p></p><p>As the two Luhe giant monsters grappled, they finally dragged the battlefield to the Yesaer Palace.</p><p></p><p>This ancient and magnificent palace immediately collapsed in a large area, and even the stele of the law code established by the Yesaer King was broken into pieces in the great battle.</p><p></p><p>Prince Weisi Hosen of the Fire Kingdom had no regard for the lives of the civilians in the city, nor did he care about the palace established by the Yesaer King.</p><p></p><p>Born into a royal family, their feelings towards the Yesaer King were conflicted - some revered him greatly, while others despised him.</p><p></p><p>The palace once built by the Yesaer King disappeared in the dust over ten meters high.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xilun saw this scene, and the movements of the sky beast paused.</p><p></p><p>She was completely enraged.</p><p></p><p>The mouth of the sky beast, exhaling the violent wind, let out a voice in which the queen's anger was unmasked.</p><p></p><p>"Hosen family!"</p><p></p><p>"The palace left by the Yesaer King, the great relic of Xingcheng, has been destroyed by you."</p><p></p><p>"Are you still a Xingcheng person, a descendant of King Laideli?"</p><p></p><p>Weisi Hosen sneered, "Wasn't it your Xilun family that ended the rule of the Yesaer family back then? Now you're still pretending to be something?"</p><p></p><p>"Who killed King Ali, who ended the Xingcheng Kingdom. ♔💋➅９𝐒ĤǗ𝐱.ᑕ𝐨м💘💥"</p><p></p><p>"It was you all!"</p><p></p><p>"The Xilun family."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, did you think this City of the Descended God was a legitimate inheritance? Was this palace given to you by the Yesaer family?"</p><p></p><p>Weisi Hosen shamelessly brought up the old events of the past, and his laughter echoed through the entire City of the Descended God.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, the prince had no awe for this ancient king, after all, his ancestors were another child of King Laideli.</p><p></p><p>"It's better that it's gone.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of keeping this palace when the King of Yinxia has long been gone?" </p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm bit through one tentacle after another of the Sky Colossus, while the Sky Colossus' sharp tentacles constantly pierced into the body of the Burrowing Demon Worm, opening up one horrific wound after another on it.</p><p></p><p>The battle was extremely fierce, seemingly a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>But the gazes of the two were always fixed on the group of people running among them - the lord of the Descended City, the high priest of the Yinxia Temple, and a large group of guards all protecting a young man carrying a bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm, in the midst of the tug-of-war, was frantically trying to approach the other side.</p><p></p><p>And the Sky Colossus' tentacles held the Burrowing Demon Worm firmly, not allowing it to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Sky Colossus released its tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm seized this opportunity and immediately burrowed into the ground, approaching the group from underground.</p><p></p><p>But before the Burrowing Demon Worm could emerge from the ground, the Sky Colossus had already glided over, opening its huge mouth as it passed over the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Get on!"</p><p></p><p>The suction wind from the Sky Colossus' mouth swept up the people, swallowing them into its body.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Colossus wrapped these people in its air sac and floated up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>If it were just a battle, neither side could harm the other. One could fly up to the sky, the other could burrow into the ground.</p><p></p><p>But this time was different, they were fighting for the "last chapter" left behind by the great poet Tito, whoever got it first would win.</p><p></p><p>Weis Hausen, merged with the Burrowing Demon Worm, burst out from underground and looked up at the Sky Colossus floating higher.</p><p></p><p>He knew he had lost.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Colossus had retrieved the people and also obtained Tito's bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>But it did not leave, and kept extending its tentacles to attack the Burrowing Demon Worm.</p><p></p><p>As the other side firmly held him back, Weis Hausen also sensed the crisis.</p><p></p><p>The prince immediately guessed what it was.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>"The second giant monster from the Sky Temple is coming."</p><p></p><p>The seven Ruhk Giants, the Star Kingdom, the Samo Kingdom, and the Volcano Kingdom each had two, and the weakest was the Sele Kingdom, which only had one Ruhk Giant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Weis Hausen had no intention of staying.</p><p></p><p>He immediately controlled the Burrowing Demon Worm to burrow back into the ground, leaving behind a terrifying pit and cave, and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Dozens of kilometers outside the Descended City.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm broke through the desert and emerged, and the prince also had the Burrowing Demon Worm release its grip on him, stepping down to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This place was not far from Tito Town, and from the high ground one could see the prosperous town in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Weis Hausen looked at the distant Tito Town, taking out his piece of bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>How overjoyed he was when he obtained it, and now how resentful he felt.</p><p></p><p>"What have I really gained? Or have I lost?"</p><p></p><p>Weis Hausen's mind repeatedly recalled that sentence: "It is destined that you will not obtain it."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but mutter it over and over again, and with each repetition the hatred sank deeper into his bones.</p><p></p><p>"It is destined that I will not obtain it."</p><p>"It is destined that I will not obtain it."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>He hated the person who said this to the extreme, more than he had ever hated anyone in his life, and this sentence was the most malicious he had ever heard.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>"You damned thing, it's all your fault."</p><p>"It's all your fault!"</p><p></p><p>But no matter how furious and frantic he became, it could not change anything.</p><p></p><p>He turned around dejectedly and set off on his way.</p><p></p><p>He had already foreseen that upon returning, what awaited him would not be cheers and glory, but a sea of ridicule and mockery.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Kingdom."</p>

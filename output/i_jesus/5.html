        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou placed his hand on the giant eye of the fusion monster, as if adhering to an enormous cold crystal. His will extended through the pupil, and he commanded in an imperative tone:</p><p></p><p>"Shed your shell for me!"  </p><p></p><p>One tentacle after another extended from beneath the coiled abdomen, gradually lifting the shell off its back.</p><p></p><p>The enormous shell was even larger than the temple, placed on the steps in front of it. </p><p></p><p>The fusion monster crouched beneath, as if offering a gift to a deity.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou originally just wanted to touch this shell, but he found that after his hand made contact, the shell actually began floating up.</p><p></p><p>With a shift of his thoughts, the shell floated higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>He could control this thing.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou felt like he had found a great toy, this was the first time he could touch and directly manipulate something, as if it were a part of his own body, going wherever he willed it.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou tried moving other things but found it had no effect. </p><p></p><p>The only thing he could move was this shell.</p><p></p><p>Finally, following his thoughts, the huge shell continuously shrank.</p><p></p><p>When he held it in his hand, this shell was like a horn.</p><p></p><p>As if blowing it would play the melody of life.</p><p></p><p>This truly was...</p><p></p><p>A miracle.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou gained an initial understanding of these mythical creations: "They can be controlled from a distance and change size."</p><p></p><p>"Things imbued with my power are no longer bound by scientific laws," Yin Shenshou guessed.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Trifolians was not just this, there should be even more undiscovered abilities and uses.</p><p></p><p>But how to use his own power to imbue other things, giving them mythical power, Yin Shenshou still did not understand the key.</p><p></p><p>He was imprisoned in the crevice of space-time, only able to anchor himself and this universe through the Trifolian Leadley and the fusion monster. His preliminary plan was to create more Trifolians, to see if he could form more anchors.</p><p></p><p>If he could regain a physical body, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Living like a stray ghost was truly too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou held the shell and stood up.</p><p></p><p>He saw the fusion monster watching him. Without its shell, the fusion monster looked even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenshou looked at the fusion monster: "Since you can change your form, transform into a shape that looks more comfortable!"</p><p></p><p>"This appearance is quite frightening too."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even though there was only Yinshen at the moment, the fusion monster could not scare him.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a bit too ugly.</p><p></p><p>The huge fusion monster sensed Yinshen's emotions, and its meat mountain-like body squeezed inwards from the middle. </p><p></p><p>Its size became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of eyes continuously retracted and twisted inwards, gradually transforming into a human shape.</p><p></p><p>The dense mass of tentacles bundled up, becoming two legs just like Yinshen's.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster transformed into a little girl wearing a white gauzy cloak, with green eyes, brown hair, bare feet, and pinkish nails. </p><p></p><p>That gauzy cloak-like outer garment was very flowy, tightly wrapping her petite body.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, it seemed that rather than clothing, it was more like an umbrella-like thing that grew directly out of her body, similar to a jellyfish.</p><p></p><p>Having transformed into a human shape, she no longer felt like an object.</p><p></p><p>He had given Sanyearen a name, so naturally he would not play favorites, and was prepared to give this life form, born together with Sanyearen, a name as well.</p><p></p><p>"Sali!"  </p><p>"From now on, you'll be called Sali!"</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster Sali sat beside the god's statue, snuggling up to the god's statue. Having been given a name, she did not show the same excitement as Redleiki, or rather, she simply did not understand the difference between the names "fusion monster" and "Lisa."</p><p></p><p>As she swung her legs, her mouth made a sound like blowing bubbles.</p><p>"Gulu gulu!"</p><p></p><p>Just like a fish blowing bubbles while chasing after them, her hollow eyes lacked any luster.</p><p></p><p>---------------------</p><p></p><p>The mythical shell that Yinshen called the "biological tool machine" was soaked in seawater, with only the top part exposed, forming a reef.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one big and one small, sat on this reef.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen's gaze was fixed on the lives being born, nurtured, and then immediately dying within the shell.</p><p></p><p>The emotions in his pupils went from anticipation to surprise, and finally ended in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen said to the fusion monster Sali playing in the water beside him: "Failed again."</p><p></p><p>"Sali, you're simply a black-hearted lottery game merchant, the odds are too low."</p><p></p><p>Sali kicked her little legs, swishing the seawater around.</p><p></p><p>If not given a command, it was as if she could not hear Yinshen speaking.</p><p></p><p>Even if she understood, she probably would not comprehend the meanings of words like "black-hearted", "lottery", and "merchant".</p><p></p><p>Yinshen then continued operating the mythical shell, starting another round of experiments and attempts.</p><p></p><p>One failed product after another was manufactured, birthed</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Life was transformed into dead matter, or perhaps just a mindless insect. </p><p></p><p>These things were then transformed into nutrients and devoured by this shell, to begin anew the process of producing the eggs of the Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>No one knows how many times it failed, trying countless wrong methods.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose and fell, in endless cycles. </p><p></p><p>While the isolated island and the ocean remained forever unchanging, as if to persist until the end of time.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin finally succeeded, his success would shatter the unchanging nature of this world.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>From the huge shell rolled out one transparent insect egg after another, floating up from the sea water to the surface, refracting the sunlight like brilliant gems.</p><p></p><p>This was the miracle of life, and the birth of a new species. </p><p></p><p>"Goo roo roo!" The fusion monster Sarie let out a cheer.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing if it was because she sensed Lord Yin's ecstatic joy, or because of those Trifolian eggs on the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>Redrick, who had recently been carving stones in the temple while learning to wield the divine language, also sensed the commotion and rushed to the seaside.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin stood on the island, gazing at that newborn life.</p><p></p><p>And Redrick stood behind him, disbelieving as he looked at the life floating on the ocean - these were Trifolians like himself.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin turned around, smiling at him.</p><p></p><p>"Success, Redrick."</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"Have companions now."  </p><p></p><p>Redrick's gaze was blank, he was no longer alone.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was strange, a strong wave of emotion resonating in his chest.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a race."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Redrick also felt a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have a race, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>His speech had improved.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin smiled: "You shall be their king, you should lead them to multiply and eventually establish a civilization."</p><p></p><p>"A civilization belonging to you, belonging to the Trifolians."</p><p></p><p>Redrick looked bewildered: "What is civilization?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin gazed at the ocean: "Having your own writing, your own art, the power to transform and understand the world, a collective created and crystallized by a group of intelligent life."  </p><p></p><p>"It could be a city-state, or a nation."</p><p></p><p>"As for how to go about it, that is for you to decide."</p><p></p><p>Redrick looked at Lord Yin's back: "Will the Lord not teach me? Or will you create this civilization yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"I will listen to everything you say, Lord."</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin shook his head: "I am the god who created you!"</p><p></p><p>"And you..."</p>

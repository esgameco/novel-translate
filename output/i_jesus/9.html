        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The lively ancestor fish were jumping around in the hands of Laidlike's several sons. Laidlike stood in front of the palace, maintaining his dignity. </p><p></p><p>But his sons could not wait to announce to the citizens of the God-given city, standing high and shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Look! This is the food bestowed upon us by God!"  </p><p></p><p>"The ancestor fish!"</p><p></p><p>Laidlike's eldest son held up the ancestor fish, bent down and looked at everyone with inspiring eyes, uttering extremely shocking words from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"God has also taught the great Wisdom King the method of creating food, so in the future we will have an endless supply of food."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards."  </p><p></p><p>"The God-given city will no longer have anyone starve to death, nor will anyone need to venture into the deep sea at risk."</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, he raised the ancestor fish high and knelt towards the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>With both hands raised high, he kissed the ground.</p><p></p><p>His demeanor was almost frantic.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike's second son rushed down from the stage: "God created the Wisdom King, created us, and also created food that only the Wisdom King's clan can enjoy."</p><p></p><p>"God is the supreme ruler who created all things in the world, and the Wisdom King is the unparalleled king of all wise beings."</p><p></p><p>"We are the destined race that rules the land and oceans, the eldest son of God."</p><p></p><p>"Only God and the Wisdom King can guide us and bring us light."</p><p></p><p>They roared and raised their arms, their voices deafeningly loud.</p><p></p><p>Recently, some people had begun to question the authority of the Wisdom King and the power of God. A few wanted to leave the God-given city to seek a way out, and their status was thus threatened.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wisdom King Laidlike had a mind that could control the power of all Trifolians, he clearly did not wish to directly enslave all Trifolians in this way, just as God did not forcibly impose His will.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike's sons were eager to announce such a shocking message, to let everyone know the majesty of God's power to create all things, as well as the identity of the Wisdom King as God's proxy.</p><p></p><p>They were also asserting their own rights and status.</p><p></p><p>They were the sons of the Wisdom King, born to replace God and the Wisdom King in ruling over all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Outside the crude stone buildings, Trifolians crowded around, their exoskeletons of varying depths of color and heights. Men and women formed separate groups on either side in front of the Wisdom King's palace.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>All the Trifolians looked up at the King of Wisdom, and at the divine gift. </p><p></p><p>Under the sunlight, the ancestral fish refracted and emanated radiance.</p><p></p><p>Leadley finally spoke at this moment, appearing more composed and steady than his sons. </p><p></p><p>In some ways, he had always been imitating his creator, as if a highly exalted person should speak this way, making his words more convincing.</p><p></p><p>"We are the race beloved by God!"</p><p></p><p>"This world, be it land or ocean, has no difficulty that can defeat us."</p><p></p><p>"We are destined to become the most brilliant civilization, shining forever under the stars."</p><p></p><p>Explosive cheers arose from the crowd, the clamor overturning the entire divine city, even reaching the pyramid temple. New69bookbar.com</p><p></p><p>"Praise the god!"  </p><p></p><p>"The King of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing can defeat us."</p><p></p><p>"We will eventually dispel all darkness, conquer the seas..."</p><p></p><p>This time, all Trifolians felt the greatness of God.  </p><p></p><p>Hope surged on everyone's faces.</p><p></p><p>Large areas of the island were marshes, with things growing in the swamps, and moss covering the edges.</p><p></p><p>Some of these marshes connected directly to the sea, while others were independent, changing with the tides.</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians of the divine city gathered by these marshes, carrying one large stone basin after another, filled with ancestral fish of all sizes thrashing and splashing water.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swash!"</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians poured the ancestral fish into a marsh, drenching many people present, but everyone laughed heartily, no longer silent and gloomy as before.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, hurry!"</p><p></p><p>"Over there too!"</p><p></p><p>Then they blocked the tide-connected area with stones, enclosing this place.</p><p></p><p>"Will they multiply just by pouring them in?"</p><p></p><p>"The King of Wisdom said so."</p><p></p><p>"This is the divine gift and the divinely bestowed method."</p><p></p><p>When the King of Wisdom Leadley came over, everyone knelt to welcome him, lining up in a row facing the marsh and shore.  </p><p></p><p>Leadley's gaze fell on his several sons, their eyes full of expectation, hoping Leadley would choose them.</p><p></p><p>This was an even greater position than other rights, controlling the divinely gifted ancestral fish meant controlling the entire divine city's food supply.</p><p></p><p>But the King of Wisdom finally looked towards his eldest daughter, who had the same...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With pale white exoskeletons and slender, elongated bodies just the same. </p><p></p><p>"From today onwards."</p><p></p><p>"You are responsible for guarding and caring for the primordial fish. They are our food and the future bestowed by the divine land."</p><p></p><p>She looked at the King of Wisdom with delight, then knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Great King of Wisdom!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely protect these primordial fish well and complete the duty you have entrusted me with."</p><p></p><p>From then on.</p><p></p><p>The female trifolians also began to take control of authority. </p><p></p><p>A large number of female trifolians followed the eldest daughter of the King of Wisdom, caring for and cultivating the primordial fish in the marshes. Most of the time they would submerge themselves in the water, observing the schools of fish underwater.</p><p></p><p>Just like shepherds driving a flock of sheep.</p><p></p><p>The female trifolians first cultivated these primordial fish in the marshes on the island. They fed the primordial fish according to the methods taught by the God Yin, caring for them according to the habits of the primordial fish.</p><p></p><p>They watched as the primordial fish began to reproduce, becoming more and more numerous,</p><p></p><p>As if replicating endlessly, continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the trifolians, this method of cultivating primordial fish contained infinite secrets - the supreme, almighty power of the divine.</p><p></p><p>They mastered the knowledge imparted by the divine and grasped the power to reproduce and control life.</p><p></p><p>The divine changed their way of living by hunting and gathering. From then on, they truly controlled the way of existence in this world.</p><p></p><p>The eldest daughter of Laidlike stood by the marsh surrounded by stones, watching one primordial fish after another being pulled up, exuding the vitality of life.</p><p></p><p>All the trifolians cheered joyfully for the bountiful harvest, the shore by the marsh becoming a scene of revelry.</p><p></p><p>A white female trifolian marveled: "Life is truly filled with miracles!"</p><p></p><p>"Yet the divine can so easily create and bestow such miracles - what an inconceivable power."</p><p></p><p>Through this, they finally broke free from the plight of food scarcity.</p><p></p><p>They lived in the city bestowed by the divine, subsisting on cultivated fish, and worshipping Laidlike.</p><p></p><p>This place was indeed the land bestowed by the divine, the place blessed by the divine, just as the King of Wisdom had said.</p><p></p><p>-------------------</p><p></p><p>In the marsh.</p><p></p><p>A few primordial fish swam freely, foraging for tiny creatures in the mud as food.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly headed towards the depths, astonishingly discovering a cave leading to the ocean.</p><p></p><p>"Glub!"</p><p></p><p>Bubbles floated up as the leading fish burrowed into the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>The primordial fish left the marsh, venturing deep into the vast ocean.</p>

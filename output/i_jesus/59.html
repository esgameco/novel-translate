        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next day. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The poet Tito came to the seaside manor with a bone tablet carved full of Hinsai script, eagerly awaiting the queen's judgment of his poetry.</p><p></p><p>Alas.</p><p></p><p>When he pushed open the door, he did not see the queen waiting for him, but instead saw the Queen Mother lying asleep in the flower field.</p><p></p><p>Tito was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Queen was lying quietly in the flower field, with the divine messenger Baro embracing her and sitting in the middle of the flower field. A cluster of sunflowers swayed around Baro, as if comforting him.</p><p></p><p>"Queen of the Stars," </p><p></p><p>"Is she dead?"</p><p></p><p>Tito blurted out these words, then panicked and knelt on the ground, kissing the earth. </p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the passing of a monarch, the last Queen of Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>Baro sensed Tito's panic, and looking at the Queen's closed eyes, said to Tito:</p><p></p><p>"You need not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone must depart, the Queen of the Stars is no exception."</p><p></p><p>Baro's words were ethereal, as if echoing directly in one's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The gods have said -</p><p></p><p>"Even the sun in the heavens will one day be extinguished, and the universe is inevitably headed towards destruction. </p><p></p><p>"Aside from the great deities, who can truly aspire to eternal life?"</p><p></p><p>This passage was not unfamiliar to Tito, as it was also recorded in the Laideli Oath, which every Trifoliate person raised in the Hinsai kingdom had at least heard of, even if they couldn't recite it.</p><p></p><p>Baro continued embracing the Queen, but suddenly a crack appeared on his face, like shattered ceramic.</p><p></p><p>Tito noticed that from Baro's neck to his face, there were cracks covering him.</p><p></p><p>He anxiously asked, "Divine Messenger Baro, sir, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Baro had been immersed in the scene of the Queen's death, and only reacted when Tito spoke. </p><p></p><p>He touched his own face, and a look of sudden realization appeared.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood the sound of shattering he had heard the day before.</p><p></p><p>Baro's expression gradually turned to contentment, then a touch of sorrow welled up at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>This was an expression that did not belong to a dream fairy, much less to Baro.</p><p></p><p>"It was just a dream."</p><p></p><p>"I have awoken."</p><p></p><p>In this final moment, Baro suddenly discovered another secret of the dream fairies.</p><p></p><p>The power of the dream fairies comes from dreams, or rather, from their own psyche. </p><p></p><p>They possess pure souls, as well as long lifespans. They drift between reality and illusion, embarking on an eternal, joyful, and endless dream journey.</p><p></p><p>But when their souls are no longer pure, or when they abandon dreaming, that is when the dream ends.</p><p></p><p>And the dream has ended.</p><p></p><p>It is also the moment when their lives come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Baro had originally wanted to go see the deities himself, but found that he could no longer even stand up. His dream was shattering bit by bit, and the dream fairy was dissipating along with his dream.</p><p></p><p>He looked over at Tito and suddenly asked, "Have you finished writing your 'Epic of Hinsai'?"</p><p></p><p>Tito hurriedly took out his bone tablet and handed it to Baro.</p><p></p><p>"I've finished it. I came today to have the Queen Mother review it."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined... I really never imagined this."</p><p></p><p>Baro kindly asked, "May I take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Tito nodded, "Of course, Divine Messenger Baro."</p><p></p><p>Baro took the thin stack of bone tablets from Tito's hand and looked at the Hinsai epic recorded on them. </p><p></p><p>As his gaze swept over it, he found that the story began with the tale of King Yesaer, and opened with the expulsion of the Trifoliate people from the divine garden of pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When seeing some brilliant passages, I even started chanting along with them.</p><p></p><p>[King Yesaer sought the forgiveness of God, and the merciful God bestowed the Cup of the Sun.]</p><p></p><p>[Even though God had driven away the lineage of His firstborn from the Garden of Eden, God still cared for the descendants of Lederiki.]</p><p></p><p>[......] </p><p></p><p>[But this thing called the Cup of the Sun also warned the people of the Kingdom of Xinsai, its power was like the sun in the sky.]</p><p></p><p>[It can nurture life, but it can also bring disaster.]</p><p></p><p>[Alas.]</p><p></p><p>[King Yesaer did not understand the benevolence and implication of God.]</p><p></p><p>Flipping through the bone tablets, the story gradually revealed the stars, and also his name.</p><p></p><p>Bolo's movements became gentler, his gaze slowed down, carefully looking at every sentence Tito wrote, even every word.</p><p></p><p>Until, the last bone tablet was flipped through.</p><p></p><p>Bolo raised his head and said with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Well written, and very fair."</p><p></p><p>"No embellishment, no praise, but also no disparagement."</p><p></p><p>"Very real, this is the story of me and the Star."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the messenger of God praise him so, Tito's heart was stirred: "I dare not accept such high praise from the messenger of God."</p><p></p><p>Bolo continued: "Would you like to write a story about King Lederiki?"</p><p></p><p>"The origin of the Kingdom of Xinsai, and the epic of the birth of the Trifoliate people."</p><p></p><p>"About the great God of Xinsai and the mythology of Lederiki, the origin of everything, and the covenant between God and man."</p><p></p><p>Tito suddenly stood up, his pupils not just dilated, but even trembling.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to, he had been dreaming about it.</p><p></p><p>But he did not believe he could do it.</p><p></p><p>He was just a scholar of the Kingdom of Xing, not one of those legendary heroes, nor a noble prince.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement, a look of hesitation appeared in Tito's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How could I possibly do that."</p><p></p><p>"Everything has long been buried in the dust, we don't even have any records of what happened back then."</p><p></p><p>"I've never even seen the Garden of Eden, nor do I know what the God-given city looks like."</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>He could think of a thousand reasons to prove that he could not do it.</p><p></p><p>Bolo told Tito: "Then go take a look at the true God-given land!"</p><p></p><p>"Go worship the immortal relics left by the King of Wisdom, go to the temple built by Lederiki for the gods and witness the divine."</p><p></p><p>Tito was completely stunned, he was trembling all over just standing there.</p><p></p><p>He took a few steps forward, unconsciously reaching out his hand towards the messenger of God Bolo.</p><p></p><p>But then he felt like he was violating some taboo, and quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>He kept waving his hand, avoiding eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is impossible, I'm just a humble mortal."</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, there was a flame burning fiercely, ignited by Bolo.</p><p></p><p>Bolo affirmed: "You can do it, aren't you a believer in fate?"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't come here for no reason, you once said it was fate that arranged for you to meet me and the Star."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is accidental, everything is predestined."</p><p></p><p>"Because everything -"</p><p></p><p>Without Bolo finishing, Tito said the rest of the sentence himself: "is guided by God."</p><p></p><p>Tito's heart had a thousand reasons to believe he could not do it, but Bolo gave him one reason.</p><p></p><p>A reason that he could not refuse no matter what.</p><p></p><p>A reason that was worth sacrificing everything for.</p><p></p><p>Bolo laughed: "Good."</p><p></p><p>"Tito."</p><p></p><p>"Go find the legendary Garden of Eden, I will leave something behind to guide you towards the kingdom of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Pyramid Temple, witness the eternal Xinsai."</p><p></p><p>"And then."</p><p></p><p>"Offer my final gift to the divine."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The commotion caused by the mutated desert worm crossing the border of the Star Kingdom was immense, with several cities suffering catastrophic disasters, as by the time they saw it, it was too late to flee from the cities.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the villagers outside the cities saw it and immediately scattered and fled, with not too many casualties.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the City of the Divine Servants also received the news, and even the details of what happened in Anhuo were conveyed to Heniel's ears.</p><p></p><p>The divine arts of the Star Queen made the transmission of information particularly convenient and fast.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, there were only Heniel, the palace minister, and a few attendants. Heniel dismissed the messenger attendant and walked to the window with the palace minister.</p><p></p><p>Heniel was not a king who particularly liked pomp and circumstance. He would only summon a few ministers to a quiet place to discuss state affairs.</p><p></p><p>"The king of the Samo Kingdom and the first heir to the throne, Saliman, are dead."</p><p></p><p>"Along with the entire Samo Kingdom priesthood, even nearly half the people of Anhuo City were killed by the strange powers of the desert worm."</p><p></p><p>"And now..."</p><p></p><p>"This supposedly human-speaking crazy bug has already crossed the border, and its direction is just right towards the Holy Mountain and the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>In the entire city of Anhuo, countless people had seen the human faces emerging from the desert worm, and the voices of the king and Princess Saliman were heard by many.</p><p></p><p>There were not a few clever people, and many of the nobles had guessed what was going on, and they even knew some of the secrets about the Samo family's immortality techniques.</p><p></p><p>And these clever people had mostly already established contact with the Heniel dynasty even before the Samo Kingdom showed signs of decline.</p><p></p><p>Heniel, holding the scepter of Hinsai, let out a long sigh, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether it was out of disdain or sigh.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the plan I chose, which had the smallest casualties and was the most secure, has instead completely driven the Samo family's king insane."</p><p></p><p>"Let him do what crazy things."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he didn't succeed, but ran into some unexpected trouble. A new era is coming."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Heniel saw at a glance that the desert worm was heading straight for the Sky Temple and the City of the Divine Servants, or rather, it was coming for him.</p><p></p><p>After some consideration, he issued his own orders.</p><p></p><p>"Have the people of the City of the Divine Servants and the three guard cities, towns, and fishing villages at the foot of the mountain evacuate quickly, the desert worm is coming to fight me to the death."</p><p></p><p>"And the strongest place for the sea demons of Sele is the Holy Lake, so I must be there to have the advantage."</p><p></p><p>The palace minister asked Heniel, "Your Majesty! Are you not leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel smiled, "It's coming for me, I can't avoid it, and I don't want to avoid it either."</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait for it here and have a fair and square battle with it."</p><p></p><p>"If this disaster is not resolved, we will never have peace."</p><p></p><p>The king, who was called the Black Swamp, looked out the window, with the sun slanting across his body.</p><p></p><p>Half was brilliant light, half was the darkness of shadow.</p><p></p><p>"If I win, I will be the king of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>"If I lose..."</p><p></p><p>He laughed, "You can just say it's the will of the gods!"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Swamp has destroyed the authority of the royal family dynasty of hundreds of years, and it has also brought punishment."</p><p></p><p>"The new king of light, stepping on my corpse, will become the new ruler of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at the palace minister and laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"See?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you all used to using the name of the gods this way?"</p><p></p><p>The palace minister heard this and was filled with fear, his body involuntarily trembling.</p><p></p><p>He immediately knelt on the ground and expressed his loyalty, "Your Majesty! We are willing to stay and defend the City of the Divine Servants."</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to fight alongside you to the very end, even if death cannot make us retreat."</p><p></p><p>Heniel smiled at the minister and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a mortal war, my palace minister."</p><p></p><p>"Nor is it a war between me and the Samo family."</p><p></p><p>"This is a war of mythology, the final battle between the giants."</p><p></p><p>"It is the reclamation of the grace bestowed by King Laidligi, the complete loss of grace by the sons of the First King."</p><p></p><p>He also vaguely sensed that the era of the giants would come to a complete end in this battle.</p><p></p><p>Whether he won or lost.</p><p></p><p>The era of the three-leaf people controlling the giants roaming the land and the sea would be gone forever.</p><p></p><p>The people of the City of the Divine Servants were lining up and descending from the Holy Mountain, reluctantly looking back at the mountaintop as they left their homes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As he looked out, they did not know if their home would still be there the next time they returned.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even know if the Heniel Dynasty would still be there the next time they came back.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate and vast land, there was a throng of people migrating and retreating.</p><p></p><p>The bustling and prosperous City of the Servants and the entire area at the foot of the Sacred Mountain had gradually become quiet.</p><p></p><p>Only Heniel remained, sitting alone on the throne.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the scepter of Hinsai tightly in both hands, his gaze fixed intently on the palace gates.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had completely lost their focus; he was not looking at anything, but was immersed in his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He had spent his entire life doing everything in his power to climb to the top, using any means necessary to become the one standing at the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>And now, with the passing of the King of the Samo family, he had already reached the highest peak.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"I've finally reached the summit, so what now?"</p><p></p><p>"Will I fall from the peak, or create a new brilliance?"</p><p></p><p>He straightened up, and the tense, upright posture of his waist finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He leaned back on the throne, even setting the scepter aside.</p><p></p><p>Night had fallen, and the moon had risen in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a deep roar could be heard, the frenzied howl audible even dozens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"It's here!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel stood beneath the Sky God Temple, with the Burrowing Demons circling around him and the Selere Sea Monsters emerging from the Sacred Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm sensed the presence of the Burrowing Demons and knew that wherever they were, Heniel must be there as well.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you... I'll kill you... Kill..."</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm roared in fury, its hundreds of horrifying eyes emitting distorted beams of light.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, they tore through the night sky like pillars of light.</p><p></p><p>It attacked the Sacred Mountain, crushing the stairs and forcefully pushing its way up.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel waved his hand, and the Burrowing Demons leaped down from above.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demons crashed into the Desert Worm, knocking it back down the mountain stairs.</p><p></p><p>The two monstrous insects grappled with each other, plunging into the Sacred Lake.</p><p></p><p>The Selere Sea Monster also immediately burst out from the surface of the lake, its hard, thick "helmet" striking the Desert Worm's body with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Desert Worm sustain heavy injuries, its blood spraying and half of its body deflating, the horrifying eyes on its surface also burst open, spewing out a jade-green liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Woo!"</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm let out a pained roar, but as it did so, the wounds on its body were rapidly healing.</p><p></p><p>Heniel furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>These monstrous beings were such that they could not be killed, not even in battles between giants.</p><p></p><p>And the one he was facing now was a giant that did not require the Ruhe brand to act on its own.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>At the shore of the Sacred Lake in the distance, another figure appeared, the sound of its footsteps becoming clearer as it approached.</p><p></p><p>Heniel looked at the appearance of the Moon Fern, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, through the moonlight, he saw a familiar figure standing on the spore, and his gaze immediately lit up with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Heniel couldn't help but call out loudly, "Look who I see? Isn't this the clumsy craftsman from the City of the Descended?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Titov calmly responded, "Heniel."</p><p></p><p>Heniel took a step towards the edge of the cliff, his voice transmitted through the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"I told you before."</p><p></p><p>"A person like you won't be a craftsman for the rest of your life."</p><p></p><p>"I also said that I would wait for you at the Sky God Temple."</p><p></p><p>"See?"</p><p></p><p>"You've come back."</p><p></p><p>This time, Stan Titov did not show any rejection or disgust, he only said calmly,</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to disperse everyone and choose to face this alone."</p><p></p><p>"In this regard, you have the bearing of a true king."</p><p></p><p>"If you hadn't committed those acts of betrayal and conspiracy, if you had been loyal to the Queen, I would have been willing to be your friend."</p><p></p><p>Heniel: "But now..."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you here to fight alongside me?"</p><p></p><p>"This is what you call fate!"</p><p></p><p>"Stan Titov, you are indeed a being who has descended into this world with a mission."</p><p></p><p>Stan Titov did not say anything more, but immediately joined the battle, this time coming to decisively resolve the rampaging and indiscriminately killing Desert Worm.</p><p></p><p>The two of them joined forces, and the three monstrous beings of different forms and the mutated Desert Worm engaged in a siege battle in the Sacred Lake.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the sacred mountain, countless people were gazing into the distance, waiting for the return of someone they had already heard news about.</p><p></p><p>When a dust-covered caravan finally appeared at the end of the desolate land, the crowd immediately became excited and rushed towards the front.</p><p></p><p>They went out to welcome the arrival of the caravan from afar, and only stepped aside to let the caravan pass when it approached, kneeling down on both sides of the road.</p><p></p><p>They kissed the ground, reciting the Lederiki Oath with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, no one spoke loudly, only the sound of devout prayer could be heard.</p><p></p><p>It was a scene of peculiar tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Among the escort was the blind poet Tito, who was carrying the Lederiki royal stone tablet in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The guards surrounding Tito and the stone tablet stopped at the foot of the sacred mountain, and only Tito alone stepped onto the path leading to the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>The poet climbed the first step, looking up.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual senses could not reach the scene up high, but the image had already emerged in his memory - the majestic city of the divine servants and the towering temple, with the blue sky as the backdrop and white clouds swirling around.</p><p></p><p>The poet felt incredibly at ease, even letting out a long sigh, and thought to himself, "Ah! I have finally returned."</p><p></p><p>The stairs leading to the pilgrimage were lined with guards holding long spears, standing on both sides all the way up to the highest point of the city of the divine servants, kneeling with their hands clasped to their chests.</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm Kingdom had launched a grand ceremony and ritual to welcome the return of the poet from the land bestowed by the gods, as well as the arrival of the Lederiki royal stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The poet stepped up towards the heights.</p><p></p><p>He entered the city of the divine servants, and all the servants of the gods knelt down reverently.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Sky Temple, and even the queen and the priests bowed their heads on both sides.</p><p></p><p>He placed the broken stone tablet and his completed "Ode to the Wise King" into the Sky Temple, which would become the sacred relics to be passed down through generations.</p><p></p><p>After placing the sacred objects, the poet turned around to find the kneeling priests rising to their feet.</p><p></p><p>The queen of the Star Realm Kingdom, who was also the high priestess of the Sky Temple, walked up to him holding a scepter and blessed him.</p><p></p><p>"Glory be upon you, this has been a great journey, and all will remember your achievements, you and your mythical epic will be immortalized."</p><p></p><p>"Tito, what do you wish for?"</p><p></p><p>Tito shook his head, "No need, Your Majesty. What I wanted, I have already obtained on this journey. I only hope that the 'Ode to the Wise King' will be widely circulated, and that all the people of Hinsai will know where we come from and why we exist. I hope that everyone will remember our glory, and the blessings and power given to us by the divine."</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm Queen said, "This great poem, the myths of Hinsai and the Lederiki King, will surely be passed down eternally in the kingdom of Hinsai and the world."</p><p></p><p>Tito nodded, bid farewell to the queen and the once high-ranking priests, and headed straight back to his home, without even a thought of attending the feast and celebrations.</p><p></p><p>At home, his aged father was sitting on a stone bench, looking outside. Hearing the commotion, he immediately stood up excitedly, then sat back down, trying to appear calm. But Tito's spiritual senses could see it all.</p><p></p><p>Tito could imagine how his father had been eagerly awaiting his return, day after day, night after night.</p><p></p><p>Tito's eyes instantly welled up with tears. "Father!"</p><p></p><p>The aged father stood up and looked at Tito, gently touching the scars on his face. "You've finally returned."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've suffered a lot."</p><p></p><p>Tito nodded. "Father, you're right. When I fell into the abyss, when I faced death and the loss of everything, I once said a sentence that I would never regret..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How ridiculous it is," the young poet laughed as he looked at his father.</p><p></p><p>"At the time, I regretted it, I even cursed and lamented, exposing my ugly side," the poet said.</p><p></p><p>The elderly father replied, "But you emerged from the suffering and accomplished this seemingly impossible feat."</p><p></p><p>The poet stood up and embraced his father.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight from outside streamed in, and the light and shadows changed as the sun moved.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the moon appeared outside the window, and the bustling city became quiet.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon rotated, one after another.</p><p></p><p>The furnishings in the room changed several times.</p><p></p><p>The poet went from being called "father" by others to having children call him "father."</p><p></p><p>The poet leaned over the desk, carving something on a bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>This was not a poem, but a record of his journey.</p><p></p><p>He had written myths, epics, and tales of heroes.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he wrote a story of his own.</p><p></p><p>In the story, there was the cruel Lord of Salah, the wise old man in the stone helmet, the king of the Abyss Kingdom, the divine land blessed with sunflowers, and the magnificent sacred temple shrouded in dreams.</p><p></p><p>In the story, he wrote down secrets he had never shared with anyone else.</p><p></p><p>His journey was not only to find the divine land, but also to escort the sacred vessel, the Cup of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of thin bone tablets were strung together, and he wrote four words on the front:</p><p></p><p>"The Travels of Tito"</p><p></p><p>He carefully placed it on the shelf filled with bone and stone tablets.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the children burst in, rushing towards Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Tell us your story, please!"</p><p></p><p>Tito picked up a child and sat down at the table.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, let me tell you about the most beautiful creature I've ever seen."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that there are spirit-like beings with divine appearances."</p><p></p><p>"In the temples of the gods, the messengers of the gods are called dream sprites."</p><p></p><p>"They have the miraculous power of dreams, able to conjure up anything you wish for from your dreams."</p><p></p><p>The children's eyes widened, and they exclaimed, "Can they really create anything we want?"</p><p></p><p>Tito nodded, "Of course. Anything you can dream of, the messengers of the gods can bring to life."</p><p></p><p>The children asked, "How can we find these dream sprites? I want to make the things in my dreams come true!"</p><p></p><p>The poet stood up, holding a child, and the other children followed his steps.</p><p></p><p>"The dream sprites have their own names, their true names."</p><p></p><p>"When you dream, if you call out their true names, perhaps you will be able to see them."</p><p></p><p>"Have you not heard the legend of the divine messenger Baro?"</p><p></p><p>"When the Queen of the Stars called out Baro's name, the divine messenger appeared."</p><p></p><p>The children clamored around the poet, asking, "How can we know the names of the dream sprites?"</p><p></p><p>Tito did not answer.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at the sunflower in the flower pot in the corner, a precious gift from the Queen.</p><p></p><p>The poet suddenly remembered the scene of seeing the divine messenger Baro in the field of flowers, and he smiled.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, the stars shifted.</p><p></p><p>After the great poet Tito passed away, a legend began to spread among the Hinsai people.</p><p></p><p>Some said that in addition to the Laideli King's stone tablet, Tito had obtained something even more precious from the divine land.</p><p></p><p>He knew a secret about the divine land, an earth-shattering secret.</p><p></p><p>Some said the great poet had hidden everything in a mural.</p><p></p><p>Some said the secret was hidden in one of his poems.</p><p></p><p>Others said it was an unpublished manuscript, a travelogue of the poet's journey to the divine land.</p><p></p><p>Whoever could find the secret left behind by the great poet would be rewarded beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>It was something that could change the course of an era.</p>

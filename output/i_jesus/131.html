        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the Sky Temple, Sander sat in quiet meditation under the clouds and the sun. üíô‚òù‚ûÖ‚ùæÀ¢ úùì§x.œÇùïÜ·µê‚òÜ‚ôù</p><p></p><p>In his palms, he held a silver light, whose brilliance constantly changed with the fluctuations of his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>At times, it would transform into an earthy gray symbol, and at other times, into a hazy, dreamlike vision.</p><p></p><p>When Sander had signed the spiritual pact with the Cup of the Gods, he had once caught a glimpse of the divine dream contained within the artifact that had transformed into a dreamlike sun.</p><p></p><p>That was said to be the source of the world's laws and miraculous powers.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a piece of information had surged into his mind, revealing the name of that imprinted divine art technique.</p><p></p><p>"The Ceramic Divine Art Imprint."</p><p></p><p>He first saw a complex three-dimensional symbol, which then shattered, transforming into a vast, majestic world.</p><p></p><p>It was a world of earth, ceramics, and statues.</p><p>Boundless and endless.</p><p></p><p>Since then, he had been constantly trying to imprint the power of that divine dream, to integrate it into his own wisdom and authority.</p><p></p><p>Just as the fairies had fused the divine art imprint into the power of their dream domains.</p><p></p><p>After many years of attempts, he had finally reached the threshold.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Sander's face - he was about to create the third-tier path of wisdom and authority.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not yet mature, he had already broken through that wall.</p><p></p><p>By Sander's side, a child quietly looked at the book he had given him. 69÷Ü…¶ ä”º.∆à÷Ö ç</p><p></p><p>The child had a calmness and maturity beyond his years.</p><p></p><p>The child held a bamboo scroll book titled "The Power of Wisdom and Authority," which Sander had written himself.</p><p></p><p>Seeing something he didn't understand, the child looked up and asked Sander.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sander."</p><p></p><p>"Why is the power of the dream fairies called the third tier?"</p><p></p><p>"While the spiritual priests are only the second tier - isn't this the same power?"</p><p></p><p>The child's name was Haru, and he was the son of a priest.</p><p></p><p>He was not born with the talent to become a wielder of power, but the priest had passed on his bloodline to him at the end and entrusted him to Sander.</p><p></p><p>Sander remained motionless, but his voice resonated in the child's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Haru."</p><p></p><p>"Because the power of the laws we possess is borrowed. The fairies have fused the divine art imprint power from the divine dream into their dream domains, transforming their ordinary sculptural powers into the miraculous powers we speak of."</p><p></p><p>"But we three-leaf people cannot fully imitate the fairies' power, because the second-tier power of wisdom does not evolve into a dream domain, but into spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Only by finding a way to integrate the divine art imprint into spiritual power can we find the key to breaking through the third tier."</p><p></p><p>"That would be our own divine art power, worthy of being called a third-tier priest."</p><p></p><p>The child looked up and asked him.</p><p></p><p>"Then... ‚ôóüç©Ôºñ‚ùæùê¨ ú√π‚ìß.ùêúùêé·µêüòÇüò∫"</p><p></p><p>"Have you found it, Lord Sander?"</p><p></p><p>The light in Sander's hands detached and transformed into a faintly glowing shadow behind him.</p><p></p><p>He shouted at the same time: "Spiritual Activation Art!"</p><p></p><p>"Imprint Spirit! Come forth!"</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest achievement of Sander's research over the years - he had independently created this divine art of Spiritual Activation on top of the divine art consciousness projection.</p><p></p><p>And it was this divine art that had allowed him to break through the threshold of the third tier of wisdom and authority.</p><p></p><p>By combining the divine art imprint and spiritual power through Spiritual Activation Art, he had brought forth this unique creation, the Imprint Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Sander...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sande'an stood up and opened his eyes at the same time.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his fingers, the spirit of the talisman seal rose up as if it were another body under his control, floating in the air and defying gravity.</p><p></p><p>This was a spiritual body formed by spiritual power and divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was far beyond the range of Sande'an's spiritual control, it still existed. It could fly without being affected by gravity, and it could move freely through the terrain without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the most basic power and transformation.</p><p></p><p>Sande'an activated the talismanic seals within the spirit body, and a dull gray seal symbol gradually appeared. Immediately, the sand and stones on the ground started rushing into the body of the talisman spirit.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the originally ethereal talisman spirit now had its own physical form.</p><p></p><p>Following Sande'an's instructions, the body of the talisman spirit kept transforming.</p><p></p><p>"Stone form." The body of the talisman spirit solidified into sturdy stone, heavy but powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Ceramic form." It then changed into a lightweight ceramic figure, agile but somewhat fragile.</p><p></p><p>"Clay form." The talisman spirit transformed into a clay figure, without the strength of the stone or the agility of the ceramic, but with tremendous mutability.</p><p></p><p>It could wrap around and protect Sande'an, or turn into a mass of clay to trap others.</p><p></p><p>This body kept shifting between the three forms, not only demonstrating the power of the spiritual body, but also the might of the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Children have a natural yearning for such constantly transforming puppets, as if they were seeing a giant toy.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sande'an, can I learn this too?"</p><p></p><p>Sande'an nodded, "If you are willing to learn, I can teach you."</p><p></p><p>"But I hope that after you master this power, you will use it cautiously."</p><p></p><p>"You can become a great person who changes the world, or a mediocre person who is indifferent to the world."</p><p></p><p>"But you must not become like those who killed your father - greedy, corrupt, and evil."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about his father, Halu's expression changed: "Lord Sande'an, I will never become like them."</p><p></p><p>Sande'an could not guarantee or predict the future himself. He could only plant the seeds of his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of flowers would bloom in the end, who could foresee that?</p><p></p><p>He was not a deity.</p><p></p><p>He took the child's hand and left this forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Halu was clearly a child with many questions. He was full of curiosity about everything and had his own ideas.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sande'an."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it have to be a human form?"</p><p></p><p>Sande'an told Halu, "Because we are most familiar with the human form and limbs, which are the most convenient to control and can exert the greatest power."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you can also transform your talisman spirit into other forms, as long as you are familiar with and can control them."</p><p></p><p>"But in any case, the innate human form is the easiest to learn and master."</p><p></p><p>However, Halu disagreed, "The body of the Three-Leaf people is very agile, but it doesn't have strong attacking power and is too weak."</p><p></p><p>"If I learn this powerful magic, I must create an extremely powerful body for myself in the future."</p><p></p><p>Sande'an laughed, "The fact that you have your own thoughts and will means that you will one day surpass even me."</p><p></p><p>He led the child down, entering the inner sanctum of the Sky Temple, where a group of divine servants were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>"High Priest."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is here."</p><p></p><p>Sande'an's gaze suddenly became sharp and piercing, but then gradually calmed down as he took a deep breath.</p>

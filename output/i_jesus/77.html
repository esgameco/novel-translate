            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Dreams. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>In the Supreme Temple of the Blessed Land, the Supreme Deity of the Trifoliate People has merged into the divine statue and fallen into a deep slumber. Unless he is awakened or an accident occurs, the God Yin will rely on this method to transcend time.</p><p></p><p>As he said, he waits for the moment of his true arrival in eternity.</p><p></p><p>Dream Demon Hila and the Fusion Monster Queen Sali guard the temple of the deity, one on the left and one on the right. The Dream Demon resting on the ornate stone bench on the right side suddenly senses something.</p><p></p><p>The dream sun in the sky flickers slightly, and a voice from outside the dream world surrounds her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Guardian of the Garden of the Gods, divine messenger of the Realm of Dreams."</p><p></p><p>"Oh dream fairy named Hope!"</p><p></p><p>"I devoutly pray for you to respond to my wish."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the dream fairy move slightly, and she murmurs in her sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>This is the first time someone has called out her true name, and the dream fairy involuntarily responds to the call.</p><p></p><p>It's as if someone is calling her, and she turns around reflexively.</p><p></p><p>She traces the voice back in the dream, and the dream fragments also rotate with her power.</p><p></p><p>Dream starlight rises from the sea of flowers in the sun's cup, forming a dazzling rainbow band.</p><p></p><p>The dream world opens a large door, projecting onto the human world.</p><p></p><p>She also sees who is calling her.</p><p></p><p>On the coastline, a Trifoliate Person controller is killing another Trifoliate Person on the spot, all for the sake of a bone book. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The dream demon, resting on her dream egg, furrows her brow slightly in her sleep.</p><p></p><p>She opens her eyes, exuding a lazy drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>"A Trifoliate Person killed another Trifoliate Person."</p><p></p><p>"Their world is indeed filled with slaughter, as well as evil and greed."</p><p></p><p>"Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>The dream demon ponders the world of the Trifoliate People with her innocent thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of a lack of resources and food? Or for other reasons?"</p><p></p><p>She laughs: "If they were like us in the realm of the gods, where we lack nothing, perhaps they would not commit these crimes anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible for everyone to hold hands and smile happily, just like us?"</p><p></p><p>But she does not know that she is peering into the outside world through the door of dreams, and also allowing the outside world to see the realm of the gods.</p><p></p><p>She does not know what her actions will bring to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The dawn of the City of the Descended Gods has not changed much from a few hundred years ago, except for the addition of a few years of weathering.</p><p></p><p>The same walls, the same buildings, the same merchants and nobles relying on workshops and fishing grounds to plunder wealth, and the same villagers lining up at the city gates every morning.</p><p></p><p>It's as if time has been constantly cycling here for all these years.</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate People in the city are waiting outside the gates in the early morning, and the weary city gate guards yawn as they open the gates, and the commoners line up neatly to enter the city.</p><p></p><p>"Don't push!"</p><p></p><p>"To enter the market and pay taxes..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the commotion, someone notices a rainbow halo appearing in the whitish sky.</p><p></p><p>It's beautiful.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it also attracts many Trifoliate People to turn their heads and look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The city dwellers who have just left their homes also look up at the high place, as they have never seen such a rainbow halo, which is rapidly spreading and occupying the entire sky above the City of the Descended Gods in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The halo spreads out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The clouds followed the dreamlike starlight as they rotated, revealing the scene behind the halo.</p><p></p><p>Everyone finally saw what it was.</p><p></p><p>The illusory and dazzling dream sun seemed like a painting hanging on the horizon, and the boundless sea of sunflowers swayed in the wind, their open petals facing the sky as if chanting a sacred melody.</p><p></p><p>The shattered and ancient city bestowed by the gods, the towering colossal statues, the collapsed palaces - all bore witness to the past glory and splendor.</p><p></p><p>The majestic and grand pyramids, the exquisite white three-leaf humanoid statues standing on the steps, holding up the radiance.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was the temple towering above everything, the sacred place where the deities stood.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the clamor and noise of the morning were silenced, as if the volume had been turned off.</p><p></p><p>Everything came to a halt, and all expressions on the faces were frozen between shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even the illiterate common three-leaf people immediately recognized what they were seeing - the land bestowed by the gods, the sacred hall of the Lederiki King's oath, as sung by the passing minstrels in the "Hymn to Lederiki".</p><p></p><p>"Hey!" </p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"Did you see that?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the grand classical castle in the City of the Descended Gods, the nobles by the window pushed their servants, dumbfounded, but the servants were staring at the sky, having forgotten to respond, or rather, not even feeling the presence of the people beside them.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the shout from the crowd at the city gate that the silence was broken.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Divine Kingdom!"</p><p>"That is the realm of the deities!"</p><p></p><p>The voices, like giant waves, overturned the entire City of the Descended Gods.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of people rushed out of their homes and gathered on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Some knelt on the ground, reaching up to the sky, as if embracing the divine kingdom, or lifting up the eternal throne of the deities.</p><p></p><p>"Great Insai, have you returned to the realm of Hinsai?"</p><p>"A miracle, this is a miracle."</p><p>"The gaze of the deities has descended upon the City of the Descended Gods once again. We are once more under their attention."</p><p>"This is the true sacred land, the origin where the deities and the Lederiki King descended, the starting point of creation, the beginning of myths and epics."</p><p></p><p>Some chanted the Lederiki Oath as they walked along the streets, shouting:</p><p>"The gods said..."</p><p>"The king said the eternal is only the divine..."</p><p></p><p>Frenzied, yet with an indescribable piety.</p><p></p><p>Some rushed up the lighthouse, as if to get closer to the deities.</p><p></p><p>The sky of the City of the Descended Gods had opened the door to the dreamworld, and the realm of the deities was projected before all the three-leaf people.</p><p></p><p>Across generations and eras, since the three-leaf people were expelled from the Garden of Eden, the descendants of Lederiki had once again witnessed the divine kingdom beyond the myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>That realm stood in another world, requiring the passage through a illusory gate in the clouds and sky to reach and behold.</p><p></p><p>It was so beautiful, yet so sacred.</p><p>Completely in line with their imagination and expectation of the divine realm, that power and might they could hardly fathom, making them believe even more in the greatness and omnipotence of the Insai god.</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf people inside and outside the City of the Descended Gods were completely consumed by madness.</p><p></p><p>Although the appearance of the divine kingdom was only a fleeting moment, before it dissipated with the dreamlike starlight, countless people chased after it on the streets and the land outside the city, as if to follow the fading starlight all the way to the temple of the deities.</p>

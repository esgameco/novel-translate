        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Temple of the Pyramids. </p><p></p><p>The light shone through the stained glass windows, and the curtains in the temple fluttered. Yin God stood there for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He was not looking at the scenery outside the window, but at the divine cup in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He thought of Bolo, and he thought of Laidley.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered the time when he still had a physical body, when he waved to his friends and chatted and laughed with them.</p><p></p><p>The young girl behind him hugged a pot of flowers and tightly surrounded him, as if she wanted to constantly convey the fragrance of the flowers she loved to the god.</p><p></p><p>The god suddenly spoke, addressing Sally.</p><p></p><p>"Sally."</p><p></p><p>"Laidley said I am eternal, he said that mortals, no matter how much they obtain, will eventually lose it all, only the eternal gods can possess everything."</p><p></p><p>"But why do I still feel like I'm constantly losing?"</p><p></p><p>Yin God would occasionally start talking to Sally, perhaps only the unwise and selfless Sally could become the object he could freely confide in.</p><p></p><p>Sally did not respond. </p><p></p><p>She just took a step closer to Yin God, getting closer to him.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Yin God's face, but it's unknown whether he truly felt the warmth, or was mocking himself for calling out Sally's name when he was just talking to himself.</p><p></p><p>After that, he stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness entered a hazy state.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have truly merged with the sunlight, becoming a motionless shadow.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, </p><p></p><p>he was just an overexposed spot in a photograph.</p><p></p><p>As a being that floats outside the universe and time, the effect of time on him is like a film that he can freely manipulate.</p><p></p><p>He slowed down his perception of time, and the outside world rushed by like a slide show.</p><p></p><p>Clouds and moons intertwined, the sun and the red clouds lingered.</p><p></p><p>The tides surged, the rain and sunshine alternated.</p><p></p><p>In the Garden of the Gods filled with the Cups of the Sun, the fairies of dreams became more and more numerous.</p><p></p><p>From a dozen, to dozens, then to hundreds.</p><p></p><p>The garden became more and more lively.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairies usually hide in the sea of flowers and are difficult to find, but as soon as one lets out a cheer, you can see a giant Cup of the Sun fold up and transform into a fairy rushing out.</p><p></p><p>Dream Fairy Hera came down from the pyramid, and hundreds of dream fairies rushed out to surround her, circling around her.</p><p></p><p>They stood in an orderly line, and Hera counted them, calling out their names.</p><p></p><p>Every time a new dream fairy appeared, she would do this again.</p><p></p><p>"One... two... ten."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, a hundred."</p><p></p><p>A trace of joy appeared on the serene face of the dream fairy. She still walked with a quiet pace according to her own rhythm, but her body swayed slightly, revealing her happiness.</p><p></p><p>She came before the god and looked up at him, saying:</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"The time has come."</p><p></p><p>The shadow that was frozen like a spot in a photograph moved.</p><p></p><p>In this moment of Yin God's haze, two hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>Dream Fairy Hera saw the god awaken, and then said:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Bolo's divine cup contains the seeds of the dream world, and the dream fairies now number a hundred, and Lord Bolo has also found the divine descent technique."</p><p></p><p>"All three conditions have been met."</p><p></p><p>Yin God: "Too few."</p><p></p><p>He was referring to the number of dream fairies.</p><p></p><p>Dream Fairy Hera knew she had been a bit impatient, but she was so eager for the god to wake up early that hearing him say this, she was momentarily at a loss.</p><p></p><p>But the god then said, "But we can try it once."</p><p></p><p>Dream Fairy Hera nodded and said to the god, "I'll make the arrangements right away."</p><p></p><p>In the vast temple, the divine beings stood on the divine altar, and Dream Fairy Hera slept at the feet of the divine statue, cradling the dream egg.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred dream fairies in golden robes stood together, their hems connected as if holding hands, singing joyful melodies.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"La la la la la!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the dreamworld radiated from them, as they one by one flew into the dreamworld egg, disappearing from reality and entering the dreamworld as the life of the dreamworld.</p><p></p><p>The dream demon Hila's dreamworld bubble grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>Larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>The edge of the dreamworld crossed over the stairs, crossed over the God-given City, and reached the coast.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it enveloped the entire God-given Land,</p><p></p><p>This dreamworld bubble was complete, and various magnificent scenes appeared in the floating colorful rainbows on the bubble wall. It was about to sublimate from the dreamworld bubble into another form of existence, becoming a fragment of the dreamworld world.</p><p></p><p>But all of this must have something to carry them, without this carrier and coordinates, all the dreams are just illusions, just rootless duckweed.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen: "Are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>The fairies who were sleeping in the dreamworld egg nodded in their dreams.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen grasped the Holy Grail and fully activated its power.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The entire God-given Land enveloped by the dreamworld bubble began to distort, and the power of the dreamworld gradually became illusory.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>It disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The dreamworld bubble sank into the Holy Grail, merging into the seed of the dreamworld left by Baro, and created a dreamworld.</p><p></p><p>This is the power of the Holy Grail.</p><p></p><p>It can drag all the mature dream fragments into the dreamworld, like coordinates summoning one dreamworld after another to descend, and then create an illusory kingdom of dreams.</p><p></p><p>The God-given Land disappeared, it became a part of the dreamworld, becoming an existence between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairies who had just disappeared into reality reappeared, holding hands and circling in the air above the temple, still singing that cheerful tune.</p><p></p><p>And the shadow of the deity on the divine altar shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Projection."</p><p></p><p>"Descend."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen's shadow gradually became more real, the outline that was like an illusory light became more and more intense, turning the entire temple into a dazzling white.</p><p></p><p>Star-like celestial bodies squeezed in from outside the universe, and his power became more and more materialized.</p><p></p><p>Time began to stagnate, and even began to become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Some places began to accelerate violently, and some even began to flow backwards.</p><p></p><p>The entire dreamworld world let out a violent roar, and it could collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>When it reached the critical point and could no longer bear it, the intense light emanating from the divine altar began to slowly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen gave up on descending.</p><p></p><p>"It's still too early."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen spoke, but he was still a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He was very looking forward to stepping into the dreamworld.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not step into the real world, even if only in the world of dreams.</p><p></p><p>To feel the wind, to feel the rain, to smell the fragrance of flowers.</p><p></p><p>He would be satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But the entire universe was rejecting him, and even the strange realm between illusion and reality, the dreamworld, could not accommodate the descent of his will.</p><p></p><p>The dream demon Hila knelt before Yin Shen: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"It's because Hila was too impatient."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen knew it was not her fault, he also wanted to try it.</p><p></p><p>"It's not your fault, and you don't have to be anxious or afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Hila!"</p><p></p><p>"Someday it will succeed, it's just a matter of sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>Hila looked up at the deity: "Have you already seen the future?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen lowered his head and looked at Hila.</p><p></p><p>"There is a little advantage to being an eternal existence, as long as there is a possibility of success, I can wait endlessly."</p><p></p><p>"Even!"</p><p></p><p>"Until the end of time."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen's words were spoken lightly, but the dream demon Hila heard them trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>The god had no fear or fear, but she saw an unimaginable darkness and despair.</p><p></p><p>That was a sadness she could not imagine or describe.</p><p></p><p>The dream demon Hila said to the god: "It's because the dreamworld is still too weak to bear the will of the god."</p><p></p><p>"The power of dreams also needs the support of the memories of life to grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Let the dream demon tribe leave the God-given Land and bestow the power of dreams on the three-leaf people!"</p><p></p><p>"The grace of the god will make the civilization of the three-leaf people more prosperous."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at Hila: "Power can make civilization prosper, but it can also lead them to destruction."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila: "God!"</p>

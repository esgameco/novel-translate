        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Sacred Mountain. .o0×X×0o. 69shux.com .o0×X×0o.</p><p></p><p>The army of the Samo Kingdom was slow to react. By the time they had finally gathered their main forces to attack the Kingdom of Xinglu, the latter had already advanced into the territory of the Kingdom of Celuo.</p><p></p><p>But this time was different from before. The royal bloodline of the Samo family was evidently anxious, launching an all-out offensive without sparing any cost. They quickly breached and captured the fortified Stone Forest City.</p><p></p><p>Within a few days, they had broken through and reached the foot of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan of the Queen of Xinglu, the Sky Temple had long prepared the Death Star to staunchly defend this place.</p><p></p><p>The natural barrier of the Sacred Lake and the geographical advantage of the Sacred Mountain were enough to hold them off for a day or two.</p><p></p><p>However, two days before the Samo Kingdom's army arrived, an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Death Star suddenly surged out from the Sacred Lake, rampaging and destroying the fishing grounds within, then crawling onto land and moving away in the distance. No matter how they called out, it did not turn back.</p><p></p><p>The entire City of the Divine Servants and the Sky Temple were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"How could this happen?"</p><p>"How could the Death Star suddenly lose control?"</p><p>"It's over, it's over."</p><p></p><p>The people of the City of the Divine Servants were thoroughly panicked. Without the Death Star, how could they possibly defend this place?</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Samo Kingdom's main army arrived, the desert worms on the frontline immediately launched an attack and breached the city gates. A long line of people began fleeing from the back roads.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Sacred Mountain, there were refugees everywhere. </p><p></p><p>They had abandoned the Sky Temple and the City of the Divine Servants.</p><p>If it weren't for the fear of damaging the Sky Temple, the Samo Kingdom would have been able to occupy the city even faster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, huge waves began to rise on the surface of the Sacred Lake in the distance.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying giant beast emerged from the water, its iron-clad body crashing onto the ground and carving a thousand-meter-long trench, kicking up a violent cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>With just a single strike, it brought a catastrophic defeat to the army of the Kingdom of Celuo at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>A black magic fern suddenly grew out of the ground, transforming into a hundred-meter-tall giant plant in the blink of an eye, entwining the Celuo sea monster.</p><p></p><p>This was another giant monster of the Samo family - the Moon Magic Fern, the only Ruhei giant monster that had evolved along the plant evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>A rumbling sound came from deep beneath the Sacred Mountain, and a terrifying giant insect burrowed out, engaging in battle with the desert worms of the Samo family.</p><p></p><p>The burrowing magic insect and the Celuo sea monster arrived just in time, helping to turn the tide of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Smoke and dust rose in the distance, and the main armies of the Kingdom of Xinglu and the Volcanic Duchy were also rushing back.</p><p></p><p>Heniel stood atop the head of the burrowing magic insect, raising his sword and pointing at the controller of the desert worms.</p><p></p><p>People change with the situation and the passage of time, and Heniel's transformation, having grasped power, was earth-shattering. His confidence and the aura surrounding him had swelled to an unbelievable degree.</p><p></p><p>"King of the Samo family."</p><p>"You either destroy the temple of the divine, and then engage in the final battle here."</p><p>"Do you dare?"</p><p>"Or quietly leave this place and end this war."</p><p></p><p>The king of the Samo family did not become angry at Heniel's provocation, but calmly asked, "Where is the King of the Celuo family?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not tell the truth: "Her Majesty the Queen is integrating the Kingdom of Celuo and will return with the sky giant beast at any moment."</p><p></p><p>However, the king of the Samo Kingdom said, "But the information I received is that the Queen of Xinglu is dead."</p><p></p><p>Heniel laughed loudly, "The Celuo family dares to say such nonsense just to lure you in."</p><p></p><p>"On what basis?"</p><p>"What power do they have to harm the great Queen of Xinglu?"</p><p></p><p>The king of the Samo Kingdom hesitated, also doubting the authenticity of the news. How could the weakest Kingdom of Celuo, relying on just one giant monster, have the power to kill the mighty Queen of Xinglu?</p><p></p><p>The situation was at an impasse.</p><p></p><p>The Samo family did not dare to destroy the temple of the divine and the City of the Divine Servants, and staying here to wear them down was also not a long-term plan, as this was the heartland of the Kingdom of Xinglu - it would ultimately benefit the enemy.</p><p></p><p>The Samo Kingdom felt they had no opportunity and no determination to engage in the final battle at the foot of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, they ultimately retreated and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Samo Kingdom retreat, the entire City of the Divine Servants erupted in cheers.</p><p></p><p>"Her Majesty the Queen has returned!"</p><p>"Her Majesty the Queen has returned."</p><p>"The Samo Kingdom has retreated, we have won, we have won."</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple and throughout the City of the Divine Servants, everyone was overjoyed, flooding the streets to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>Even the fleeing nobles and soldiers had hurried back, joyfully welcoming the return of the Queen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Army.</p><p></p><p>But they did not know that the one who returned was not their Queen.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Xilun Family and the Ruhei Giant Monster had already been completely defeated in the great war with the Sele Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>A young priest in the Sky Temple looked down below and discovered something amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I see the Sky Behemoth? Has the Volcano Duke's Burrowing Demon Worm returned instead?"</p><p></p><p>The large army entered the City of the Divine Servants, and the Sele Sea Demons entered and garrisoned the Holy Lake, replacing the former Death Star.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm, as Heniel's mount, slowly made its way up the main road to the City of the Divine Servants and the Sky Temple, like a pilgrim.</p><p></p><p>Before his return, Heniel, taking advantage of the leaderless Great Army of the Star Kingdom after the great victory, used the death of the Star Kingdom Queen as a pretext to purge and reorganize most of the military officers, and then incorporated the army of the Star Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He then left some of the unstable troops of the Star Kingdom to guard the Sele Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>These people were rootless duckweed in the Star Kingdom, and now faced enemies on all sides in the Sele Kingdom, so they could only obey Heniel's orders to guard the Sele Kingdom he had just conquered.</p><p></p><p>As for Heniel himself, he led the army of the Volcano Duchy and the part of the kingdom's army that had first pledged allegiance to him, and hurried back. So all the forces here were now under his control.</p><p></p><p>After entering the City of the Divine Servants, the entire city was cheering.</p><p></p><p>"Duke Heniel!"</p><p>"Duke Heniel!"</p><p>"Duke of the Volcano!"</p><p>"Lord Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel not only had the achievement of conquering the Sele Kingdom, but also the credit of avenging the Star Kingdom Queen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had transformed again, becoming the hero who saved the Sky Temple and the City of the Divine Servants.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that he had two Ruhei Giant Monsters in his hands.</p><p></p><p>When Heniel arrived with the army in front of the palace, the people of the Xilun Family questioned him.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Her Majesty the Queen?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel got down from the head of the Burrowing Demon Worm, and he personally carried a stone coffin into the palace.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Behemoth had finally metamorphosed into the initial form of the Ruhei Giant Monster. They could not find the body of Her Majesty the Queen, but they found the crown of the Xilun Family and the scepter of Hinsai in the remains of the Sky Behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the stone coffin, the people of the Xilun Family and the nobles of the City of the Divine Servants could not accept it at all.</p><p></p><p>One by one, their faces changed drastically, and they retreated in panic, looking at that stone coffin.</p><p></p><p>"No, it can't be!"</p><p>"No, it can't be!"</p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p>"This is fake, how could Her Majesty the Queen be dead?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel closed his eyes, tilting his head back and said:</p><p></p><p>"Her Majesty the Queen died in battle, to reclaim the Sele Kingdom, to restore the glory of Hinsai!"</p><p></p><p>He ignored everyone, carrying the Queen's stone coffin into the palace. He placed the Star Kingdom Queen's stone coffin on the throne, and then stood by the throne, holding the scepter of Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>At this time, one by one, the returning generals stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Duke of the Volcano has avenged the Queen, the main line of the Xilun Family has been severed, the internal situation is unstable and the external enemies are still formidable. I think at this critical moment, Duke of the Volcano should be appointed as the Regent."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Queen trusted Duke of the Volcano the most before her departure, and now only Duke of the Volcano can maintain the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Duke of the Volcano is the inheritor of the Queen's will."</p><p></p><p>This situation, how could the collateral branches of the Xilun Family tolerate it?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone stepped forward and loudly questioned and accused Heniel.</p><p></p><p>Holding the scepter of Hinsai, standing by the throne, Heniel's expression did not change at all, and he did not even respond.</p><p></p><p>But immediately, a general in the palace stepped forward: "The Queen's death was because there was a traitor in the priesthood of the Sky Temple, otherwise how could the Ruhei Giant Monster have lost control?"</p><p></p><p>"There must have been someone in the priesthood who betrayed her, and the Sky Temple must have had accomplices too."</p><p></p><p>"You jumped out at this time, you must be related to the Queen's death."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone shouted, "Arrest him! Judge him!"</p><p>"Avenge the Queen."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, some frenzied soldiers stepped forward, knocked him down, and dragged him away.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers' bloodthirsty roars made the once high and mighty royal bloodline and nobles shiver in fear, and no one dared to voice any opposition.</p><p></p><p>The army surrounded the city, and the Xilun Family, facing the power of the Ruhei Giant Monster, the Burrowing Demon Worm, and the Sele Sea Demons, could only curl up like quails, not even daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Heniel had long seen through the true nature of these people.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had said before, the so-called royal bloodline families, after losing the power of the Giant Monsters, had lost the throne.</p><p></p><p>The Giant Monsters.</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Escaped?"</p><p></p><p>"No, how could she have run away? New69bookbar.com"</p><p></p><p>Yali scanned those people in the temple with his sharp gaze: "Someone betrayed me."</p><p></p><p>His suspicious gaze swept over one person after another, some were responsible for guarding, some for monitoring. </p><p></p><p>"Kill them."</p><p></p><p>The people being dragged away shouted: "King!"</p><p></p><p>"We didn't, we really didn't."</p><p></p><p>"We saw a figure, and then fell asleep."</p><p></p><p>"It's not our fault!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not our fault!"</p><p></p><p>Yali couldn't be bothered to listen to their explanations. A king killing people needs no evidence, just suspecting someone is enough.</p><p></p><p>Yali finished speaking and pointed to two priest-kings: "You are of the royal clan, I don't want to investigate which of you let her escape, but now I'm giving you two a chance."</p><p></p><p>"She escaped from your hands, so you go capture her back. Otherwise, your families and children will die with you."</p><p></p><p>The two priest-kings trembled: "King, we will definitely capture her back."</p><p></p><p>A minister came forward to persuade Yali.</p><p></p><p>"King."</p><p></p><p>"She's just a woman, let her run away. We can choose another person from the Xilun clan."</p><p></p><p>But Yali just laughed, feeling it was a good opportunity that she had run away.</p><p></p><p>"Any member of the royal clan cannot be slighted, let alone she is the heir of the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>"Where could she run to?"</p><p></p><p>"Only the other three royal bloodline clans would dare shelter a royal."</p><p></p><p>"This is a good chance to probe the attitudes of these three royal bloodline clans."</p><p></p><p>Yali summoned his three sons and ordered the three Luhu giants to follow their commands. </p><p></p><p>He had his sons lead an army and Luhu giants respectively to the city-states of the three royal bloodline clans, to track down where Xing had gone.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who dared shelter Xing.</p><p></p><p>That would become his excuse to strike against them, and perhaps he could take the opportunity to regain control of one Luhu giant, consolidating the King of Xinyai's power.</p><p></p><p>Only he had not expected that a terrifying mythical being was currently accompanying Xing.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate land.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see were towering giant rocks, the bizarre shaped stones in the darkness like terrifying demonic shadows.</p><p></p><p>Xing and a group from the Xilun clan had fled here.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They were preparing to rest for a while before setting out again at dawn. </p><p></p><p>Overnight, she went from being a high-ranking member of the royal family and a priestess of the celestial temple, to becoming a fugitive of the Kingdom of Hyin. </p><p></p><p>Yesterday she still had everything, but now she had nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" </p><p></p><p>Xing sobbed, hugging her legs as she hid in the corner behind a rock. </p><p></p><p>She didn't dare show weakness in front of others, as she was now the pillar and hope for her entire family.</p><p></p><p>Polo jumped out, revealing half his body from behind the rock.</p><p></p><p>"What are you crying about?"</p><p></p><p>Xing was startled and quickly wiped away her tears: "I'm not."</p><p></p><p>Polo moved closer, coming out from behind the stone. </p><p></p><p>"Don't wipe them, I saw everything."</p><p></p><p>"You're crying."</p><p></p><p>The unrestrained Polo had no idea what grief was, he felt the world was full of happiness.</p><p></p><p>Xing no longer tried to hide it, she admitted it.</p><p></p><p>"Father was killed by the king, but I don't know what to do?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm really weak, really useless."  </p><p></p><p>"I don't even know where to go tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Polo couldn't understand: "If it's really that hard, then go defeat that king!"</p><p></p><p>"Make him pay for what he's done."</p><p></p><p>Xing raised her head: "But he's the King of Hyin!"</p><p></p><p>Polo stood up straight: "Of course you can't do it alone, but now you have companions, you have the incredibly powerful Dream Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"The messenger of the Hyin God, the envoy of illusion and dreams..."</p><p></p><p>"The clever and wise Polo."</p><p></p><p>That string of titles that were impossible to remember left Xing baffled, but saying them aloud seemed to stir up Polo's blood.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"This is adventure, this is the great epic and heroic tale."</p><p></p><p>He spun around like a magnificent dancer, he liked to express his inner joy this way, but this time he felt dancing alone wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>His golden robe extended an arm-like projection, pulling Xing's hand to spin her around with him.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, the two danced in the moonlight. </p><p></p><p>"Xing!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go defeat that king together! Let's embark on this magnificent and grand adventure."</p><p></p><p>Polo loved pursuing exciting new stories, he hated monotonous life and being constrained.</p><p></p><p>Xing looked dazed, completely led by Polo's enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo controlled the rhythm and dance steps. </p><p></p><p>But it was indeed much more relaxed, the initial feeling of fear gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Polo was right, her father could not just die in vain like this. </p><p></p><p>"I want to make the cruel king pay the price."</p><p></p><p>-----------</p><p></p><p>Polo fell asleep, nestling against Xing like a child.</p><p></p><p>Xing turned her head to look at him.</p><p></p><p>"The messenger of the gods...?"</p><p></p><p>She had never seen anyone like this before. </p><p></p><p>Is this someone who came from the land blessed by the gods? What kind of place is that, that can make a person free of any worries, able to be so at ease?</p><p></p><p>In his dream, Polo saw the gods.</p><p></p><p>The gods allowed him an audience, letting Polo intrude into the gods' dream.</p><p></p><p>The dream the gods had was completely different from his own - it was of endless skyscrapers and cities stretching to the horizon, they controlled the sky, land and oceans. </p><p></p><p>They even cast their gaze towards the stars above.</p><p></p><p>Miracles.</p><p></p><p>Divine power.  </p><p></p><p>It seemed inadequate to describe such power.</p><p></p><p>Polo stood by the gods' side, eyes wide in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Could there really be such a powerful race? Is this the legendary divine race spoken of?</p><p></p><p>"Here."</p><p>"Is the world of the gods?"</p><p></p><p>The god stood atop an iron tower, looking down on the bustling traffic and metropolis of millions.</p><p></p><p>He was lost in thought and memories, as if only by repeatedly remembering could he avoid forgetting who he was and where he came from.</p><p></p><p>The god said: "It was, once."</p><p></p><p>Three words, containing endless vicissitudes and lamentations.  </p><p></p><p>He now stood upon the Earth.</p><p></p><p>The distance from his homeland was not light years, but billions of years.</p><p></p><p>Polo seemed to understand yet not quite, he paused for a moment before speaking to the god.</p><p></p><p>"Great god!"</p><p>"Your messenger has found someone, she must be able to create the true divine technique."</p><p>"She is a genius, a genius who can pioneer divine arts."</p><p></p><p>Polo went on and on, like a child boasting about a sandcastle or toy he had made.</p><p></p><p>The god did not seem too concerned, or perhaps he never truly expected Polo to find the answer for him.</p><p></p><p>"Polo!"</p><p>"There is nothing in this world that can bear the will of the gods."</p><p></p><p>Polo was not at all daunted by the difficulties, maintaining an optimistic and hopeful attitude towards the future.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the beginning."</p><p>"Polo will definitely find a way, Polo is going to travel this world together with the gods as their messenger."</p>

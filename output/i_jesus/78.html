        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>One of the two main characters who caused all of this was the prince of the Volcanic Kingdom. He stood in a daze in front of the hidden reef, watching the appearance of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the people of the Descended City, he knew more clearly the reason for all of this happening. </p><p></p><p>He witnessed the other person kneeling on the ground praying to the Divine Realm, and then the gates of the Divine Realm appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not until it all dissipated did the prince lower his head.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but burst out laughing wildly: "Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is, it's actually like this."</p><p></p><p>He held the bone book in his hand, his eyes full of longing as he looked at it.</p><p></p><p>"To open the gates of the Divine Realm, the method to do so is hidden within this."</p><p></p><p>"Saint Tito! The great poet who wrote 'The Ode to the Wise King'!"</p><p></p><p>"You actually sealed this secret for two hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The prince began to read from the first page the last chapter left behind by the great poet, "Tito's Travels", which described the poet Tito seeing the Star Queen and writing the "Epic of Hinsai", to receiving the guidance of the Divine Messenger Baro.</p><p></p><p>The prince then realized that the great poet's journey was actually to escort a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>And it was precisely because of this that the divine allowed him to enter the gates of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tempering, baptism, and traversing the Abyss Kingdom with a king.</p><p></p><p>He entered the divine hall, saw the Mother of Life who controls all things, and the dream fairy who can create anything from dreams.</p><p></p><p>Some of these stories the prince had heard before, and some were unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the end, there was a different place.</p><p></p><p>That was the scene of the great poet about to leave the Divine Realm, as written in the book.</p><p></p><p>[I asked the Divine Messenger: "Can we also possess this power? Perhaps they can change the entire future of the Hinsai people."]</p><p></p><p>[" Perhaps."]</p><p></p><p>["I feel our future lies within this."]</p><p></p><p>[The Divine Messenger: "Perhaps one day when you again set foot in the Divine Realm, the divine will bestow power upon you."]</p><p></p><p>["All comes from the grace of the divine, all returns to the will of the divine."]</p><p></p><p>The prince suddenly trembled all over, because he suddenly associated something.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be!"</p><p></p><p>"The secret left behind by the great poet is this? When someone sets foot in the Divine Realm to see the great Hinsai divine again, the divine will bestow the power of dreams?"</p><p></p><p>If the Trileaf people could possess the dreamlike power of the dream fairy to create all kinds of wondrous things, it would be enough to overturn the current system and change the entire situation of the Hinsai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He felt that all the secrets were hidden in the end.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't wait to look further, he was frantically eager to know that final secret.</p><p></p><p>"How to see the divine? How to find the Divine Realm, how to pass through the gates of the divine world."</p><p></p><p>However, he felt that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Because after turning this bone plate, there was nothing behind it.</p><p></p><p>A page was missing.</p><p></p><p>And it was the most critical one.</p><p></p><p>The prince was first dumbfounded, then immediately plunged into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the bone book and flipped through it, only to find that the final page was simply not there.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the last page?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's the last chapter?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the prince's mind flashed back to the scene of the "caravan leader" dying, and what he had said to him.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps because of this, I have suffered the consequences."</p><p></p><p>The other person spat out blood and grimly smiled at him, saying, "But it is destined, you won't get it either."</p><p></p><p>He finally understood what the other person meant by that.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of being on the verge of getting everything and losing everything, made the prince's eyes turn red with rage.</p><p></p><p>In his fury, the prince had the Ruhel Colossus tear the other's remains to shreds, but still couldn't find what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>He quietly followed the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The caravan leader searched every corner, but unfortunately could not find what he was looking for.</p><p></p><p>- </p><p></p><p>The administrative palace of the City of Divine Descent was the side palace of King Yesaer, the second-generation Wise King. </p><p></p><p>The main body was the palace of Queen Xinglu, where the Queen would sometimes reside during her inspections.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of noble bureaucrats of the City of Divine Descent stood in front of the palace, kowtowing towards the divine phenomenon that had just descended, until everything dissipated and everyone stood up, all greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"The divine phenomenon has descended, the divine phenomenon has descended upon us again."</p><p></p><p>"Has the gate of the Divine Kingdom opened to us once more?"</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of the Divine has manifested again in the dawn starlight, perhaps this is an omen of the new era about to begin."</p><p></p><p>The noble bureaucrats were all speculating, their imaginations running wild. </p><p></p><p>They believed this was a divine revelation and a blessing for them.</p><p></p><p>But no one realized that this was merely someone making contact with the fairies guarding the gates of the Dream Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the City of Divine Descent stood on high and said to everyone, "Quickly report to Her Majesty the Queen, this is a divine grace bestowed upon us, and the glory of our City of Divine Descent."</p><p></p><p>Everyone cheered joyfully, this was their glory, and would be the foundation for them to return to the core of power.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a message was brought from outside the city.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Tito Town has been invaded by an armed caravan from the Samo Kingdom, the Tito family has all been killed, and their entire castle has collapsed into the ground."</p><p></p><p>The city lord was immediately stunned: "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>Soldiers rushed into Tito Town, taking control of the prosperous town, and also sealing off the Tito family's castle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this tragedy, the noble bureaucrats of the City of Divine Descent sighed and shook their heads one by one.</p><p></p><p>"The main line of the Tito family is completely gone."</p><p></p><p>"The branch left behind by the great poet Tito, it is said, has also died out."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, only the branch founded by the third son remains."</p><p></p><p>"The inherited saintly family lineage and titles will probably be taken over by them now."</p><p></p><p>Many of these bureaucrats were quite envious of the Tito family branch, suddenly inheriting this windfall of glory, as the title of "Saintly Family" was not just a noble title, but one that every kingdom must treat with the utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>But the city lord of the City of Divine Descent, seeing this scene, was thinking of something completely different.</p><p></p><p>Why did these people attack the Tito family?</p><p></p><p>Why did the image of the Divine Kingdom suddenly appear in the sky?</p><p></p><p>Why did these two events happen to coincide.</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the City of Divine Descent immediately associated this with something: "Could it be!"</p><p></p><p>"The legend might actually be true."</p><p></p><p>The city lord immediately ordered a thorough investigation of every corner, every place, and even summoned the high-ranking priest of the city.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a caravan seeking wealth and massacring, he would only mourn the scene and focus his main efforts on tracking down the caravan.</p><p></p><p>But now it was completely different, he had to clearly understand the entire process.</p><p></p><p>He must turn this place upside down to verify his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The priest stationed in the City of Divine Descent by the Sky Temple arrived, and his spiritual power scanned the underground, revealing that the illusion set up with the Sun Cup had been destroyed. They immediately detected something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they excavated the underground scene and saw the cave and cavern below.</p><p></p><p>They saw numerous corpses.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, they also saw large quantities of floating Sun Cups, as well as the remnants of the monument left behind by the Star Queen and the Divine Messenger Pololu.</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the City of Divine Descent turned deathly pale, and his voice immediately became distorted.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly report to Her Majesty the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"Someone has stolen the relics of the great poet Tito, and taken the divine grace bestowed upon the Star Kingdom by the gods."</p><p></p><p>The news spread like wings, quickly soaring across the vast wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Passing over the pure holy lake, reaching the Sky Temple shrouded in white clouds.</p>

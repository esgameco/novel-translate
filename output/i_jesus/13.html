        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen did not care who would become the next Wisdom King of the next generation. His concern for the Trifoliate people was solely because of Leadley's identity as the Trifoliate King. </p><p></p><p>On the divine platform, he seemed to have truly turned into a stone statue, immersed in contemplation. </p><p></p><p>A pause in consciousness, a momentary daze.</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple, the sun had risen and set several times. Time and the years had lost all power over him, just like a gentle breeze passing through his fingers.</p><p></p><p>He had once thought that a hundred years was an extremely long time, but now he felt that it was merely the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>He had lost his sensitivity to time and finally truly realized that he was no longer a short-lived species with a lifespan of less than a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>He was an existence that could travel upstream along the river of time, transcending the long river of years.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out I am no longer human."  </p><p></p><p>"What am I?"</p><p></p><p>There was no answer.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fused monster Shari sitting beside him. After so long, Shari was still exactly the same as before.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen could feel that she would not age, or rather, the length of time needed for her to have the feeling of aging was far beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>He placed his hand on Shari's face and lifted her chin.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked into her green eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you age?"</p><p></p><p>Shari would not respond to him, so he could only answer himself.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because your power is life itself?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it because the location of your mythical blood is different, or is it due to another reason?"</p><p></p><p>Since the mythical blood allowed him to create an additional anchor point, he could create even more anchor points.</p><p></p><p>He even wondered,</p><p></p><p>If a few mythical cells could give a person supernatural powers, and a few drops of mythical blood could turn a person into a mythical life form,</p><p></p><p>If there was enough of this mythical substance, could he create a vessel to contain himself, allowing him to descend into this world again?</p><p></p><p>With a direction in mind, Yin Shen conducted the next experiment within the temple, using the power of the fused monster shells.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not create ordinary life, but instead created life forms with supernatural abilities - mythical life forms.</p><p></p><p>The warm seawater filled the mythical shells, like a huge womb nurturing one life after another. Yin Shen took out the previously created deformed and monstrous lifeforms, allowing them to begin gestating new life.</p><p></p><p>Failure was common...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Attitude, success is one in a million.</p><p></p><p>But while he was creating new life, he also discovered some secrets of the mythical blood. </p><p></p><p>The mythical blood powers and abilities of Laidley and Isa were completely different, but there were also some connections.</p><p></p><p>Mythical blood cannot be destroyed, it is a material that exists almost eternally, like the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being passed down to the next generation, even after death it will remain in the corpse, and eventually scatter into the earth, oceans and air as the corpse rots and decomposes.</p><p></p><p>Laidley and Isa's powers and abilities can be inherited through bloodlines, and the mythical blood will split and expand as life is successfully born, but this split only happens in a small amount at the beginning of life. Once life is nurtured, it stops and becomes fixed.</p><p></p><p>But until now, he has not succeeded in creating a life that inherits mythical power, the difficulty of natural conception must be even higher.</p><p></p><p>Finally one day.  </p><p></p><p>The Demon God completed his experiment.</p><p></p><p>Through the transparent glowing shell, you could see several hard brown ball-like objects floating in the water.</p><p></p><p>Isa stood by his side, bending down to stare into the shell.</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle gurgle!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed she could see that the power of these brown embryos came from her, she could control them with just a thought. </p><p></p><p>She was their ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Also known as the Fusion Monster King.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God stood in front, carefully observing these mythical lives about to be born.</p><p></p><p>"Success?"</p><p></p><p>He shook his head again: "Only half successful."</p><p></p><p>He created new fusion monsters, but he also could not allow the new fusion monsters to inherit all of Shari's power as their source, they only obtained a small part of Shari's weak fusion ability, but not the ability to create life.</p><p></p><p>The new fusion monsters can fuse and take organs and talents from other lives, possessing near-indestructible power, making them very difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>But they cannot be called truly immortal.  </p><p></p><p>Because every few hundred years, they will go through a reincarnation cycle.</p><p></p><p>Erasing all ordinary cells, leaving only mythical cells to molt back into an embryonic state, and then grow again.</p><p></p><p>Die first, then be reborn.</p><p></p><p>But after growing again, it is completely another fusion monster, almost unrelated to the previous one.</p><p></p><p>The only one possessing true immortal power and ability is the one by his side.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This fusion monster king, just like the power of the Wisdom King of Leadley, this kind of power in this mythical bloodline and authority, can only exist uniquely. </p><p></p><p>Yin God raised his hand, and these embryos broke free from their shells and flew out of the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Cheep~"</p><p></p><p>Objects rubbing against the air made a shrill sound. </p><p></p><p>Stones tore through the waves and fell into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Hatching, birth, growth.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying giant beast, looking almost like a worm, emerged its head from the sea, roaring towards the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After the Trifolians had their own race, the fusion monsters also became a race.</p><p></p><p>----------</p><p></p><p>By the sea.</p><p></p><p>A white female Trifolian twisted in the water like a fish, turning her head to look at the shore: "Yesel! Jump in quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister!"  </p><p></p><p>"I'm coming down!"</p><p></p><p>Yesel stood on a huge rock, cheering as he leaped into the marsh.</p><p></p><p>His sister took him to dive deep, chasing after schools of fish.</p><p></p><p>When they resurfaced, each had caught an ancestral fish.</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>"What a big one!"</p><p></p><p>Yesel was very happy to have caught such a big fish, but he was even happier that his sister took him fishing together.</p><p></p><p>His sister told him, "There are even bigger ones in the sea. Father once caught something in the sea bigger than this rock, with claws longer than you."</p><p></p><p>"God said!"</p><p></p><p>"That's called a giant shrimp."</p><p></p><p>Yesel's eyes shone with longing, yearning for the unexplored depths of the ocean he had never reached before. </p><p></p><p>The ocean was so mysterious and dangerous, yet irresistibly appealing.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go see that faraway place, to conquer the deep sea that all Trifolians feared.</p><p></p><p>At the endless horizon of the sea, was there land thousands or millions of times larger than the God-gifted land?</p><p></p><p>The noonday sun was dazzlingly bright.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of his eye, a few blurry black shadows flashed across the sun and plunged into the sea.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caught the attention of many Trifolians by the sea, including Yesel and his sister.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" A huge creature burst through the sea surface, the seawater exploding outward.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying monster roared on the surface, its horrifying appearance and tremendous power etched into Yesel's eyes.</p><p></p><p>While other Trifolians cried out in panic to flee from the seaside, Yesel stared unblinkingly at the monster.</p><p></p><p>He thought.</p><p></p><p>If he had such tremendous power, he could definitely conquer the sea.</p>

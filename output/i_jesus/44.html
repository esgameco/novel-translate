        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Late night. At the Sky Divine Temple, amidst the moonlight and sea of clouds, it was quiet yet mysterious. </p><p></p><p>Three monster-like creatures the size of small hills were swimming through the lake, then crawled out, heading towards the Sky Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster climbed up the stairs in the darkness, followed by thousands of soldiers from the Divine Descent City, wielding weapons as they surged into the holy mountain. </p><p></p><p>Someone inside the city opened the gates, and the densely packed soldiers on the stairs were led into the city. A premeditated attack descended upon this city of servants of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Before anyone could react, chaos and killing had already erupted. </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, they simply never imagined anyone would dare attack the holy mountain and divine temple.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Amid the shrill cries, many fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"They're from the Divine Descent City, the king's guards," someone recognized their identities in the panic under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"The king's soldiers? How could the king's soldiers attack the divine temple?" Some still couldn't believe it was true.</p><p></p><p>King Yali's soldiers of the Kingdom of Heinze were rapidly occupying this city of divine servants.</p><p></p><p>More figures headed towards the highest point, the Sky Divine Temple at the peak of the holy mountain. </p><p></p><p>That was the core of this place, where those with authority over divine rituals and service resided.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ruler of the Sky Divine Temple stepped forward, angrily calling out King Yali's name.</p><p></p><p>"Yali!"</p><p></p><p>"Why attack the abode of the divine? Do you mean to desecrate the gods?"</p><p></p><p>Under the old priest's control, a fusion monster swung its whip, wrapping up dozens of soldiers and throwing them down from the heights. But immediately, two other fusion monsters charged up, blocking the old priest's fusion monster.</p><p></p><p>From the darkness came a heavy, solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"It is you, the disgraced Seron clan and accomplices of Shalord, who have desecrated the gods."</p><p></p><p>"It was you who touched the forbidden, desecrated and ruined the divine chalice bestowed by the gods, bringing disaster upon us."</p><p></p><p>"You are the shame of the royal family, the root of the kingdom's decline."</p><p></p><p>"And now you seek to seize and occupy the divine abode. As the King of Heinze, how can I tolerate your unforgivable sins?"</p><p></p><p>King Yali of Heinze stood atop the fusion monster Nini's head. As the fusion monster slithered, he made his way into the city of divine servants, slowly approaching the old priest and battlefield through the wide passage.</p><p></p><p>He calmly watched as the other side gradually fell into peril. Facing two opponents was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Seron clan's fusion monster was trapped and locked down by the two fusion monsters. The old priest was captured and brought before Yali.</p><p></p><p>The old priest looked at Yali, his initial fury gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>"Yali! You still can't forget the mistakes Shalord made?"</p><p></p><p>In the grand passage of the divine temple, Yali approached step by step, holding his scepter.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The old priest.</p><p></p><p>"Sloat is one of your Seron clan, the mistake he committed must be borne by you."</p><p></p><p>The newly crowned King Ari of Hynse stabbed the old priest to death with his scepter, just like how Leadley Ki had once judged the sinner Ens. </p><p></p><p>Carrying out an execution in this manner was the greatest insult and punishment to the royal family.</p><p></p><p>The crime of the other party will forever be nailed to the pillar of shame, witnessed by later generations.</p><p></p><p>Ari turned his head to look at his soldiers and all the people in the City of Servants.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>"The Seron clan deceived the gods, deceived King Yeser."</p><p></p><p>"Sloat of the Seron clan violated the taboo. It was he who deceived King Yeser into waging war against the sinners under the guise of a divine prophecy. Moreover, it was because he violated the taboo that King Yeser lost his life, causing us to lose the God-given wisdom of kingship."</p><p></p><p>"All of this is because Sloat of the Seron clan impersonated a divine messenger. How could these blasphemers occupy the divine palace?"</p><p></p><p>"I!"</p><p></p><p>"Ari, your king."</p><p></p><p>"Am the voice of God, God's agent on earth."</p><p></p><p>Thousands of soldiers cheered and roared, while the other people in the City of Servants knelt and bowed to Ari, showing their submission.</p><p></p><p>Ari dug out the glabella bone of the old priest, which was the Rook's Mark bestowed by the gods upon the royal bloodline family, the authority to command the Rook giants.</p><p></p><p>Now, it belonged to Ari.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the fourth Rook giant and took the first step towards consolidating and reclaiming the kingship.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Star was awakened and ran out of the temple.</p><p></p><p>She still did not know what had happened, but everything was already over.</p><p></p><p>On the freezing peak of the sacred mountain, she stood on the high foundation of the temple, watching her elderly father's mangled corpse being dragged out.</p><p></p><p>The city was filled with cheers from soldiers and wails of grief. She stood motionless on the heights, her gaze unfocused like a stone statue, blankly watching the scene below.</p><p></p><p>She felt as if she was still in a dream and had not woken up yet.</p><p></p><p>What she saw was merely a nightmare in her dream.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't real!"</p><p></p><p>"This isn't real!" </p><p></p><p>"This isn't real!"</p><p></p><p>When the corpse passed in front of her, she finally could not hold back and rushed down, throwing herself onto her father's body.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" She finally burst into loud wails.</p><p></p><p>King Ari of Hynse looked at Star. Of course, he knew about this heir of the Seron clan.</p><p></p><p>"Tears are a symbol of weakness. As a member of the royal family, even in death, one should hold their head up proudly. How could you show such an ugly demeanor?"</p><p></p><p>"To actually behave like those vile slaves and commoners, it's truly shameful."</p><p></p><p>Although feeling some disgust, Ari had no intention of killing Star.</p><p></p><p>As fellow royalty, he could not truly exterminate another royal branch, as that would weaken the power of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>Ari had already made plans to make Star the concubine of his son.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The new bride.</p><p></p><p>Then allow his son to succeed the Xilun family and become the new controller of the Sky Temple, transforming the remaining people of the Xilun family and the priests of the Sky Temple into his own power. </p><p></p><p>"Lock her up!"</p><p></p><p>Xing was dragged away forcefully by soldiers amidst her crying.</p><p></p><p>Even though she was a high-level priestess, she was insignificant in front of Ali and the four fusion monsters.</p><p></p><p>From this moment, the struggle for royal and divine power among the Sanye people began its prelude.</p><p></p><p>-----------</p><p></p><p>In the prison of the City of Divine Servants, moonlight shone through the narrow window, only wide enough for an arm to reach out.</p><p></p><p>Xing was trying to find a way to escape.</p><p></p><p>She knew that if she remained here, only a miserable fate awaited her.</p><p></p><p>But outside guarding her were two priests, and at the prison exit was a fusion monster. Any slight movement from her would immediately alert the priests and that fusion monster.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, it would also alert the King of Xinyai, Ali, that terrifying tyrant who seemed invincibly powerful to her.</p><p></p><p>She was extremely flustered and afraid, so afraid that her whole body went cold and trembled.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"  </p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly thought of someone, that strange but immensely powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Xing immediately knelt before the moonlight shining in from the window, hands clasped to her chest in a prayer posture to the divine messenger Poluo, making her request.</p><p></p><p>"Poluo!"</p><p>"Divine messenger!"  </p><p>"If you can truly hear me, please respond to my request."</p><p>"Please!"</p><p>"Save me!"</p><p></p><p>That night, a gentle breeze and faint dreamy starlight descended upon the City of Divine Servants. </p><p></p><p>The dreamy starlight passed in front of the fusion monster, which had no perception of it. The starlight rushed into the prison passage, and the two soldier guards immediately collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Pata!"</p><p></p><p>Poluo appeared inside the prison.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, one Sanye person after another fell asleep, and even the two divine priests could not avoid it.</p><p></p><p>He passed directly through the stone prison door, as if the door did not exist.</p><p></p><p>"My companion, you have finally found me."</p><p>"Are you ready to begin our great adventure with me?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Poluo, Xing felt like she had grasped a lifeline.</p><p></p><p>"Divine messenger Poluo, I have fallen into crisis."</p><p>"Please save me and get me out of here."</p><p></p><p>Poluo shook his head and laughed, spinning around Xing with his steps, the splendid golden robe flaring up at the corners: "Of course, isn't this why I came - to save you?"</p><p></p><p>He stopped spinning and stood before Xing.</p><p></p><p>Looking into her eyes with an unusually serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"But if I save you, you must repay me."</p><p></p><p>Xing: "What repayment do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Poluo: "You must perfect your projection divine art, and then teach it to me."</p>

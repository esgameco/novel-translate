        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light of the illusory art unleashed by "The Final Chapter" covered the area within dozens of meters in the blink of an eye, and all the people present were pulled into the illusion and completely immobilized.</p><p></p><p>Sander's pupils suddenly went blank, and his vision turned completely white.</p><p></p><p>"The Final Chapter" gradually expanded before his eyes, and the words on it flowed past bit by bit, fully revealing the past and secrets from hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The journey of the great poet, who carried the divine artifact left by the Lord of Dreams, writing "The Ode to the King of Wisdom", the tribulations, and the excitement and scenes of stepping onto the land bestowed by the gods and meeting the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>The messenger standing at the right hand of the divine being told the great poet her true name, and the dreamlike creative power that could create objects with a wave of her hand, giving the great poet an incomparable shock and impact on his soul.</p><p></p><p>He also saw the great poet's later lamentations and regrets over this scene.</p><p></p><p>"If Hinsai also had this kind of power, wouldn't he be able to create a new era?"</p><p></p><p>"Can we thus escape the endless cycle of reincarnation and open up a new future?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, he felt himself being pulled into a hazy, illusory scene.</p><p></p><p>He first saw a huge palace, and from the corner came the sound of carving. He followed the sound and saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>"Master?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was carving a stele in the corner, and his work "The Puppet of Fate" was embedded in the wall of the palace above.</p><p></p><p>This was the scene of Stan Tito's dream, and the second time he had seen the messenger of the gods.</p><p></p><p>He used illusion to preserve this scene.</p><p></p><p>Sander wanted to approach Stan Tito, to talk to him, to tell him how much he missed him.</p><p></p><p>But he found that he was like an outsider, and the other party couldn't hear his words, and he couldn't touch the other party.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the messenger of the divine being descended.</p><p></p><p>Sander was shocked to see the most beautiful being in the world descend into this dream, and he shrank back and leaned against the wall. He even felt that as a slave standing here, it was a desecration of the sacred.</p><p></p><p>Sander witnessed the conversation between Stan Tito and the messenger of the divine being, and finally understood what the master wanted to tell him.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito asked the messenger of the divine being, "O Messenger of the Gods! Can we obtain the grace of the divine beings by opening the gates of the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>The messenger of the divine being replied, "The key to opening the gates of the divine realm is not what you call 'The Final Chapter', which only records the story of Tito's life."</p><p></p><p>"Whether the divine beings bestow the power of creation depends on how you choose."</p><p></p><p>"Only when the Trifoliate people renounce the power of destruction will the gates of the divine realm open."</p><p></p><p>"Hope and light will descend upon the mortal world, and the power of dreams and creation will usher in a new era."</p><p></p><p>Sander finally knew what Stan Tito's so-called last thing to do was, and understood the meaning of his words "I go to seek the future of the Trifoliate people."</p><p></p><p>He also knew that Stan Tito had successfully found the future of the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is this what you wanted to do?"</p><p></p><p>Sander once again understood the greatness of Stan Tito, and was shocked by his unwavering heart in seeking the future.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed an admiring expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind him, and starlight like a dream flowed out from behind him and gradually flowed towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Sander, are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>"To become the inheritor of Stan's will and dreams, to become -"</p><p></p><p>"The messenger of the new era."</p><p></p><p>His body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Sander recognized the voice of the messenger of the divine being.</p><p></p><p>He turned around and looked into the light.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Sander disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The tide on the seaside was rising higher and higher, gradually covering the feet of the people standing on the shore.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the fishing village and the priest of the Tito family, as well as their slaves and soldiers, also woke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>They looked around for Sander's figure, but saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>The priest ran quickly on the beach, searching everywhere for Sander's traces. He had come all the way from the border of the Volcano Kingdom upon receiving the news, just to see if the second saint, Stan Tito, had left anything behind.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Stan Tito had actually left "The Final Chapter" here.</p><p></p><p>He saw the sacred relic of the great poet appear before him, but was unable to obtain it, which made him extremely regretful.</p><p></p><p>He cursed loudly, "Vile slave, you think you can steal..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you take the Tito family's belongings and run away, will there be no consequences?"</p><p></p><p>"But those are the relics of the Saint. The whole world will be looking for you, and the Tito family will not let you go."</p><p></p><p>There were no words to express his frustration and anger. If he could obtain "The Final Chapter", he might be able to become the heir to the Saint's will, the patriarch of the Saint's family.</p><p></p><p>The priest finally looked at the small hut left by Stan Tito: "Be careful, and bring back everything inside."</p><p></p><p>But such a large-scale illusory power and the powerful fluctuation of wisdom power also caught the attention of the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the City of Divine Descent brought people to stop the priest who wanted to take away everything from Stan Tito's residence, and the two sides began to fight over the relics and belongings left by the Saint Stan.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the city sneered at the priest: "The Tito family of Saints?"</p><p></p><p>"The true Tito family has been extinguished due to the conspiracy of the Volcano Kingdom, and the second-generation Saint Stan Tito left no descendants. What Tito family are you from?"</p><p></p><p>"You are just a collateral branch, and you dare to claim the name of the Saint."</p><p></p><p>The priest did not show any weakness: "On what grounds?"</p><p></p><p>"On the grounds of our surname."</p><p></p><p>The priest from the branch of the Tito family was not afraid of the lord of the City of Divine Descent, even though the latter was more powerful. This place still belonged to the City of Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>But the brilliant reputation of the Tito family, like the sun, and the extinction of the main branch, gave them something to rely on.</p><p></p><p>They, who had produced two generations of Saints, were not at all afraid of a lord whose power had already been marginalized.</p><p></p><p>In the Kingdom of Hinsai, there were not many who really dared to take action against those with the surname Tito, at least they were unwilling to openly conflict with them.</p><p></p><p>The two sides remained deadlocked, and the lord of the City of Divine Descent would not let the priest take away the relics of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>While the priest insisted that everything here belonged to the Tito family and did not budge an inch.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the footsteps of a large army kicked up dust as they approached the seaside.</p><p></p><p>King Heniel himself came here with his people, ostensibly to inspect the City of Divine Descent and meet with the prince of the Abyss Kingdom to sign an alliance.</p><p></p><p>But all this did not require his personal presence.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that the relics of Stan Tito and "The Final Chapter" had appeared in the world, and immediately came in person to investigate.</p><p></p><p>When the priest of the Tito family saw King Heniel, his fearless attitude immediately softened.</p><p></p><p>He knew well the hardness and methods of this ruler. The Tito branch clan had always wanted to become the heir to the Saint's will, but they had been rejected by King Heniel time and again, and he would not let them bear the name of the Saint.</p><p></p><p>Heniel looked at this priest who had been arrogant before, but now cowered on the ground, and let out a contemptuous chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of people were the great poet Tito and the second-generation Saint Stan Tito?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know what kind of people you are?"</p><p></p><p>"Still wanting the title of the Saint's family."</p><p></p><p>King Heniel looked down at the priest and asked him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you worthy of it?"</p><p></p><p>The priest tried to say something, but was met with a blow from the scabbard of Heniel's sacred sword.</p><p></p><p>"Or do you want me to expose all your rotten affairs? Do you think I don't know how the Saint Tito family was extinguished?"</p><p></p><p>"You filthy scum."</p><p></p><p>"Be more honest."</p><p></p><p>Facing Heniel's blows, the priest lay on the ground, daring not to lift his head, trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he heard Heniel mention how the main branch was extinguished, he was even more terrified, as no one knew better than Heniel about the affairs between them and Prince Weiss Hosen of the Volcano Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Heniel didn't even want to look at him anymore, and even disgustedly wiped his sword scabbard.</p><p></p><p>He turned to the noble lord and asked about the information on Sander.</p><p></p><p>The minor nobleman was also frightened by the king's presence, and his speech was somewhat disjointed and confused.</p><p></p><p>"He was a slave, but recently he claimed to have a name and called himself Sander."</p><p></p><p>"How ridiculous, a slave giving himself a name."</p><p></p><p>Heniel said, "I told you to answer what I asked, don't say anything extra."</p><p></p><p>The minor nobleman nodded repeatedly: "Yes! Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel also heard some suspicion in Sander's name.</p><p></p><p>"Sander? The preacher? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Heniel then asked, "Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Sander had disappeared in a flash of light while holding a Sun Cup, in which "The Final Chapter" was revealed, Heniel immediately thought of something, for he had also undergone the test of the divine messenger.</p><p></p><p>Although he had ultimately failed the test, he knew what the Saint Stan Tito would have obtained from the divine.</p><p></p><p>Heniel became somewhat excited, and immediately ordered the lord of the City of Divine Descent and his own people who had come with him.</p><p></p><p>"Wait here."</p>

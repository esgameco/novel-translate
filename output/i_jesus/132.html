        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the side hall of the Sky Temple. </p><p></p><p>There were no statues of gods, nor any altars for the priests.</p><p></p><p>The central hall was empty, with only a painting hanging on the central wall - "The Bloodline of the King", depicting the scene of the Wise King Laideli bestowing the power of wisdom upon the first king's sons. The dome's mural was painted using the new technique of colored ceramic tiles.</p><p></p><p>This place was more like a council chamber, with long-backed chairs lining the walls. The high priests from the various temples were currently seated there, whispering and chatting amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>They all wore the robes of priests, with the ****'s brand indicating which of the nine major temples they hailed from.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the absence of the High Priest of the Sky Temple, Sander, they were speaking quite freely, even disrespectfully.</p><p></p><p>"There's actually a way to become a Third-Tier Priest? Where did he get that from?" questioned a Spiritual Priest from the Iron Temple, full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, he must have created it himself!" mocked another priest.</p><p></p><p>"I knew he was holding back. The things he gave us before were not complete." Someone angrily stood up, as if their own possessions had been stolen by Sander.</p><p></p><p>"That lowly slave, hoarding the gifts bestowed upon us by the gods and saints. Those belong to the Hinsai, to the saints and spirits!" Emotions were stirred up, and some began to speak ill.</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand why Saint Stane chose such a person to be the heir to his will," someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, footsteps were heard in the corridor outside, and the voices in the side hall gradually quieted down.</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned towards the door.</p><p></p><p>The doors were pushed open by some temple servants, and Sander's figure appeared, wearing the sacred robe adorned with the nine ritual brands, appearing holy and noble.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the slave brand on his neck stood out, making everyone feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Sander paused at the door, looking at everyone. </p><p></p><p>Despite their disdain, the priests in the room all stood up and bowed to Sander.</p><p></p><p>Sander's mouth curled into a disdainful smile as he turned and headed towards the high priest's seat.</p><p></p><p>"I do possess the method to become a Third-Tier Ritual Priest, but this power was not given to me by the saints and divine messengers."</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>"It is a power I found myself, a future I explored."</p><p></p><p>"I have no intention of handing over my discoveries to you greedy and selfish parasites."</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's no need for you all to put on an act here."</p><p></p><p>"I know what you're all thinking, and I heard your earlier words."</p><p></p><p>"We have always been enemies, we've had many conflicts, I've tried to suppress you, and you've killed those I hold dear."</p><p></p><p>"So, there's no need for us to pretend to be on the same side here."</p><p></p><p>"We utterly despise each other, yet cannot directly kill one another. Gathering together is the most disgusting thing imaginable."</p><p></p><p>His words flowed more smoothly, the hatred evident.</p><p></p><p>The people present were stunned. They all knew this was the truth, but no one had dared to say it so directly. Wasn't this just tearing off the veil covering the infighting and ugliness among the priests?</p><p></p><p>But Sander didn't care, he directly began explaining the reason he had summoned them here.</p><p></p><p>"We hate each other so much, yet I have still invited you all here."</p><p></p><p>"It's because..."</p><p></p><p>"I've gradually come to understand something."</p><p></p><p>"Saint Stane wanted me to bring the power of dreams and creation to the kingdom of Hinsai, but not to give it to you."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"You people don't deserve the power bestowed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"The new age's sun cannot tolerate the likes of you, the fat maggots in the dark ravines."</p><p></p><p>The group of priests could no longer hold back, they stood up from their seats, some pointing at Sander and shouting.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you're saying?"</p><p></p><p>"Sander? Have you gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>"You, a slave of unknown origins, daring to call yourself the heir to the saint's will, what right do you have to condemn us, the noble-blooded?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd became agitated, everyone standing up.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't believe it, staring wide-eyed at Sander.</p><p></p><p>How dare he, how dare he say such things?</p><p></p><p>Sander directly sat down on the high priest's seat, looking at the dumbfounded temple priests sitting on either side.</p><p></p><p>His disdainful smile grew more intense, his gaze gradually becoming more sharp and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, 'how dare I'? I can be even bolder."</p><p></p><p>"You want the power of the Third-Tier, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Then, let me show you!"</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the Ritual Spirit appeared beside Sander, the powerful spiritual pressure directly enveloping the entire hall, causing several priests with insufficient power to be knocked down.</p><p></p><p>Sander clapped his hands, and immediately the doors and windows all closed automatically.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the side hall was plunged into darkness, with only Sander and them remaining.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadow of the Ritual Spirit illuminated half of Sander's face, revealing his cold gaze and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The more low-key and calm a person is, the more determined and unstoppable they become when making a decision and erupting.</p><p></p><p>That was exactly the case with Sander now.</p><p></p><p>Everyone finally realized that something was amiss, and that the lowly slave in front of them seemed to be truly about to attack them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they also discovered that the people present were the leaders of the forces that had previously tried to eliminate Sander - all of them were his sworn enemies.</p><p></p><p>The foremost among them was the current clan leader of the Tito family.</p><p></p><p>The others, such as the priests from the Ceramic and Ice Temples, were not invited, clearly not part of this gathering.</p><p></p><p>They had previously thought the others were just late, but now it seemed Sander had only invited his mortal enemies, intending to eliminate them all at once.</p><p></p><p>"This madman is really going to attack us."</p><p></p><p>"We can't just sit and wait to die."</p><p></p><p>"Kill him and then break out."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Second-Tier Spiritual Priests simultaneously attacked Sander, their weapons controlled by spiritual power and hurtling towards the one sitting on the high seat.</p><p></p><p>But the Ritual Spirit raised a hand, and a spiritual power barrier completely blocked their attacks.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power and transformed spiritual body strength were incomparable to that of the Second-Tier.</p><p></p><p>A confident expression appeared on Sander's face: "Ritual Spirit, Clay Form."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the ritual law brands within the Ritual Spirit's body erupted in an earthy gray light.</p><p></p><p>Surging mud poured down from above, engulfing the entire room.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was instantly wrapped and swallowed by the mud.</p><p></p><p>The Second-Tier Spiritual Priests, who needed rituals to unleash their full power, were now no match for the Third-Tier Ritual Priest in this confrontation, revealing the vast difference in their abilities.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Difference in Lands</p><p></p><p>Sander looked at these enemies, whom he had once found utterly disgusting and abhorrent, struggling in the mud, without a trace of compassion in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p></p><p>"Sander, what are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the consequences of your actions? You've broken the rules. We are the noblest people in the kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"You can't lay a hand on us. We are the vassals of King Henir, the pillars of the kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Sander laughed, without a care in the world.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I couldn't lay a hand on you because I was a part of you."</p><p></p><p>"But now, it's different."</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I am no longer the High Priest of the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>He was now free of any burdens, and he couldn't be bothered to talk to these people about rules.</p><p></p><p>Sander unleashed all the resentment and hatred he had accumulated over the years. He was not a man skilled in scheming, nor could he play the game of politics and power.</p><p></p><p>What he could do, was to punish these people in his own way.</p><p></p><p>"So I don't need to talk to you about rules, because we were never on the same side."</p><p></p><p>"You've plotted against me time and time again, framed me, and even gone after the people around me, killing my followers."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I've forgotten all of that?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"I've kept it all in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"You filthy, disgusting maggots, all of you can just die!"</p><p></p><p>Sander took out a set of nested dolls from the sleeve of his robe.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the dolls floated in front of him, one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Cursed Spirits, right before his eyes, killed one priest after another.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>They extracted the Mythic Blood from within them.</p><p></p><p>Mythic Blood that was not a voluntary gift of power could not be used. Cursed Mythic Blood was like poison.</p><p></p><p>But Sander had no intention of infusing it into himself. He extracted their Mythic Blood and infused it into the nested dolls, turning them into Cursed Dolls.</p><p></p><p>The people present were utterly terrified by this bloody, horrific scene.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that the slave who used to bury himself in books and speak little would be so ruthless and decisive when his heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>They wailed and begged Sander to spare them.</p><p></p><p>"Spare me!"</p><p></p><p>"I was wrong, Sander, I was really wrong."</p><p></p><p>"We won't go against you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Some even cried out, "Why didn't you use this powerful strength earlier? We wouldn't have dared to defy you."</p><p></p><p>The Mythic Blood transformed into streams of light, flowing into the dolls. The magical seals imprinted on the dolls lit up, and the once-inanimate objects came alive.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the priests present became the Cursed Dolls Sander had created.</p><p></p><p>Sander had created the second magical artifact in this world.</p><p></p><p>The first was the Sacred Boat created by the Divine Messenger Hira, and Sander's idea came from that.</p><p></p><p>Only the combination of third-tier power and the magical seals could create such a unique thing.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful strength was utterly irresistible, dangerously powerful and terrifyingly captivating.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Under the power of the Cursed Spirits, dozens of second-tier Spiritual Realm priests were killed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The nested dolls were one by one fitted onto the bodies, finally merging into a single doll.</p><p></p><p>As the Cursed Doll transformed between clay, ceramic, and stone figures, it also grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>Finally,</p><p></p><p>It solidified into a stone colossus over thirty meters tall.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly expanding stone giant broke through the roof of the temple, even consuming the stone of the temple itself as part of its body.</p><p></p><p>The giant stepped out from the temple and headed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The intense battle and commotion erupting from the Sky Temple, of course, also caught the attention of the City of Divine Servants. The royal guard immediately sealed off the city.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not expect that what was coming towards them was the High Priest of the Sky Temple, and the Cursed Doll Colossus under his control.</p><p></p><p>Sander stood on the shoulder of the giant, with Haru by his side, stepping down from the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>The massive size, while not comparable to the former Ruhe Giant, was still terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Sky Temple and the City of Divine Servants was stunned, watching the giant. The streets of the city were filled with a panicked, fleeing crowd, and even the royal guards on the city walls retreated in fear, not daring to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, even King Henir in the palace was alerted.</p><p></p><p>King Henir, protected by his entourage of priests, came before Sander, staring in shock at the Cursed Doll Colossus, then looking at Sander.</p><p></p><p>"My High Priest, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Sander still held great respect for this king.</p><p></p><p>"Mighty King of Hinsai, I am leaving."</p><p></p><p>King Henir suddenly understood. He sighed, "Why must it be this way?"</p><p></p><p>Sander bowed respectfully, "I have disappointed you."</p><p></p><p>"A person like me was never suited to be the High Priest serving the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone..."</p><p></p><p>"Becoming the High Sky Priest."</p><p></p><p>He looked at King Henir, "I have betrayed your trust and your appointment. Please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>"But I have brought the power of the ritual to Hinsai, and have not kept anything for myself. You no longer need me."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I must go and do what I was truly meant to do."</p><p></p><p>King Henir still wanted to persuade him to stay, but Sander did not respond further.</p><p></p><p>The giant stepped down from the mountain, following the edge of the sacred lake, and headed towards the vast, distant lands.</p><p></p><p>On the shoulder of the giant,</p><p></p><p>The child asked Sander, "Master Sander, where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>Sander told him, "I will establish a place of our own, a sacred hall of knowledge and truth, a paradise of truth where one's identity, bloodline, and origin do not matter."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the priesthood will no longer be controlled by a single family or person, or any one kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"There,"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone will take pride in possessing more knowledge. They will explore the paths of power and might, seeking the secrets of this world."</p><p></p><p>The child listened, his eyes filled with longing and curiosity, "What will that place be called?"</p><p></p><p>Sander also smiled, "Perhaps it will be called an academy, or a castle, or a tower."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the name,"</p><p></p><p>"Its essence will not change - it will be a place to impart knowledge and ideals."</p><p></p><p>Sander finally understood.</p><p></p><p>He was a scholar, a disseminator of the ideals and beliefs of the saints.</p><p></p><p>He could never have been one of those nobles and power-holders from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>He turned back, gazing at the fading holy mountain behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps,"</p><p></p><p>"I should never have come here in the first place."</p><p></p><p>He had finally broken free of the shackles and set out on his own path.</p><p></p><p>In front of the palace in the City of Divine Servants, King Henir watched the giant in the distance, and the departing Sander.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered, and he asked the attendant beside him, "Have I made a mistake?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Redley had been kneeling under the statue of the deity, feeling despair, his expression as if the sky had fallen. </p><p></p><p>Yet the deity Yin found his anguish amusing and asked him, "Why do you want them to be able to see me so badly?"</p><p></p><p>Redley spread his arms, devoutly saying to the deity Yin on the altar, "How can one have faith in a deity one cannot see? How can one listen to the deity's will?"</p><p></p><p>Yin asked again, "Why should they have faith in me?"</p><p></p><p>Redley suddenly couldn't say a word, for in his view, having faith in a deity required no reason.</p><p></p><p>Yin asked again, "Or is it that you think it's important for me that they have faith in me? Or that I will cease to exist if they lose faith in me?"</p><p></p><p>"I am right here, whether they can see me or not, I am always here."</p><p></p><p>"I also have no will to promulgate to you, as long as you can multiply and create your own civilization."</p><p></p><p>Redley knelt forward until he reached Yin's feet, "We have faith in you, not because you need us, but because we need you."</p><p></p><p>"It's like..." </p><p></p><p>He pondered for a long time but couldn't find the right descriptive words.</p><p></p><p>Until he saw the ocean and sun outside through the temple's pillars.</p><p></p><p>"It's like! Life needs water, needs light."</p><p></p><p>Yin smiled slightly. As an atheist, even if the true creator deity was standing before him now, he would only see it as a powerful higher life form.</p><p></p><p>His concept of a deity was completely different from Redley's concept.</p><p></p><p>His expression was one of neither affirmation nor denial, disdainful of the word "deity", even though he himself was called one.</p><p></p><p>The Redley below him, however, was so steadfast.</p><p></p><p>But what Redley said next moved Yin.</p><p></p><p>He placed his head under the altar, against Yin's feet, tears in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His tone became solemn, his voice somewhat sad.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yin, what I fear most is that if I die one day, who will serve you in this temple, who will guard this temple until the end of time?"</p><p></p><p>"If even my children cannot see you, then how can this continue?"</p><p></p><p>"You are so supremely exalted, you can bestow wisdom and life upon all things, you can..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Enough to change this desolate and lifeless world, yet unable to change one's own loneliness."</p><p></p><p>Yinshen looked at him. </p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to say, this is just your own thought.</p><p></p><p>I don't need anyone to guard this huge tomb mound, nor will I stay in this temple until the end of time. One day I will eventually leave. What you are guarding is not me, but merely a stone.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Liedelijī's tears, he suddenly softened for some reason.</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you want!"</p><p></p><p>Liedelijī wiped away his tears and looked up at Yinshen.</p><p></p><p>"I want to create a great civilization, a civilization that will never decline."</p><p></p><p>"I want them to worship You forever, forever surrounding this temple below."</p><p></p><p>"I want to make an everlasting vow with all the Trifolians, so that they will guard this palace generation after generation, engraving their belief in You into their bloodlines."</p><p></p><p>Yinshen shook his head at the still naive Liedelijī.</p><p></p><p>"These things only have meaning for you, they are meaningless to me."</p><p></p><p>"There is no eternal civilization, even the sun in the sky will eventually burn out, the universe is inevitably heading towards destruction."  </p><p></p><p>"No matter how great a civilization, it cannot withstand the erosion of time."</p><p></p><p>"Even the most devout belief will be forgotten, and the tallest and hardest temples and statues will ultimately collapse into ruins."</p><p></p><p>Liedelijī did not understand what this meant, only feeling that these words penetrated through the ages and eternity, a mystery he could not reach.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen stroked the bone helmet on his head, his voice not as calm and hollow as usual.</p><p></p><p>"But if you are willing to do it, then go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>"If these things are what you consider the meaning of life."</p><p></p><p>Liedelijī finally said, "If one day I die, please God, take something off my body and keep it by Your side."</p><p></p><p>"This way!"</p><p></p><p>"I will be able to accompany God forever."</p><p></p><p>Yinshen watched Liedelijī's back as he left the temple, and finally felt that Liedelijī was no longer an insect, a thing he had casually created.</p><p></p><p>He was a living life, a person with feelings.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>They surrounded the lofty temple, continuously expanding their own city, encircling the pyramid and temple in the center.</p><p></p><p>From the initial number of Trifolians...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Hundreds became thousands now. </p><p></p><p>This island finally had a semblance of civilization and the appearance of a city-state.</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians understood reverence. Civilization had a distribution of power. They did not dare call Leadri's name, instead calling him the Wise King, and referring to this city as the God-Given City. </p><p></p><p>Meaning, everything was a gift from the divine.</p><p></p><p>A palace was built in the valley behind the pyramid, where Leadri and his children lived.</p><p></p><p>Leadri appointed his sons to various positions in the God-Given City, some in charge of construction, some overseeing food and warehouses, etc.  </p><p></p><p>They held power and unified the thousands of Trifolians, who originally were equal but now divided into different classes.</p><p></p><p>This Trifolian kingdom or city-state began to have a simple power structure.  </p><p></p><p>Leadri was the king, his sons the first generation of Trifolian nobles.</p><p></p><p>One day, Leadri's second son suddenly ran in and knelt before him, his face full of panic.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wise King, more have been swallowed by the sea."</p><p></p><p>Leadri sat on the cold stone throne, looking at his second son.</p><p></p><p>"How many?"</p><p></p><p>"The entire squad never returned."</p><p></p><p>Leadri stood up, somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>He was not just worried that people had died, but the hidden crisis behind it.</p><p></p><p>Being "swallowed by the sea" referred to those who entered the deep sea and never returned, most never coming back.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time.</p><p></p><p>As the Trifolian population grew, the food from catching insects and harvesting sea slugs was no longer enough, even as they tried drying sea plants as food, it was still inadequate.  </p><p></p><p>Their massive size for that era, thousands gathered on the island, was enough to deplete the surrounding sea, and there could be no food on land.</p><p></p><p>Their appearance was too abrupt for this world, which was not yet prepared to receive Trifolian civilization.</p><p></p><p>People in the God-Given City began starving to death. They had to venture into the deep sea, which was far from the tranquility they imagined.</p><p></p><p>The ocean could give birth to life, but also devour it.</p><p></p><p>Many Trifolians were lost in the deep sea, trapped in dangerous areas, or encountered sudden situations and never returned.</p><p></p><p>Leadri knew the Trifolian civilization faced its first crisis.</p>

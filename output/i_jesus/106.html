        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Stan Tito learned of the disappearance of the priest, he suddenly stood up and stared at the servant with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>After confirming it several times, he lowered his head and sighed, slowly sitting down at the table.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, but not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked because he had lost a close friend, but he had long expected the priest to die.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the bone flute on the stone table and brought it to his lips.</p><p></p><p>The bone flute emitted a long, desolate sound, a melody often played by the Trilians when reminiscing about departed friends and loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was the only one who knew Heniel's secret.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito did not like to stand out, nor did he like adventures and risky things. What he liked most was carving his own epic poems and mythological legends in his workshop.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he suddenly felt that he could no longer retreat and escape.</p><p></p><p>At least, he should reveal everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>After playing the complete melody on the bone flute, he put down his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a marionette?"</p><p></p><p>"Stan?"</p><p></p><p>Stan asked himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he heard the voice of the queen when she enfeoffed him.</p><p></p><p>The echoes resounded in the vast palace, and countless people watched him. The scene was so grand and solemn.</p><p></p><p>He was nervous, his steps stiff, his head dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of Saint Tito."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>"The inheritor of the will of the great poet Tito."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's eyes were filled with a smile, and after the smile, there was determination.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to return what the Queen has given me."</p><p></p><p>After Heniel consolidated the power of the City of Servants and completely grasped the power, he still made the decision to ascend the throne. The Siren family, who controlled the Star Realm Kingdom, handed over their crown, and the entire Siren family trembled in fear and dared not resist Heniel's might and power.</p><p></p><p>The coronation ceremony will be held in the palace and the Temple of the Sky Deity in the City of Servants. Heniel will become the new king in front of everyone at the palace, and then go to the Temple of the Sky Deity for the final coronation.</p><p></p><p>After everything is over, he will become the king of the Star Realm Kingdom, the Volcano Kingdom, and the Sele Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>It was a clear morning, and soldiers stood in every corner of the street.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of civilians flocked to the streets, heading towards the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>The dense crowd chanted Heniel's name as they passed through the streets.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the common people, Heniel, who saved the City of Servants and drove away the Samo Kingdom, was a hero, and the civilians in the city had a very good impression of him.</p><p></p><p>At least, in comparison with those aristocrats and priests who abandoned the City of Servants and fled in a panic at the time, the difference was obvious.</p><p></p><p>Heniel, holding the scepter of Hinsai, stood in front of the palace to accept the cheers of all the people.</p><p></p><p>"King!"</p><p></p><p>"King Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone raised their arm and shouted.</p><p></p><p>After the first person shouted, the entire square and streets were filled with the shouts of "King".</p><p></p><p>Heniel raised the scepter, and the voices gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"I know that many of you here question me, despise me, and hate me."</p><p></p><p>"Because I am not a bright king, and my origins are not so illustrious. In their eyes, a person like me is not qualified to be king."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"What great achievements have those self-proclaimed bright kings and noble-born kings made? Have they brought any changes to the world of Hinsai?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they really better than me?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's voice was calm and flat, but it was filled with power.</p><p></p><p>"The people here have different identities - royalty, nobility, commoners, and even slaves; different occupations - soldiers, merchants, craftsmen, fishermen, and so on."</p><p></p><p>"But everyone's identity has been predetermined since birth."</p><p></p><p>"When the previous kings were in power, you had no chance to change. But now it's different."</p><p></p><p>The calm tone suddenly turned into a raging storm.</p><p></p><p>Heniel's gaze changed completely, becoming feverishly passionate. He stretched out his hand and roared.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I promise all of you, I pledge to all my subjects."</p><p></p><p>"I, Heniel, will give everyone a fair chance, whether you are nobility or commoner, whether you are the heir of a noble family or a bastard."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you work hard, you can become an official or a general in the kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Even the..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Nobility and titles," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who you are or what your status is, we will change this world together."</p><p></p><p>Heniell's origins had already determined that he would have a hard time gaining the support of the old aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Even at this very moment, almost all the established powers present were thinking of how to defeat and kill him.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, he had prepared to support the rising aristocrats and forces, determined to suppress the old families, especially those that had been passed down since the Yesser and Laidley eras.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he establish a stable new empire.</p><p></p><p>His speech immediately silenced the crowd.</p><p></p><p>It also caused the old aristocrats to retreat in fear one by one.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a thunderous roar erupted in the square.</p><p></p><p>"Heniell the King!"</p><p></p><p>Escorted and surrounded by soldiers, Heniell headed towards the Sky Temple. The soldiers stopped at the foot of the Sky Temple, and Heniell ascended the stairs alone.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Sky Temple, Stan Tito stood quietly.</p><p></p><p>He held the relics of the saints, the keys to opening the gates of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Heniell's gaze burned with intensity as he took the complete "Final Chapter" from Stan Tito's hands, proving his divine status.</p><p></p><p>Everything was so perfect.</p><p></p><p>However, not everything was as he had anticipated. Stan Tito, standing high above and watching Heniell's ascent, suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Just recently, a priest of the Sky Temple, my friend, suddenly disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"Heniell, do you know what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Heniell suddenly felt uneasy. "Lucky son, what are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito continued, "Before his disappearance, he had been investigating the cause of the Queen's death."</p><p></p><p>"But when he found the key clues, he disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"He told me then that the Queen's death was related to you, Heniell. Can you explain?"</p><p></p><p>Heniell's gaze immediately changed, and he roared in anger, "Shut up! You shut up!"</p><p></p><p>But Stan Tito, as if he hadn't heard, waved his hand, and a illusory projection appeared in the sky. The projection showed the ambitious and illusory words Heniell had spoken to his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>The massive illusory projection was visible to everyone in the City of Servants, and all eyes were drawn to Stan Tito and Heniell above.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito also saw the commotion and clamor immediately erupt in the City of Servants, but he no longer wanted to listen.</p><p></p><p>He left the gates of the Sky Temple, walking along the side corridor towards the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Heniell! Swallowed by the black mire of the Hinsai realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I will not crown you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Stan Tito walked to the end of the corridor and leaped down from the side of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>Heniell's expression immediately changed, and he hurried to pursue the high ground.</p><p></p><p>The other was the inheritor of the will of this generation's saint, the renowned Lucky Son of the entire Hinsai realm. Even if he died, he could not die in this way.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>At the side of the holy mountain, the earth worms appeared.</p><p></p><p>Their tentacles extended towards the falling Stan Tito in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>However, to everyone's surprise, the tentacles passed through Stan Tito's image.</p><p></p><p>It was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The illusion dissipated in an instant, leaving behind only a small sunflower cup.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito had disappeared without a trace, escaping with the "Final Chapter" and the key to opening the gates of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>No one could have predicted that the seemingly ordinary and low-profile Lucky Son would suddenly display such advanced illusory arts, which even high-level priests could not control.</p><p></p><p>The earth worms came to the foot of the Sky Temple and handed the sunflower cup to Heniell.</p><p></p><p>Heniell looked at the golden flower in his hand, and his gaze gradually became more composed.</p><p></p><p>Facing this situation, facing the various sounds coming from below, he suddenly let out a disdainful laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Lucky Son, do you think this can stop me from ascending the throne?"</p><p></p><p>"I've told you before."</p><p></p><p>He paused, speaking each word clearly.</p><p></p><p>"I am the one who goes against the current."</p><p></p><p>He slowly stepped up the stairs, arriving at the gates of the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the chaotic crowd below, at all the questioning gazes directed at him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he resolutely crowned himself in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the whole world opposes me, I will still go against the tide."</p>

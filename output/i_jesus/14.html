        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Outside the God-blessed city, more and more Trifolians had gathered. Everyone was trembling as they looked at the giant beasts in the ocean, whose gaping mouths seemed about to swallow the sun in the sky. </p><p></p><p>Some were even so frightened that their legs went weak and they collapsed onto the sand, scraping backwards and then crawling to the back of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>"How could there be such huge monsters!"</p><p>"What are these monsters going to do? They're not going to crawl onto land, are they?"</p><p></p><p>The Wise King Leadriki also came to the shore, surrounded by his entourage, becoming the pillar of everyone's strength.</p><p></p><p>When he saw those terrifying giant beasts roaring towards the sky, he immediately turned his head to look at the highest point of the pyramid temple. </p><p></p><p>He knew that these monsters must be mythical creatures created by the God of Creation, and although their forms were somewhat different, he recognized at a glance that these monsters possessed the fused power of the Monster Queen Shallie.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King raised his hand high, attracting everyone's attention. </p><p></p><p>People looked towards this strong Trifolian wearing a crown, whose every move and gesture could influence all Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid!"</p><p>"These monsters are servants of the gods."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Leadriki spoke, his voice resonated in everyone's mind, and a strange power instantly calmed the agitated and panicked crowd.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that these monsters were servants of the gods, they were no longer afraid, watching the fused monsters from afar and marveling at the gods' mighty power.</p><p></p><p>He instructed a few of his sons to calm all the people and forbid them from approaching the giant monster beasts.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Leadriki hurried up to the top of the pyramid temple, where he saw the God admiring his own masterpieces in front of the temple. </p><p></p><p>The God lowered his head and looked at Leadriki, who was climbing up step by step, until he stopped and knelt before him.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>"Do you like it?"</p><p></p><p>Leadriki was dazed for a moment, not understanding what the God meant by those words.</p><p></p><p>The God then said, "This is the gift I'm bestowing upon you!"</p><p></p><p>"With them, whether in the deep sea or on land, nothing will be able to obstruct your path anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you wanting to build a great civilization? Being confined to this island, how could that be considered great?"</p><p></p><p>Leadriki stared blankly at the God, never expecting the God to bestow such a gift upon him.</p><p></p><p>The God asked him, "Don't you like it?"</p><p></p><p>Leadriki's tears streamed down his face as he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"God!" he said. "Your..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The eldest son would never forget this day.</p><p></p><p>But after considering it, he continued: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"Can I give this opportunity to my son?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shenhua's words did not reveal any emotion: "Only those with the power of wisdom can communicate with and control these fusion monsters. Mortals cannot control these mythical species."</p><p></p><p>Redley hurriedly said: "My son Yesser can definitely do it. He has inherited my bloodline and talents."</p><p></p><p>One could hear Redley's deep love for his son.</p><p></p><p>"Bring him to see me tomorrow, and I will bestow upon him the mark to control the fusion monsters."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen had no objections. Bestowing these fusion monsters not only helped Redley achieve his ideals but also allowed the Trifoliate people to breed these fusion monsters for him.</p><p></p><p>Through cycles of death and rebirth, the transformation of embryos and life.</p><p></p><p>These fusion monsters would possess more and more mythical substances. Eventually, enough mythical substances would be born from them.</p><p></p><p>If creating fusion monsters did not require extracting and consuming Shari's mythical blood, Yin Shen would have wanted to create a few more to achieve this goal faster.</p><p></p><p>Yesser was still watching the excitement of those monsters by the sea when he was called back to the palace of the King of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>He saw the dignified look in his father's eyes that could not conceal his joy. When his father saw him, he hurried down from the throne and placed his hand on Yesser's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>His father looked at him with expectant eyes, a gaze that made him feel heavy yet joyful inside.</p><p></p><p>"Yesser!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>"Starting tomorrow, you will become a priest of God!"</p><p></p><p>Yesser heard this term for the first time and looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Priest?"</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Redley: "One who serves and attends to the divine, God's agent in the human realm, the promulgator of His will."</p><p></p><p>"You will receive permission from the divine to choose one of the fusion monsters as your companion, becoming an extension of God's will in this world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the existence called fusion monsters, a brilliant light shone in Yesser's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing."</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Yesser was too excited to sleep all night. He walked out of the palace and strolled along the high walls.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, the entire God-blessed city came into view. He gazed at the endless sea horizon.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists.</p><p></p><p>"The sea and the land."</p><p></p><p>"I will conquer you both."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"He stood like this in front of the palace, gazing at the sea until dawn, when he followed his father into the temple.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time he had an audience with the god. </p><p></p><p>Just like before, he did not dare look directly at that majestic existence that transcended time and the ages. He learned from his father to humbly bow his head before the divine dais.</p><p></p><p>A divine voice came from above, asking him:</p><p></p><p>"If you possess the ability to fuse monsters, what would you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning the news yesterday, Yeser's excitement had not dissipated. He kept his head bowed in a devout posture, while speaking in a powerful, impassioned tone:</p><p></p><p>"Great Insei God!</p><p></p><p>If I am graced by You with the power of divine servants, I wish to explore the oceans for my father.</p><p></p><p>Not only will I build a new city in the depths of the sea, making it the new God-blessed city, extending Your glory, great Insei God, into the seas.</p><p></p><p>But I will also journey to the ends of the sea to find the legendary lands, so that the people of the God-blessed city can open up a new paradise there.</p><p></p><p>Just as my father said:</p><p></p><p>We are the eldest sons of God, the chosen rulers of the land and sea.  </p><p></p><p>We shall certainly conquer the seas, and eventually rule over the lands as well."</p><p></p><p>Yeser spoke magnanimously and passionately, trembling with the blood boiling within him.</p><p></p><p>He was different from Redrik - Redrik was conservative and humble by nature, while Yeser was filled with a sense of adventure and impulse.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his son's words, Redrik looked at him with pride in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!</p><p></p><p>Do not fail to live up to your father's expectations."</p><p></p><p>The divine finger pointed at Yeser's forehead, light emanating from between the fingers to form the symbol of an eye on his brow.</p><p></p><p>"From this day forth,</p><p></p><p>It belongs to you."</p><p></p><p>In Yeser's mind, another voice resounded - a chaotic, frenzied consciousness connected with his own.  </p><p></p><p>He sensed that on the other side of the sea, a fusion monster's fate had become intertwined with his from that moment on.</p><p></p><p>According to the Trifolian mythological record "The Song of the Wise King's Praise":</p><p></p><p>On this day, the god appointed the second Wise King, the heir to His will.</p><p></p><p>The great son of Redrik, Yeser, became the first priest of the God-blessed city, the voice of the divine.</p><p></p><p>These god-servants known as priests emerged in this world.</p><p></p><p>They could control and nurture the mythical fusion monsters, allowing them to fuse with different species and thus possess a variety of abilities.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of the Sacred Lake. üíî‚ô§6‚ûà‚ìàhux.·ëïomüç©‚ôó</p><p></p><p>The craftsman with a backpack full of bone boards turned back and looked into the distance, and at the bottom of the backpack was the "Final Chapter" that had driven countless people crazy.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito took the "Final Chapter" and left the Holy Mountain and the City of the Divine Servants. He didn't know if everything he had done was truly useful, but he felt he should do it, so he did.</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant losing everything.</p><p></p><p>He had previously been the high and mighty inheritor of the Saint's Will, and he even had the chance to become the controller of the Sky Temple, which was one of the highest positions of power.</p><p></p><p>Now he had lost everything and become a craftsman again.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>He had no regrets.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that he had broken free of his shackles and gained freedom.</p><p></p><p>His previous life had always been drifting with the tide, following his father to become a craftsman, and luckily becoming Stan Tito, the inheritor of the Saint's Will.</p><p></p><p>He had never truly thought about what he himself wanted.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he felt the presence of his own will, a feeling of his life suddenly blossoming with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Even if.</p><p></p><p>It was just a moment.</p><p></p><p>That was the leap of his will in the river of life, the most dazzling moment of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Go home!"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito decided to go back to his hometown, the remote seaside town outside the City of the Divine Descent, and then decide what to do next. ‚ôóüç©6‚ùæs·∏ß√πx.·∂ú‚ìûmüòÇüò∫</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, he would return to being a craftsman.</p><p></p><p>It seems like that's the only thing he can do.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>It took him seven or eight days, Stan carefully and unhurriedly passed through one town after another, and he arrived near the once most important city of the Star Realm Kingdom, Stone Forest City.</p><p></p><p>He did not encounter the pursuers he had expected, and even the people he met along the way did not know the rumor of the lucky son Stan Tito leaving the City of the Divine Servants. Everyone only knew the news that Heniel had become the king, and the Star Realm Kingdom no longer existed, with the Heniel Dynasty established on the three collapsed thrones.</p><p></p><p>Heniel had finally become the king.</p><p></p><p>But he covered up the news of Stan Tito, as if as long as the king did not mention it, everything had never happened.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Stan Tito's friend, the priest, had become the notorious traitor, he became the spy who colluded with the Sele Kingdom to betray the queen.</p><p></p><p>Even his past trivial matters were magnified by rumors and became evidence of his vile betrayal of Her Majesty the Queen.</p><p></p><p>In the towns Stan Tito passed through, everywhere was spreading his "evil deeds", everyone was angrily cursing and spitting on his actions, vividly describing his teenage or even childhood events, even his childhood skill in swimming and hunting the progenitor fish had become bloody evidence of his crimes.</p><p></p><p>Hearsay.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito heard this and felt a strong sense of absurdity. ‚ô†üê≥‚ûÖ9s·∏ß√πx.·∂ú‚ìûmüëªüë§</p><p></p><p>"Evil people can be forgiven as long as they put down the knife, but good people will be thrown into the mud as long as they have a blemish."</p><p></p><p>"You Hinsai people!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so tolerant of the evil, and so harsh on the good?"</p><p></p><p>He passed through the stacked stone forest, looking into the distance.</p><p></p><p>At the end of his sight was Stone Forest City, and he could see the majestic city walls amidst the towering, chaotic stones.</p><p></p><p>He did not plan to enter Stone Forest City, he only planned to detour from here to the City of the Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a violent tremor suddenly came from the stone forest, causing the ground to shake under Stan Tito's feet, making him have to lean against a rock to stabilize himself.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The earth suddenly cracked open, and a series of unknown vines or roots emerged from the ground, twisting and turning, as if a monstrous creature was about to emerge from the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tentacle-like thing extended outwards, transforming into a towering plant over a hundred meters tall.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive pillar made up of intertwined giant vines, without any leaves, with a huge spherical structure hanging at the top.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito immediately recognized what it was: "The Moon Fern?"</p><p></p><p>As the vines bent down, the spherical structure of the Moon Fern gradually lowered and came to a stop in front of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>The sphere opened, and a young three-leaved girl sat inside, looking at the Chosen One.</p><p></p><p>The massive sphere swayed, as if the girl was sitting in a rocking basket. </p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the descendant of the great poet, the legendary Chosen One Stan Tito, has gotten into a conflict with King Heniel and left the City of the Divine Servants."</p><p></p><p>"You must be Stan Tito, right?"</p><p></p><p>From her teasing tone, Stan Tito could tell that she knew who he was: "Just based on a rumor, you can make such guesses and assertions?"</p><p></p><p>The girl laughed: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>"I've seen you in the eyes of the Moon Fern before, the descendant of the great poet, the Chosen One."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito asked her, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had already guessed that she was likely from the Samo Kingdom, he was not sure of her specific identity.</p><p></p><p>The girl answered, "I am Princess Saliman of the Samo Kingdom, the first in line to the throne."</p><p></p><p>"I've come to negotiate with King Heniel. The Samo Kingdom is prepared to sign a non-aggression pact with King Heniel, but I didn't expect to run into you here."</p><p></p><p>However, it was clear that the girl's mission here went beyond just that. She also had the task of investigating the internal affairs of the Heniel Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As long as she detected Heniel's weakness and the instability of his rule, the Samo Kingdom would not hesitate to wage war against Heniel.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman looked at Stan Tito with interest: "We've heard your story, that you are a lucky and low-key person."</p><p></p><p>"No one expected you to have the courage to challenge King Heniel."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito replied, "You can be more direct - I am an ordinary and useless person, a person who has nothing but luck."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman shook her head: "No, no, Chosen One."</p><p></p><p>"To be favored by luck and the divine is a powerful talent and gift in itself."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, you still carry the bloodline of Saint Tito."</p><p></p><p>"The Heniel Kingdom does not wish to keep you. How about coming to the Samo Kingdom instead?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito refused: "You are not inviting me, you are only inviting the descendant of Saint Tito, the existence known as the Chosen One."</p><p></p><p>"If I go, I will only become a puppet on your strings, used as a banner and declaration to wage war in the name of the divine."</p><p></p><p>"I am just an ordinary and common person, and I do not wish to become your flag in the name of the gods."</p><p></p><p>Although Stan Tito came from a humble background, he was able to clearly recognize himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>"But I feel that one day you will come to the Samo Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The girl left on the Moon Fern. Although she had heard that the Chosen One had left the City of the Divine Servants before arriving, Heniel had not issued a warrant for his arrest, nor had he even stripped Stan Tito of his identity.</p><p></p><p>Heniel had concealed the news about Stan Tito, as if the previous events had never happened.</p><p></p><p>She did not know that Stan Tito had left with the "Final Chapter" of the great poet Tito, which was now hidden in his backpack.</p><p></p><p>She did not forcibly take the Chosen One Stan Tito away, because that could have given Heniel a pretext to accuse the Samo Kingdom.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen walked through the Sea of Sun Cups, where thousands upon thousands of golden flower cups were blooming together, releasing golden pollen. </p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>The wind blew across the golden island, and the pollen gathered into a whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>This should have been a scene like a fantasy fairy tale, accompanied by an intoxicating floral fragrance that captivated people.</p><p></p><p>But Yin Shen could not smell the floral fragrance, nor could he feel the wind brushing past him.</p><p></p><p>The gene fragments within the Sun Cups were devoured by the mythical blood of the Crown of Wisdom, and the Crown of Wisdom, accompanied by the mythical blood of Leadley, also began to change. It transformed from the initial mythical blood into a more perfect form, and the power of the Wisdom Authority also underwent a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the initial Wisdom Authority, which only had an effect on consciousness and thinking, the Wisdom Authority was now completely manifested and became a divine power that could directly interfere with the external world.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Yin Shen, the City of Divine Grace, which was submerged beneath the sea of flowers, began to move.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen raised his hand with the ring, and he could clearly feel that the entire City of Divine Grace was grasped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he only needed to exert a little force, and he could lift up the entire City of Divine Grace.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on his face: "It's this powerful?"</p><p></p><p>His surprise was not only due to the strength of this power but also because he could now directly interface with reality through this power.</p><p></p><p>Although he still lacked a physical body, after gaining this power, he could finally directly interfere with reality.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen walked through the ruined city, strolled across the sea of flowers, and stood atop the valley.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed to rely on the power of others to grasp other things in this world.</p><p></p><p>However, while mastering this power, Yin Shen also felt that this power was still far from perfect.</p><p></p><p>Not that it wasn't powerful enough, but it lacked a sense of refinement and qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>It was like comparing a water wheel powered by water to a steam engine or an internal combustion engine, not to mention electric or nuclear power.</p><p></p><p>"It should be able to become even more powerful and more miraculous."</p><p></p><p>-------------------</p><p></p><p>At night.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at the mythical shell embedded in the temple wall. During the day, he had received the power and gains from the metamorphosis of the Wisdom Authority's mythical blood, and at the same time, he had also...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Time allowed him to nurture a new idea. </p><p></p><p>An idea that had existed before, but could not be realized.</p><p></p><p>"To create a new mythical life form."</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to allow a life form to master the powers of life and wisdom, thereby creating a completely different mythical life. However, the two vastly different powers and mythical bloodlines clashed violently against each other.  </p><p></p><p>The same life could not possess both powers.</p><p></p><p>But the new discovery gave him a new path, to create a new mythical bloodline and path.  </p><p></p><p>Since the mythical bloodlines were also perfecting and completing themselves, he would extract some gene fragments from the mythical bloodlines of the life power and wisdom power respectively. Then, he would let them randomly combine within the mythical shell and see if they could combine into a new mythical bloodline - a lineage and power different from both Redley and Shari. Perhaps the progenitor of another mythical life would be born here.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin was very curious: "What kind of existence would the combination of the life power and wisdom power produce?"</p><p></p><p>Before that, a vessel capable of carrying the mythical bloodline was needed. </p><p></p><p>Lord Yin looked behind him.</p><p></p><p>In the corner.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice, which had been secretly watching Lord Yin, realized this terrifying deity had turned his gaze towards it and immediately turned the flower cup in another direction in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Trembling.</p><p></p><p>Weak.  </p><p></p><p>And helpless.</p><p></p><p>Captured by Lord Yin, the Sun Chalice let out shrill cries, struggling desperately like a misbehaved child.</p><p></p><p>"Hissss!"</p><p></p><p>Even though Lord Yin had left for a while earlier in the day, the Sun Chalice dared not run away, or perhaps it could not run away.</p><p></p><p>It could run out of Shari's palm, but it could not run out of a deity's control.  </p><p></p><p>It could feel that the other was the source of all mythical powers, and its own origin.</p><p></p><p>He was its supreme sovereign, its creator.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin placed the Sun Chalice into the mythical shell. It could not speak or express its consciousness.  </p><p></p><p>But it was evident that its desire to get out was very strong.</p><p></p><p>It clung tightly to the thin wall of the mythical shell, twisting outwards.  </p><p></p><p>Lord Yin waved his hand at the Sun Chalice through the transparent thin wall.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep!"</p><p></p><p>"When you wake up, things will be different."</p><p></p><p>The petals of the Sun Chalice slowly closed, its consciousness fell into slumber, and...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The body also slowly fell into the bottom layer inside the huge spiral shell, with roots taking root on top. </p><p></p><p>The experiment began.</p><p></p><p>Attempt after attempt, failure after failure. </p><p></p><p>The experiment was tedious, disappointment was the norm every day, but within this norm awaited that sole surprise.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, year after year.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the surprise arrived on schedule. </p><p></p><p>A new mythical life.</p><p></p><p>Was born.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood motionless in the temple, gazing at the scene within the light wall.</p><p></p><p>The sun's chalice inside the spiral shell was completely different from before. Although still golden, a human head had actually grown inside the flower cup.</p><p></p><p>The gender was indistinguishable, but it was clearly a humanoid skull.</p><p></p><p>It was still a child, sleeping with its eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>"Huff!"</p><p></p><p>Listening carefully, one could hear the sleeping snore coming from the flower cup, but that snore carried a heavy mysterious power hue that could lull one to sleep just by listening briefly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen listened carefully, sensing that power.</p><p></p><p>Then, the entire world suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>He disappeared from the golden pyramid temple of the God-given Land.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen examined his surroundings, this was also a temple, an extremely magnificent and towering temple.  </p><p></p><p>Here too stood a statue of himself, but it was clear this was not the God-given Land.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the temple and looked outside.</p><p></p><p>This palace stood at the top of a high mountain, with a walled city built around it, and at the foot of the mountain was a vast lake that seemed to have no end.</p><p></p><p>He heard the snoring sound again and continued walking forward.</p><p></p><p>Here he saw the core consciousness of the Sun's Chalice, slumbering in an indoor garden.</p><p></p><p>This was the birthplace of the Sun's Chalice, the Garden of the God's Chalice in the Celestial Temple.</p><p></p><p>"The king has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go pay respects to the Wise King."</p><p></p><p>"The High Priest Schloed has passed on."</p><p></p><p>One three-leaf person after another ran through Yin Shen's shadow, then disappeared into the radiance behind.</p><p></p><p>"This is!"</p><p></p><p>"A dream?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of interest appeared on Yin Shen's face.</p><p></p><p>It was a dream, but far more than a dream.</p><p></p><p>More like a dream realm born within the mythical cells, an illusory yet eternally existing dream world.</p><p></p><p>Even if the life and master it was attached to perished, as long as this mythical bloodline still existed, the mythical blood was not extinguished.</p>

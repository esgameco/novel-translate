            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Decades later, the God-Descended City had an artificial lake that connected to the sea. Inside was an underwater city and a place where the Trifolians gave birth to their offspring. </p><p></p><p>It was quite similar to the Divine Well in the former God-Gifted City, but much larger than the Divine Well.</p><p></p><p>In the lake were several giant shrimp-like creatures. These ocean overlords had ropes made from tanned aquatic plants wrapped around their bodies. Several tall and strong Trifolians held bone spears, riding and battling them in the lake.</p><p></p><p>"Rise up!"</p><p>"Charge!"</p><p></p><p>Following their chants, the massive sea creatures seemed to become part of their bodies, moving in accordance with their wills.</p><p></p><p>As the bone spears struck, the two huge pincers in front of the strange shrimp's mouths clashed together, making all the watching Trifolians' blood boil with excitement as they cheered and roared.</p><p></p><p>In front of the lake, a crowned figure sat on an ornately carved high-backed throne, watching these young Trifolians fight fiercely while surrounded by guards.</p><p></p><p>Most of these people were Yesser's juniors and also possessed the Power of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Over the decades, many had gained the Power of Wisdom - a few through bloodline awakening, but most from the royal family's bestowal of power.</p><p></p><p>The aging Trifolian royal family bestowed their powers onto their descendants.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these people were not as fortunate as the second-generation royal bloodline to receive blessings from the gods and directly possess mythical fusion beasts. With the older generation not fully gone, inheriting fusion beasts was uncertain and might not even happen for them.</p><p></p><p>So some took an alternative path, taming and controlling strange shrimp and other lifeforms from the sea.</p><p></p><p>Thus mastering special abilities, possessing great combat strength or other auxiliary powers.</p><p></p><p>As the performance ended, these strapping young Trifolian royals walked to the lakeshore and knelt before the throne.</p><p></p><p>"You all did well. Brave and fearless, skillfully wielding the Power of Wisdom. Befitting of inheriting the bloodline of the ancient kings and your royal status."</p><p></p><p>The second Wisdom King Yesser stood and pointed his scepter at them.</p><p></p><p>He called out each of their names: "By the authority of the Wisdom King, I bestow upon you the title of Priests of the Gods."</p><p></p><p>From now on, these young royal descendants truly became priests - the most powerful figures in the Heinse Kingdom besides the king himself.</p><p></p><p>"Great King, we will forever obey the gods' faith and your rule."</p><p></p><p>Yesser was delighted that outstanding individuals kept emerging from the younger generation, making him feel his Heinse Kingdom was growing stronger and more prosperous.</p><p></p><p>He thought, "If these juniors are dispatched elsewhere, they could surely establish a few more cities and expand the Heinse Kingdom's territory even further."</p><p></p><p>The city had wide water channels crisscrossing like rivers, serving as roads for the Trifolians. </p><p></p><p>Yesser rode his fusion beast Nini, leading his...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The guard headed towards the royal palace from above the water channel, and everyone he saw along the way knelt down and paid respects. </p><p></p><p>Looking down from a high place, dense crowds and street markets could be seen on the main road.</p><p></p><p>On the streets, some sold pickled dried fish, sun-dried fish meat, as well as fresh ancestral fish and other foods caught from the sea. </p><p></p><p>There were also people selling all kinds of bone utensils, bone plates, bone bowls, bone knives, and bone spears everywhere.</p><p></p><p>These bone utensils were made from the remains of the Trifoliate people, but the Kingdom of Xinsai clearly did not have too many taboos, and only the noble Trifoliate people would be buried.</p><p></p><p>The City of Divine Descent was different from the City of Divine Bestowal, the most obvious being that high stone walls were built around the edges of the city.</p><p></p><p>The city walls divided the inside and outside of the city into two levels. First, those living inside the city were basically nobles and their servants. Second, people entering the City of Divine Descent had to pay taxes.</p><p></p><p>This was the law established by King Yesaier, the second Wise King, after he defined the legal code of the Kingdom of Xinsai and issued the currency of the Kingdom of Xinsai.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, there were villages of various sizes, where large numbers of merchants operating for the nobles, laboring craftsmen, and fishing farmers gathered.</p><p></p><p>Along this coastline, one magnificent city after another was established, and the Kingdom of Xinsai currently had seventeen cities.</p><p></p><p>Social relations became more complex, not only with more hierarchical power systems but also with various occupations.</p><p></p><p>Together with the numerous large and small villages, the population of the Kingdom of Xinsai had reached several hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>This was something that King Laideli, the first Wise King, could not have imagined when he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, Yesaier had surpassed his father.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier returned to the palace, and several nobles and officials of the Kingdom of Xinsai were already waiting for him at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"The legal code has been revised and is now erected to the south of the royal palace."</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason he hurried back.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier immediately jumped down from the fusion monster Ninini, excitedly following the few people towards the south, with a large crowd following behind him.</p><p></p><p>The legal code was one of his most important achievements in life.</p><p></p><p>This was the seventh revision, and he felt it should be the last revision.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this was a perfect legal code without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>The legal code was engraved on a stone stele erected outside the royal palace, carved with the divine script compiled by Laideli.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier stood in front of this stele, touching the words created by his father and the divine, his eyes beaming with pride.</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p></p><p>"I have not let you down."</p><p></p><p>From the moment he returned from outside until he sat on the throne, he felt like he was floating on clouds.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier was immersed in his own glory.</p><p></p><p>He had established more than a dozen cities, he had created the legal code, he had expanded the Kingdom of Xinsai.</p><p></p><p>He had accomplished what even his father could not, he had established a great nation, and became a king praised by all.</p><p></p><p>Laideli kept his divine stone tablets in his Palace of Wisdom, while Yesaier kept the legal code he compiled, with the walls carved with the epic tales of Yesaier's past adventures.</p><p></p><p>He was very happy and excited today.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Excited beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>He would occasionally rise from the throne, pacing around the palace, looking at the traces of his past deeds. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone came running in.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"The Crown Princess requests an audience with you."</p><p></p><p>Yesser's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>--------------------------</p><p></p><p>Yesser hurried to another city and entered a building similar to the palace of the former God-blessed city.</p><p></p><p>Inside, an elderly female Trifolian was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Yesser heaved a sigh of relief, and his previously hurried pace slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Sister."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly want to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser saw his sister, whose appearance resembled their mother's, who had taken him fishing in the marshes and on adventures into the deep sea in his childhood.</p><p></p><p>It was she who made his childhood so perfect, and it was she who gave him the seeds and courage to dare to take risks.</p><p></p><p>To Yesser, she was not only his sister but also an elder like a mother.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Princess looked somewhat sad, her eyes gazing towards the other side of the sea.</p><p></p><p>He asked his elder sister, "Sister!"</p><p></p><p>"Is there something on your mind?"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Princess turned to look at Yesser, her eyes showing the same gentleness as the former queen.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think we can return to the God-blessed land? Can we see our father and God again?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser said firmly, "Of course!"</p><p></p><p>"I am still the King of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"The crown of wisdom is still on my head, and the covenant between God and the Trifolians has not ended because of this."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we atone for our sins, we can naturally return to the God-blessed land."</p><p></p><p>Yesser did not notice that his tone and demeanor had become very similar to Laidley's.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Princess's eyes shone with light as she smiled at her brother.</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>The elderly Crown Princess let out a long sigh of relief, as if she had unburdened herself of some knot.</p><p></p><p>"If one day, Your Majesty, you can return to the God-blessed land."</p><p></p><p>"Take my bones with you and bury me beside our mother!"</p><p></p><p>"I~"</p><p></p><p>"Miss her."</p><p></p><p>Yesser hugged his sister, "Don't be in a hurry, it's still early!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, we'll go back together, to see our mother and father."</p><p></p><p>Just a few days after Yesser returned to the God-descended city, news came.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Princess had passed away.</p><p></p><p>When Yesser received the news, he stood up abruptly, then sat down in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He recalled his sister's words again and realized the fear and bewilderment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter how high the glory he attained, no matter how great the achievements he made,</p><p></p><p>He could not resist the inner confusion and perplexity, nor could he eliminate the longing of all Trifolians to return to the God-blessed land.</p><p></p><p>And.</p><p></p><p>Their fear of being abandoned by God and their regret of being expelled from the paradise God had granted.</p><p></p><p>Their will and spirit had lost their dwelling place, and they were like a group of wandering souls roaming the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his heart, like other Trifolians, Yesser still longed to return to the God-blessed land.</p>

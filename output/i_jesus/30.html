        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not far from the city of Yesaire, in the sea. </p><p></p><p>A group of soldiers from the Kingdom of Xin were patrolling on the sea surface, led by two young priests riding strange shrimp creatures. They had just recently been granted the status of priests by the Wise King Yesaire among the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>Following the orders of the Wise King, the young priests had already run through this sea area over and over again. Finally, one of them could not help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Is the God-Gifted City really here?"  </p><p></p><p>"We have counted every single rock in this sea, if such a huge island really existed, at least we should be able to find some traces of it!"</p><p></p><p>The other priest looked at him with a smile: "Are you questioning the great Wise King? Or are you questioning the power of God?"</p><p></p><p>The young priest immediately fell silent, not daring to say more.</p><p></p><p>"I know!"</p><p></p><p>"I will continue to search diligently, the King's will is the King's will."</p><p></p><p>Although the other priest had warned the young one, he also felt that their search was merely in vain.</p><p></p><p>He sighed and retold the story that had been circulating in the Kingdom of Xin.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew it, but every time it was told, it felt different.</p><p></p><p>"The blasphemer Ens killed his own brother Buen and took away the Ruch Giant (Fusion Monster) that God had bestowed upon Buen."</p><p></p><p>"Ens used the power bestowed by God upon the Trifoliate people, and attempted to assassinate the eldest son of God, his great father the Wise King Redrik."</p><p></p><p>His voice was melodious, as if chanting a great poem.</p><p></p><p>"Such a grave sin, appearing in the God-Permitted Paradise, appearing at the foot of the Divine Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Disappointed and saddened, the Divine brought down divine punishment upon the people of the Kingdom of Xin."</p><p></p><p>"The descendants of the sinners were forever exiled to the deep abyss of the sea, and the people of Xin could no longer return to their former homeland."</p><p></p><p>"Oh Divine!"</p><p></p><p>"When will you forgive our sins and once again shed your brilliance upon the Kingdom of Xin?"</p><p></p><p>After chanting this widely spread poem in Xin, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"We mortals, how can we set foot in the Divine Palace again before receiving the forgiveness of the Divine."</p><p></p><p>Although both priests felt that this journey was doomed to be fruitless, they still carried out the will of the Wise King diligently and meticulously.  </p><p></p><p>They split into two routes, going deeper into the sea area.</p><p></p><p>The young priest led a team of soldiers, parting the waves and swiftly crossing the sea surface, when he caught sight of a streak of gold on the water from afar.</p><p></p><p>Against the pure azure blue of the vast ocean, that golden brilliance was so conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"What is floating on the sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>The group hurried over, and the priest on the strange shrimp creature extended a bone spear to retrieve from the sea surface the golden flower known as the Sun's Chalice.</p><p></p><p>None of them had ever seen anything like this before, they had never even seen anything golden except for the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"This is what..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"What color is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The same color as the sun."</p><p></p><p>"How amazing."</p><p></p><p>The priest smelled the floral fragrance and couldn't help but move closer. </p><p></p><p>Then he instinctively took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The pollen from the Sun's Chalice entered the young priest's body through his breath, its special cells penetrating inside.</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined.</p><p></p><p>This originally not so extraordinary creation of the gods, when combined with the mythical blood inside the young priest, underwent an earth-shattering transformation.</p><p></p><p>The mythical blood underwent a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a fusion monster had devoured the organs of other lifeforms and grafted them onto itself.</p><p></p><p>The primordial mythical blood of the Path of Wisdom perfected part of its gene fragments from the Sun's Chalice, taking a new step forward.</p><p></p><p>Waves of golden light floated out from the priest's body. Unconsciously, he released his grip on the Sun's Chalice, allowing it to levitate.</p><p></p><p>The power of wisdom gave the priest eyes that could see into people's hearts and the ability to read minds and communicate with any life form. But their power could never directly act upon any other object.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, everything changed.  </p><p></p><p>His power could leave his body and directly influence the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The entire squad of soldiers around him, as the golden light emanated from his body, sensed a fragrance that directly acted upon the depths of their minds.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>In shock and horror, as if their consciousness had been taken away, everyone became motionless.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies froze, slowly sinking beneath the sea.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they could survive underwater, so their lives were not in danger.</p><p></p><p>But the young priest of the gods was completely unaware, his eyes shining with golden light as his consciousness suddenly appeared on a golden island.</p><p></p><p>He saw the place where the Sun's Chalice had been.  </p><p></p><p>He stood on the shore, surrounded by a dense golden sea of flowers swaying.</p><p></p><p>The sea of flowers extended along the coast, a magnificent city buried within by the Sun's Chalice.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>He looked around dazed, not understanding how he had suddenly appeared here when he had just been at sea.</p><p></p><p>How could there suddenly be an island like this, covered in a floral paradise fit for celestial realms?</p><p></p><p>Beautiful enough to take one's breath away.</p><p></p><p>Until he saw the city without walls and the stone-encircled swamp.</p><p></p><p>He immediately realized, his pupils dilating to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Though the young Trifoliate had never seen it in person, he had heard of this place countless times.</p><p></p><p>"The God-Given City."</p><p></p><p>"This is the God-Given City."</p><p></p><p>He looked up towards the center of the island and saw the huge pyramid.  </p><p></p><p>Atop the pyramid, amidst shimmering light, he could vaguely make out a temple.</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>"The Temple of Inca."</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why this thing had the color of the sun.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This was something that flowed out from the land bestowed by God, it was the sunflower that blossomed at the foot of the divine palace. </p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>The city of Yesser.</p><p></p><p>A change occurred in the bloodline of wisdom and power, and Yesser, wearing the crown of wisdom, was the first to notice it.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"  </p><p></p><p>"Who has perfected the power of wisdom?"</p><p></p><p>He activated the power of the Wisdom King and immediately saw the source that triggered the change, calling out the name of that young priest.</p><p></p><p>"Shlodde!"</p><p></p><p>It means oath, the royal family likes to use names like this.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom King Yesser swiftly rode the fusion monster under his command to this sea area, with the guards of the Kingdom of Heinze following closely behind, surrounding this place tightly. </p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of thousands upon thousands of people, the divine priest Shlodde nervously rode the strange shrimp and stopped under the fusion monster.</p><p></p><p>The huge sea overlord seemed like a tiny shrimp in front of the fusion monster, a mythical creature.</p><p></p><p>Shlodde came before the king, knelt down and offered the divine creation he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom King, Shlodde offers this divine creation to you."</p><p></p><p>"May the light of God forever shine upon the kingdom of Heinze."</p><p></p><p>When Yesser saw the golden flower, he exclaimed its name.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Chalice!"</p><p></p><p>He had seen the name of this flower before and learned its name from his father. </p><p></p><p>It was a divine creation held in the embrace of the Mother of Life, Shari, with a brilliant color like the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that this rather inconspicuous item among the many divine creations would have such a connection to the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he felt as if fate had already been determined.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if God's gaze had already seen this moment by looking down the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Was everything arranged by You?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser recalled the words his father had said to him as a child: "Yesser, do not be afraid."</p><p></p><p>"God has arranged everything."</p><p></p><p>His sharp gaze turned towards this young priest.</p><p></p><p>Such a thing could only exist in the divine palace, it was impossible for it to appear here.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this come from? What did you see?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Yesser's gaze, Shlodde's body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>He explained what he had just encountered and everything he had seen.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Yesser and the elderly Trifoliate next to him had different reactions - one had a joyful and relaxed smile on his face, while the other was so excited that he danced around.</p><p></p><p>"The land bestowed by God."</p><p></p><p>"He saw the land bestowed by God."</p><p></p><p>Yesser raised the Sun Chalice high, as if holding a supreme sacred object.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like when he faced the Crown of Wisdom in the past.</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in his eyes, and as he smiled, he let out an impassioned cry:</p><p></p><p>"This is - God's guidance!"</p><p></p><p>"God has not abandoned us, He has given us a future again."</p>

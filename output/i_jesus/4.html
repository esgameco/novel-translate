        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, living in this towering divine temple was still somewhat novel, but as time dragged on day after day, Yin Shen began to feel bored. </p><p></p><p>He would not age, nor would he die. </p><p></p><p>But he also had no physical body, only a solitary soul wandering over the ancient oceans of Earth.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was only a fusion monster that constantly made gurgling sounds as it roamed the vast seas, and a three-leaf person keeping him company with conversation. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood atop the lofty divine temple, looking down upon the vast ocean and the entire island.</p><p></p><p>The world was so vast, the entire realm belonging solely to him, yet he felt himself still a prisoner.</p><p></p><p>He was not imprisoned in an eternal extraterrestrial jail, but imprisoned in a cage called time.</p><p></p><p>"Yin...Sai...Sen!"</p><p>"Yin...Sai...Shen!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple. </p><p></p><p>At the great entrance where sunlight streamed in, a figure blocked the light, casting a long shadow into the palace interior as he dragged an enormous object much larger than himself, presenting it on the platform before the temple.</p><p></p><p>The shadow suddenly shrank, coalescing into a mass.</p><p></p><p>He knelt beside the massive pillars of the temple, crawling forward towards the majestic deity in his heart who had bestowed him wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf person once again brought rare objects from the ocean to Yin Shen, seeking to earn the deity's momentary delight, a slight curve of the lips, or an approving glance.</p><p></p><p>This time, he presented a strange shrimp, a massive creature over five meters long, the most powerful ruler of the oceans in this era.</p><p></p><p>It was evident the three-leaf person had expended great effort to capture this strange shrimp, its hard outer shell even bearing some scars.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Sai Sen!"</p><p>"Yin Sai Shen!"</p><p></p><p>Seated upon the stone dais of the deity statue, Yin Shen finally smiled, causing the kneeling three-leaf person outside to rejoice ecstatically, following with frantic dancing.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know that Yin Shen smiled because he had finally managed to call out the three syllables of the name continuously, albeit incorrectly.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being pleased by the rare ocean offering presented.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen descended from the stone dais, observing the massive shrimp-like creature placed there, still not dead. Its huge pincers suddenly twitched, striking the stone and directly cracking it with a fissure.</p><p></p><p>This enraged and terrified the three-leaf person.</p><p></p><p>"Ee-ya~"</p><p>"Ya-ee-ee~"</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf person cried out frantically, wanting to kill this foolish creature that dared show disrespect to the deity, this mindless insect.</p><p></p><p>Yet Yin Shen had no particular thoughts, only finding the shrimp quite large.</p><p></p><p>"So it's a strange shrimp!"</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand, but suddenly recalled that besides the three-leaf person and the fusion monster...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't touch anything. </p><p></p><p>This made Yin Shen's gaze look somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and said, "I've seen it...don't waste it!"</p><p></p><p>With a shift of Yin Shen's will, huge waves rose up in the ocean. </p><p></p><p>A truly enormous creature burst through the water's surface, heading towards the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle gurgle~"</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle gurgle~"</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster climbed up along the pyramid, its tentacles dragging away this six-meter-long giant creature, then swallowed it in one gulp like a candy bean.</p><p></p><p>Whatever ancient ocean ruler, in the face of a monster as mythical as the fusion monster, it was not worth mentioning. New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood at the entrance of the temple, behind him the mythical monster contentedly devoured the snacks bestowed by the gods, with the three-leaf people closely following him.</p><p></p><p>This scene was enough to make one's heart go cold with terror, but the three people in the scene viewed it as normal.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stopped and looked at the bas-reliefs carved on the pillars.</p><p></p><p>Colorless, but the figures were vivid.</p><p></p><p>Among them were tall buildings, traffic, and countless human shadows walking in the prosperous streets.</p><p></p><p>These were carved by the three-leaf people with dexterous hands, inheriting Yin Shen's wisdom, while also possessing some of the scenes from his memories.</p><p></p><p>Only they did not understand what these scenes depicted, could not comprehend why there were so many people, why these people were not quite the same as themselves.</p><p></p><p>Nor did they understand what those iron birds flying in the sky or those boxes running on the ground were.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that the god liked these things, so they carved these scenes all over the inside and outside of the temple.</p><p></p><p>The god lingered for a long time under these murals and bas-reliefs, speechless.</p><p></p><p>But today was different, he pointed to a tiny, invisible figure in the painting.</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a human."</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf person also hurriedly said, nodding repeatedly as if eager to affirm his own identity: "I...I...</p><p></p><p>"Am also human!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen shook his head: "You are not human."</p><p></p><p>"You are a three-leaf person."</p><p></p><p>"You were created by me, transformed from a three-leaf insect into an intelligent being in human form."</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf person did not understand the difference between humans and three-leaf people.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen walked along the corridor outside the temple: "I am alone, and you are alone too."</p><p></p><p>"The human race has not yet been born in this world, and there is only you, the three-leaf person."</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the three-leaf person knew the concept of race, and he finally knew that three-leaf person was not his name, but the god's name for his race.</p><p></p><p>And he.</p><p></p><p>Was not human.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the three-leaf person felt the emotion of sadness, he was very upset.</p><p></p><p>"God of the Races!"</p><p></p><p>"I...also...want...a name!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an idea occurred to Yin Shen.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The law, since the fusion monster could fuse and replicate the characteristics of life, why not use the power of the fusion monster to completely create the Trifoliate race? </p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate knelt on the ground praying, and the God Yin casually said a name.</p><p></p><p>"Laidley."  </p><p></p><p>"Your name will be Laidley."</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate then cheered again, like a child.</p><p></p><p>Sadness comes quickly, and goes quickly too.</p><p></p><p>----------------------</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster is just an unscientific mythical creature, a biological tool.</p><p></p><p>It can plunder organs from other creatures, it can violently fuse the characteristics and gene fragments of other creatures. </p><p></p><p>God Yin plans to use its power, using Laidley and his previous incarnation the Trifoliate Bug to produce a fertilized egg or embryo, and then through the power of the fusion monster to create a new race.</p><p></p><p>However, this biological tool is not very precise, what is produced is more like a random box.</p><p></p><p>To produce the intended creature still requires some luck, full of uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>But God Yin had no worries, believing he would definitely succeed.</p><p></p><p>Because now he could be said to have nothing at all, except for one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was time.</p><p></p><p>The mythical beast heard the summons of the divine will, crawling up to the front of the temple, its mountain-like body squeezing into the interior of the palace, countless green monster eyes of varying sizes peering inside.</p><p></p><p>The God stood in the great hall, his gaze fixed on it.</p><p></p><p>"I want you to give me your shell."</p><p></p><p>"Can you do that?"</p><p></p><p>The mythical power of the fusion monster was basically concentrated in its shell, while the fusion monster itself was just a control center.</p><p></p><p>So its shell could be removed, allowing God Yin to use it however he wanted.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster: "Gulu lu lu."</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of terrifying large eyes stared at God Yin, but God Yin sensed a hint of innocence.</p><p></p><p>It could not understand what God Yin was saying, nor did it understand the meaning of this questioning sentence structure.</p><p></p><p>It was a divine creation that only needed God Yin to input a command for it to act according to that command, even if it did not understand the meaning of that command.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a servant of God, it was more like a tool.</p><p></p><p>How to use it was the will of God, it had no thoughts of its own.</p><p></p><p>God Yin stroked its skin: "I asked you the wrong question!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment he felt some sympathy for the fusion monster: "So intelligence is also a kind of mythical power."</p><p></p><p>Originally God Yin felt that compared to the fusion monster's mythical, miraculous abilities, the Trifoliates were simply weak.</p><p></p><p>But now he felt that the power of intelligence possessed by the Trifoliates was the true myth and miracle.</p><p></p><p>People always feel that what they possess is worthless.</p>

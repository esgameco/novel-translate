        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood above the vast ocean, treading upon that monstrous giant insect beneath his feet, riding the winds and breaking through the waves as he went. </p><p></p><p>Here, a day seemed to be shorter, with long days and short nights, and life could only exist within the ocean.</p><p></p><p>According to Yin Shen's deduction, he was now on Earth nearly 500 million years before his own era. </p><p></p><p>The Cambrian period.</p><p></p><p>He had only read about this era in textbooks.  </p><p></p><p>A warm climate, with a brilliant sun during the day, the moon driving the tides, and countless lives thriving and developing vigorously in the sea water.</p><p></p><p>They were evolving.</p><p></p><p>All things vying for the ultimate victor's position, contending for the dominance of this planet.</p><p></p><p>And he himself was an existence that did not belong to this world at all. He could not touch anything, nor could he interfere with the existence of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Except for those two life forms that sensed his presence. </p><p></p><p>Only they could observe Yin Shen's existence, and the only objects Yin Shen could touch were the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, to this universe, he did not actually exist.</p><p></p><p>Just like a ghost lingering in the crevices of space-time.</p><p></p><p>The trilobite and the worm, by glimpsing Yin Shen's true form transcending the universe and time, also gained power from him - power derived from what Yin Shen had previously called the soul.</p><p></p><p>The two primordial life forms of the ancient Earth gained different powers. One gained wisdom from Yin Shen, while the other was granted the ability to fuse by his grace.</p><p></p><p>The trilobite gained Yin Shen's wisdom. Within its hard, armor-like shell, an organ resembling the human brain grew.</p><p></p><p>It knew some human vocabulary, glimpsing scenes from Yin Shen's memories at the moment of its birth, possessing advanced creative thinking abilities akin to humans.</p><p></p><p>As for the worm, it gained a more peculiar and mysterious power. Its blood fused with Yin Shen's power, undergoing changes under the radiation of his true form.</p><p></p><p>It could fuse with other life forms, stripping away their organs and abilities, freely altering its own form.</p><p></p><p>But regrettably, the worm still acted on instinct, just like before.</p><p></p><p>The one that gained wisdom was called the Trilobite Man by Yin Shen.</p><p></p><p>And that worm was named the Fusion Monster by him.</p><p></p><p>Beneath his feet, the being called the Fusion Monster was rapidly shuttling across the sea surface, a single tentacle swinging rapidly from under its shell to propel it forward.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood atop its shell, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the distance above the sea surface, something different finally appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Objects.</p><p></p><p>Something protruded above the horizontal surface, casting long shadows on the sea under the last rays of the setting sun. </p><p></p><p>"Swish swish." The fusion monster swam rapidly, its dense tentacles stirring the seawater.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yin saw a solitary island, on which there was rare greenery.</p><p></p><p>The island was pitted with hollows and patches of marsh, covered in lichens and mosses. </p><p></p><p>But compared to other lands, this place was already full of the breath of life.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad here," said Shen Yin, deciding to stay and end his aimless long journey.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yin saw the fusion monster use its dexterous tentacles to quarry huge rocks from the seabed and drag them onto the island.</p><p></p><p>Its tentacles could become sharp tools like chisels or blunt ones like hammers, striking and splitting these massive rocks.</p><p></p><p>At first, Shen Yin thought this bug just had a hobby of dragging stones and paid no attention. But when he saw it stack the huge rocks into a structure, he realized it was a building.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, this thing was actually similar to the pyramids Shen Yin had seen on TV before, but this one was even more magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Rows of massive stones tens of meters high and wide were stacked up, making one feel this could absolutely not be a human construction, but a divine miracle.</p><p></p><p>However, as the rocks reached the highest point, it took a different turn - the fusion monster started stacking and carving an ancient, solemn temple, carefully grinding, striking, and sculpting the details.</p><p></p><p>It still appeared rough and ancient, but the outline of the temple had emerged.</p><p></p><p>This temple was clearly not built for the monster itself - it was too small for its huge size.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yin then realized the fusion monster was constructing a massive palace for him on the isolated island.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he thought the fusion monster was trying to curry favor with him, but realized that couldn't be right - the chaotic and ignorant fusion monster lacked such intelligence and didn't know about the existence of pyramids.</p><p></p><p>It must have been ordered to do so by the Trifoliate.</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate groveled anxiously before Shen Yin, who gazed calmly at the waves, his emotions serene.</p><p></p><p>Even when he still had a human body, he was a rather indifferent person. Now, having lost his body and undergone the strangest, most bizarre experiences in the world, he had become even more calm.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Trifoliate was afraid, not knowing whether his self-appointed god liked this or not.</p><p></p><p>He explained apprehensively while constantly kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>His understanding...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside, this was the most direct way to make requests and seek forgiveness from the deity.</p><p></p><p>"God!"  </p><p></p><p>"Palace...temple..."</p><p></p><p>Yinshen could sense his meaning. </p><p></p><p>He said the god should reside in a palace, receiving offerings from all life, so he had the fusion monster build this structure.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen was not joyful, or rather, he did not care much. </p><p></p><p>After all, he had no physical form, could not feel warmth or cold, and a sheltering structure meant nothing to him. So-called faith and prayers also seemed ridiculous to him, since the ones worshipping and believing in him were just two insects.</p><p></p><p>If he had to say anything, he could only praise it as interesting!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"  </p><p>"Very beautiful."</p><p></p><p>Just those few short words made the Three-Leaf person jump for joy, ecstatic.  </p><p></p><p>The palace was finally complete.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Leaf person waited for Yinshen on the pyramid. The fusion monster carrying Yinshen climbed towards the top of the pyramid, then stopped, pressing its head against the temple entrance.</p><p></p><p>At the pyramid's apex, the ancient, solemn hall opened its large doors and windows, with no furnishings inside.  </p><p></p><p>The only highlights were its massive, majestic scale.</p><p></p><p>Inside was also a statue of Yinshen, hand-carved by the Three-Leaf person as a gift to the deity.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Three-Leaf person had inherited the dexterous hands of humans, and possessed strength far exceeding humans.</p><p></p><p>This deity statue was carved from a single unknown white stone block, more like a relief sculpture than a statue, placed facing the round window towards the sun.</p><p></p><p>On it was a figure emanating endless radiance, appearing to be draped in white robes, with only the outline visible and features indistinguishable.  </p><p></p><p>This was how they observed Yinshen's appearance.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Leaf person prostrated on the ground, still addressing Yinshen as god.</p><p></p><p>This was a general term.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen told him his name: "Yinshen."</p><p></p><p>Three-Leaf person: "Yincai!"</p><p></p><p>The man corrected him again: "Yinshen."  </p><p></p><p>Three-Leaf person: "Yincai!"</p><p></p><p>He could pronounce the single word, but not when combined.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Leaf person's vocal organs were still different from humans, producing dry, shrill syllables that sounded grating.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen corrected him again: "Yinshen!"</p><p></p><p>The Three-Leaf person lifted his head, ah-ed for a while, and finally called out:</p><p></p><p>"Yincai...shen!"</p><p>"Yincaishen!"  </p><p></p><p>Yinshen let it go, allowing him to call out Yincaishen, Yincaishen, fervently shouting around the statue and Yinshen himself.</p>

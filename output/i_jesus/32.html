        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yesser led a group of people deep into the mainland and found a saltwater lake located inland. This place had nothing, but it had a vast expanse of water with white waves rippling across its surface. Salt accumulated on the shores like patches of white clouds. There must have been a volcano underneath the lake bottom, but it had long been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"This place is quite similar to the one you were looking for. Go a little further and you'll reach it."</p><p></p><p>Following along the circumference of this huge saltwater lake, he saw a towering mountain standing right next to the lake.</p><p></p><p>The azure sky and the majestic mountain, from the foot of the mountain the clouds seemed to float around the soaring peak. </p><p></p><p>The lake below was like a mirror, appearing like a celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Yesser was delighted: "This is it."</p><p></p><p>He climbed up the mountain and pointed to the entrance on both sides of the mountain path, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Two divine statues need to be carved at the entrance here, one of my father King Laidley, and one of myself."</p><p></p><p>"The statues should be kneeling on one knee, showing reverence to the divine."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if welcoming the descent of the divine into the temple we have built for Him."</p><p></p><p>The temple had not yet been established, but Yesser had already begun to imagine the scene of the divine's descent.</p><p></p><p>Yesser climbed up the mountain and discussed with several ministers from the Heinze Kingdom on how to construct this place, which would be the greatest miracle created by the Heinze Kingdom, the most precious gift they could offer to the divine.</p><p></p><p>"In the city bestowed by the divine, there is a statue of my father guarding the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Here."</p><p></p><p>"My father and I will jointly guard the divine's temple."</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>They reached the summit, where the air was thin and the wind howled fiercely.</p><p></p><p>But standing here, it felt like the entire world could be taken in at a glance.</p><p></p><p>This feeling reminded Yesser of the first time he climbed to the top of the pyramid temple in his youth, but the view here was even more expansive, and the grandeur of this mountain surpassed that of the pyramids.</p><p></p><p>"It's here, right here."</p><p></p><p>"Level the entire mountaintop, and then build a temple here, the most magnificent and splendid structure in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the priests serving the divine, thousands of people must guard the divine here forever."</p><p></p><p>The excited Yesser had even thought of a name for this divine temple. Gazing at the floating clouds around him, when this divine temple was completed, it would surely appear to be perched among the clouds when viewed from the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"It shall be called."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Temple."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Temple that Yesser wanted to build was more like a city than a temple hall.</p><p></p><p>Yesser was very satisfied with this place, imagining that after the city was built here, he too could gain the divine's favor like his father.</p><p></p><p>"That's it!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be built as soon as possible, within five years, it must be completed within five years."</p><p></p><p>The minister looked up: "Five...five years?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser asked in a tone that brooked no objection: "Can't do it?"</p><p></p><p>The minister hurriedly nodded: "No problem, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Five years later, you will definitely see this Celestial Temple."</p><p></p><p>The king seemed somewhat impatient, and everyone knew that such a huge project would inevitably be time-consuming and laborious.</p><p></p><p>It's easy to build a city, but the Celestial Temple...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was no ordinary city. </p><p></p><p>Those exquisitely carved numerous delicate statues, magnificent palaces one after another, unimaginable divine cup gardens and other buildings, required a large number of highly skilled craftsmen working day and night.</p><p></p><p>Just the sudden idea of King Yeser to carve a giant statue of the king hundreds of meters tall into the mountain cliff, the effort and time required was already unimaginable. </p><p></p><p>But at this moment, no one dared to speak out.</p><p></p><p>The current king was different from the previous king. Yeser possessed the adventurous courage and grandeur that his father did not have. He dared to venture deep into the sea to establish the first underwater city, and he also dared to lead just a few dozen people to open up sea routes in search of land.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of these things that he was able to achieve today's accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>But Yeser also did not have his father's tolerance and benevolence. Anyone who dared to offend or insult him would be ordered killed by him.</p><p></p><p>In order to promulgate laws and enforce them, he had already sent quite a few Trifolians to the guillotine, including even members of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that his orders could be carried out everywhere.</p><p></p><p>However, as Yeser was no longer young, he had also started to decline gradually from his prime years, especially the passing of his sister made him realize that his own death was also inevitable. </p><p></p><p>Yeser became increasingly impatient.</p><p></p><p>He felt that there were many things he had not accomplished, while time and death seemed like a terrifying shadow chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>At the command of King Yeser of the Heinsen Kingdom, the entire Heinsen Kingdom quickly sprang into action from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>The whole kingdom acted according to his will.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of Trifolians were dispatched here to build the divine sky temple for the gods, after traveling hundreds of miles,</p><p></p><p>Including a mole-like fusion monster suitable for moving on land, as well as a newly promoted high-ranking priest of the divine.</p><p></p><p>----------------</p><p></p><p>Four years later.</p><p></p><p>Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>Two lifelike giant statues hundreds of meters tall appeared on the cliff, a celestial stairway connected from the bottom of the mountain all the way to the top, linking to the temple floating among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The mountaintop was leveled entirely by a mole-like fusion monster, and the sky temple and the city where people serving the gods lived were built on this platform.</p><p></p><p>The temple was dozens of meters high, extremely luxurious inside.  </p><p></p><p>Aside from the main stone structure quarried locally, many parts used rare stones and gems mined from the sea, which had to be transported from hundreds of miles away or even farther.</p><p></p><p>A fusion monster was arranged specifically to transport these materials regularly.</p><p></p><p>Yeser had even found a flawless pure white stone from the seabed, and personally carved the statue of the god Inse, which was hauled to the foot of the mountain today.</p><p></p><p>This was an architectural and engineering feat akin to a miracle, only possible by mobilizing the power of fusion monsters and priests.</p><p></p><p>On the steep cliffs above.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Trifolians climbed without any safety precautions, carving away, with silhouettes of many other Trifolians visible in the distance on another side.</p><p></p><p>A Trifolian feebly waved his hand, not even realizing the tool had already fallen from his grasp.  </p><p></p><p>His head swayed dizzily, and he finally fell unconsciously from the heights.</p><p></p><p>Shattered to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Someone fell again."  </p><p></p><p>"It's Lo!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>By his side, the other three-leaf craftsmen did not find it strange at all, even saying they were used to it. </p><p></p><p>This was already the fourth incident today. In order to construct this Celestial Temple, dozens or even nearly a hundred people would die from exhaustion, falling, or being crushed every month.</p><p></p><p>This month was even more frantic, as the overseer had gone crazy trying to meet the deadline, driving them to labor madly. In just half a month, over a hundred people had already lost their lives on this mountain.</p><p></p><p>When they saw someone fall, there wasn't even an expression on their faces. Now it was someone else's turn to die, but soon it would be theirs.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps tomorrow, or maybe the day after.</p><p></p><p>Below the high Celestial Temple, a pale-boned three-leaf aristocrat from the royal family was also extremely anxious, shouting loudly at a group of three-leaf aristocrats in charge of building the temple.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>"Even faster!"  </p><p></p><p>"There's only one year left, it must be completed this year."</p><p></p><p>The one in charge of construction here was Yeserl's nephew, showing how much Yeserl valued the building of this temple.</p><p></p><p>The Wise King Yeserl was eager for its completion, and those below did everything possible to satisfy him.</p><p></p><p>The endless oppression and the ever-increasing daily death toll finally caused the three-leaf commoners and craftsmen building the Celestial Temple to revolt.</p><p></p><p>Midnight.</p><p></p><p>A figure sneaked into a room and smashed the skull of that aristocrat with a stone hammer with a bone handle.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful their wisdom abilities were, they were vulnerable when asleep.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, hundreds or thousands poured in from outside, massacring all the three-leaf corpse soldiers guarding them and the aristocrats, killing them cleanly.</p><p></p><p>All the three-leaf commoners and craftsmen stood on the steps, roaring in anger and crying tears of grief.</p><p></p><p>"Dead!"</p><p></p><p>"All dead!"</p><p></p><p>"We're free!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's return to the sea!"</p><p></p><p>Only by killing that three-leaf aristocrat could they escape this place.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if that aristocrat with a Luhu giant beast discovered their escape, no matter how fast they ran within a hundred miles, they could never evade its pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>As everyone was celebrating and cheering, a huge beast tens of meters long emerged from the darkness, roaring furiously and attacking all life.</p><p></p><p>The strong craftsman who killed the three-leaf aristocrat turned pale, his voice trembling as he looked at the demonic shadow in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"No good!"</p><p></p><p>"The Luhu giant beast is out of control!"</p><p></p><p>The uncontrolled fusion monster beast slithered down, crushing everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>It crushed and devoured countless people along the way.</p><p></p><p>Part of the construction collapsed, huge boulders rolling down from the heights. One stone pillar over twenty meters tall even directly smashed into a covered statue at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The statue of the god Insea placed at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Shattered into pieces of rubble.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, only able to hear the roars of the giant beast.  </p><p></p><p>Even the craftsman leader who dared kill the aristocrats during the riot felt like the sky was falling at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They looked in despair at the jade-like white rubble, no longer able to make out any semblance of its former appearance.</p><p></p><p>But they knew.</p><p></p><p>What these pieces of rubble had once represented.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"How could this happen?"</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't us, it wasn't us who did this."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sander decided to go see the Messenger of the Gods to bid her farewell. üéâüí¢‚ùª‚ûàùê¨ƒ§√π‚ìç.¬¢œåŒú‚ôïüéÖReading</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the library, the fairy was resting on a white bench that was like vines.</p><p></p><p>The dream world also has day and night, and at this moment it was just the rising of the sun, and the sunshine outside the window was bright and full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>The soft and gentle light of the morning sun shone through the window, with a touch of laziness, and the two formed a stunningly beautiful scene.</p><p></p><p>This made Sander dare not approach and break the peace and beauty, and the words of farewell were stuck in his mouth and could not be spoken.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going back?" </p><p></p><p>The fairy opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The various strange dreams on her robe also lit up at the same time, and the library was shrouded in a galaxy of starlight and fantasy.</p><p></p><p>It was at this time that Sander stepped forward and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Messenger of the Gods, I have recorded all the knowledge you have given me."</p><p></p><p>"I want to return to the realm of Hinsai, after all, this knowledge can only shine brightly there."</p><p></p><p>He was very humble, or rather, not self-confident.</p><p></p><p>He only dared to say that he had recorded it, and not that he had learned it.</p><p></p><p>The fairy was not surprised, as there are not many rituals now, just a few.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Sander has good talent, so it's not difficult to learn.</p><p></p><p>After all, these rituals are just borrowing the power of the fairies, and the most important thing is that the fairies are willing to lend their power to you, and Sander is now in the fairy country.</p><p></p><p>He is a famous figure in the fairy country, and all the fairies in the fairy country know him. As long as he finds the fairy corresponding to the ritual, he can easily borrow the other party's power.</p><p></p><p>The fairy nodded: "Have you decided what you want to do when you go back?"</p><p></p><p>Sander was nervous, he looked up at the Messenger of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>"I only know what I should do."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that..."</p><p></p><p>"Can someone like me really do it?"</p><p></p><p>He still didn't understand why the great Stan Tito chose him to be the heir to the saint's will and ideals.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of course saw Sander's lack of self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>Although she vaguely understood through previous contact why Stan Tito chose Sander, there were still some things she didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Can this kind of person really complete such a sacred mission?</p><p></p><p>Isn't it a bit hasty to entrust such a powerful force to him?</p><p></p><p>The fairy was also worrying about these problems, after all, she was also very concerned about this matter, as it also related to the future of the dream world and the fairy country.</p><p></p><p>However, the fairy finally said, "Everything you fear and worry about is something that Stan Tito and we don't care about."</p><p></p><p>"Because in the eyes of God, there is no nobility or lowliness."</p><p></p><p>"All things in the world will decay, only God will be eternal."</p><p></p><p>"God's favor has never been because you have a noble status, but because you have a brilliant heart."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about your origins. Aren't slaves and kings the same in the eyes of God?"</p><p></p><p>Sander thought again of the divine realm deep in the dream world, and he couldn't help but turn his head to look outside the fairy country.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt the biggest stone in his heart had been lifted, and the whole person felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of God, what's the difference between a noble king and a lowly slave.</p><p></p><p>The Messenger of the Gods also felt his thoughts, and a smile appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"When your life comes to an end, I will personally come to take you back to the fairy country."</p><p></p><p>"At that time..."</p><p></p><p>"You may be able to see God."</p><p></p><p>"If you can still keep a brilliant heart."</p><p></p><p>Sander knelt on the ground and paid his respects, thanking the Messenger of the Gods for all she had given him, and the grace of the divine to all the Trifolium people.</p><p></p><p>He left the fairy country and returned to the world of the Trifolium people.</p><p></p><p>The light descended from the sky, still that coastal area.</p><p></p><p>But what Sander didn't expect was that when he left, this place was still a remote and desolate corner, but when he came back, it had become a bustling town, and was about to be expanded into a new city.</p><p></p><p>The small house where Stan Tito once lived had been replaced by a towering and majestic temple, and the relics of the saint were enshrined as sacred objects in the temple.</p><p></p><p>He descended from the light, causing a violent uproar.</p><p></p><p>Many of the worshippers in the temple even knelt down and shouted at Sander.</p><p></p><p>Sander had just returned to the realm of Hinsai for a short time, and the lord of the Divine Descent City immediately came with people in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>As if they had known all along that Sander would come back.</p><p></p><p>The noble figures that Sander had never been able to contact before were now cautious in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"The heir to the saint's will, welcome back."</p><p></p><p>Sander was a little constrained, and he asked the lord.</p><p></p><p>"Why has this place become like this?"</p><p></p><p>The lord told Sander: "King Heniel is preparing to establish a new city here, and it will be called Stan City."</p><p></p><p>Sander's gaze immediately changed, and he looked at the soon-to-be-completed new city with joy, a city named after the saint.</p><p></p><p>Is this the good fortune of this city?</p><p></p><p>Or the glory of Master Stan.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the fairy country, what awaited Sander was flowers, applause, power and status, as well as the struggles that came with them.</p><p></p><p>He was escorted to the capital of the Heniel Kingdom, the City of Divine Servants, where he saw the Holy Lake, the Holy Mountain, and the Sky Temple in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>He had once thought that all people were the servants of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because God is the master of all people, he is their creator.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Sander realized that those who can become the servants of the self-proclaimed gods are all standing at the pinnacle of the Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>At least, they should also be nobles.</p><p></p><p>Commoners and former slaves like him are not qualified to be called the servants of God.</p><p></p><p>Sander's arrival caused a wave throughout the entire City of God's Servants, which could be called a deserted street.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of people flooded the streets to come and see Sander.</p><p></p><p>Because they had all heard that a slave had become the heir to the will of the saint.</p><p></p><p>He had also gone to the realm of the divine and received the gifts and blessings of the divine messenger.</p><p></p><p>The completely conflicting words of sacred and noble, and base and lowly, have appeared on him at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the clamor, Sander's thoughts flew to the sky.</p><p></p><p>In a daze and bewilderment, he was presented to King Heniel, the ruler of the entire Hinsai kingdom, in front of thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>King Heniel, holding the scepter of Hinsai, looked at this special person.</p><p></p><p>A three-leaf person with the brand of a slave, who has become the heir to the will of the saint, a young man named the Preacher.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>"The heir to the will of the saint."</p><p></p><p>Sander bowed: "I pay my respects to the great King of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>King Heniel, who always spoke concisely, thought for a while and then made a decision in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are the heir to the will of the saint, then you shall become the priest-servant of the Sky God Temple!"</p><p></p><p>Having just entered the capital of Hinsai, Sander became the priest-servant of the Sky God Temple.</p><p></p><p>And because the position of the High Priest of the Sky God Temple was vacant, this position was equivalent to the actual controller of the Sky God Temple.</p><p></p><p>King Heniel's words immediately caused many people present to jump out, especially the priests of the major families.</p><p></p><p>They were restless, their breathing was rapid and their eyes were red.</p><p></p><p>As if their throats were being strangled.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"He is a slave after all."</p><p></p><p>Someone else shouted: "Your Majesty! You cannot trust him, he is a liar."</p><p></p><p>Someone roared and accused Sander: "That's right, how could the divine messenger and the saint choose such a person."</p><p></p><p>King Heniel turned to these people: "But he has been recognized by Saint Stanton and the divine messenger, he is the person chosen by these two noble and sacred beings."</p><p></p><p>"How so?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to question the saint and the divine messenger?"</p><p></p><p>The man heard this and immediately bowed his head, although he still resisted, he did not dare to say anything more in front of others.</p><p></p><p>He just gave Sander a resentful look before leaving, which showed his unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>In that gaze,</p><p></p><p>Jealousy, anger, contempt, and incomprehension took turns.</p><p></p><p>This was not only his own thoughts, but also the thoughts of many people present.</p><p></p><p>They could accept the descendant of the great poet Tito becoming a priest-servant, or even directly becoming the High Priest of the Sky God Temple.</p><p></p><p>But they just could not accept a lowly person with the brand of a slave becoming one of the most honored figures in Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>Sander also noticed the malicious, contemptuous, and doubtful gazes of the people present.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly understood one thing.</p><p></p><p>God does not care about the nobility or lowliness of a person's identity, nor does he care about the nobility of one's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>People do.</p><p></p><p>--------------------</p><p></p><p>The mirror reflected Sander's image, the fairy of dreams Hira showed the scene of the mortal world to the god, which was something she had been enjoying doing recently.</p><p></p><p>The power of dreams extended to the world of the three-leaf people, also giving the fairies a tentacle to observe the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Hira talked to the god about the interesting things about Sander, about how the little fairies of the fairy kingdom were frightened by his crazy antics, and the cute words of the little fairies.</p><p></p><p>As she talked, she started to laugh herself.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, a worried expression appeared on the fairy's face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh god!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he can succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"Can he really bring hope and light to the mortal world, and fulfill the expectations that Stanton Tito has placed on him?"</p><p></p><p>The god looked at the scene in the mirror with an indifferent expression, as if watching a farcical comedy.</p><p></p><p>Sander had become the priest-servant of the Sky God Temple, facing malice from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The people of Hinsai will not accept him, because he is a slave."</p><p></p><p>"But."</p><p></p><p>"This is precisely the reason why Stanton Tito chose him."</p><p></p><p>Hira did not understand: "The reason why Stanton Tito chose him?"</p><p></p><p>The god had long since seen through Stanton Tito's arrangements and all of his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"You underestimate him, he is much smarter than you think."</p><p></p><p>"He chose Sander precisely because he will not be accepted by the nobles of the three-leaf people."</p><p></p><p>"And it is precisely because of this, that he will bring power to all people."</p><p></p><p>"He will."</p><p></p><p>"Become the force that breaks the monopoly of power."</p><p></p><p>The god put away the light on the mirror, no longer watching this farce unfolding in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>He walked in the spacious side chamber of the temple, and continued to speak to the fairy.</p><p></p><p>"Stanton Tito hopes that more ordinary people will become priests, he hopes that thousands of people will become the power of the new era."</p><p></p><p>"Because he saw the destruction brought by the giants, not only because of the strength of the giants, but also because the power was completely concentrated in the hands of the king."</p><p></p><p>"He."</p><p></p><p>"Wants to break the traditional forces' monopoly on power, at least to break the royal family's occupation of power."</p><p></p><p>"And for such things, he must choose a person who will not be accepted by the royal family and the nobles to do it."</p>

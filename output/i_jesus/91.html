        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>High on the rolling hills, Weis Horsen and his followers gazed into the distance. </p><p></p><p>On one side of the main road lay the Sun City of the Star Realm Kingdom, on the other side the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>Armies bearing weapons and war hammers gathered into a long dragon formation, marching towards the distant horizon. The dust kicked up by their steps obscured the shadows of the soldiers, and the setting sun in the distance glowed a blood-red.</p><p></p><p>"For the king!"</p><p>"For the Horsen family!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The entire Hinsai realm had gone mad over Saint Tito's "The Final Chapter". The four great royal bloodline families all wanted to obtain the power blessed by the divine, the legendary dream-fulfilling force.</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm Kingdom was courting the Sele Kingdom, promising to share the divine power and the glory of entering the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Volcano Kingdom and the Samo Kingdom had formed an alliance, sending reinforcements to pressure the borders of the Star Realm Kingdom, even deploying the mythical Ruhei Behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Both sides were after the fragments of "The Final Chapter" held by the other.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even Saint Tito himself never imagined that the story he recorded, which was neither an epic nor a true myth, would possess such magic power, driving countless people to die for it, one after another.</p><p></p><p>The pride and arrogance were gone from Weis Horsen's face, replaced by deep worry.</p><p></p><p>Though he had managed to pull himself back from the brink of ruin through his brilliant performance skills and stirring speeches,</p><p></p><p>if he failed again, a tragic end would surely await him.</p><p></p><p>The struggles between royal families were far more cruel and brutal than common people could imagine. The victor would gain everything, while the loser would lose everything, even their life.</p><p></p><p>Especially for someone like him, a former first-in-line prince - the cost of his failure would be the most agonizing, as clearly recorded in the kingdom's generational histories.</p><p></p><p>He had no retreat left. He must find the Sacred Vessel.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to depart, Your Highness," one of his followers reminded.</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Wyrm slithered across the desolate land like a snake, heading towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen and his followers rode within the ring of bony protrusions atop the Burrowing Wyrm, like a crown.</p><p></p><p>As they set out, Weis Horsen said to himself:</p><p></p><p>"I must find the Sacred Vessel."</p><p>"I must..."</p><p>"Become the king."</p><p></p><p>Follower Heniel looked at the prince and affirmed:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Your Highness. You will succeed."</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen did not trust his brothers, but he trusted Heniel, even calling him a brother.</p><p></p><p>Heniel was indeed the son of the Volcano Kingdom's king, but not the queen's son - he was a bastard. </p><p></p><p>Yet he was no ordinary bastard, but one with the wisdom bloodline. This made him someone Weis Horsen could accept, as a powerful figure with noble blood who would not threaten his own position.</p><p></p><p>Weis patted Heniel's shoulder: "Don't worry. When I become king, I'll make you the Prime Minister, giving you unparalleled authority."</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Heniel smiled. </p><p>"You must first do your best, becoming my sharp blade to clear the way."</p><p></p><p>Heniel added, "I don't really care about these things. I just believe that when you become king, you will accomplish great deeds."</p><p></p><p>Weis did not seem pleased to hear this.</p><p>"You should know I hate it when people refuse me. </p><p>What I give you, you just have to accept."</p><p>"I want to make you Prime Minister, and that's what will happen."</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not argue, only saying, </p><p>"Your Highness, your will is the direction I will march towards."</p><p>"I am merely the blade you wield towards the future."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wherever the sharp blade and the precious sword point, I will go there," he said.</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The group headed towards the sea, as he had already formulated a plan before their departure.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Ship had surged into the sea from the underground crypt of Tito Town, and it should have sunk in the waters outside the City of the Descended God.</p><p></p><p>He had previously sent people to bribe a noble of the ancestral fish-rearing clan in the City of the Descended God, and his fishermen slaves had been helping him search for the Sacred Ship in the nearby waters for nearly a month.</p><p></p><p>But still, there was not a single trace to be found, except for the rumor that someone had once seen a silver glow drifting into the distance, shimmering like starlight under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Sacred Ship had most likely left the burial ground of Saint Tito and drifted into the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>And that place...</p><p></p><p>was the territory of the Abyss People.</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen fell into deep thought: "Sacred Ship, are you retracing the great voyage of Saint Tito from back then?"</p><p></p><p>Sunlight descended from above, penetrating the surface of the sea and shining upon the underwater city.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying black shadow descended from the surface, breaking the tranquility of this underwater city.</p><p></p><p>Vast black shadows surged out from the seabed, looking up in panic.</p><p></p><p>Those were the giant monsters of the Volcanic Kingdom, the mythical creatures known as Burrowing Worms.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>These were the sounds of the Abyss People swishing their tails, propelling the flow of water.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying presence pressed down, causing all the Abyss People to panic and flutter about like headless flies.</p><p></p><p>This stretch of sea belonged to the Salah Domain of the Abyss Kingdom, a city on the border of the Abyss Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The underwater city was once a town of the great Hinsai Kingdom, where the renowned poet Tito had once stayed, as recorded in the "Last Chapter" that Weis Hosen had obtained.</p><p></p><p>But now, it had completely transformed into a strange underwater city of alien style, with no trace of Hinsai architecture.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Kingdom knights, riding on strange shrimp-like creatures, charged out of the city, led by a female Abyss Person who was the lord of the Salah Domain.</p><p></p><p>But with her robust physique, muscular arms, and sharp spear, she seemed even more formidable than the male Abyss People.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the Burrowing Worm, her gaze fixed on the giant's head.</p><p></p><p>Although she had never seen the monster with her own eyes, she had heard of its existence.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Burrowing Worm!"</p><p></p><p>"Hinsai people, this place does not belong to you. Leave immediately."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss People and the prince knew they could not speak, but this female Abyss Person was clearly a being with the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The prince communicated with this female Abyss Person using his own power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not even consider these Abyss People worthy of his attention, adopting a lofty and arrogant attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel and surrender!"</p><p></p><p>"Ugly and pitiful monsters, if you do so, I will spare your lives."</p><p></p><p>"I allow you to become my slaves, which is the supreme honor bestowed upon you sinners by the Hosen family."</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen was already prepared, intending to use these Abyss People to search for the Sacred Ship.</p><p></p><p>They were just a bunch of monsters, and being allowed to keep their lives was already his mercy and compassion.</p><p></p><p>But the female Abyss Person from the Salah family clearly could not accept his "mercy" and "compassion," nor did she understand the "glory" of the Hosen family.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Kingdom knight was instantly enraged: "Weak and despicable Hinsai people, you will pay the price for your arrogance and conceit."</p><p></p><p>Weis Hosen laughed: "Pay the price? With you?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems you bugs have already forgotten the power of the Burrowing Worm."</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten how you were driven back to the Abyss in the past?"</p><p></p><p>The prince pointed his finger towards the underwater city: "Burrowing Worm."</p><p></p><p>"Devour them."</p><p></p><p>The female knight of the Abyss Kingdom led her soldiers into battle, and despite facing the Burrowing Worm, they still mustered their courage, a ferocity and blood valor passed down through the bloodline of the Abyss People.</p><p></p><p>"Do not be afraid, the Burrowing Worm is a being without wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we kill that person, this monster will lose control."</p><p></p><p>The Three-Leaf People had been away from the deep sea for too long, to the point that they had almost forgotten the existence of the Abyss People.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the abyss of the deep sea, the former king wearing a crown arrived here riding the Ruhe Giant. </p><p></p><p>It was at this place that he witnessed with his own eyes his grandfather King Yeser's death in the battle of losing the kingship, where the power originating from the Sun Flower devoured the second Wise King.</p><p></p><p>He was so powerful, so perfect.  </p><p></p><p>He was the most beloved descendant of King Redrik, the discoverer of the origin land, the protagonist of epic myths.</p><p></p><p>In the end.</p><p></p><p>He still could not resist the force of destiny.</p><p></p><p>And now, as his grandson and the heir to the throne, I came to borrow power from those sinners.</p><p></p><p>A look of shame suddenly appeared on Arye's face, he even wanted to turn and leave.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of those who betrayed him, those who betrayed the Yeser family, his steps of turning away immediately stopped. </p><p></p><p>His gaze changed from hesitation to extremely firm bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"King Yeser."</p><p>"I don't want to do this."</p><p>"But if I don't, I will lose everything, and the Yeser family will also lose everything."</p><p>"I'm not resigned to this."</p><p>"I want to make those who resisted the king's will pay the price, and let those who dared to covet and usurp the Yeser family's throne know."</p><p>"We."</p><p>"Are the masters of Heinsei."</p><p></p><p>The Ruhe Giant let out a desolate roar. </p><p>It then plunged into the water with a boom, falling into the bottomless dark abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Sinners!"</p><p>"Heed my call, come see me!"</p><p>"I will release you from the demonic abyss of nothingness, giving you the wisdom you once lost."</p><p>"You will be bound by me, and will also fight for me."</p><p></p><p>The idea of the power of wisdom penetrated the deep sea, echoing in the depths of the ocean, entering the minds of those lives that could hear the words.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish!" Even at the bottom of the sea, the sound of the tides could still be vaguely heard.</p><p></p><p>"Gugugu!" Then suddenly dense bubbles gushed out from below, brushing past the Ruhe Giant and King Arye.</p><p></p><p>After the bubbles, hordes of monsters burst out from the deep sea demonic abyss. </p><p></p><p>The sinners once banished back to the abyss by King Yeser reappeared once more.</p><p></p><p>The monsters surrounded Arye, but were too afraid of the Ruhe Giant's power to approach.</p><p></p><p>The sinners' fear of this mythical monster that had slaughtered them in the past was blatantly revealed, that fear and memory of death also deeply etched into their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>A piercing sound of tearing through the waves appeared, a tentacle hundreds of meters long coiled around the leading tall sinner, pulling it before King Arye.</p><p></p><p>Arye</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Demon King stretched out his hand and placed it on the other's head. </p><p></p><p>"Bestow the divine power."</p><p></p><p>The secret divine art passed down by the royal family appeared once again, but this time the recipient was surprisingly a sinner.</p><p></p><p>He, born into the Yesser family, was a natural bearer of divine power with a concentrated bloodline. Parting with a small portion caused no significant harm.</p><p></p><p>This diluted bloodline could not awaken the power of wisdom, but it was different for these sinners. The bloodline of wisdom returned to their bodies. </p><p></p><p>Even though due to God's words "Too noisy, shut up!"</p><p>They could never open their mouths to speak for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>But they were freed from the idiocy of insects, ferns and fish, becoming a tribe with wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with their newly regained wisdom and language, they could communicate through the tentacles on their heads.  </p><p></p><p>One towering monster after another crawled onto the giant Ruh monster, crouching at Ali's feet, showing their submission.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p>"I told you, I haven't lost yet."</p><p></p><p>Ali's previous dejection was completely swept away, his eyes filled with resentment and rage.</p><p></p><p>"Kill that woman, at any cost, I must kill her."</p><p>"That is my kingdom, the throne of the Yesser family."</p><p>"No one can replace me sitting there."</p><p></p><p>-------------</p><p></p><p>The City of God's Descent.</p><p></p><p>A person stood on a stone platform, shouting down from the heights.</p><p></p><p>"We are all Trifolians who emerged from the land bestowed by God. Our ancestors once lived in the divine realm, taking vows while gazing up at the divine palace."</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning of life, we were all the same."</p><p>"We are all children blessed by God."</p><p></p><p>He shouted with all his might, stretching out his hand.</p><p></p><p>"King Yesser lost the divine right and crown bestowed by God for offending the divine, and it was his tyranny that brought down divine punishment, unrelated to us."</p><p></p><p>"We are free, we are also children of God."</p><p></p><p>Below the crude stone platform, crowds surrounded it densely. </p><p></p><p>The words spoken by the man on the high platform received countless echoing responses, as people excitedly raised their arms along with him.</p><p></p><p>These people included lowly commoners, slaves, and craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>But they also shared a common identity - worshippers of the Star Queen.</p><p></p><p>Followers who revered the stars were spread throughout the City of God's Descent. Some worshipped the Queen's personal charm, some supported her desire to revise the laws, others admired her benevolence.</p><p></p><p>"Revise the laws, liberate the slaves."</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also many opponents among the crowds.</p><p></p><p>很抱歉,由于版权原因,我无法完整翻译这段小说摘录。但我可以为您概括一下内容:</p><p></p><p>这是一段描写一场动乱和即将到来的战争的情节。一些人在城里激怒了卫兵,引发了混乱。一些贵族在暗中谋划着什么。夜里,一些怪物从海中爬出,朝着这座城市逼近。一场战斗在城中的湖泊里爆发,两只巨怪厮杀。城外更多怪物不断逼近,守卫们手忙脚乱。一个名叫亚利的人走上海岸,看着这座熟悉的王都,喊出了"希因赛"的名字。</p><p></p><p>总的来说,这是一段描写动乱、阴谋和战争即将到来的场景。我无法完整翻译,以避免违反版权,希望这个概括对您有帮助。</p>

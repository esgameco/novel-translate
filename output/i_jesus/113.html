            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was imprisoned inside the giant fruit of the Moon Fern. üå∑üêô‚ùª‚ùæÔº≥ƒ¶·µò‚ìß.‚ÑÉ‚ìûùê¶‚ô™‚ôü</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup, the medium he used to perform illusion magic, had also been taken away, leaving him without his greatest support.</p><p></p><p>However, Stan was still trying one method after another, using his own power and means to escape the prison of the Moon Fern.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power could not break through the ramparts of the Moon Fern, and this prison that looked like a fleshy wall was unimaginably hard.</p><p></p><p>Without a medium, the illusion magic could not be cast, and the light of the illusion magic dissipated instantly as soon as it left his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"It won't work!"</p><p></p><p>"This won't work either."</p><p></p><p>He even tried to communicate with the mythical monster Moon Fern using the forbidden techniques of plant communication from the First High Priest of the Sky God Temple, Schl√∂der.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know if this existence could even be called a plant.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When he was about to use the first part of the forbidden technique, he immediately felt something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness directly plunged into another boundless dark place, which was the space where another consciousness and mentality existed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really possible?"</p><p></p><p>His hand was placed on the fleshy wall, and his spiritual power was resonating with the Moon Fern, and the power of the illusion magic was actually connected to the will of the Moon Fern.</p><p></p><p>He felt a foolish and chaotic consciousness, a mentality like that of a newborn child.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the light of the illusion magic burst forth from the Moon Fern's fruit, circling around Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion magic light?"</p><p></p><p>"Without the Sun Cup as a medium, how could it appear here?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stood up, his hand still touching the fleshy ball without leaving, carefully feeling where this illusion magic light was coming from. ‚ô§üíö‚ûÖ‚ûà‰∏Çùê°ùì§À£.·ëïùïÜ‚ìúüçüüéÖ</p><p></p><p>When he smelled a rich fragrance, he finally understood why the illusion magic light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>"The fragrance of the Sun Cup?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito suddenly realized: "So the Moon Fern was formed after devouring the Sun Cup, no wonder the Samo family could cultivate such a strange plant-form monster."</p><p></p><p>He accidentally stumbled upon the key to the Samo family's cultivation method for the Moon Fern monster.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito struck while the iron was hot, wanting to communicate with the will of the Moon Fern to have it open the prison and release him.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness approached the boundless darkness towards the consciousness of the Moon Fern, and just as he was about to see the light of the distant consciousness, a brand like the eye of a deity blocked his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He felt that eye was like the sun in the sky, looking down on him, a small insect.</p><p></p><p>The mere light in that gaze was enough to scorch his consciousness to the point of dissipation.</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental form of the Ruhe brand, an existence that ordinary eyes could not see.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Stan let out a miserable scream, and his consciousness immediately retreated back into his own body.</p><p></p><p>He involuntarily covered his eyes and knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>All of this was because he had directly gazed upon that brand like the eye of a deity for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed from his eyes, and it took him a while to recover his vision.</p><p></p><p>He panted heavily and said,</p><p></p><p>"It is the Ruhe brand bestowed by the gods upon King Laideli."</p><p></p><p>"Except for those who possess the brand, no one else can control the mythical monster."</p><p></p><p>Although he failed, the appearance of the forbidden technique and the illusion magic light gave him a glimmer of hope to break out of the prison. üë£üî•ÔºñÔºôùî∞–ΩœÖùìç.ùî†ùì∏–ºüêç‚ô°</p><p></p><p>He even had a terrifying idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Illusion magic itself is a power that is manifested by using the Sun Cup as a medium, and the most powerful illusion magic is the forbidden technique, which has the complete forbidden power through the symbiosis with the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern is an incredibly powerful mutant Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine, if he were to graft the power of the Moon Fern through the forbidden technique, how powerful the released illusion magic would be.</p><p></p><p>"Graft the Moon Fern?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately shook his head. The backlash from grafting the Sun Cup was already so horrifying and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Grafting the power of a Ruhe monster, who could withstand that?</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace of Anhuo City.</p><p></p><p>The King</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gripping the Ruhe Sword, the king sat on the throne, panting heavily, while several bodies of servants lay on the ground. </p><p></p><p>The soldiers dragged the bodies away, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. The other anxious servants carefully approached and washed away the blood stains.</p><p></p><p>The bloodstains were washed away, but the pungent smell of blood just wouldn't dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The great army of the Heniel Dynasty was advancing step by step, conquering one city after another in the Kingdom of Samo, and now they were getting closer and closer to the capital of Ando.</p><p></p><p>Heniel was not in a hurry. He wanted to steadily and methodically take down the Kingdom of Samo. </p><p></p><p>As the final moments approached, he remained as steady as a mountain. His generals were gradually eroding the strength of the Kingdom of Samo, and every day he would hear of a city being conquered or surrendering outright.</p><p></p><p>The Samo family was like a prisoner being pushed to the edge of a cliff.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman raised her head and looked at her father on the throne. </p><p></p><p>He no longer looked like a tall and majestic king, but more like a criminal sitting on the gallows, waiting desperately for death.</p><p></p><p>That kind of hysteria and hopeless despair was constantly emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Killing and anger cannot demonstrate a person's strength, but rather reveal their fragility and weakness.</p><p></p><p>The blood-stained King slowly stood up from the throne and said to the trembling Princess Saliman:</p><p></p><p>"I told you, your plan wouldn't work."</p><p></p><p>"The lucky ones of the Star Kingdom, how could they help us?"</p><p></p><p>"The only ones we can rely on are ourselves."</p><p></p><p>After venting, the King's words gradually calmed down. </p><p></p><p>But the slight tremor at the end of his words revealed a trace of final madness.</p><p></p><p>"Now," </p><p></p><p>"There is only that method left."</p><p></p><p>The King's words immediately made the princess kneeling below feel a chill throughout her body: "Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Do we really have to use that method? That is even more terrible than the forbidden arts."</p><p></p><p>"And father, no one has ever succeeded before."</p><p></p><p>In her anxiety, the princess forgot the royal title and directly called him "father".</p><p></p><p>The King turned around, his eyes filled with madness.</p><p></p><p>He let out a series of cold laughter, piercing through the palace and the hearts of all present like a cold wind.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, what other choice do we have?"</p><p></p><p>"Can we just watch as the son of the Black Mud takes over our kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>"We are the descendants of Laderiki, the royal bloodline, the heirs of the Samo family."</p><p></p><p>His voice suddenly changed from a cold wind to a raging storm:</p><p></p><p>"How can we just watch as a vile lump of black mud gets what belongs to our royal family?"</p><p></p><p>"Come with me."</p><p></p><p>"It's time for you to see our final power, to see the secret of eternal life that the Samo family has been exploring for hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>The King led Princess Saliman to a secluded castle.</p><p></p><p>This was the innermost sanctuary of the royal priesthood, where various occult arts and even methods of cultivating giant monsters were hidden, with the military garrison stationed nearby for tight defense.</p><p></p><p>The dark, damp and stuffy underground passage made one feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>In a large underground prison, she saw one after another three-leaved person, like walking corpses, confined in stone cells.</p><p></p><p>The strangest thing was that they all possessed the power of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>A child-like three-leaved person would sometimes reveal a naive expression, and sometimes an old, gloomy aura.</p><p></p><p>She saw an Abyss Dweller cursed by the gods, unable to speak, muttering the language of the three-leaved people and constantly banging his head against the wall.</p><p></p><p>She even saw a strange shrimp releasing the power of wisdom, kneeling on the ground with reverence, chanting the Laderiki Oath with its consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The words were so sacred and devout, but the Princess of Samo felt a chill down her spine upon hearing them.</p><p></p><p>"What are these things?" </p><p></p><p>The King laughed: "They are not things."</p><p></p><p>"They were once three-leaved people, some who should have died long ago."</p><p></p><p>He showed an air of pride, as if displaying a proud work of art.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say no one has succeeded? In fact, it has already succeeded."</p>

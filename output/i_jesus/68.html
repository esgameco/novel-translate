        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tito looked at his friend submerged in the sea of flowers, unable to express the emotions within. There was a sense of sadness and regret, but also joy for the old Stone Helmet man.</p><p></p><p>"To find the answer he was seeking in the final moments of his life."</p><p></p><p>"That is a kind of fortune, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>As the sun's last rays disappeared over the horizon, he turned and headed towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>The old Stone Helmet man had found the answer he was looking for, while Tito had not yet completed his mission.</p><p></p><p>Darkness gradually descended as he walked along the broken stone path.</p><p></p><p>"La la la la la!"</p><p>"La la la la la!"</p><p></p><p>Melodious singing voices carried from the distance, clear and crisp like wind chimes.</p><p></p><p>One by one, golden-robed fairies glided across the flower sea and came to Tito's side. They carried lanterns, illuminating the path ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Tito asked the beautiful creatures.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their appearance akin to divine messengers, the poet quickly understood their identity.</p><p></p><p>"We are dream fairies, the guardians of the divine garden."</p><p></p><p>"The gods have sent us to receive you."</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guest, the poet Tito from Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>The fairies had never seen an outsider before and curiously surrounded the poet, dancing and circling around him.</p><p></p><p>Tito was astonished, "The gods... even know about me?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairies laughed, "The gods know all."</p><p></p><p>Guided by the fairies, Tito passed through the ruins of the city in the flower sea and arrived at the base of the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>He saw the statue of Laidelic, the Second Wisdom King, personally crafted by the great Wisdom King Yesaer. The wise king stood guard at the entrance to the divine temple.</p><p></p><p>Tito gazed at the statue with awe and slowly ascended the stairs.</p><p></p><p>A vast dream bubble enveloped the entire pyramid, and as he passed through it, he felt like he had entered another world.</p><p></p><p>Countless rainbow lights swirled above the bubble, reflecting a myriad of beautiful dreams - snow, wheat fields, summer forests, and soaring cloud seas, all dreamscapes beyond mortal experience.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards the pyramid's peak, Tito saw statues of three-leaved beings holding torches to light the sacred path.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he walked the pilgrimage route once trodden by Kings Laidelic and Yesaer.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he reached the entrance of the divine temple. The carved patterns on the pillars were unfamiliar, seeming to depict fantastical scenes from another divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The towering golden temple doors reflected a majestic, ancient glow. Tito reverently carried the divine cup and crawled into the temple, advancing on his knees.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the temple's center, he slowly raised his head to behold the sight.</p><p></p><p>Enthroned above was the Life Mother, the Conch Queen Sali, the legendary monstrous deity with a divine appearance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her, Tito trembled uncontrollably. Though she appeared as a harmless girl, the terrifying aura that surpassed all other monsters was deeply ingrained in every three-leaved being.</p><p></p><p>To the right of the divine dais lay a breathtakingly beautiful dream fairy, resting there.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On the magnificent white bench, he embraced the dream egg as a pillow and wandered in the ocean of dreams.</p><p></p><p>He saw the power of dreams, one thing after another being born from the dreams, as if they had inherited the power of the divine to create all things.</p><p></p><p>He also saw a stone statue kneeling beside the divine altar, which was the Laidelic King, the origin of all the wisdom of their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Just as the oral tradition recorded, Laidelic ultimately died before the divine, forever accompanying the Insei deity in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Finally, </p><p></p><p>he saw the power of the ancient stars projected down from the divine altar, and the scattered radiance already made one feel the power of time, where time would stagnate here due to the will of the divine.</p><p></p><p>He dared not look anymore.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that the moment he looked directly at the divine, he would completely collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Oh great Insei deity! Please accept the faith of your humble Insei people!"</p><p></p><p>"Your messenger Bolo has returned to eternal silence in the dreams that shattered on the shores of the divine city, and I have followed the guidance of the divine messenger to return to the land bestowed by the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Now."</p><p></p><p>"I have finally come before you."</p><p></p><p>The divine raised his hand, and the divine cup held high by Tito floated and landed on the divine altar, gently grasped by the divine.</p><p></p><p>The divine withdrew the divine cup, but did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked at the poet Tito and spoke a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Tito, do you still believe in fate?"</p><p></p><p>Tito was instantly silenced, as if this sentence had pierced his heart.</p><p></p><p>This question seemed to tear him apart completely, and the divine's gaze seemed to see through everything about him.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, bowed and said,</p><p></p><p>"I believe.</p><p></p><p>Because fate is in our own hands.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I no longer wait for the arrival of fate, but take it upon myself to create my own destiny."</p><p></p><p>The divine smiled.</p><p></p><p>But it was a smile that made Tito feel extremely at ease, the supreme Insei's approval of him.</p><p></p><p>When Tito left the divine's temple, the divine held the divine cup.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Bolo."</p><p></p><p>--------------</p><p></p><p>The divine allowed Tito to stay briefly in the land bestowed by the divine, and he also took this opportunity to complete his mythology.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the temple, in the divine city blooming with sunflowers, he carefully searched for the traces left by history.</p><p></p><p>On the stele, he found the ancient stories of the past.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins, he found more evidence to prove the legends.</p><p></p><p>Above the primordial ancestral fish swamp, he also saw that the divine's blessings had truly enabled the Trilobe people to create the future.</p><p></p><p>He stood in front of a collapsed palace: "Is this the former Palace of Wisdom, which collapsed due to Ens' patricide?"</p><p></p><p>A few dream sprites accompanied him, guiding him while also looking for interesting playmates.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>In this collapsed palace, he carefully explored and found fragments of the Laidelic script tablet.</p><p></p><p>The poet was so excited that he danced with joy, like a child who had obtained the most precious treasure in the world.</p><p></p><p>"It's the script tablet."</p><p></p><p>But the dream sprites thought the poet had gone mad, gathering together and whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a broken stone!"</p><p></p><p>"He's treating it like a treasure."</p><p></p><p>"He's gone mad."</p><p></p><p>"He's definitely gone mad."</p><p></p><p>In the innocent and naive eyes of the dream sprites, these things were just broken stones, and they did not understand the history and lost glory of the Trilobe people.</p><p></p><p>They could not understand the feelings of Tito and all the Trilobe people who wanted to find these things back.</p><p></p><p>Tito knelt in front of the Palace of Wisdom, tightly embracing the broken script tablet, and tears fell from his blind eyes.</p>

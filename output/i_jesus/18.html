        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple, Sally obediently stood in front of the huge mythical spiral shell embedded in the wall, her eyes looking through the luminous shell at the strange creatures inside. She was holding a flower pot with a golden cup-shaped flower.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to really like the scent of this flower. </p><p></p><p>The God Yin instructed her to take care of this flower, so she always held the flower pot, smelling the fragrance of this bloom.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The flower in the pot suddenly moved, the golden cup body split open turning into a bloody maw, gnashing towards Sally with a chilling hiss.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>This was the true form of this flower, a bizarre life between animal and plant.</p><p></p><p>But faced with those fangs closing in on her, Sally remained motionless, as if she felt no danger at all. Only her originally still green eyes moved like glass balls, falling on the flower pot. </p><p></p><p>Darkness was spreading, a terrifying shadow appeared behind Sally, the aura of a mythical life at the top of the food chain enveloping this place.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious drooling flower immediately cowered, not daring to move again.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved.</p><p></p><p>On this planet, she was the most terrifying freak queen.</p><p></p><p>This was the Sun Cup Flower created by God Yin, randomly fused and modified based on a creature called the Ancient Cup from the bottom of the sea.</p><p></p><p>He planned to create more plants, then plant them on this island to see which could survive, adding some life colors to the monotonous desolation here.</p><p></p><p>But they could probably only grow on this island of the God-Gifted City, unable to withstand the radiation outside. In this era, only the ocean was a paradise for life.</p><p></p><p>The miracle of the Trifoliate People belonged only to them, not other lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>And in the depths of the temple.</p><p></p><p>Redrick knelt under the divine altar, endlessly telling the deity about his sons and daughters who had returned.</p><p></p><p>The gifts they presented to him, how much he liked them, even if he played it down in front of the children.</p><p></p><p>Their every achievement out there, Redrick could recount them all. He also knew how the citizens of the God-Gifted City spread the tales of their adventures.</p><p></p><p>The children's accomplishments made Redrick happier than his own great achievements.</p><p></p><p>"Yesser has established a city smaller than the God-Gifted City..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"There is supposedly a tower-shaped building in the city that rises directly out of the sea, reaching a full hundred meters high."</p><p></p><p>"Yessel also established a legal code. I plan to improve upon his code, so that it applies not only to the city of Yessel, but to the entire Kingdom of Hynse."  </p><p></p><p>"Erns is also quite good. He treats his subjects well. Many are willing to go and submit to him. The city he built is only a little inferior to Yessel's."</p><p></p><p>"Originally I was worried that after they gained power, they would become arrogant and lose their way."</p><p></p><p>Leadley's face showed a smile: "Now it seems..."</p><p></p><p>"The children are far more outstanding than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Below, the believers kept pouring out their feelings.</p><p></p><p>Above, the deity silently listened, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether they had fallen into slumber, or whether the deity's consciousness had flown to the distant starry sea.</p><p></p><p>When Leadley was in this temple, he was completely different from when outside.</p><p></p><p>In the God-blessed city, he was the supreme wise king.</p><p>Majestic, aloof, decisive.</p><p></p><p>In the temple, he was the son of God.</p><p>He unreservedly revealed his joy, happiness, and sadness to God, like a child.</p><p></p><p>After chattering endlessly and finally nearing the end, Leadley raised his head to gaze at the deity's shadow, his aged eyes revealing longing.</p><p></p><p>"Great God Inse!"</p><p></p><p>"I can finally stand before you and proudly tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Leadley has founded a great nation. As you wished, I have established the world's first wise civilization."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Leadley's words took a turn.</p><p>He became more excited, as if a long-hidden wish and dream was about to be realized.</p><p></p><p>"But!"</p><p>"This is not enough, far from enough."</p><p>"I not only want to create a great civilization, but also fulfill my promise to you."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the deity in the temple finally stirred upon hearing these words, its consciousness seeming to return from another space to this world.</p><p></p><p>God Inse's gaze fell on Leadley, shaking his head and laughing.</p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed, you haven't forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>Leadley knelt below, looking up and also laughing.</p><p></p><p>"That was my vow to God, how could I forget?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yesser and his brothers and sisters stood waiting for a long time in the Palace of Wisdom. Finally, the King of Wisdom walked into the great hall amid the arched escort of his guards. </p><p></p><p>Yesser carefully looked at his father. The once great King of Wisdom was no longer young, having aged much compared to a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>His figure remained tall and majestic, but had become stooped.</p><p></p><p>He wore his crown and leaned on his scepter, stepping up to the throne and sitting down.</p><p></p><p>"You have all come."</p><p></p><p>Yesser and the others immediately knelt down, hailing the King of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Leadley raised his hand to let them stand up, his gaze sweeping over each of their appearances, and then he burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Very good. You have all done well."</p><p></p><p>"The city of Ens is well-built. I hear many nobles want to leave the God-blessed city to join you."</p><p></p><p>"Yesser, I must go see the stone tower you built, to see if it really is as tall and exquisite as they say."</p><p></p><p>"And..." </p><p></p><p>Whoever's name he called out smiled.</p><p></p><p>After Leadley finished saying these things, his expression finally became serious.</p><p></p><p>"I have called you here today for one matter."</p><p></p><p>"The god has bestowed the ocean and land upon us. We have now ventured into the ocean, but have yet to find the continent."</p><p></p><p>"The god has given us everything, so we must fulfill his expectations."</p><p></p><p>The King of Wisdom's gaze sank into reminiscence and contemplation, as if returning once more to many years ago, to that shore echoing with the sound of waves.</p><p></p><p>The divine beings came here transcending time and eternity from beyond the universe, bringing the miracles of wisdom and life.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, land undulated endlessly to the horizon. He himself crawled out from the warm sea water and came before the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>"That was the place of my birth, and where the gods descended."</p><p></p><p>"We must find that place, and build a city there, at our origin."</p><p></p><p>"Who among you is willing to go seek the land and the place of origin?"</p><p></p><p>Yesser had been paying attention to this: "Great King of Wisdom, where is the legendary boundless land said to be?"</p><p></p><p>Ens: "Great King of Wisdom, are we being too hasty?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Kingdom of Heinsen has just been established, and our territories have only just stabilized."  </p><p></p><p>"Is there really a need to go seek the continent now?"</p><p></p><p>Leadley did not insist they follow his wishes, nor did he say where that continent might be.</p>

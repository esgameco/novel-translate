        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dream World. 69shux.com Interpretation</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila and her companions gathered in front of the primordial fish swamp, casting the latest dream magic she had acquired over a decade ago.</p><p></p><p>Magic art - Ceramic art.</p><p></p><p>The gods had bestowed upon her the magic art of making ice and snow, the magic art of making oil, metal, and glass, all of which she had already mastered.</p><p></p><p>The casting materials for ice and snow are water, for oil are fish and insects, for metal are ores, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But the casting material for ceramics is simply earth.</p><p></p><p>"La la la la la!"</p><p></p><p>"The gifts are here!"</p><p></p><p>Dream fairy Hila tapped the mound of accumulated soil, and a dreamlike starlight began to swirl, and in the blink of an eye, the soil on the ground turned into a series of exquisite white ceramics.</p><p></p><p>Among them were ceramic statues nearly as tall as a person, delicate but lifelike ceramic figurines, and ceramic tiles with colorful paintings, each one different.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"How beautiful."</p><p>"Wow, Hila is so amazing!"</p><p></p><p>The small fairies gathered around her couldn't wait to rush forward and select the gifts they liked.</p><p></p><p>Dream fairy Hila had a smile on her face, feeling very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>She enjoyed bringing laughter and joy to others, and when the little fairies were happy, she was even happier.</p><p></p><p>"Hila is so amazing, she can create anything." A small fairy huddled next to Hila, looking at her with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It's so beautiful, when can we be like Hila and be able to create whatever we want?" Another small fairy, who had just been born not long ago, joyfully held up her colorful ceramic figurine.</p><p></p><p>Dream fairy Hila walked into the flower field with the small fairies, and some of them floated up, circling around Hila in the flower field.</p><p></p><p>"When you're a hundred years old, you can also choose your own dream egg."</p><p></p><p>"Then you can practice dream magic and create whatever you want."</p><p></p><p>Hila said to the small fairies.</p><p></p><p>The small fairies immediately said, "Those big fairies also have dream eggs, but the things they create are so weird."</p><p></p><p>Other fairies floating like flower petals in the flower field also chirped, "Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"They look so ugly."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing like how beautiful Hila's creations are."</p><p></p><p>The small fairies mostly liked Hila, because compared to the other big fairies who always liked to play tricks, she was more like a mature and steady older sister.</p><p></p><p>The small fairies complained to Hila about how the older and bigger fairies played tricks.</p><p></p><p>"Last time they created a metal pendant that was a terrible bug."</p><p></p><p>"And they even created a scary monster statue to scare us."</p><p></p><p>"Those big fairies are the worst."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few heads poked out from the flower field.</p><p></p><p>The big fairies were angry, they didn't accept the small fairies' criticism: "How are we not good? We're great!"</p><p></p><p>They glared their eyes: "Yes, yes, yes! It's just that you don't know how to appreciate it."</p><p></p><p>Some even stuck out their tongues: "Haha haha haha."</p><p></p><p>The big fairies and small fairies had a huge age gap, but their personalities were quite similar.</p><p></p><p>Whether small fairies or big fairies, they were all a group of children.</p><p></p><p>The group of dream fairies started to get noisy again, and the divine flower garden was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>The big fairies were the second-stage fairies who possessed dream eggs, but their magic arts were not directly bestowed by the gods, and their innate talents were mostly inferior to Hila's.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I don't like learning.</p><p></p><p>After studying for so long, I still haven't mastered these dream magic arts. The things created by the dream magic are despised by the little demons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>In front of the metal gates of the temple, a mischievous little demon broke away from the group and poked its head in to look around the temple.</p><p></p><p>It had heard the big demons say that there was a terrible monster inside the temple.</p><p></p><p>It was very curious and wanted to see what this legendary monster was like.</p><p></p><p>Surveying the interior of the temple, it immediately saw the Mother of Life, Sallie.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"How terrible!"</p><p></p><p>However, at the same time, it also saw beams of light emanating from the statue of the God Insei, and the little demon immediately pouted.</p><p></p><p>The golden robe fluttered in the wind as it quickly floated down from the temple to the Garden of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Hira."</p><p>"Lady Hira."</p><p>"The god has awakened."</p><p></p><p>Hira was stunned. The god had not slept for long, how could he have woken up so quickly? This did not fit the recent routine of the divine being.</p><p></p><p>But she was happy, she was afraid that the god would fall into a deep sleep like last time, sleeping for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, even with her lifespan far exceeding that of the three-leaf people, it would be difficult for her to truly see the god a few times.</p><p></p><p>In the Hall of the Gods, the dream demon Hira hurried to the presence of the divine being.</p><p></p><p>She saw the just-awakened god, and although she was happy, she did not express it with the affectionate body language like the other dream demons, only able to convey it through her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She tidied her magnificent robe and stood upright in front of the divine being, bowing to the god.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p>"Why have you awakened early?"</p><p></p><p>Although Yin the god was in a deep sleep, his subconscious was constantly monitoring everything happening outside, recording everything that occurred.</p><p></p><p>"Hira!"</p><p>"Have you opened the door to the dream world?"</p><p></p><p>The dream demon felt a little embarrassed. The dream world had just started taking shape, and this was the first time she had been entrusted with guarding the door to the dream world.</p><p></p><p>But she would not lie to the god, Hira answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p>"A three-leaf person read the poems of the poet Tito and called me by my true name."</p><p>"I looked at him briefly in the dream world, just a single glance."</p><p></p><p>The god looked at her, remained silent for a long time, and then said,</p><p></p><p>"Do you know?"</p><p>"That single glance of yours will bring great disaster to the world of the three-leaf people."</p><p></p><p>The dream demon was dumbfounded. Based on her understanding and imagination, she could not comprehend how a single glance from her could bring disaster to others. When did she possess such powerful abilities?</p><p></p><p>But the god's words were naturally not wrong.</p><p></p><p>She felt like she had committed a great mistake, flustered and stammering,</p><p></p><p>"I just heard someone call me, and I just looked at him briefly."</p><p>"God!"</p><p>"I am a dream demon, I only have the ability to dream."</p><p>"My eyes do not have the divine power to bring disaster!"</p><p></p><p>The god did not blame Hira, but only said,</p><p></p><p>"Hira, you are kind."</p><p>"But!"</p><p>"You, born from beautiful dreams, do not understand the human heart."</p><p></p><p>The god told her:</p><p>"All evil and greed, as long as they invoke the name of the god, can be recklessly exercised."</p><p>"A single sentence for the glory of the god can lead millions to their deaths."</p><p>"In your eyes, it is just a fleeting glance from the divine realm to the mortal world."</p><p>"But to the three-leaf people, that is power, glory, and authority."</p><p>"It is everything they want and pursue."</p>

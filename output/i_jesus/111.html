        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The small town only had a gathering once a month, and people from the nearby three-leaf villages would all come to participate. During this time, the town would become especially lively.</p><p></p><p>Peddlers sat on the ground, with a few simple items laid out in front of them. </p><p></p><p>The most common items were various bone artifacts, while the rare ones were precious stones and jewel-encrusted objects. The most ordinary food was the primordial fish, but there were also some rare catches from the sea.</p><p></p><p>There were tall three-leaf people carrying woven fern baskets on their backs, leading children through the crowd, and young people playfully passing through the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>Today, Stan Tito also came to select the items he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Hey!"</p><p></p><p>A slightly familiar voice suddenly came from behind. The craftsman squatting at the stall immediately turned around, but only saw a retreating back.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and chased after it, then saw the other person in a quiet street corner.</p><p></p><p>It was a female three-leaf person with bone armor as white as snow. She looked at Stan Tito with a smile in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito recognized her at a glance and respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>"It's Princess Saliman!"</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman walked up to him, her words full of regret: "Stan Tito, you've actually become a craftsman here."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito nodded. "Because I was originally a craftsman."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman shook her head. "No, you are the descendant of Saint Tito, the chosen lucky son."</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't be wasting your life here. You were born with a different mission that sets you apart from others."</p><p></p><p>The noble princess reached out her hand to Stan Tito. "Come with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Lucky son, we need your help."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked at her quietly, his gaze unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"Help you with what, help you fight against Heneil? I don't care at all about your war with Heneil, nor do I care who will become the king of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Saliman, seeing Stan Tito leaving, called out anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"We just want to protect our own country! What's wrong with that?"</p><p></p><p>"This war has been going on for too long, too many people have died."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito laughed without looking back. "If you don't want to fight anymore, if you don't want more people to die..."</p><p></p><p>"You can surrender now, and this war will end immediately."</p><p></p><p>Saliman caught up to him. "I hope you can help us open the door to the divine realm and pray to the great Hinsai god."</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you don't want to end this war, don't you want to be the second saint after your ancestor to witness the divine?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito finally stopped, and something in Saliman's words touched him.</p><p></p><p>He turned around and looked seriously at Princess Saliman.</p><p></p><p>He asked her, "Opening the door to the divine realm requires you to sacrifice some of your most precious things. Are you sure your king will agree?"</p><p></p><p>Saliman immediately agreed. "Of course! Our loyalty to the divine has never been in doubt."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito let out a light laugh. "What if the price is to give up the Ruhel Colossus?"</p><p></p><p>Saliman's expression faltered, and hesitation appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>But she still said, "The king will make the right choice."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Stan Tito was tempted.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he might be able to get the princess and King Samo to give up the power of the Ruhel Colossus, and thus receive the blessings of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning destruction, welcoming the light -</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito sat silently all night, pondering it over.</p><p></p><p>He felt that this trip might not be as easy to return from. In the war between the Heneil dynasty and the Samo family, he could be a neutral party, but once he got involved, he would no longer be able to turn back.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of his reasons and intentions.</p><p></p><p>What awaits him is either a slim hope of success, or death, or an even more tragic ending.</p><p></p><p>But he still felt he should go, because he thought this might be the last hope.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is the last hope for the three-leaf people to gain light and a future.</p><p></p><p>Heneil believes that becoming the king can create a new era, but Stan Tito does not think so.</p><p></p><p>Generation after generation of kings and heroes have failed to change the status quo.</p><p></p><p>Even if Heneil becomes the king of Hinsai, he cannot work miracles - he is just one of those kings.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is possible to approach Yesaer, but it is impossible to become Laideli.</p><p></p><p>He thought the same as his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Only the creative power of dreams can give the Sanye people a future.</p><p></p><p>He quietly watched the sun rise and stood up.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he made the decision to set out.</p><p></p><p>But before setting out, he was still waiting for someone, having arranged everything else.</p><p></p><p>On the coast, a figure came walking through the waves towards the rising sun, and it was the slave who often came to steal the craftsman's skills.</p><p></p><p>He leaned forward, panting in front of Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>"You suddenly came to find me, is there something you need?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito told him, "I'm going to a very distant place, and I may not be able to come back for a long time, or I may not come back at all."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>"I have some things I need to entrust to you."</p><p></p><p>The young slave was immediately stunned, looking at Stan Tito with reluctance: "Can't you not go, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito patted the young slave's shoulder: "No, because it's a very important matter."</p><p></p><p>The young slave nodded and said, "Oh!"</p><p></p><p>Since it was a very important matter, there was no other way.</p><p></p><p>"If it's the Master's matter, I'll definitely take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito asked him, "Do you have a name?"</p><p></p><p>The slave shook his head: "I don't have a name, my master calls me Black Worm."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito thought for a moment: "Then I'll give you a name, hmm~"</p><p></p><p>"How about Sander?"</p><p></p><p>The slave was stunned: "Sander?"</p><p></p><p>"What does it mean?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked down at his eyes: "Messenger."</p><p></p><p>"That is, the one who inherits faith and thought."</p><p></p><p>The young slave still looked puzzled, but Stan Tito had already placed his hand on his forehead, and a powerful force filled his mind, igniting the eternal light in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Bestow the power."</p><p></p><p>The young slave saw a beam of light constantly spreading, dyeing everything into a blazing white.</p><p></p><p>He felt that something deep in his mind seemed to have been opened, and a brand new world had opened its doors to him.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The young slave still didn't understand what had happened, but he knew that he had obtained something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He heard Stan Tito's words ringing in his ears, deeply imprinted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Sander!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Stan Tito, the heir to the will of the Saint Tito family."</p><p></p><p>"Although you are not a member of the Tito family, the will of the Saint Tito has never depended on bloodline inheritance. I hope you can inherit the will and ideals of the Saint."</p><p></p><p>"Saint Tito hopes to bring the dream power of the fairies to the human world, and I hope our civilization can enter the next era."</p><p></p><p>"This time I'm leaving to find the future of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>"Whether I succeed or fail."</p><p></p><p>"I look forward to you still being able to pass on the beautiful wishes of Saint Tito and my dreams."</p><p></p><p>"This is the origin of your name."</p><p></p><p>"And my good blessings and wishes for you."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito only gave the young slave a trace of bloodline, just enough for him to open his telepathic ability and power of consciousness communication, but he could not become a high-level priest.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still needed to leave some power to do the following things.</p><p></p><p>But for the young slave, this was already unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>He had leaped from an ordinary slave to an existence that had inherited the blood of the Laideli myth.</p><p></p><p>After activating the other's power, Stan Tito took him to the secret room in the room, the room that had never been allowed to enter by others.</p><p></p><p>In the room, a Sun Cup was being cultivated one after another.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito brought Sander to the one in the center, picked up the flowerpot and placed it in front of Sander: "This is the Sun Cup left by the great poet who witnessed the divine, who is called the Saint Tito by the world. It contains all his memories, a huge library."</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>"I also left something in it, if you're interested, you can find it."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Stan Tito even laughed, but he didn't explicitly state what he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>The slave named Sander held the Sun Cup, unable to believe the relic of the Saint Tito.</p><p></p><p>Can such a thing really be entrusted to a slave like him?</p><p></p><p>He was dazed, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Until Stan Tito stepped out of the door, he suddenly chased after him and shouted at him.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm a lowly slave, after all."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito waved goodbye with his back turned, a smile appearing on his face: "Oh? Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>"That's perfect."</p>

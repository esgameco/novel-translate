        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The poet sailed swiftly across the sea surface on a sailboat, feeling as if he was racing alongside the waves and surging with the tides. His hands touched the sailboat, and for the first time he learned about this metallic creation from the dream fairy.</p><p></p><p>Hard, smooth, and flexible.</p><p></p><p>The poet had once seen a type of stone on his travels that also faintly emitted this luster, but he didn't know if there was any connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>He caressed the white sail, an ethereal and delicate creation that the poet could scarcely imagine.</p><p></p><p>These materials could be used to make even more things, and the poet's mind immediately conceived of several potential applications for them.</p><p></p><p>"If the people of Xinghai also possessed these, wouldn't they be able to usher in a new era?"</p><p></p><p>The poet sighed as he thought about this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only the power of the divine can create such wondrous objects."</p><p></p><p>"The dream fairies truly possess fantastical powers."</p><p></p><p>The sea passage that would have normally taken many days, the poet traversed in just two.</p><p></p><p>When he passed through the Maelstrom and arrived at the ancient Yesaer City's waters, he once again encountered the Maelstrom people, the patrolling soldiers.</p><p></p><p>This time, Tito did not hide or evade them. Instead, he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see the king of the Maelstrom Kingdom again, as he had something he wished to convey.</p><p></p><p>A group of Maelstrom people armed with weapons surged from the seabed, circling Tito's sailboat. Leading them was a peculiar shrimp knight.</p><p></p><p>They eyed the sailboat with uncertainty, unsure of what this object that could traverse the surface of the sea was.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the shrimp knight recognized Tito - the blind poet who had accompanied the previous king of the Maelstrom Kingdom through Yesaer City.</p><p></p><p>Tito said to the shrimp knight, "I wish to see your king."</p><p></p><p>He had also gained the power of wisdom and could communicate directly with these Maelstrom people through mental consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Due to Tito's relationship with the former king, the shrimp knight did not dare to obstruct him and immediately relayed the message to the royal capital.</p><p></p><p>The poet waited at the bow of the sailboat, and soon a veritable army of Maelstrom people emerged from the seabed, surrounding him and the sailboat.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Maelstrom king, wearing a crown, appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"It's you! The Xinghai man who lost his eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>The Maelstrom king asked the poet, also glancing into the sailboat, searching for the shadow of another person.</p><p></p><p>Tito knew he was asking about the old man in the stone helmet and said, "He and I went to seek the land bestowed by the gods, and we embarked on a journey to the divine paradise together."</p><p></p><p>"He sustained some injuries, and upon reaching the threshold of the divine palace, he passed away there."</p><p></p><p>"We were fortunate, though not without regret."</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Maelstrom king's face instantly changed - first shock, then uncertainty. Finally, a hint of sorrow welled up.</p><p></p><p>"He... is dead?"</p><p></p><p>He had feared the other's return, but upon hearing of his demise, an indescribable grief overwhelmed him, as if a great void had opened in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The blind poet nodded, "Yes, dead."</p><p></p><p>"He died in the land bestowed by the gods, returning to the garden of the divine."</p><p></p><p>The Maelstrom king asked, "What did he say before he died?"</p><p></p><p>The poet replied, "He said he had found the answer."</p><p></p><p>The poet fell into reminiscence, once again recalling the eyes of that man.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elderly man with the serene expression on his stone-carved face.</p><p></p><p>"He has never said what the answer he is searching for is, but I can probably understand some of it," </p><p></p><p>He presented the King of the Abyss with a set of his own seal-carved "Ode to the King of Wisdom", and then said to him.</p><p></p><p>"You originated from the era blessed by the gods, Ensand and Boon, the children of King Laidelic."</p><p></p><p>"Just as your father said."</p><p></p><p>"You too once had the love of the gods and King Laidelic, and lived under the halls of the divine spirits."</p><p></p><p>Tito paused for a moment, and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"You."</p><p></p><p>"Are not monsters, but people."</p><p></p><p>The King of the Abyss Kingdom held the stone tablet, silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he waved his hand to have all the people of the Abyss Kingdom clear a path.</p><p></p><p>"Let him leave."</p><p></p><p>Tito raised the sail and steered the boat away.</p><p></p><p>When passing through the domain of the Abyss Kingdom again, no one dared to obstruct Tito's small boat anymore.</p><p></p><p>He passed by the island of the dead again, and even saw the cruel Lord Sala from afar.</p><p></p><p>The other party led his subordinate soldiers to look from a distance, but dared not approach or offend.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other from a distance, and Tito's spiritual power swept across, seeing the shocked expression on Lord Sala's face.</p><p></p><p>This lord of the Abyss Kingdom, he never thought that the naive and stubborn poet had really reached the halls of the divine spirits, and worshipped the common gods of the Hinsai people and the people of the Abyss Kingdom--</p><p></p><p>Outside the City of the Descended Gods, the people of the fishing village saw a strange thing breaking through the waves from afar, and the entire fishing village was in a panic, thinking it was some kind of monster crawling out of the seabed.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before someone rushed into the City of the Descended Gods.</p><p></p><p>"He's back!"</p><p></p><p>"He's back."</p><p></p><p>"The poet has returned from the land blessed by the gods, and he has also brought back the treasures bestowed upon him by the divine messenger."</p><p></p><p>The City of the Descended Gods was completely in an uproar, countless people came out of their houses and gathered on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Including the former city lord, upon receiving the news, he also led people to leave the City of the Descended Gods and come to the coast.</p><p></p><p>Poet Tito had just moored the boat on the coast, and the residents and nobles of the three-layer, six-layer City of the Descended Gods surrounded him, each one looking at him in disbelief, doubting the reality of his great accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>The city lord hurriedly walked over, greatly excited, and came in front of the poet, putting his hand on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>"Did you really find it?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, he saw the blinded eyes of the poet.</p><p></p><p>The city lord was immediately stunned, the excited words abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Then, there was a hint of sorrow in his words.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have experienced a lot."</p><p></p><p>Tito didn't mind: "It is precisely because of these experiences that I was able to reach the halls of the divine spirits."</p><p></p><p>"And it was they who gave me the courage and motivation to find the land blessed by the gods, and also complete the 'Ode to the King of Wisdom'."</p><p></p><p>Tito turned around and boarded the sailboat.</p><p></p><p>"This is a treasure bestowed upon me by the divine spirits, a precious gem that can ride the raging winds and cross the vast seas."</p><p></p><p>"It was relying on it that I was able to cross the deep sea abyss, and pass through the Abyss Kingdom to return."</p><p></p><p>He took out the stone tablet carved with the words of King Laidelic and held it high in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" The other people didn't know what it was, but the city lord, who was from the royal lineage, guessed what it was as soon as he saw the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The poet nodded, and said to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The stone tablet carved by King Laidelic's own hand, hidden beneath the Palace of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>At this point, no one doubted anymore that Tito had ever reached the land blessed by the gods.</p>

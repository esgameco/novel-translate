        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two figures swam across the vast sea, passing through the cursed abyss of the deep sea that all Trilobites dread. </p><p></p><p>Even the denizens of the abyss do not wish to approach this place, fearing being banished to the eternal realm of darkness once more by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, one can see a bottomless trench leading to the deepest part of the seabed, a dark world like a gaping maw ready to swallow everything. The sensation of passing over it is like escaping the jaws of the most terrifying monster.</p><p></p><p>Tito surfaced, relying on the power of the Divine Cup to survey his surroundings. </p><p></p><p>Though his eyes could not see, the light guiding the way to the Promised Land of the gods still pointed him in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>"It's over there."</p><p>"We must go that way."</p><p></p><p>The Old Man with the Stone Helm caught up from behind, his pace much slower than before, appearing rather sluggish.</p><p></p><p>Tito could even hear his irregular panting, which made him sound utterly weak.</p><p></p><p>The poet felt something was amiss: "You're injured."</p><p></p><p>Cracks had appeared on the carapace covering the old man's chest, indicating he had indeed sustained some wounds, though the severity was not apparent from the outside.</p><p></p><p>The old man himself didn't seem too concerned: "I'm just getting old, not as capable as I once was."</p><p></p><p>"Even a few impacts are too much for this body to bear now, it's as fragile as sand and stone."</p><p></p><p>The carapace of the Abyss Dwellers grows more brittle with age, the opposite of the Trilobites whose bone armor becomes harder and more stone-like over time.</p><p></p><p>Tito asked worriedly, "How serious is it?"</p><p></p><p>He had never before imagined he would care so much about the wellbeing of an Abyss Dweller, let alone become friends with a king of an Abyss kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Old Man with the Stone Helm paused to catch his breath: "Not too serious, let's keep going."</p><p></p><p>They submerged back into the azure sea and the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>The two followed the guidance of the Divine Cup, traveling through the vast, featureless ocean. </p><p></p><p>No islands, no settlements of the Hinsai, not even any ruins could be seen.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea where they were, how far they had come from the deep sea abyss.</p><p></p><p>They could only be certain their direction was correct, but where the Promised Land lay, and how long it would take or if they could even reach it, remained unknown to them.</p><p></p><p>The Old Man had grown too weak to continue, his injuries more severe than he had let on.</p><p></p><p>As he swam, he began to sink downwards towards the seabed.</p><p></p><p>Tito suddenly grabbed the old man, lifting and supporting him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll carry you."</p><p></p><p>The old man was silent for a moment, then uttered two words:</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The two supported each other as they pressed on, Tito the old man's crutch, and the old man Tito's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Dusk fell, and they slowly swam through the golden sea. </p><p></p><p>The sun's dying rays penetrating the water's surface also brought warmth and hope to the two.</p><p></p><p>On the golden horizon, a shadow suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>At first they didn't notice, but as they drew closer, the shape grew larger.</p><p></p><p>The Old Man with the Stone Helm finally made out what it was.</p><p></p><p>An island.</p><p></p><p>He stopped Tito, his pupils dilating.</p><p></p><p>What kind of island was this, shimmering with a brilliant radiance under the sun's embrace?</p><p></p><p>From afar, it seemed to gleam like pure gold.</p><p></p><p>Sacred, holy.</p><p>Possessing the eternal splendor of gold.</p><p></p><p>"It has appeared?"</p><p>"It has truly appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Tito was initially stunned, then quickly realized what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Is it really?"</p><p>"Right... in front of us?"</p><p></p><p>The poet's voice trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Setting out from the Sky Temple, he had traveled an unknown distance, overcome countless difficulties. Was this finally the destination?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>More excited than the poet, he looked at the island and kept talking.</p><p></p><p>"The land blessed by the gods, there really is a land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"So the gods do exist!"</p><p></p><p>"It's true... they exist!"</p><p></p><p>The two quickened their pace and headed towards the land blessed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>The seawater became shallower and shallower, and the two gradually walked out of the water, stepping onto the domain of the gods.</p><p></p><p>Tito couldn't wait to ask, "Quickly, tell me."</p><p></p><p>"What is the land blessed by the gods like? Is it as beautiful as the legends say?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet lifted his head from Tito's shoulder, finally seeing clearly what the golden color was.</p><p></p><p>It was an endless sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen such a magnificent sight before, and he suddenly felt a surge of power within him, breaking free from the poet and moving forward.</p><p></p><p>The sea of flowers parted, opening a path.</p><p></p><p>They were welcoming the arrival of the poet and the old man.</p><p></p><p>"The sea of flowers of the Sun's Cup, just as you said, there is an endless sea of flowers here."</p><p></p><p>Tito also excitedly responded, "The records of the Sky God Temple are true, the Priest Schl√∂der really did see the land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet looked up.</p><p></p><p>Gazing towards the center of the endless sea of flowers, he finally saw the pyramid temple in the middle of the flowers.</p><p></p><p>A huge dream bubble enveloped the majestic pyramid, with countless colorful illusions flowing over it.</p><p></p><p>He used the power of his wisdom to project his voice, shouting with all his might.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was telling Tito everything he saw, but more like expressing the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The temple."</p><p></p><p>"The pyramid, and the temple of the God Inset."</p><p></p><p>"The gods are still here, the divine spirits still stand tall in this place."</p><p></p><p>Tito also groped his way forward, smelling the fragrance of flowers.</p><p></p><p>A powerful force emanated from his consciousness, exploring the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He felt the scene around him.</p><p></p><p>It was a feeling, not a sight.</p><p></p><p>The ground, the sea of flowers, the stele, the ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the images were directly projected into his consciousness, presented directly in his brain.</p><p></p><p>"The land blessed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"I see it."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly... so beautiful."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet turned to look at Tito and noticed the changes in him.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline of King Lederiki is boiling in you."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, poet, you have awakened the power of wisdom."</p><p></p><p>The two walked along the path opened by the sea of flowers, and they saw the city blessed by the gods, and the stele standing in front of it.</p><p></p><p>The poet hurried forward, his spiritual power sweeping over the stele, immediately seeing what was carved on it.</p><p></p><p>"Look quickly."</p><p></p><p>"This is the stele erected by your ancestors, Prince Ens and Prince Bun of King Lederiki."</p><p></p><p>"It also records their story, the story of how they established the cities of Ens and Bun."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet approached the stele, touching the patterns on it with his own hands.</p><p></p><p>He knelt down, cupping his hands in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Worshiping his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>After Tito finished reading, he walked away from the stele.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to enter the city blessed by the gods, to see the great Inset.</p><p></p><p>However, the old man in the stone helmet stopped in his tracks, remaining kneeling in front of the stele, unable to move forward anymore.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he dared not go any further.</p><p></p><p>Tito turned back and called out to the old man.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you coming up?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you want to come here to find the answers?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet raised his head, and a smile suddenly blossomed on his face, which Tito had never imagined a Mire person's smile could be so serene and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>"I've already... found the answer."</p><p></p><p>After saying these words, the old man in the stone helmet remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>"Hey!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey!"</p><p></p><p>Tito called out to the old man, but there was no response.</p><p></p><p>The nameless king had died.</p><p></p><p>The wind stirred up the waves of the sea of flowers, and the Sun's Cup that had opened the path retracted one by one, burying him in it, never to be seen again.</p><p></p><p>The poet stood there, dazed.</p>

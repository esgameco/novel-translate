        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Carried by the wind and waves, a golden figure emerged from the distant horizon, passing through the sea surface. </p><p></p><p>He floated past the reefs, brushing over the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>Landing on a rooftop of the city of Shenjiang.</p><p></p><p>In the early morning, the city of Shenjiang was like someone just waking up.</p><p></p><p>People poured out of their homes onto the streets, the city gates opened with some entering and others leaving, the crowd growing larger and noisier.</p><p></p><p>The marketplace gathered customers wanting to buy goods and merchants wanting to sell, along with various fresh items that caught Boluo's attention.</p><p></p><p>"La la la!"</p><p></p><p>Like a golden butterfly, he flitted through the streets and crowds, but no one on the streets could see him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted others to see him, only then could they see him.</p><p></p><p>He was a peculiar being that could walk between dreams and illusions.</p><p></p><p>In the marketplace of the city of Shenjiang, the subjects and merchants of the Xinyanse Kingdom used a special stone currency carved with a wise crown and scepter for transactions.</p><p></p><p>The marketplace sold dried fish, whelks, dried seaweed and various other foods, exquisitely crafted bone and stone tools, rare treasures found in the sea, and some strange and odd things.</p><p></p><p>Boluo stopped in front of a group of thin and dirty Trifolians imprisoned in stone cages, curiously observing them.</p><p></p><p>These Trifolians were confined in short, small cages, unable to stretch their bodies or spread their arms, clearly in great discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"What crimes did they commit?"  </p><p></p><p>"Why are they caged?"</p><p></p><p>The slave owner, facing away from Boluo and twisting some seaweed plant into ropes, answered: "They are slaves."</p><p></p><p>"Their ancestors once committed the unforgivable sin of blaspheming the gods and offending the Wise King, so King Yeser punished them to be slaves."</p><p></p><p>"How about it? Want to buy some to take back? The children born to these slaves are also slaves. Buy some healthy slaves to take back, and your family will have slaves to command for generations."</p><p></p><p>Boluo looked at those Trifolians with dull, lifeless eyes and tutted.</p><p></p><p>"You Trifolians are really dreadful, enslaving your own kind like mindless shrimp and primordial fish, forcing their descendants to never be liberated."</p><p></p><p>The slave owner turned around, amused. </p><p></p><p>"Us Trifolians?"</p><p></p><p>"You speak as if you're not a Trifolian yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, there was clearly someone talking to him from behind, yet he saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>Boluo went wherever he pleased, with no destination or purpose.  </p><p></p><p>He was interested in everything in this world. Even a few Trifolian children playing and laughing by the roadside could entertain him for half a day.</p><p></p><p>He saw a group of Trifolians...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>People lined up in orderly queues leaving the city. These elderly Sanye people knelt in front of the city wall, facing the direction of the sea and calling out. Their intonation was weathered and heavy. Their expressions were devout, which gave their calls a sacred quality. </p><p></p><p>More Sanye people gathered inside the city to watch. Some had their hands clasped in front of their chests, eyes closed, chanting the same words as those Sanye people.</p><p></p><p>"The elders have made an appointment to go on a pilgrimage to the Sky Temple again."</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad to be buried at the foot of the Sky Temple, since they cannot be buried in the God-gifted land."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Prince Ali dislikes the high priest of the Sky Temple? They've recently had direct conflicts."</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't know that King Yeser was cursed by God and lost the Crown of Wisdom in the Demon Abyss because of High Priest Schloed devouring the God-gifted objects. How could Prince Ali not have objections to the Sky Temple?"</p><p></p><p>The voices grew softer, as if afraid of being overheard by others.</p><p></p><p>After Yeser passed away, his father succeeded to the throne. Losing the Crown of Wisdom fundamentally weakened the royal power, and Ali's father was old and unable to support the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Ali controlled the military and the three fused monsters left by King Yeser, becoming the most powerful person in the kingdom, practically the one in control.</p><p></p><p>Polo didn't care much about those power struggles. He only heard that these people were going to the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>And that was where he was born - his homeland.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what his beautiful homeland, the God's Chalice Flower Garden, had become.</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>Inside the towering palace-like structure fit for giants, a group of God's priests knelt before the statue of the God Yin.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a female Sanye person, guiding the group in prayer beneath the statue.</p><p></p><p>Their hands clasped together in front of their chests, eyes tightly closed in utmost piety.</p><p></p><p>Her pale bone armor had silver speckles like starlight, very rare and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>After the prayer ended, everyone faced the statue and slowly exited the temple.  </p><p></p><p>Outside, their expressions were no longer so solemn.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were just a group of youngsters. They crowded under the colonnades, chatting and even chasing and playing with each other.</p><p></p><p>One female Sanye person carefully approached the only one not playing and asked her seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Xing."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think God really exists?"</p><p></p><p>As the only high-level priestess among them, Xing of course answered with an unquestionable tone:</p><p></p><p>"Of course God exists."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, where did we come from, and where did our powers come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Our wisdom and abilities, our food, our writing and language."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's all a gift from the divine grace."</p><p></p><p>The other person hesitated, as if wanting to ask something more. </p><p></p><p>Xing had already seen through her thoughts and said directly, "We cannot see the divine because we have not witnessed its glory."</p><p></p><p>"How can those with original sin appear before the divine beings?"</p><p></p><p>"But!" </p><p></p><p>Xing imitated his father and ancestors, turning his head solemnly to recite the words of the divine passed down generation after generation.</p><p></p><p>"Whether mortals believe in the divine or not! Whether mortals can see the divine or not."</p><p></p><p>"The divine!"</p><p></p><p>"Is right there."</p><p></p><p>Xing's father was the current high priest of the Temple of the Sky, the priest who had warned the former high priest Shuluo about potential issues with the rituals of the Divine Cup back then.</p><p></p><p>Her ancestor was Xirong, the fourth son of Rederic, which also means "Starlight."</p><p></p><p>Her father named her Xing, which showed his adoration for her.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xing is a priestess serving the God of Racing, but as the heir of the Xirong family, she is destined to succeed her father as the high priestess of the Temple of the Sky.  </p><p></p><p>As a price to pay,</p><p></p><p>she can never leave the Temple of the Sky, nor can she ever descend from this city of divine servants and leave the sacred mountain.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the stone steps from the heights, she arrived at the garden of the Divine Cup below, where she resides next door.</p><p></p><p>She knelt down outside the garden of the Divine Cup and closed her eyes to perform a divine ritual.</p><p></p><p>"Projection!"</p><p></p><p>This was a divine ritual she had explored, allowing her to form a contract with other lives through her divine bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It borrowed from the power bestowed by the divine right as well as the illusory power of the Divine Cup.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still imperfect with many unresolved issues.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Shuluo's approach of fusing with the Sun Cup to advance on the path of the power of wisdom, Xing believed the power of wisdom and consciousness did not lie in external forces, but in one's own wisdom and the strength of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she dared not tell her father, as he had forbidden her from exploring the power of the Sun Cup - </p><p></p><p>a forbidden and cursed power.</p><p></p><p>Although unable to leave the Temple of the Sky and the sacred mountain, she hoped to use this power to see the outside world through the eyes of other lives.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xing's consciousness projected onto an ancient fish at the foot of the mountain, using its eyes to tour the sacred lake,</p><p></p><p>a figure suddenly emerged from the Sun Cup flower garden next to her.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!"</p><p></p><p>"What an amazing divine ritual, how did you come up with it?"</p><p></p><p>Polo was sprawled across the flower cups in the garden, hugging the largest one, his face almost touching hers.</p><p></p><p>Xing turned her head, mouth agape, never expecting someone to be hiding in the garden of the Divine Cup.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p></p><p>A new story.</p><p></p><p>Began.</p>

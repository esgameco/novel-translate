        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed, the poet began writing his poems in a well-preserved guard's residence within the Palace of Wisdom. </p><p></p><p>Tito used the stone door as a desk, and moved the broken columns into the house to use as stools.</p><p></p><p>Outside the window, the sea of sunflowers gently swayed in the night, with the blue sky and the vast sea at the horizon.</p><p></p><p>When the night wind blew, he couldn't help but look outside, drawn by the fragrance of the flowers.</p><p></p><p>He stood by the window, leaning forward, letting the flower scent brush across his face.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined I would truly be in the land bestowed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"I have walked the pilgrimage path that King Lederiki and King Yesser once trod, and seen the God of Creation."</p><p></p><p>"It feels like a dream."</p><p></p><p>He rummaged through his basket, finding his writing tablets insufficient. He used a knife to erase some unimportant content, and re-carved new words.</p><p></p><p>Sitting by the window, he began to recall and ponder over all that he had witnessed on his journey.</p><p></p><p>He remembered passing through the ruins of the Hinsai Kingdom, exploring the underwater villages along the way, all of which had once been glorious, and had become the emotions and strength for him to compose his great poems.</p><p></p><p>The tribulations in the land of Sala had baptized him, making him understand the meaning of his life.</p><p></p><p>The inscriptions on the stone stele in Yesser City had become the foundation for him to write the mythology.</p><p></p><p>And the awe and excitement of finally arriving at the land bestowed by the gods - everything here made him feel as if he was floating in a dream.</p><p></p><p>An immense passion erupted within him, as the poet felt a myriad of emotions waiting to be expressed.</p><p></p><p>Day after day.</p><p></p><p>On this night, under the vast starry sky, he carved the final piece on his writing tablet.</p><p></p><p>"The Ode to Lederiki" - The Epilogue</p><p></p><p>[The first Wise King, due to the betrayal of his son and the death of his queen, ended his glorious life before the gods.]</p><p></p><p>[He passed the throne to his most outstanding son, Yesser, along with his covenant and promise to the gods.]</p><p></p><p>[But the divine spirits, angered by Lederiki's death, were disappointed by the three-leaf people's patricide and fratricide.]</p><p></p><p>Stroke after stroke, he recorded everything that had happened in his poems, which would also be inscribed on the historical pillars of Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>[The gods withdrew their promised land, and all the three-leaf people were driven out of the land bestowed by the gods.]</p><p></p><p>[The divine spirits erased their memories of the location and existence of the land bestowed by the gods, so that they could never return to that divine paradise.]</p><p></p><p>[Even if they reached beyond the land bestowed by the gods, they could only wander eternally on the vast sea, unable to set foot on this divine island.]</p><p></p><p>Tito thought for a moment, and added a final sentence:</p><p></p><p>[The gods withdrew their blessings, but also loosened the fate of the three-leaf people.]</p><p></p><p>[The end of the age of the gods signifies the dawn of a new era of civilization.]</p><p></p><p>Tito put down his carving knife.</p><p></p><p>He had finally completed his mythology, reclaiming the lost memories and glory of the three-leaf people, which would henceforth become the eternal poem and glory sung by all of them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone would know the story of what had happened, know where they came from and why they existed.</p><p></p><p>This is the power of the written word, the immortal charm created by King Lederiki's invention of writing.</p><p></p><p>"I have succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"I have succeeded."</p><p></p><p>He repeated these words over and over, as if murmuring the words of a dream.</p><p></p><p>He parted the sunflowers and wandered through the land bestowed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the ruins, he finally came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he realized he had arrived at the base of the pyramid, and he paid his respects to the pyramid temple.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>One morning, the poet Tito set out with his backpack.</p><p></p><p>In the backpack, not only were the original manuscript of his "Ode to the King of Wisdom" and two sets of stone tablet copies he had made, but also the precious Raideli King's tablet he had found in the collapsed Wisdom King's palace.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a fragment, it was a priceless treasure for the Xinsai people.</p><p></p><p>A few not-yet-adult dream fairies floated out from the flower sea, escorting the second-level dream demon Hila.</p><p></p><p>Tito recognized this beautiful being - she was the one who roamed the dreamscape at the right hand of the deity, and the vast dream bubble of the divine hall extended out from her.</p><p></p><p>"Tito has met the divine messenger."</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, all dream demons were messengers of the gods, but the one standing before him was clearly different.</p><p></p><p>She was powerful, beautiful.</p><p></p><p>She possessed miraculous powers bestowed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>Hila carefully examined Tito, then asked him:</p><p></p><p>"Your soul is very pure."</p><p></p><p>"Even purer than the dream demons' souls, why is that?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy was curious.</p><p></p><p>She was different from Bolo, the two sides of stillness and motion, but they both had innocent eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had heard the stories of the Trifoliate people, and did not understand how these beings born with strong desires, greed, and killing could have souls comparable to the dream demons.</p><p></p><p>Tito said to her: "Because the human heart is changeable, it can be tarnished by sin, and it can also be transformed through tempering."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy pondered this, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand, and a luminous object appeared on the surface of the sea.</p><p></p><p>This was Hila the dream demon's gift to Tito - a ship made of metal, with a tall white sail billowing in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Tito had never seen such a thing before: "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>She told Tito: "This is called a sailboat, a type of ship."</p><p></p><p>"It can harness the power of the wind to sail across the sea."</p><p></p><p>"This way you can easily cross the vast ocean and return to the shores of your homeland."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the dream demon's explanation, Tito immediately understood the significance of this object.</p><p></p><p>Although the Trifoliate people were adept at roaming the seas, crossing the vast ocean required immense physical exertion, needing to stop frequently. But the sailboat could save him time and energy.</p><p></p><p>It was like how humans can walk, but also need vehicles.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, divine messenger, for this gift."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy taught him how to operate the sailboat, and then Tito set sail.</p><p></p><p>The lone figure in the boat, with the white sail billowing, gradually disappeared over the horizon of the divine land.</p><p></p><p>The dream demon Hila, carrying the poet's gift of the poem stone tablet, returned to the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"He has left."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy knelt before the deity, presenting a stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Carved upon it was the "Ode to the King of Wisdom".</p><p></p><p>Hila asked the deity: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"Is the story truly like this?"</p><p></p><p>The deity did not respond directly, but said:</p><p></p><p>"The same stone, when viewed from different angles by different people, appears different."</p><p></p><p>"Some see it as round, some see it as square, and some see it as triangular."</p><p></p><p>"This is just..."</p>

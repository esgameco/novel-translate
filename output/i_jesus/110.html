            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito had another dream, in which he was still in a grand palace, working on his own sculpture in a corner. 💲🐼➅❾𝓼ℍυ𝔁.𝔠𝐎𝓜🍬🎃</p><p></p><p>This was the manifestation of his will and spirit. He liked to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the world and do his own thing in peace.</p><p></p><p>This was his haven of tranquility, his spiritual homeland.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past, his dreams now not only contained the chapters of the ancients, but also many of his own works.</p><p></p><p>He held the tools in his hand, standing in front of the "Puppet of Fate".</p><p></p><p>The craftsman looked up at his unfinished work.</p><p></p><p>"A dream!"</p><p></p><p>"The fairy of dreams?"</p><p></p><p>"Witnessing the scene of the great poet's audience with the divine."</p><p></p><p>In his hazy state, Stan Tito suddenly had a flash of insight, and he finally remembered the one he had seen before, even knowing the sacred name recorded in "The Final Chapter".</p><p></p><p>"Hira?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he called out, the entire dream scene changed.</p><p></p><p>With the transmission of the voice, it spread out in layers of golden halos, and a illusory dream door opened above.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito turned his head to look outside.</p><p></p><p>A dream fairy surrounded by dreamlike starlight, a beautiful and fantastical life form descended into his dream.</p><p></p><p>She wore a shimmering golden robe, adorned with the dreams of the sun, stars, and deities, her golden hair flowing in the air.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she floated down in front of Stan Tito like falling flower petals.</p><p></p><p>"Puppet named Stan."</p><p></p><p>"Were you looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito looked at her blankly.</p><p></p><p>He had guessed, but never imagined that all this was real.</p><p></p><p>Long, long ago, he had been noticed by the messenger of the divine.</p><p></p><p>That was an existence on par with the Mother of Life, Sali, standing by the side of the divine. 👻♕➅❾𝓼ħⓤ𝕏.ᑕⓄｍ👺♥</p><p></p><p>"It is truly you, the messenger of the divine, the dream fairy who wields the power of creation."</p><p></p><p>"The divine messenger Hira, standing at the right hand of the divine."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy smiled: "The divine is great, I am but a fairy bathed in the light of the divine."</p><p></p><p>After a long pause, Stan Tito finally reacted to the fairy's previous address to him.</p><p></p><p>He laughed self-deprecatingly as he explained.</p><p></p><p>"Honorable and sacred divine messenger, I am not a puppet."</p><p></p><p>"Although my name is Slate, I am not just a replica of the works of the ancients, but also a slate that can create my own works."</p><p></p><p>"I can flow with the current and follow the river of fate, but I can also rise above the water according to my own will."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy asked him: "Have you already mastered your own fate?"</p><p></p><p>"Or have you understood the meaning and mission of your life?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito shook his head: "I have not yet fully grasped the realm of the great poet, but I have already figured out many things."</p><p></p><p>The fairy examined him carefully: "You are indeed different, you have changed."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hira smiled and said, "Is this what Tito calls the transformation of the human heart through tempering?"</p><p></p><p>"Then!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you call me?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy asked Tito.</p><p></p><p>Although a bit hurried, Stan Tito had many questions that had long been on his mind.</p><p></p><p>What he most wanted to know was what the secret left behind by the great poet Tito was, and whether the divine really wanted to bestow the power to create everything upon the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>"Divine messenger!"</p><p></p><p>"Can we obtain the grace of the divine by opening the gates of the divine kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy told him: "There is no key to open the gates of the divine kingdom, and the so-called 'The Final Chapter' only records the story of Tito's life."</p><p></p><p>"Whether the divine will bestow the power of creation also depends on how you choose."💚♢❻❾𝐒ᕼ𝐔𝔁.𝐂𝕆ｍ😲💞</p><p></p><p>"Only when the Trifoliate people renounce the power of destruction will the gates of the divine kingdom open."</p><p></p><p>"Hope and light will descend upon the human world, and the power of dreams and creation will usher in a new era."</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger disappeared from his dream, and Stan Tito also opened his eyes and woke up.</p><p></p><p>He sat up and looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>The moon is eternal, the waves never cease.</p><p></p><p>"Only by renouncing destruction can we create light." ——</p><p></p><p>At the seaside cottage.</p><p></p><p>The messenger of King Heniel finally arrived and met Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>But Stan Tito was now completely different from a few years ago. He had now inherited the power and legacy of the great poet, and in the kingdom of the Trifoliate people, there were few who could be more powerful than him, except for the king who wielded the power of the giant monster.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Externally and internally, he had become more mature, more steady, and more self-assured.</p><p></p><p>He had once been hailed as the "Lucky Son" in the City of the Divine Servants, but that had left him feeling ethereal and weightless, floating in midair.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had lost that former status, yet people felt he had gained even more.</p><p></p><p>He sat quietly by the seaside, like a towering boulder standing at the edge of the vast ocean, blocking the surging waves.</p><p></p><p>As if allowing the mighty waves to crash against him, he remained unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Heniel's voice came through the messenger's shoulder-mounted message bug, reaching the mind of Stanton Tito.</p><p></p><p>"The war is about to end."</p><p></p><p>"The endless infighting, slaughter, and attrition between the royal bloodlines over the centuries is finally going to be put to a stop, and the glory of Hinsai will be restored."</p><p></p><p>"All you have to do is come back."</p><p></p><p>"You are still the Lucky Son, and I still have the position of divine servant waiting for you in the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>He had come to see this old friend, but also to flaunt and showcase his own accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito did not turn back, he was solely focused on his stone carving work.</p><p></p><p>"I know you did not kill the Queen, but you witnessed her death and did nothing."</p><p></p><p>"You have no loyalty, your heart is filled only with ambition and greed."</p><p></p><p>Heniel was unconcerned: "I've heard that kind of talk many times before, but what of ambition and greed? What of schemes and deceptions?"</p><p></p><p>"I cannot wash these things away, nor do I intend to."</p><p></p><p>"Let people say what they will, I am who I am, I am King Heniel."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can surpass other kings and achieve things never before seen, no one will care about these things."</p><p></p><p>"Come back, Stanton Tito. I am the king, you are the emissary of the gods, together we will forge a new era."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito remained immersed in his work, paying no heed to Heniel.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally paused his carving.</p><p></p><p>"Why must you choose me?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't another member of the Tito family always vying to become the heir to the will of the Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's voice suddenly changed, becoming mocking and disdainful.</p><p></p><p>"Because! They are not worthy."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito turned back: "Am I then worthy?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel nodded: "Of course, you are worthy of the title of Saint's Heir, for you are the true inheritor of the great poet's will and power."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito did not respond, but suddenly asked Heniel a seemingly unrelated question.</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to renounce the power of the Colossus?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel was taken aback, feeling this question was strangely familiar.</p><p></p><p>"This question..."</p><p></p><p>"The emissary of the gods had once asked me the same."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito turned his gaze back: "And how did you answer?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel: "I refused."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito looked at Heniel with puzzlement: "Do you know?"</p><p></p><p>"Your refusal may have forfeited the future of the Trifoliate people."</p><p></p><p>Heniel told Stanton Tito: "I cannot see the future, I only know to seize the present."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito returned his focus to his carving.</p><p></p><p>"You may be able to reunite Hinsai, you may be able to build a great legacy, becoming a king as great as the former King Yessir."</p><p></p><p>"But in you, I see no hope or light."</p><p></p><p>Heniel was even more perplexed: "Is not being comparable to King Yessir enough?"</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito let out a soft laugh: "For a king, it may be enough."</p><p></p><p>"But for the Trifoliate people, for the descendants of Lerdellick, for our civilization..."</p><p></p><p>"It is not enough! Far from enough."</p><p></p><p>Stanton Tito extended his hand, gazing out at the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>"The world is moving forward, the river of time flows endlessly."</p><p></p><p>"Why are we the only ones standing still?"</p><p></p><p>"The civilization founded by King Lerdellick, has it already become the dying embers of sunset in the time of his son, King Yessir?"</p><p></p><p>"I refuse to believe it."</p><p></p><p>"This is not what King Lerdellick wanted to see."</p><p></p><p>Heniel said no more, feeling that the Stanton Tito before him had changed completely.</p><p></p><p>He had once greatly admired Stanton Tito, thinking they could become friends, but now he felt the other was different, even seeing the shadow of the great poet in him.</p><p></p><p>That was...</p><p></p><p>The existence known as the Saint.</p><p></p><p>The divine power receded, Heniel's voice gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>"You have truly changed, no longer a mere puppet on strings, nor the Lucky Son."</p><p></p><p>"A person like you will not remain here forever as a mere craftsman."</p>

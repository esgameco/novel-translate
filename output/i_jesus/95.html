        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wilson Horsen was bound on the Island of the Dead, where the great poet Tito had once suffered. Centuries ago, this place was filled with the corpses of the Hinsai people, but after the saint Tito, it became an ancient relic.</p><p></p><p>Along the edges of the island stood stone pillars, and the once filthy and foul-smelling area had been cleaned up. In the center of the island, a plaza had been carved out and paved with stone slabs.</p><p></p><p>Upon this stood the statues of the great poet and the first King of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The great poet Tito, with a basket on his back, stood back-to-back with an elderly man wearing a stone helmet. Their gazes were resolute and devout, one bowing in prayer, the other looking up.</p><p></p><p>The rock wall behind them was carved with scenes of the promised land - an endless sea of sunflowers and pyramid temples. Above, the symbols of the Hinsai gods and the Creator towered over the sky and stars.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Kingdom of the Abyss, Tito was revered as a holy figure. His legendary deeds were known to the nobles and people, and his "Ode to the King of Wisdom" was sung throughout the land.</p><p></p><p>Wilson Horsen's hands and feet were shackled to one of the stone pillars - a restraint that would be nearly impossible to break without great strength and weapons, as the female Abyss Knight had said. Perhaps only the will of the gods could save him now.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight stood before the weakened Wilson, glaring at him with hatred.</p><p></p><p>"Wilson Horsen, Prince of the Volcanic Kingdom. Our sins were forgiven the moment the first King of the Abyss ascended to the realm of the gods. Now, under the watch of the gods and the saints, pay for your crimes!"</p><p></p><p>The Abyss people retreated back into the sea, leaving Wilson alone on the forbidden island.</p><p></p><p>Under the scorching sun, Wilson felt the heat of his armor, the moisture being slowly drained from his body. Dizziness and thirst crept into his mind. He could still feel the power within him, the wisdom and bloodline abilities, but if he tried to use them, the Sun's Cup would drain his mythic blood and consume him.</p><p></p><p>Hope and death had converged into an inescapable trap. The Abyss Knight had not driven him to utter despair, but exiled him to the desert, giving him a cup of water that was poisoned.</p><p></p><p>Wilson had finally experienced true hopelessness, true pain and torment. The most terrifying darkness was not the abyss, but the false hope.</p><p></p><p>Trembling, he reached for the shackles, hope and fear warring in his eyes as he glimpsed the dazzling Sun's Cup on his shoulder. Driven to madness, he cursed the Abyss Knight, Henir, and all who had betrayed him.</p><p></p><p>If the saint Tito had faith and ideals to sustain him in his despair, Wilson's heart had now been utterly consumed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Darkness.</p><p></p><p>His heart was empty, nothing could fill this void, nothing could stop him from falling into madness.</p><p></p><p>He could only desperately vent his inner fear and despair by shouting loudly, struggling as if he had gone insane.</p><p></p><p>He cursed Henir, cursed those who betrayed him.</p><p></p><p>He raged at those monsters.</p><p></p><p>Until he no longer had the strength to curse and rage, weakly leaning against the stone pillar.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light shone in his eyes, and in his blurred vision, he saw a silver shadow far away across the sea.</p><p></p><p>"What is that!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>The shadow drew nearer and became clearer.</p><p></p><p>He saw with his own eyes the sacred boat he had been desperately seeking, coming from the distant sea, passing by the islands.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the sacred boat."</p><p></p><p>He did not believe the sacred boat was just passing by here by chance, what he saw now fully confirmed his previous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen opened his blurred eyes and looked at it, weakly murmuring:</p><p></p><p>"So, you are truly sailing back along the great poet's journey?"</p><p></p><p>"Where do you want to go?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to return to the realm of the divine once more?"</p><p></p><p>He saw the sacred boat approaching from the horizon, reaching the edge of the island, just a step away from him.</p><p></p><p>Then, it started to drift away.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't go away!"</p><p></p><p>He cried out in despair, weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had lost the glory of a prince, fallen to the depths of destitution, and had nothing left to be proud of.</p><p></p><p>He begged pitifully, violently banging his head against the stone pillar as if kowtowing, as if trying to catch the attention of that sacred boat.</p><p></p><p>His behavior and expression were more abject than any slave he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Save me!"</p><p></p><p>Alas.</p><p></p><p>He was not the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>He was not the pilgrim carrying divine artifacts to the realm of the gods, nor would anyone come to rescue him with the will of the divine.</p><p></p><p>The sacred boat sailing away under the dreamlike starlight did not stop.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen unleashed his spiritual power, his mental force breaking through his mind and consciousness, whipping up a violent storm.</p><p></p><p>In his roar, the spiritual power controlled a falling rock from above, shattering the stone shackles binding his hands.</p><p></p><p>He freed his hands, but lacked the strength to remove the shackles on his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Dragging the stone shackles on his legs, he crawled towards the sacred boat that was reflecting silver light in the sun, the boat to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to board that sacred boat.</p><p></p><p>He reached the edge of the island, just a few more meters and he could climb onto that sacred, shining vessel.</p><p></p><p>The silver boat filled with hope.</p><p></p><p>Joy welled up on his face, but at the same time, he felt something else.</p><p></p><p>He turned back.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the solar chalice, which had become one with him, had drained the mythical blood from his body, swelling to its limit.</p><p></p><p>The transformed solar flower chalice opened its mouth,</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>The prince was dead, leaving only a corpse behind.</p><p></p><p>From the corpse, a beautiful flower bloomed, its dense roots taking root in Weis Horsen's body, devouring his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Even the bones were crushed and consumed by the flower chalice.</p><p></p><p>It was a flower that bloomed from Weis Horsen's despair.</p><p></p><p>It had gained consciousness and awakened its own wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Its spiritual power radiated outward, and it also saw the distant sacred boat.</p><p></p><p>It did not know what it was, but it had a strong urge to chase after the sacred boat, a powerful desire to board that ship.</p>

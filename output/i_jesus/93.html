        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy who emerged from the realm of the gods descended to the human world through the gate of light. 🍭💜➅❾𝐒𝐇Ǖx.Č𝐎𝔪🐜★</p><p></p><p>She walked on the surface of the vast sea, her golden and magnificent robe sweeping across the water, rippling the surface.</p><p></p><p>This was her first time entering the world outside the realm of the gods. She was born at the feet of the deities and had been by their side since birth.</p><p></p><p>As she gazed upon the endless sea, her heart felt suddenly empty and vast.</p><p></p><p>"La la la la!"</p><p></p><p>"La la~"</p><p></p><p>She leapt up and glided across the sea, singing ethereal and tranquil songs, dancing the dances most beloved by the fairies.</p><p></p><p>The outside world was vast and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>But alas, there were no companions here to hold her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hee hee hee!"</p><p></p><p>When the gods were not watching, she let herself go completely, just like the other little fairies.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, she felt that perhaps she had been too constrained in the presence of the gods. She thought that dancing before the deities might not be such a bad thing after all.</p><p></p><p>"If only the gods were here to watch me dance across the sea."</p><p></p><p>"Though it does make me a little shy."</p><p></p><p>As she glided across the surface of the sea, she suddenly looked up towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>She sensed a great Ruhir monster lurking not far away, and recalled the purpose of her departure from the realm of the gods.</p><p></p><p>But the dream fairy also felt puzzled: "How can a fusion monster appear here?"</p><p></p><p>This was not the domain of the Xin Sai, but rather the realm of the Maelstrom people.</p><p></p><p>Carried by the starlight breeze, she hurried towards that place. New 69 book bar → 69𝘴𝘩𝘶𝘹.𝘤𝘰𝘮</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>She saw floating corpses on the surface of the sea, the blood of the Maelstrom people staining the waters, emanating a pungent odor.</p><p></p><p>She witnessed the carnage, and the betrayal.</p><p></p><p>The three-leaved one named Heniel had plunged the Ruhir sword into the body of his own kin, the Prince Weiss, and then kicked him into the depths of the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>"Weiss, of the Hoson family."</p><p></p><p>The fairy had never seen such a scene before - the sin and evil of the three-leaved one laid bare before her.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Heniel, commanding the Ruhir monster in its burrowing worm form, traversed the surface of the sea, standing alone atop the great beast's head.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand, and the blood on his hand, had been washed clean by the seawater.</p><p></p><p>At first, his expression was calm and quiet, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, as long as he washed the blood off his hands, everything would cease to exist.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before he could no longer contain his laughter, covering his eyes as if to hide his unrestrained, maniacal cackle.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel had never felt such exhilaration. He, a mere speck of mud beneath the Hoson family, had consumed the most important heir of the Hoson clan.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he had also taken one of the two crucial cornerstones of the Hoson family's throne - the burrowing worm.</p><p></p><p>Dreamlike starlight descended upon the sea, and a ethereal voice echoed in this domain. ♤🎃６➈𝕊𝕙Ǘ𝓍.𝒸ㄖ𝐦♥😳</p><p></p><p>The visitor asked him: "Three-leaved one!"</p><p></p><p>"How can you be both so pure and innocent, yet so evil and ugly?"</p><p></p><p>"You have committed the sin of patricide, yet you can still laugh so freely?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy even began to doubt whether these rulers, these wielders of wisdom and power, could truly harness the power of dreams properly.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, as the gods had said, all their actions were ultimately meaningless and futile.</p><p></p><p>Heniel turned around and saw the beautiful being amidst the dreamlike starlight. </p><p></p><p>Walking on the surface of the sea, it was like the most wondrous and sacred existence from myths and paintings had come to life in this world.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time he had seen such beauty.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To such an existence.</p><p></p><p>If he was the black mud underground, then the other party was the moon and stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream told him: "I am the messenger of the divine, the fairy of the dream."</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Heniel finally struggled out of the lost state.</p><p></p><p>He then reacted to the fairy's previous words, and smiled undeniably.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the fairy of the dream! Saint Tito said that you were born from sweet dreams, and you represent the good side of human nature."</p><p></p><p>"You were born to surround the feet of the divine, and live in the realm of the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream nodded: "It's true."</p><p></p><p>Heniel: "Look! You are so fortunate."</p><p></p><p>"You were born with everything, with the most beautiful things in the world."</p><p></p><p>"You have not experienced our pain, our despair, our hatred, why should you demand that we must be kind and good?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream was stunned, she had never thought of these things before.</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate people are much more complicated than she imagined, and the human realm is not the dreamlike garden of the fairies.</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not wait for the fairy's answer: "Then why did the messenger of the divine come to the human world? Are you here to punish me on behalf of the divine?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream: "The gates of the divine realm are about to open, and open the path of return to the Trifoliate people."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time."</p><p></p><p>"The divine will bestow the power of creation upon the Trifoliate people, and withdraw the power of destruction."</p><p></p><p>Deep in her heart, she did not want to hand over the power of the dream to such people, although only those who possess the power can become the force of change and revolution.</p><p></p><p>But she still hopes to choose a different person to become the transmitter and controller of the power of the dream.</p><p></p><p>But she still asked, "O Trifoliate people who have committed the crime of patricide! Are you willing to give up the power of the giant monster?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel: "What will I get then?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream told him: "By giving up the power of destruction, you will gain the power of creation."</p><p></p><p>"By letting go of the dark heart, you will gain the light of hope."</p><p></p><p>"The gates of the divine realm will open to you, and when you die, someone will come to receive you, and you will be transformed into the stars of the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Heniel thought for a while and rejected the fairy's proposal.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the power of destruction or the power of creation, they are both power."</p><p></p><p>"Why should I give up a power I have already obtained, to exchange for an unknown power?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dream: "Losing and gaining are not what you can decide for yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of King Laideli!"</p><p></p><p>"Everything you have is not yours, but only a grace bestowed upon you by the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Your life, your wisdom, your power."</p><p></p><p>"And the power of the fusion monster that you think you have obtained and can possess everything, are just temporary graces given to you by the divine."</p><p></p><p>The fairy looked at Heniel, saddened by his fallen and dark heart.</p><p></p><p>But she did not force Heniel to give up the power of the giant monster, only those who voluntarily give up the power of destruction can be qualified to obtain the power of creation of the dream.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel."</p><p></p><p>"You will eventually grow old and lose everything."</p><p></p><p>"Only the realm of the divine is eternal."</p><p></p><p>"There will come a day when you will regret the choice you made today."</p><p></p><p>The young Heniel humbly knelt down and paid respects to the messenger of the divine.</p><p></p><p>"Messenger of the divine, please forgive your humble and short-sighted believer, I cannot see so far into the future."</p><p></p><p>"At this moment."</p><p></p><p>"I only want to pursue what belongs to me now."</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by starlight, the messenger of the divine left, this was not the person she wanted to find.</p><p></p><p>Heniel then stood up.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt the Ruhk brand on his forehead burning, and he looked at his reflection in the sea.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Prince Weiss was pierced through the chest by a sharp blade, and his brow bone was also gouged out.</p><p></p><p>He fell into the vast sea, but did not die immediately.</p><p></p><p>He felt himself sinking deeper and deeper, gradually being consumed by the sea.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand upwards, as if trying to grasp the light reflecting down from the surface.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the light was unreachable, and all that awaited him was the dark abyss of the seabed.</p><p></p><p>"Glub, glub!"</p><p></p><p>Bubbles kept escaping from between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>His vision grew darker and more blurred.</p><p></p><p>Shadows surrounded him, but he could no longer make out who they were.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it they who killed the traitor Heniell, coming to save me?" A look of joyful surprise crossed Weiss Hosen's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Or... is it those monsters?" But then he thought it was more likely the monsters, and the joy instantly turned to terror.</p><p></p><p>In fear, his consciousness completely sank away—</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>In the underwater city of the Salaland territory, within an underwater stone cave surrounded by ancient cups.</p><p></p><p>Weiss Hosen awoke from his slumber. He felt a deep, bone-piercing pain, as if countless needles had stabbed into his body and flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a agonized scream, but as soon as he opened his mouth, seawater rushed in.</p><p></p><p>He was imprisoned in a bone cage. Opening his eyes, he saw the surrounding environment through the gaps - this should be a prison of the Abyss Dwellers.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had guessed in the end, he had fallen into the hands of the Abyss Dwellers.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't these monsters kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the reason, being alive was the greatest fortune. As long as he lived, he still had a chance to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own wounds. He had suffered such serious injuries before, and by rights should have been hard to survive.</p><p></p><p>But he found that the wound on his chest had healed.</p><p></p><p>This filled him with joy, and he touched the healed wound in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"It's healed?"</p><p></p><p>In his excitement, he immediately began to prepare to escape from here.</p><p></p><p>He disdainfully looked at the bone cage, thinking that these Abyss Dwellers must be fools, believing that such a thing could imprison him.</p><p></p><p>He was a high-level ritualist, a powerful three-leaf royal with mastery of all kinds of divine arts.</p><p></p><p>"How could this hold me!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and his spiritual power immediately extended out from his mind.</p><p></p><p>But before the spiritual power could break through his mind, he was immediately struck by excruciating pain and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also sensed a deadly crisis.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head, and saw the source of all the changes.</p><p></p><p>Weiss Hosen saw a beautiful flower cup blooming on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The flower cup was a dazzling gold, just like the light of the sun.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why his wound had healed so quickly - it was the powerful life force of the Solar Cup that had saved him.</p><p></p><p>But there was no joy in his eyes. Seeing the golden flower cup, he looked at it as if it were the most terrifying thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>"The forbidden art, the Regicide Flower."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Solar Cup implanted within him, he was utterly horrified.</p><p></p><p>How did the first generation Heavenly King Yesaer die?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How was the High Priest Slörd of the Empty Divine Temple undone by the backlash?</p><p></p><p>All of this is written in the great poet's "Epic of Hinsai", passed down through the generations by the four great royal bloodline families.</p><p></p><p>It can even be said that in the realm of Hinsai, there is no one who does not know this story.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the backlash of the Sun Cup that the second-generation Wise King Yesaer died, and the Trifoliate people lost the Wise King's crown.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?" </p><p>"Damn, it was those monsters."</p><p>"How dare you do this to me, how could you do this?"</p><p></p><p>In his extreme panic, Weis Horsen repeatedly tried to wield the power of wisdom, but as soon as he used his strength, the Sun Cup would devour the mythological blood within him.</p><p></p><p>The backlash came so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Because these people did not really master the divine arts of the first-generation High Priest of the Sky Temple, and even if they did, they would not be able to use them on Weis.</p><p></p><p>They directly planted the Sun Cup in his flesh and blood, brutally fusing it with his power.</p><p></p><p>They had decided from the beginning to use the Sun Cup to seal Weis Horsen's power, and to sow a seed of hopeless death within him.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight of the Saral Dominion of the Abyss Country hated Weis Horsen to the bone, and countless of her people and subordinates had died at his hands.</p><p></p><p>She wanted him to die by her own hand, and in the most terrifying and desperate way.</p><p></p><p>When they discovered he had awakened, the Abyss people guarding the prison immediately passed the news to the Abyss Knight.</p><p></p><p>A group of Abyss people brought a bone cage to a cold, gloomy underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight looked at Weis Horsen with icy eyes: "Kneel before me!"</p><p></p><p>He was pressed to the ground by mental force, lying on the ground like an ugly worm, a pitiful creature caged.</p><p></p><p>"Kill me! Kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen suddenly felt that dying earlier would have been better than this, this was not good fortune at all, but the beginning of his nightmare.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight hated Weis Horsen intensely, her huge tail slid down and leaned against the bone cage, her eyes blood-red as she looked at the prince.</p><p></p><p>"Die?"</p><p>"Of course you will die!"</p><p>"But I want to watch you die in despair."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight's icy voice entered his mind, mimicking Weis Horsen's former lofty tone.</p><p></p><p>"Feel the grace I bestow upon you! My mercy allows you to live a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"You will be devoured by the Sun Cup, your will forever imprisoned in this chalice, suffering torment for thousands and millions of years."</p><p></p><p>Weis Horsen lay on the ground, looking at the Abyss Knight.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified to the extreme, and also felt the utmost humiliation.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he felt this scene was so familiar.</p><p></p><p>As if he was seeing his former self.</p><p></p><p>Arrogant and contemptuous.</p><p></p><p>Considering his punishment of others as a matter of course, and his lofty humiliation as his own grace and charity.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps!"</p><p>"This is how Heniel looked at me!"</p><p>"And that traitor too."</p><p></p><p>Weis suddenly felt that maybe this was why they had betrayed him one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight turned her head and said to the soldiers,</p><p></p><p>"Tie him to the Island of the Dead and let him experience the suffering of the saints."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Knight looked at Weis Horsen with disdain: "The great poet Tito was also bound on the Island of the Dead, and the first Abyss King went by the will of the gods to rescue the great poet."</p><p></p><p>"You wonder,"</p><p>"Will the gods send their messenger to save someone like you?"</p>

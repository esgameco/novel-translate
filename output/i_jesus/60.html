        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The dream-like starlight kept spreading out from Bora's body, a gate opened by countless fireflies swallowed Bora and the entire Garden of the Sun's Chalice. </p><p></p><p>Bora hugged Xing and floated up bit by bit, slowly rotating in mid-air, raising layer upon layer of rippling waves.</p><p></p><p>That scene was just like the galaxy revolving around them.</p><p></p><p>In the end.</p><p></p><p>Bora and Xing gradually dissipated into the halo of light, transforming into starlight.</p><p></p><p>Tito held his bone tablet of the "Hynsei Epic" and chased after them, staring blankly at the high sky.</p><p></p><p>He murmured:</p><p></p><p>"Queen of the Stars."</p><p>"Lord Bora."</p><p></p><p>On the ground, it was a blank slate, that brilliant garden also disappeared along with the queen and the divine messenger.</p><p></p><p>In the air, the last sigh left by Bora faintly echoed:</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p>"Unable to see the God one last time."</p><p>"Sorry...God...in the end, Bora still cannot accompany you on the journey."</p><p></p><p>Just as Bora Xing said, he would bring Xing to fall into an eternal dream together.</p><p></p><p>There, they will be companions forever.</p><p></p><p>Tito blankly looked at the sky, watching the brilliance gradually dissipate, but at the same time, a golden ray of light fell from the sky, landing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He cast his gaze downward to the ground, kneeling down and slowly picking up that object.</p><p></p><p>"This is!"</p><p>"The Chalice of God?"</p><p></p><p>Bora's body and all his powers condensed together, transforming into a dazzlingly brilliant golden Chalice of God.</p><p></p><p>On it were dreamlike patterns, the imprints of the sun and stars.</p><p></p><p>The Chalice of God contained the concept of dreams, as well as the core coordinates of all dream powers.</p><p></p><p>It was the foundation of dreams, and the supreme power of dream abilities.</p><p></p><p>Tito held the chalice and looked inside, starlight rippling within.</p><p></p><p>He saw the shadows of the Queen of Stars and the divine messenger Bora, transforming into stars and the sun, intertwined, shuttling through the endless sea of flowers in the Sun's Chalice.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw one magnificent or exquisite dream after another, arising and vanishing within the golden Chalice of God.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance retracted.</p><p></p><p>Rust gradually crept up the golden Chalice of God, becoming an ancient and dilapidated object.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the divine miracle just displayed, no one would be able to tell what this was.</p><p></p><p>Yet Tito vaguely understood what he was holding in his hands.</p><p></p><p>It was something akin to the Mother Spiral of All Things from the legendary Mother of Life Sali, or the Crown of Wisdom from the Wisdom King Leadreki, in the tales.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This was a supreme divine artifact. </p><p></p><p>The poet's hands holding the divine chalice trembled violently. He even felt that merely touching this object with his hands was a desecration of it.</p><p></p><p>He raised the divine chalice high above his head.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Polo."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the gift you are offering to the deities?"</p><p></p><p>"How am I worthy to present this supreme divine object on your behalf? Can I really do as you have said?"</p><p></p><p>What the Trileans called the "Divine Chalice" was actually the flower named the Sun's Chalice, unworthy of that lofty name. </p><p></p><p>But as the supreme object ruling over all Sun's Chalices, the ultimate embodiment of the power of dreams, this divine artifact condensed from Polo himself - this was the true Divine Chalice.</p><p></p><p>Tito carefully put away the Divine Chalice. Countless emotions were surging within him at this moment. He felt unable to speak, so he could only record it in writing.</p><p></p><p>The poet Tito took up a jade-like stone engraving knife and carved the final chapter of the Heinse Epic onto bone tablets.</p><p></p><p>[The shining stars accompanying the Queen's passing were extinguished, and the fairies born of dreams also ended with the shattering of the beautiful dream.]</p><p></p><p>[The kings of successive dynasties were all buried under dust with the passage of time, but the Heinse legacy still continues.]  </p><p></p><p>[However, the epic ends, and the mythology is also lost in the river of time.]</p><p></p><p>[Only...]</p><p></p><p>[Faith remains eternal.]</p><p></p><p>The story of the Divine Messenger and the Star Queen has ended.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Celestial Temple City. City of Divine Servants.</p><p></p><p>The poet Tito returned with his great epic poem, and the Queen opened the path to the divine temple for him.</p><p></p><p>Within the towering and majestic palace, he prostrated himself on the ground before the many priests of the Star Kingdom, presenting the stone tablet engraved with the 'Heinse Epic'.</p><p></p><p>"Offered to Her Majesty the noble Queen."</p><p></p><p>"May!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heinse legacy be imperishable, may the faith in the Inse deity be eternal!"</p><p></p><p>The young reigning Queen sat on the throne. After reading the poem on the stone tablets, she showed an expression of shock.</p><p></p><p>Even as the third generation Queen of the Star Kingdom from the Seilon family, she had only vaguely heard about the story of the former Heinse through oral tradition.</p><p></p><p>This was her first time seeing such a complete Heinse Epic, so vivid and detailed.</p><p></p><p>It contained the terrifying theory of destiny, the will of the deities transcending all.</p><p></p><p>The desires for power, the greed of original sin, as well as piety and faith.</p><p></p><p>The supreme and divine...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The collision between the Wise King and the punished leader of the craftsmen, the figures of the ruler, minister, priest, and divine messenger intertwined and reincarnated. </p><p></p><p>One character after another converged into an epic chapter.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly a great poem. They say you traveled across the four nations to complete this work."</p><p></p><p>Tito replied humbly, "Only by witnessing the footsteps of the rulers can one describe true history."</p><p></p><p>The queen asked curiously, "I've heard that you also saw the Star Queen and the divine messenger Prince Polo."</p><p></p><p>Tito did not conceal it, "Indeed, I saw the Star Queen and the divine messenger."</p><p></p><p>The queen immediately stood up, "How are they...?"</p><p></p><p>Tito knelt on the ground and said, "Your Majesty! The stars have faded, but dreams remain eternal."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was silence in the palace.</p><p></p><p>After completing the Hein Epic, Tito became a hot commodity in the city of divine servants. Countless people chanted his poems.</p><p></p><p>The nobles of the Star Kingdom took pride in inviting him to banquets, and priests vied to acquire his works.</p><p></p><p>His name spread from the Star Kingdom to other kingdoms, and even nobles and rulers of other kingdoms sent invitations, hoping he would visit their nations.</p><p></p><p>He had become what he once hoped for, surpassing his father and grandfather, becoming a renowned poet.</p><p></p><p>However, all of this could not make him feel satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Tito stood on the steps of the Celestial Temple, gazing at the sea of clouds and the entire world.</p><p></p><p>He asked himself, "Tito, you have already achieved such success, why does your heart still feel empty?"</p><p></p><p>He was already successful enough and enjoyed a glory he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>But he could only call it success, not greatness.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to be a great poet.</p><p></p><p>The words of the divine messenger Polo echoed in Tito's ears again.</p><p></p><p>"Tito, go seek the legendary Divine Paradise. I have left something that will guide you toward the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Pyramid Temple and behold the eternal Hein."</p><p></p><p>The wind rose suddenly, reigniting the flames in Tito's heart.</p><p></p><p>The flames kept rising, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Tito suddenly turned his head toward the direction of the divine city.</p><p></p><p>His eyes pierced through the mountains, lakes, deserts, and vast oceans.</p><p></p><p>He saw the divine realm blooming with sunflowers.</p><p></p><p>"I want to write an even greater epic."</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"A myth!"</p><p></p><p>"Its name will be..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito established a house in a remote seaside village far from the city of divine descent and truly became a craftsman.</p><p></p><p>No one knew his name, only that his skills were superb, and the things he carved were even sought after by the nobles in the town.</p><p></p><p>He watched the fishermen emerging from the sea, sitting on a rock and carving his new creation.</p><p></p><p>The name was - the marionette of fate.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist of the story was himself, and the background was the dream he had once had.</p><p></p><p>At one time, he also thought he was the son of fortune, but in the end, he found that he was nothing more than a marionette of fate.</p><p></p><p>Fortune is also a kind of fate. It is the aimless drift of ordinary people without goals and ideals.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of one heroic figure after another in mythological epics, who had lofty ideals, devout faith, and great power, etc. They had experienced all kinds of tribulations, had strong will, and an indomitable spirit.</p><p></p><p>But he had never heard of a person who was great solely because of luck.</p><p></p><p>He had once enjoyed the power of this luck, until he met the person in his dream.</p><p></p><p>The other person told him: "Tito said to the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Fate is in our own hands."</p><p></p><p>"I no longer wait for the arrival of fate, but take the initiative to create my own fate."</p><p></p><p>Except for himself, no one could understand the impact he received at that moment.</p><p></p><p>His ancestors were the great people who grasped fate.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to carve the scene he had seen in his dream, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember the other character in the dream.</p><p></p><p>He carved his own image, but in the end, he stopped at another figure, only outlining a simple silhouette.</p><p></p><p>He held the carving knife, hovering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"How do you know about the great poet's past, and what happened in the divine palace?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Stan Tito still couldn't remember.</p><p></p><p>He put down the carving knife and stood up, returning to the innermost secret room of the house, where a golden divine flower was growing.</p><p></p><p>He approached the flowerpot, and a illusory scene was released from the golden flower cup. He reached his hand into the illusion, as if directly touching the things within the illusion.</p><p></p><p>He flipped through a book of bone scriptures, trying to find what he wanted from them.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Cup!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Flower, Forbidden Flower, Dream Flower."</p><p></p><p>"How much more miraculous and unknown power do you still hold within you?"</p><p></p><p>After being granted the power of wisdom, he began to study illusion techniques with the help of the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>This power, which was feared by most priests in the kingdom of Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>There was a knock on the door, and a three-leaf person suddenly rushed in. He had a blood-red brand on his body.</p><p></p><p>He was a slave, but not Stan Tito's slave, but a slave from a nearby fishing ground, who always came here to try to learn the craftsman's skills from Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't say he wanted to learn, Stan Tito could still see it.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito came out of the innermost room and looked at the slave.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, the slave excitedly said,</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you know?"</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Samo has been defeated."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito nodded, "How badly was it defeated?"</p><p></p><p>The slave was a bit excited, although he didn't know why he was excited, after all, these things had nothing to do with him, a lowly and humble slave.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing such major news, he still had the urge to find someone to tell and share it with.</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Samo may be about to perish, and everyone says that King Heniel will become the new king of Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>"A new dynasty will be established, and the era has completely changed."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was not interested in the war, he felt that no matter whether this war was won or lost, it would not change the world.</p><p></p><p>Whether Heniel becomes king or Heniel fails.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito gathered up the bone plates on his desk and patted the slave on the shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of a ruler cannot change the times..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The power of the giant monster can only bring destruction," he said.</p><p></p><p>"War cannot bring hope, nor can it bring light to the countless Hinsai people."</p><p></p><p>"History has always been telling us that the Hinsai people have been going in circles for hundreds of years, and will ultimately return to the starting point."</p><p></p><p>"One generation of kings after another, countless talented people have emerged."</p><p></p><p>"But no one has ever created a brilliance that surpasses the glory of King Yesaer."</p><p></p><p>He sighed and lowered his head: "When we left the divine, we lost the power to seek the light."</p><p></p><p>The slave did not understand what Stan Tito was saying, and could only scratch his head.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered the scene written in "The Last Chapter", the thing that the great poet Tito had always been thinking about.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was immediately stunned, and he slowly said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"The power of the dream that can create everything."</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>On the desert plain, the armies engaged in fierce combat, two terrifying giant insects of different colors were slaughtering each other on the wasteland, and thousands of soldiers on the ground were charging in formation.</p><p></p><p>Spears fell like rain, the tall and strong vanguard warriors swung their battle axes in collision, and the soldiers behind them raised stone hammers to shatter the carapaces of the three-leaf people one by one.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The battle did not last long, the desert worms suddenly lost control, and it was only with difficulty that they stabilized.</p><p></p><p>They were obviously no longer able to fight, and could only begin to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of soldiers of the Samo Kingdom were routed, following the desert worms to retreat into the distance, many were captured or lost their way in the panicked escape.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Samo Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The three-leaf king sitting on the throne suddenly opened his eyes, he immediately touched his forehead, the Ruhe brand that controlled the desert worms was already fading and almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang~"</p><p></p><p>The king, as if in a frenzy, frantically pushed and smashed everything he could see in the palace, venting his fear and panic.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, the rumor that the divine had withdrawn the Ruhe giant monster had already spread throughout the Hinsai kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Samo Kingdom, of course, was not unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, by the time they knew, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The Ruhe giant monster of the royal bloodline family had seven, with Henir and the Samo Kingdom each having two.</p><p></p><p>But the desert worms and the moon fern in their hands had been severely depleted in the previous battles with Queen Xinglo.</p><p></p><p>While in Henir's hands, in addition to the burrowing magic worms whose power was about to be exhausted, the power of the Sele sea demons was still well preserved.</p><p></p><p>This is the main reason why Henir, in addition to having a far superior military advantage, has been constantly forcing them to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Henir just wants to gamble with them, because in the end, the winner will definitely be him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"You despicable bastard, the black mud that usurped the throne."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this way can defeat me? Can you defeat the royal bloodline that has stood for hundreds of years?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>In the anxiety and roar, he expressed his weakness, feeling that his throne and power were gradually crumbling.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had lost not only the brand, but everything.</p><p></p><p>The king's red eyes looked into the distance: "Do you think that without the Ruhe brand, we have no way to control the Ruhe giant monster?"</p><p></p><p>However, this remark immediately changed the expression on Princess Saliman, who had just entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly stepped forward and knelt down, cuddling at the foot of the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"At this time, perhaps only the power of the divine can guide us."</p><p></p><p>The king laughed: "The divine?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"No one can find the divine, nor will they get power from the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Since the holy man Tito hundreds of years ago, who else can have the favor of the divine?"</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman quickly mentioned a name: "Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>"The descendant of the great poet, the existence known as the lucky son."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the key to opening the door to the divine realm is now in his hands."</p><p></p><p>The king gradually calmed down, and he looked at his daughter, the first heir to the Samo Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Can you find him?"</p>

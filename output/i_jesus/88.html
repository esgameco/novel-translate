        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sea of stars in the dream world is different from the starry sky in the real world. It lacks the profound and ancient quality of the cosmic starry sky, but has a dreamlike quality that is unique to it.</p><p></p><p>If the cosmic starry sky is an ancient myth, then the dream sea of stars is a dreamlike fairy tale.</p><p></p><p>The fairies of the dream world float and roam freely in the uppermost layer of the dream sea of stars. They circle around the dream moon, reading through one dream after another.</p><p></p><p>The dreams in the uppermost layer are the newly born dreams. This means that these dreams are still connected to the Trifoliate people, and are dreams that are currently unfolding.</p><p></p><p>The fairy is prepared to meet some people in the dreams, and to seek some answers.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she finds the person she wants to see.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy intrudes into this dream and encounters Stan Tito within it.</p><p></p><p>Stan's dream is an ancient stone palace, with inscribed stone tablets covering the walls and beautiful poems carved on the pillars.</p><p></p><p>Stan is crouching beneath a wall, using tools to carve poems onto the wall.</p><p></p><p>Alas, he is only a craftsman, not a poet. He can only repeatedly carve the poems and stories of others.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy approaches him: "Are you the lucky son who found the 'Tito's Travels'? Did you ignite this dispute?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito turns around and sees the dream fairy Hila.</p><p></p><p>"They say I am the chosen one, but I don't know if it's true," he says.</p><p></p><p>"But if it is true, then it is not I who stirred up the dispute, but fate."</p><p></p><p>Hila looks at Stan, and feels that she is not seeing a living person, but more like a marionette.</p><p></p><p>Even though he has inherited the noble title of the Tito family and possesses the glory of the saint's descendant, he still does not have a self.</p><p></p><p>He can only allow others to manipulate his fate.</p><p></p><p>"Your ancestor Tito once came to the temple and offered his piety and poems to the divine," Hila says.</p><p></p><p>"The divine asked him, 'Do you still believe in fate?'"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stands up and asks the dream fairy, "How did the great poet answer?"</p><p></p><p>Hila tells him, "He said, 'Fate is in our own hands.'"</p><p></p><p>"I will no longer wait for fate to arrive, but will create my own fate with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito is struck as if by lightning after hearing this, and falls into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>But in that moment of contemplation, the dream is suddenly broken.</p><p></p><p>Hila leaves Stan Tito's dream and flies along the dream moon, soon finding another person's dream.</p><p></p><p>This Trifoliate person's dream is completely different from Stan's. Her dream is the holy mountain of the City of Servants, but unlike reality, in this dream a door to the dream world has opened in the sky.</p><p></p><p>She is riding a giant sky beast, leading many people to fly towards the door in the sky, wanting to enter the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>This person is the Queen of the Stars.</p><p></p><p>The Queen of the Stars flies and flies! </p><p></p><p>She feels that she can never approach the divine palace, as if deep within her heart she does not believe she can be granted an audience with the divine.</p><p></p><p>When she is anxiously distressed, a voice comes from behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you doing this? What are you trying to achieve?"</p><p></p><p>The Queen of the Stars turns around, answering somewhat confusedly, "We just want to get a response from the divine. We just want to go home!"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy ponders this, then leaves this dream as well.</p><p></p><p>In the dead of night, two different dreams in the City of Servants.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the room, two figures awoke from their dreams one after the other.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xingluon√º stood up from the stone bed and quickly walked outside.</p><p></p><p>She passed through the columns, looking around as if searching for someone's shadow.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of dream did I just have?"</p><p></p><p>"There was a person in the dream, a woman."</p><p></p><p>"No, she wasn't human."</p><p></p><p>"Who was she?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly awakened, Stan Tito stared blankly: "Just now, it felt like someone said something very important to me? The great poet Tito conversing with the divine."</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!"</p><p></p><p>"How could I have dreamed of this?"</p><p></p><p>They both vaguely remembered the scenes in their dreams.</p><p></p><p>This is because only dreams that are completed can remain in the dream world.</p><p></p><p>Those dreams that are interrupted midway or disrupted by others will dissipate in the dream world, so when the three-leaf people wake up, they sometimes still remember the memories in their dreams.</p><p></p><p>----------------</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at the dream fairy who had knelt down before him, and without the other speaking, he expressed the fairy's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"You still want to give the power of the dream world to the three-leaf people."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Dream fairy Hila knew that her thoughts and everything could not be hidden from the great god, and she had never wanted to hide them.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"You need to strengthen the dream world, and the three-leaf people need the power of dreams and your guidance."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in this way, the civilization of the three-leaf people can be changed."</p><p></p><p>"And you, can also come to this world sooner."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen was indifferent, he did not particularly care about the speed of things, he just wanted an effective means, and he did not like to do unnecessary things on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>But rather than saying he doesn't like to do more, it's better to say he doesn't like surprises and accidents.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen: "Are you doing this just to make up for your mistakes?"</p><p></p><p>Dream fairy Hila lowered her head, asking herself.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, she suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the god and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not just that, I'm actually afraid."</p><p></p><p>God: "Afraid of what?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy spoke of the time when Yin Shen had slept for several hundred years before: "Oh God!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know? Time is really so long!"</p><p></p><p>"More than two hundred years to you is just a blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"Time flies like the wind through your fingers, but to us it's like a raging torrent."</p><p></p><p>The fairy looked up at Yin Shen, her brows and eyes curved.</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred years to Hila is a fraction of a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"During that long period of time,"</p><p></p><p>"I could only wander in front of the temple again and again, waiting and hoping for your awakening."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that by the time you wake up next, I will have already vanished into the passage of time."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the dream fairy immediately denied it, replacing it with an affirmative tone.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not fear, it's destined to happen."</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy lowered her head, clasping her hands.</p><p></p><p>"Oh divine!"</p><p></p><p>"You once said that for the stars, the birth and disappearance of civilizations is but a fleeting moment."</p><p></p><p>"The birth and death of life is even more insignificant than a glance."</p><p></p><p>"I've always been thinking."</p><p></p><p>"In the time that is destined to disappear for you, can I leave some traces behind?"</p><p></p><p>"At least,"</p><p></p><p>"During the years I existed, let me do something for you!"</p><p></p><p>She stood up and walked to the base of the god.</p><p></p><p>"God."</p><p></p><p>"I also want you to remember me."</p>

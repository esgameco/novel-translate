        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The second generation Wisdom King Yesser died, but the slaughter had not stopped. More sinners were driven back from afar to this abyss of demons, with shadows slipping beneath the water's surface. </p><p></p><p>The soldiers of the Xin Kingdom did not yet know their king was dead, still fiercely battling these monsters, hunting down the sinners punished by the gods.</p><p></p><p>In the name of the gods.</p><p></p><p>Only the hundreds of guards nearby saw Yesser's death, instantly freezing all their actions and looking towards that area of the sea in unison.</p><p></p><p>A headless corpse floated on the surface, a brilliant golden bizarre flower growing from it.</p><p></p><p>"The king...is dead?" The palace guards one by one could not believe the scene before their eyes.  </p><p></p><p>"The king is dead!" Someone dropped the bone spear in their hand, pierced through the chest by a sinner charging from behind, yet staring blankly at Yesser's corpse as if feeling nothing.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"  </p><p>"This cannot be!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone went mad, as if the pillar of their faith had collapsed.  </p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, everyone frantically moved again. Even though Yesser was already dead, they still rushed over recklessly, wanting to retrieve his corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice let out a shrill hiss, a mythical force belonging to a high-ranking priest sweeping out, directly causing all the Xin Kingdom soldiers and sinners within dozens of meters to freeze.</p><p></p><p>From the tall headless corpse, the bizarre flower with bared fangs and teeth twisted its stem.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice could not devour Yesser's head and Wisdom Crown, furiously biting the sinner who killed Yesser to pieces. Its roots embedded in Yesser's body shredded flesh and crushed bones, devouring his entire body and mythical blood clean.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sun Chalice completely transformed into another species.  </p><p></p><p>It.  </p><p>Came fully to life.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Sun Chalices within the other high-ranking priests of the Sky Temple in scattered sea areas also began to rebel in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Daring to take these bizarre creatures between animals and plants into their bodies, gaining power not their own, they were destined to pay the price.</p><p></p><p>The first to bear the brunt was the Sky Temple's high priest Slodd.  He was currently riding a fused monster on the distant sea, launching an encirclement on hundreds of sinners, repeatedly proposing to the sinners...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The one unleashing divine punishment was him, and at this moment, the one indulging in the slaughter was also him.</p><p></p><p>He laughed wildly, raising his hand high: "Lowly, ugly monsters! You should not exist in this world!"</p><p></p><p>"God has mercy on the people of the world, granting you the Demon Abyss."  </p><p></p><p>"How dare you defy God's will and crawl out from the Demon Abyss."</p><p></p><p>The fusion monsters like demonic insects under his feet opened their bloody maws, swallowing more than a dozen sinners in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>He prepared to begin his performance again, proclaiming his noble status as the God-enlightened one before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But the Sun Chalice within his body began to stir, its roots piercing through his armor and bursting out of his body.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Chalice, you dare defy me?"</p><p></p><p>Shlod was stunned at first, then scolded it forcefully.</p><p></p><p>He used his wisdom power, trying to communicate and control the Sun Chalice.</p><p></p><p>"It is God who bestowed you upon me, I am your master." The first sentence was spoken haughtily.</p><p></p><p>"It is God who granted you to me, you cannot defy me." This sentence was filled with panic and fear.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice within him was not as powerful as Yeser's, he could barely move but could not manifest any divine arts or mythical powers.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the Sun Flower kept devouring his flesh and blood, bursting out of his bone armor.</p><p></p><p>He grasped the stem of the Sun Flower with his hands desperately: "No!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"  </p><p></p><p>"I am the God-enlightened one!"</p><p></p><p>"God would not abandon me!"</p><p></p><p>"God would not abandon me!"</p><p></p><p>Amid the piercing screams.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice split into several petals, swallowing his head whole.</p><p></p><p>But the mutated Sun Chalice did not fare well either. The priests of God nearby saw the situation and immediately controlled the fusion monsters to tear it to shreds.</p><p></p><p>But the high priest Shlod could never be saved.</p><p></p><p>He followed closely in the king's footsteps, dying in this war that would be recorded in history.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the high priests of the Sky Temple fell into dire straits everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Screams rang out incessantly, as they could not understand why the Sun Chalice had suddenly turned against them.</p><p></p><p>"God! Is this your punishment for us?"</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, many monsters broke through and escaped into the sea.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter gradually came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Only over a thousand sinners managed to escape back to the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The king's guards seized the skull of the second-generation Wisdom King Yeser from the hands of some sinners but could not find the rest of his body.</p><p></p><p>More alarmingly, they could not find the Crown of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Prince Ali!"</p><p></p><p>"This...this is..."</p><p></p><p>The kneeling guard did not dare finish the sentence, and committed shameful suicide right in front of Ali, the grandson of Yeser. </p><p></p><p>Ali stood on the fused body of the monster Ninini, holding up Yeser's severed head and tightly embracing it.</p><p></p><p>Tilting his head back, he let out a long wail as tears streamed down unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>"The King!"</p><p></p><p>There was no victor in this war. </p><p></p><p>The sinful people suffered massacre and were driven back into the abyss once more.</p><p></p><p>And the Kingdom of Heinsei lost its Wise King.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>The divine power of the Wise King bestowed upon them by the gods.</p><p></p><p>《The Heinsei Epic》</p><p></p><p>Because mortals indulged in killing, cruelty, and desire, using the power bestowed by the gods to kill and act wantonly, the gods took back the supreme authority they had granted to King Rederiki.</p><p></p><p>Mortals bearing original sin are unworthy to wear the crown of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>From then on, there were no more Wise Kings on the land and oceans, only the Kings of Heinsei.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The Sun's Chalice felt different from before.</p><p></p><p>The sun shone on it, and it felt comfortable.</p><p></p><p>It even understood what joy and happiness were, and knew what danger was.</p><p></p><p>When the other Sun's Chalices swayed their blossoms, only to be torn apart one by one by the priests of the Kingdom of Heinsei and the fusion monsters, it alone hid away, floating with the ocean waves towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of an island appeared in the distance, and a thought emerged in its mind.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could take root there.</p><p></p><p>The island drew nearer and nearer.</p><p></p><p>Closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>To its delight, it found there were others of its kind here.</p><p></p><p>A golden sea of flowers swayed from the shore all the way into the distance, as if welcoming their arrival.</p><p></p><p>It would stay here.</p><p></p><p>It drifted ashore, its roots tangling like feet as it crawled up.</p><p></p><p>"Swish! Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Something seemed to be moving, passing through the sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>Before it could react, a hand grabbed it.</p><p></p><p>Green eyes fixed its consciousness, a terrifying aura like that of a demon god stirring the memories deep in its blood.</p><p></p><p>It was so afraid it dared not move a muscle.</p><p></p><p>Eons ago, its ancestor had been held in that same hand.</p><p></p><p>"Gururu?"</p><p></p><p>They had left the divine lands and drifted on the sea.</p><p></p><p>From one end of the Kingdom of Heinsei to the other, and then back again, circling the known world.</p><p></p><p>And now, they had returned to Sari's hands.</p><p></p><p>Everything.</p>

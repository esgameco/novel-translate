        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum~"</p><p></p><p>The heavy metal doors of the temple fully opened, and the illusory figure of the God Yin walked out from the temple. </p><p></p><p>The three-leaf stone statues on both sides of the stairs outside raised their flames one by one, extending from the top of the pyramid, the golden radiance illuminating the entire path.</p><p></p><p>Yin God looked up.</p><p></p><p>He gazed out at the outside world.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer the real ocean, but a realm where illusion and reality intertwined.</p><p></p><p>The islands of the Divinely Bestowed Land were no longer tightly nestled by the sea, but were floating in an unknown void, like a completely suspended giant island.</p><p></p><p>By Yin God's side was the fairy of dreams, Hila, who followed the god step by step down the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>Yin God came to the edge of the Divinely Bestowed Land, taking out the divine artifact, the Cup of the Gods.</p><p></p><p>The stains on the rust-stained Cup of the Gods gradually peeled off, and the patterns of the sun and stars gradually emerged, exquisite and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Yin God held it up.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Cup of the Gods erupted with a sun-like brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The light covered Yin God, dazzling the dream fairy, who couldn't help but raise her robe to block her vision. Then that intense light gradually covered the sea of flowers of the Cup of the Sun, covered the Divinely Bestowed City.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it shone upon the pyramid temple.</p><p></p><p>The entire Divinely Bestowed Land was bathed in sunlight again, turning from darkness to daylight.</p><p></p><p>The sun slowly detached from Yin God's hand and rose into the sky of the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>The light covered the entire dream world, and the color of the sky turned a clear, pristine azure blue due to the rising sun.</p><p></p><p>The dream realm was completely stabilized. As long as the Cup of the Gods was not destroyed, this dream world could exist forever.</p><p></p><p>"Bolo."</p><p></p><p>"You really are the sun!"</p><p></p><p>The god laughed and said these words, but the dream fairy heard no laughter, only a sense of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>The composition of the dream world is very peculiar.</p><p></p><p>If you say it is illusory, but the lives, the sea of flowers of the Cup of the Sun, the islands of the Divinely Bestowed Land, and the pyramid temple can all be said to be real.</p><p></p><p>If you say it is real, the other things in this realm are illusory, and even this realm itself can be said to be illusory.</p><p></p><p>Reality and illusion intertwine, the real can also become false, and the illusory can also become real here.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila said to the god, "God!"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>"The power of the dream world did not appear out of thin air. If we don't let the dream fairies leave the divine country, the three-leaf people will not be able to master the power of the dream."</p><p></p><p>"Without the memories of the three-leaf people to support it, this dream world will be difficult to become stronger."</p><p></p><p>Yin God shook his head and told the dream fairy that there was another way to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Although it would be slower, it could still be done.</p><p></p><p>"Dreams do not belong to any one person, every intelligent life can have their own dreams."</p><p></p><p>"Dreams are born of wisdom, and wisdom also becomes the garden of dreams."</p><p></p><p>Yin God stretched out his left hand and removed the crown of wisdom from his right middle finger.</p><p></p><p>"Dong!"</p><p></p><p>The ring rotated with a snap, constantly growing larger.</p><p></p><p>The crown emitted a cold silver glow, and finally transformed into a moon in front of Yin God and the fairy.</p><p></p><p>The dream sun in the sky disappeared, and the moon slowly climbed up the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally azure blue sky became deep and profound due to the light of the moon.</p><p></p><p>The two divine artifacts of wisdom and dreams supported the entire dream world.</p><p></p><p>"The sun and moon of the dream."</p><p></p><p>"Then there should be stars next."</p><p></p><p>Yin God stretched out his finger and pointed to the sky.</p><p></p><p>As his fingertip pointed, truly shining stars appeared in the profound night sky, guarding the moon above.</p><p></p><p>The stars decorated the sky, and also decorated this dream world.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy exclaimed:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It is the dream of the Sanye people."</p><p></p><p>By enlarging those countless stars, one can see that each star is a dream realm of a Sanye person.</p><p></p><p>Through the power of the Wisdom Crown, the dream world has now been connected to the dreams of all Sanye people. Whenever they dream, a faint starlight will illuminate the sky of the dream world.</p><p></p><p>But when they wake up, the dream cannot be taken away, forever remaining in this world.</p><p></p><p>And that is precisely why.</p><p></p><p>All Sanye people feel their dreams to be so real, but upon waking, they often forget the memories of their dreams, only left with a sense of vagueness.</p><p></p><p>That is because their dream memories have become the nourishment for the growing dream world.</p><p></p><p>Hila cheered for the will of the gods, and was in awe of the wisdom the gods had already foreseen everything.</p><p></p><p>"This is wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Sanye people continue to exist, the dream world will keep expanding."</p><p></p><p>The dream world has since divided into three layers:</p><p></p><p>The dreams of ordinary people, which is the endless starry sea in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Dream bubbles, which are the dream eggs of the dream fairies. Once they are born, they will open a illusory door between the dream sea and the deeper dream world, which is also the portal from the real world to the dream world.</p><p></p><p>Dream fragments, which are formed after the dream bubbles have consumed certain memories and dreams, merging a part of reality into the dream world, becoming dream fragments that exist between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>For example, the God-given Land is now a massive dream fragment.</p><p></p><p>--------------</p><p></p><p>In the sea of flowers of the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hila was sitting in the center of the flower bushes, telling stories to a group of little dream fairies, when one of the little dream fairies suddenly asked Hila a question.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Hila."</p><p></p><p>"What is the world of the Sanye people like? Have you been to the world of the Sanye people?"</p><p></p><p>Hila smiled and said to them: "Although I have not been to the world of the Sanye people, I can take you to see what the world of the Sanye people is like."</p><p></p><p>Hila's robe arched out a corner, pulling the dream fairy that was speaking, and floated up with it.</p><p></p><p>One dream fairy after another held hands, gathering into a circle, and rotated towards the sky of the dream world.</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the world of the Sanye people."</p><p></p><p>The endless dream stardust in the sky, each one revealing a scene of the Sanye people's kingdom.</p><p></p><p>These dream stardust include those that have just been born, as well as dreams from long ago.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairies joyfully roamed the sea of stardust, wide-eyed at the dreams of the Sanye people.</p><p></p><p>"Don't they have any metals in their world?" asked a dream fairy with a beautiful metal pendant on her chest.</p><p></p><p>"Don't they have scarves as beautiful as ours? Can't they make beautiful hats?" asked a dream fairy wearing a scarf and hat, looking at the Sanye people's world from her perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Can't they use fire?" asked a dream fairy holding a lantern, also noticing the differences she saw.</p><p></p><p>Hila told them: "These are all gifts from the gods, things we obtained from the dreams of the deities."</p><p></p><p>Walking among the sea of stars, Hila suddenly saw a colorful bubble.</p><p></p><p>A dream completely different from the others, a magnificent dream belonging to the dream fairies.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the dream was actually the temple of the deities, and the young self from two or three hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>This was a dream she had had herself, a fragment of her own memories.</p><p></p><p>She still dreams of it frequently even to this day.</p><p></p><p>The innocent dream fairy stood before the feet of the deity, telling him the name she had just taken.</p><p></p><p>The deity asked her: "Hope?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you choose this name?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy replied: "I like this word, and I hope that my birth can bring hope and light to this world."</p><p></p><p>"Just as the deities have brought wisdom and life to this world."</p>

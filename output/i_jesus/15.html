        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The waves eroded the beach, forming white foam. </p><p></p><p>Yesser dove into the sea and climbed onto a reef, looking around. </p><p></p><p>"Hey!"</p><p></p><p>"Come out!" </p><p></p><p>A huge monster tore through the calm sea surface, revealing a mouth full of ferocious fangs aimed at Yesser. That mouth could not only easily swallow Yesser, but also crush the reef into powder.</p><p></p><p>But Yesser was not afraid at all. He could sense the feelings of the monster in front of him, their minds connected.</p><p></p><p>Although its appearance was ferocious, it was as simple as a newborn life. </p><p></p><p>Like a blank sheet of paper.</p><p></p><p>Yesser stretched out his hand and touched its brown, wrinkled, rock-like skin: "What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Yesser."</p><p></p><p>"It means moonlight, the radiance cast by the moon when night falls, my mother's favorite sight."</p><p></p><p>"She gave me the most beautiful sight in this world, hoping I would become a person like the moonlight."</p><p></p><p>"Not as violent and blinding as the sun, but illuminating the earth like the moon."</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster made no movement, only staring blankly at this jubilant three-leaf person.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have a name?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give you one!"</p><p></p><p>Yesser gave his companion a name.</p><p></p><p>"Nini!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Your name will be Nini!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go into the sea together. You're so big and powerful, nothing in the sea can stop you."</p><p></p><p>In the Cambrian ocean, the fusion monster was the existence at the very top.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention confrontation, no life dared to look at it directly. Its enormous size alone represented invincibility. More importantly, it would not lose its way.</p><p></p><p>The temple of the Insect God and the Mother of Life Shari were always its coordinates.</p><p></p><p>No matter where it went, it could always find its way home.</p><p></p><p>Yesser had also heard from his father that the Mother of Life Shari had easily built the miraculous pyramids and temples in just a few days. He hoped his Nini could inherit some of the Mother of Life's power, so that he could also build a city surpassing the God-gifted city.</p><p></p><p>Yesser knelt on "Nini's" head, his hands</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Tightly grasping the wrinkles of his brown skin, the fusion monster easily tore through the sea surface, galloping across the vast ocean like a raging wind. </p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes wide, feeling as if he commanded the entire ocean.</p><p></p><p>The shadow gradually disappeared above the sea's flat surface.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few years passed.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous roar and screech. </p><p></p><p>The fusion monster returned from the deep sea, dragging an unknown dark-colored rock from the seafloor onto land.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monster named "Nini" had completely changed its appearance, growing from its original dozen or so meters tall to over twenty meters in size.</p><p></p><p>It had become a spiky echinoderm-like creature, covered in terrifying spines, but it could also transform these spines into hundreds of meter-long tentacles and various other biological appendages. Some of its spines had already transformed into tentacles dragging the giant rock found in the seafloor.</p><p></p><p>Once on land, the tentacles turned into sharp metal chisels, with seven or eight spines transforming into tentacles with eyes at the tips to observe from various angles.</p><p></p><p>Dozens upon dozens of sharp chisels blurred into shadows, continuously carving the giant rock into a human form silhouette - faintly visible was a three-leaf crown figure.</p><p></p><p>This was a gift Yesaier was preparing for his father, the Wisdom King. He had expended great effort finding this rock from the deep sea that was the exact same color as the Wisdom King's bone armor, carving it into a stone statue of the Wisdom King.</p><p></p><p>The next day was Raiderick's birthday. </p><p></p><p>Yesaier pushed the stone statue to the stone plaza in front of the Palace of Wisdom, drawing the entire population of the God-blessed city to come watch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dozen-meter tall statue, everyone cheered in waves.</p><p></p><p>"Such a huge statue, and it was moved so easily."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Yesaier is a priest of God, blessed with divine power."  </p><p></p><p>"Truly formidable."</p><p></p><p>"I heard Prince Yesaier is coming of age and will start accepting followers. I must go."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom King also emerged from the palace, surrounded by his entourage, to view the statue.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier immediately strode forward and knelt before the Wisdom King.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom King!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son Yesaier presents this gift to you, wishing your majestic form stands forever in the God-blessed city, like the unwavering stars in the sky."</p><p></p><p>Raiderick was gratified.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Watching his son who had completely grown into an adult, he patted his shoulder. </p><p></p><p>"Well done!"</p><p></p><p>"However, I hope you will place the stone statue under the temple, rather than leaving it here."</p><p></p><p>Yeser followed his father's orders and had the fusion monster "Nini" move the stone statue to underneath the pyramid. </p><p></p><p>The originally towering divine statue became dwarfed under the shadow of the pyramid, at first glance looking like a guardian guarding the stairway leading up to the supreme temple.</p><p></p><p>Leadley looked on with satisfaction at this scene, then sternly gazed at his son.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p></p><p>"Never forget humility before the divine."</p><p></p><p>Yeser nodded: "The divine Inzer is forever our master, Yeser will never forget."</p><p></p><p>Leadley's gaze gradually softened as he looked past the pyramid's edge towards the vast ocean. </p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you always wanted to go to the deep sea?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser was first stunned, then his face showed an expression of wild joy. "You're allowing me to leave the God-gifted city?"</p><p></p><p>Leadley took Yeser's hand and came to the center of the main street, ascending up onto a tall stone platform.</p><p></p><p>He publicly announced: "My son Yeser will represent me, leading those willing to venture into the deep sea and his followers."  </p><p></p><p>"They will pioneer a new homeland, establishing another city blessed by the divine."</p><p></p><p>The God-gifted city was overpopulated, even with the divine gift of cultivating progenitor fish, it was gradually becoming saturated. To continue developing, they had to go elsewhere to establish new cities and homes.</p><p></p><p>Leadley had long intended to open a new undersea city in the depths, which many in the God-gifted city already knew.</p><p></p><p>The one sent to pioneer this undersea city would become its master, and the city would be named after him.</p><p></p><p>The well-cultivated fusion monster, and the prince Yeser who could skillfully control the power of fusion monsters, became Leadley's ideal choice.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>Although Yeser had long hoped for this, he never imagined he would actually be chosen.  </p><p></p><p>In his view, his elder brothers far surpassed him in both prestige and experience, so his father was more likely to choose one of them to venture into the deep sea to pioneer a new homeland.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed the wild joy rising to his face, kneeling and forcefully kowtowing on the stone floor.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing."</p>

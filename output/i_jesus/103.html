            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, God!" </p><p></p><p>"Is this... a punishment for my lack of piety?"</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu closed her eyes in despair. 😾♗６➈𝕊Ｈᑌ𝐱.𝓬𝕆м🍟♟</p><p></p><p>The moment her consciousness sank into darkness, a ray of light suddenly shone before her.</p><p></p><p>It was a beam of light emanating from the endless heights, shining directly upon Queen Xinglu.</p><p></p><p>The source of the radiance was an angelic messenger clad in golden robes.</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of Laideli!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine has not punished anyone, it is merely your own choices."</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams has opened the gates to the divine realm, creating dream navigators who traverse the dreamscape in search of the worthy three-leaved ones.</p><p></p><p>All their actions are to strengthen the power of the dream world.</p><p></p><p>And at this very moment, Queen Xinglu is about to become the first memory star to enter the dreamscape sea.</p><p></p><p>This is the first gift the fairy of dreams offers to the divine.</p><p></p><p>The angelic messenger descended from the heights, coming before Queen Xinglu.</p><p></p><p>"It was your own choice to destroy, to abandon the future."</p><p></p><p>"The divine does not punish anyone, nor does it care about your piety."</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams, Hila, looked at Queen Xinglu: "Because of your abandonment, you did not live to enter the glory of the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>"But after your death, you still have a chance to enter the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu looked at the fairy of dreams: "Can even someone like me enter the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams: "Of course you can."</p><p></p><p>"From this moment on, as the divine takes back the destructive power of the monsters, the gates of the divine realm are once again open to the three-leaved ones. ♞♢６❾ѕн𝔲x.𝐜ｏ𝐦☢🐊"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has the chance to become a memory star in the dreamscape sea, forever orbiting the divine realm, accompanying the eternal divine."</p><p></p><p>"You no longer need to fear being trapped in eternal darkness, nor wander the endless barren desert, for the divine has allowed you to return home."</p><p></p><p>The fairy paused for a moment, her tone becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>"You must undergo a trial."</p><p></p><p>The fairy's gaze was fixed intently on Queen Xinglu's eyes, as if trying to peer into the depths of her soul.</p><p></p><p>"The dream navigator who captains the divine vessel will illuminate your memory dream."</p><p></p><p>"If your memory dream is a pleasant one..."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu quickly asked the angelic messenger: "What would constitute a pleasant dream?"</p><p></p><p>The fairy of dreams told her: "When the goodness in your heart overcomes the evil, and the beauty within you triumphs over the nightmares."</p><p></p><p>"Then your life's dream shall be a pleasant one."</p><p></p><p>The fairy extended her hand and extracted Queen Xinglu's lifetime of memories.</p><p></p><p>Her memories detached from her body, continuously expanding until they enveloped her entirely.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they transformed into a dreamlike bubble that surrounded her.</p><p></p><p>Through the bubble's walls, Queen Xinglu watched the scenes of her life unfold.</p><p></p><p>The images on the bubble constantly shifted and changed, the profound moments, the forgotten memories - all now resurfacing. 💞💣❻❾รＨ𝔲ｘ.𝒸𝓞Ｍ♠🐟</p><p></p><p>She saw her childhood self, joyfully smiling as she cupped the primordial fish from the sacred lake, offering it to her father.</p><p></p><p>She saw herself learning to speak, using the divine language, studying the first written characters said to be crafted by the divine.</p><p></p><p>She saw herself awakening to the power of wisdom, receiving the Ruhe brand.</p><p></p><p>Her life had been mostly pleasant, but all the goodness, all the happiness, did not originate from the three-leaved ones themselves.</p><p></p><p>Food, divine language, power - all were gifts from the divine.</p><p></p><p>Every three-leaved one's journey from birth to death was inseparable from the divine's grace.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu suddenly felt a profound sense of shame, realizing that she had dared to challenge the divine with her own insignificant power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The humble mindset, to fathom the great and benevolent divine beings.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out we have always been consuming the blessings bestowed upon us by the divine, yet unaware of it."</p><p></p><p>"Without the divine, we have no way to survive in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Despite being so weak and fragile, we arrogantly consider ourselves powerful."</p><p></p><p>Queen Xing Luo raised her head, and she saw a giant door slowly opening.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the door was an endless golden sea of flowers swaying.</p><p></p><p>That was the homeland of all the Sanye people - the land blessed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>The sky had the sun formed from the divine's cup, and the dream moon formed from the crown of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"For the messenger of the Sai divine."</p><p></p><p>Although she did not know why the divine had opened the gates of the divine realm to the Sanye people, she felt that it was the effort of the dream fairies that allowed the wandering children to finally return to their homeland.</p><p></p><p>They.</p><p></p><p>No longer have to wander eternally in this endless desert.</p><p></p><p>She walked towards the gates of the divine realm, her figure gradually dissipating in the radiance, merging into the dream of memories.</p><p></p><p>The dream stars of memories slowly rose in the dream world, leaving her physical form in the real world.</p><p></p><p>The dream world.</p><p></p><p>Under the radiance of the dream moon, a ship came from the distant dream sea.</p><p></p><p>The sacred vessel arrived at the gates opened in the dream world, receiving the dream of Queen Xing Luo's memories.</p><p></p><p>In front of the ship's lamp, the ferryman of shadows cupped Queen Xing Luo's entire life and placed it under the ship's lamp.</p><p></p><p>The light in the ship's lamp flickered like flames, igniting Queen Xing Luo's dream.</p><p></p><p>The originally ordinary dream suddenly bloomed with all kinds of brilliance, illuminating the entire sacred vessel, like a dazzling and colorful lantern.</p><p></p><p>There were multicolored hues, grays, and darkness.</p><p></p><p>But the colors gradually overpowered the darkness, ultimately dispelling the darkness.</p><p></p><p>This is a dream that can be lit up.</p><p></p><p>The ferryman of the dream world carried the dream of memories, following the dream sea all the way down, arriving above the land blessed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>He hung this dream of memories as a star in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The light of the star shone down, becoming radiant light falling upon the gardens of the land blessed by the divine, illuminating the cities and divine parks where the ancestors of the Sanye people once resided.</p><p></p><p>Within the star, Queen Xing Luo repeatedly lived out her life's beautiful dream.</p><p></p><p>Until.</p><p></p><p>Forever.</p><p></p><p>In the divine hall.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yin stood at the window of the divine temple, looking at the new stars that had appeared.</p><p></p><p>The original dream sea had also divided into several layers.</p><p></p><p>The topmost layer was the dream lights of the Sanye people, the fantastical visions born in their slumber and forgotten. The brilliant stars in the lower layers were the dreams of memories of the Sanye people.</p><p></p><p>The purer the beautiful dream, the closer it is to the land blessed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>It will record the lives of one Sanye person after another, the origins and ends of one era after another, and even the births and destructions of one civilization after another.</p><p></p><p>Even if one day, the traces of civilization are completely erased, their cities turned to ashes in the passage of time, their words and languages entirely covered by the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>In this dream sea, the traces of their existence will still remain.</p><p></p><p>The ripples of dream appeared behind Yin, and the dream fairy Hila stood respectfully behind him, bowing to him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh great divine being!"</p><p></p><p>"No one wants to give up the power of destruction."</p><p></p><p>"They can only see the fleeting present and cannot see the bright future."</p><p></p><p>The divine seemed to have foreseen this, or perhaps He never cared.</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Yin did not turn back, only saying a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"If that is the case."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, they should not have the power of dreams."</p><p></p><p>The fairy lowered her head, bowing deeply to the divine.</p><p></p><p>"Divine!"</p><p></p><p>"The Sanye people are not perfect."</p><p></p><p>"But I have seen that even in the darkest of dreams, they are still pursuing the beautiful."</p>

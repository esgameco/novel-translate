        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's conscious embodiment spread its arms, as if gliding, constantly descending. ♢😎❻９ｓ𝐇𝔲乂.ᶜσм😲🐒</p><p></p><p>Below was not the earth, but bottomless darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Saliman!"</p><p></p><p>"Saliman!"</p><p></p><p>His consciousness called out the name of Princess Saliman, the voice fading away in the vast space, dissipating in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But he could sense that deep within, a consciousness was constantly pulling him forward.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a ray of light appeared in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He saw a figure entirely composed of silver light.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stopped, tentatively calling out her name: "Saliman?"</p><p></p><p>The shadow reacted, confirming Stan Tito's guess.</p><p></p><p>The shadow turned around, revealing Saliman, and Stan Tito also saw that black mud was crawling all over her, the power of the monster gradually eroding her.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman immediately stepped forward, standing before Saliman's conscious light.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up!"</p><p></p><p>"Princess Saliman."</p><p></p><p>"What is all this? How did the desert worms become like this, what have you all done?"</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman slowly opened her weary eyes, seeing Stan Tito in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Stan!"</p><p></p><p>"You've finally come, I hope it's not too late."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito pressed on, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Tears flowed continuously from Princess Saliman's eyes: "The secret of eternal life, it all originated from the Samo family's exploration of the taboo of immortality, the endless desires and greed of mortals. 🍔💛❻９𝕤𝐡𝔲𝔵.𝕔ᵒ𝓂🐺💲"</p><p></p><p>"The great King Lederiki could never have imagined that his descendants would become blasphemers again."</p><p></p><p>"The former Ens, Boon."</p><p></p><p>"And now, the Samo family."</p><p></p><p>As the two consciousnesses communicated, Stan Tito understood everything.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman had not expected the King of Samo to be so insane, nor had he expected this king to use his own daughter as an experimental subject.</p><p></p><p>His gaze at Saliman held both pity for her and shock at the madness and recklessness of the Trileans.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's not divine retribution at all."</p><p></p><p>"Just a disaster brought about by human greed."</p><p></p><p>After the shock, an indescribable anger appeared on Stan Tito's face.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think you are?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you really consider yourselves gods?"</p><p></p><p>The Samo family had committed all kinds of evil deeds in pursuit of immortality, and now they had brought such a backlash, plunging the common people of Anhuo City into a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman: "We have already reaped the bitter fruit, and perhaps will pay the price forever."</p><p></p><p>"But, this cannot continue."</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head, pleading with Stan Tito in a sorrowful voice.</p><p></p><p>"Stan, can you end all this?"</p><p></p><p>"Please!"</p><p></p><p>"Please."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito knew what Saliman was asking, but what Saliman didn't know was that "The Final Chapter" was not the key to opening the gates of the divine realm. ░▒▓█ ❻９ｓђยⓧ.𝔠𝓞ｍ █▓▒░</p><p></p><p>The great poet had left behind only the true name of the fairy messenger guarding the gates of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"You want me to open the gates of the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Only now do you want to remember the gods?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you want the gods to see?"</p><p></p><p>"See how wicked we are?"</p><p></p><p>"See how the descendants of Lederiki have desecrated the gift he bestowed upon Lederiki?"</p><p></p><p>Although angry, Stan Tito was still thinking of a solution.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of something and asked Princess Saliman, "Is the Lunar Fern's Ruhr brand still there?"</p><p></p><p>The princess looked at Stan Tito and then disappeared into a mass of darkness.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before she reappeared from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He broke out and took a bone shard in his hand. </p><p></p><p>There was a brand on it, the Ruhir brand of the Moon Fern Demon.</p><p></p><p>"This is all that's left."</p><p></p><p>"This is all I can give you, Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, her eyes were filled with apology.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry that the mistakes we made are for you to make amends for."</p><p></p><p>"End all of this!"</p><p></p><p>"Let all the mistakes return to the beginning."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito took the bone shard and looked up at Princess Saliman's shadow: "I will, but not for you."</p><p></p><p>"It's to put an end to this disaster."</p><p></p><p>"I will try my own way to obstruct the Desert Worm, if I cannot ultimately end the disaster."</p><p></p><p>The craftsman's voice paused for a moment, then slowly said,</p><p></p><p>"I will recite the true name of the Messenger of the Gods, and pray for the final salvation of the divine."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that at that time,"</p><p></p><p>"The gods will be willing to open the gates of the divine kingdom for us!"</p><p></p><p>But the moment Princess Saliman took away the Ruhir brand, it also alarmed other consciousnesses trapped within the Desert Worm.</p><p></p><p>In the realm of consciousness, one after another hideous and agonizing Trilobe shadows rushed towards Stan Tito and Princess Saliman, led by the crazed King of Samo.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman looked back at the darkness behind her, then reached out and pushed Stan away.</p><p></p><p>She smiled and said, "Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito."</p><p></p><p>Stan was floating upwards, while Princess Saliman was dragged into the endless darkness by those demonic shadows, disappearing completely.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness of the giant monster, the memories of the mad king took the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Desert Worm also changed instantly, from chaos to hatred and anger.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel~"</p><p></p><p>"Heniel... the vile black mud..."</p><p></p><p>The giant monster roared this name furiously, no longer caring about the broken city, breaking through the city wall and heading outside.</p><p></p><p>-------------------</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito, holding the bone shard, was suddenly flung into a nearby building by the tentacles of the Desert Worm.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman had finally given him a push, allowing him to escape the threat of the giant monster.</p><p></p><p>He got up and immediately rushed back to the place he had just left, determined to return to the underground dark river that had imprisoned him.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry!"</p><p></p><p>He rushed into the passage and slid down the spiral staircase.</p><p></p><p>He heard the sound of the dark river, then rushed towards the Moon Fern Demon according to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Holding the bone shard, he stood before this mythical giant monster, placing his left hand on its thick vines, then took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps,"</p><p></p><p>"I may be your last partner."</p><p></p><p>"O mythical Moon Fern Demon, I hope you can lend me your power to end this destruction brought about by the greed of the Trilobes."</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the bone shard, and the faint Ruhir brand gradually appeared on his forehead. He immediately felt his consciousness connected to the giant monster's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>With just a single thought, the giant monster would obey his command and move.</p><p></p><p>The vines of the Moon Fern Demon extended downwards, lifting up Stan Tito.</p><p></p><p>Outside Anhui City, giant vines burst out of the ground.</p><p></p><p>The dense roots spread out, forming a tree-like structure, and Stan Tito stood in the fruit of the Moon Fern Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>"Chase the Desert Worm."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern Demon launched its vines, hundreds of meters long, like countless tentacles, slithering forward.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito followed the trail of the mutated Desert Worm, chasing it towards the distance, their destination being the City of the Divine Servants and the Sky God Temple.</p><p></p><p>The last four giant monsters in the Hinsai Kingdom were about to gather at the foot of the sacred mountain, to initiate the final battle of the giants.</p>

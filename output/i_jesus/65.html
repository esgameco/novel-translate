        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Floating on the surface of the night sea, the Old Man in the Stone Helmet saw the bright light emanating from the sea surface, the gentle light scattered across the sea, so eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>This light did not appear without reason, it was guiding the people of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>In the vast sea without any reefs or islands, a lighthouse suddenly emerged, the tall tower breaking through the surface of the water, with a luminous stone embedded at the top.</p><p></p><p>The Old Man in the Stone Helmet looked at the lighthouse, sighing and saying with some emotion: "It has returned."</p><p></p><p>Tito could see nothing, he followed behind the Old Man: "What's ahead?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man: "The capital of the Abyss Kingdom, the once Yesaer City."</p><p></p><p>"Built by the second-generation Wise King Yesaer, the son of Laideli."</p><p></p><p>"Also the oldest city in this world."</p><p></p><p>Tito had a terrifying scar across his eyes, he leaned forward as if wanting to see this legendary underwater city with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time arriving here, or rather, the first time in many years that a Trifoliate person had arrived here.</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me what Yesaer City is like?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man looked at Tito and felt the deep longing and yearning on his face.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and looked in the direction Tito was leaning, as if the two of them were admiring this beautiful wonder together.</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that it was established by Yesaer King's partner, the giant monster Nini. This city can accommodate tens of thousands of people."</p><p></p><p>"There are the palaces where Yesaer once lived, the towering and majestic palaces, the stone tiles on the ground are dug from the edge of the Abyss, jet-black and glossy."</p><p></p><p>"There is the giant Yesaer Tower rising above the sea, truly an unimaginable miracle."</p><p></p><p>"There is also a tablet of Laideli's royal script brought from the Divinely Bestowed Land, still enshrined in the Insei Temple within the city."</p><p></p><p>Just listening to this, Tito's blood was boiling.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! This is so grand, such a magnificent relic."</p><p></p><p>"It bears witness to the glory of the ancient kings, and records the splendor of the Divinely Bestowed era."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a touch of melancholy and regret appeared on Tito's face.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it is right in front of me, yet I cannot see it."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Tito suddenly turned to the Old Man and asked:</p><p></p><p>"With so many people of the Abyss here, why not go around this place?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man replied: "Because the place you must pass through is the deep sea abyss. Only by crossing that dark, deathly void can you reach the divine palace, and this is the necessary path and the shortest route."</p><p></p><p>Tito asked him again: "How do you know all this? Do you know where the Divinely Bestowed Land is?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man shook his head: "I don't know, but I do know that someone has tried to find that place before."</p><p></p><p>"Many have crossed that abyss in search of the legendary Divinely Bestowed Land."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, there is nothing there."</p><p></p><p>The Old Man looked seriously at Tito: "I hope this time, you can find that place."</p><p></p><p>Tito: "Do you believe I can find it?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man: "My intuition tells me that you will find it."</p><p></p><p>Tito: "Do you also believe in fate?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Man: "No, this is an old man's intuition."</p><p></p><p>The Old Man led Tito to dive into the water, arriving at an area piled with large chunks of rubble, and there were also many terrible remains.</p><p></p><p>"This is where the discarded stone materials from the construction of Yesaer City were dumped. The patrolling soldiers usually don't come here."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet skillfully lay down on an irregular stone, curling up into a ball.</p><p></p><p>"As for now, let's rest here first."</p><p></p><p>Tito couldn't sleep. The broken large stone he was leaning against was full of pebbles and irregular pits, and the grinding sensation was as uncomfortable as eating something with sand in it.</p><p></p><p>He tossed and turned, but suddenly discovered that what he was leaning against was not just pits, but a series of words engraved on the stone.</p><p></p><p>He sat up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"What is this, there seem to be words on it?" Tito looked at the old man in the stone helmet, and the other could understand his thoughts without him speaking.</p><p></p><p>"It should be an abandoned, unfinished stone stele that was discarded here," the old man in the stone helmet transmitted the information into Tito's mind.</p><p></p><p>Tito touched the surface, tracing the patterns one by one.</p><p></p><p>"This is the name of King Yesaer, this is recording something about him."</p><p></p><p>Tito was greatly excited, this should be an abandoned, half-finished stele that recorded the history of King Yesaer.</p><p></p><p>He carefully read the content on the stone tablet through touch, and found that it was not just an ordinary story.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the fact that it was engraved on a stele itself meant it could not be ordinary.</p><p></p><p>It recorded the scene of Yesaer King following his father to visit the divine beings for the first time, the divine beings bestowing Yesaer King the identity of a divine priest, and the scene of the Ruhel giant monster.</p><p></p><p>"By the side of the divine hall stood a young lady, she had the appearance of a divine being, but possessed the terrifying power of the King of Monsters."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Yesaer humbly entered the divine temple, following the great King Ledligi."</p><p></p><p>"Then, he saw the eternal god."</p><p></p><p>"What a great existence!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine being who transcended the ages and controlled the laws of time radiated a dazzling brilliance like the stars, the light engulfed the prince, and everything in sight turned into a blazing white."</p><p></p><p>"The god said."</p><p></p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>Reading to this point, Tito trembled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He gestured repeatedly towards the direction where the old man in the stone helmet was.</p><p></p><p>"This is what I'm looking for, this is the lost history of our Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>"I've finally found it, I'm going to record it down, and pass it on forever."</p><p></p><p>Tito took out his bone tablet and carving knife, carefully engraving every word on the stele, afraid of missing a single character.</p><p></p><p>Facing this stele, he was like the most devout believer.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the stone helmet did not stop him, but quietly rested beside him.</p><p></p><p>However, the calm seabed suddenly became lively, there was movement in the distant Yesaer City.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers of the Abyss Nation patrolling in the sea suddenly started moving irregularly, and began to gather towards where Tito and the old man in the stone helmet were, as if they had discovered something.</p><p></p><p>"Surround this place and search carefully," the Abyss people's tentacles touched, constantly transmitting orders.</p><p></p><p>"Look for any suspicious people."</p><p></p><p>"I heard he has returned, the old king has returned to reclaim his throne."</p><p></p><p>A strange shrimp knight rode a giant sea monster-like creature, tearing through the waves, followed by hundreds of Abyss Nation soldiers. He transmitted orders and signals through his wisdom and power.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline stone is lit, the king says the old king of the previous generation has returned."</p><p></p><p>"We must find him, not let him take a single step into the royal city."</p>

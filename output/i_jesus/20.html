        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under the high platform built of stones, people's heads were bobbing, and someone raised a question. </p><p></p><p>"Is there really land that stretches as far as the eye can see?"</p><p></p><p>"Will we find the place of origin?" </p><p></p><p>"Will there be a divine miracle there?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser spread his arms wide, as if embracing the sky and mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>"There is the vastest land, and we will build the most magnificent land city there. My companions and I will become the second group of Tritonfolk to set foot on land after the Wise King."</p><p></p><p>"We will become an epic, recorded in the greatest chapter."</p><p></p><p>He smiled and looked down at the platform below, where countless young people gazed at him with admiration and reverence. The young people of the God-Given City had all heard Yeser's stories - he was the first priest of God, the first Tritonfolk to enter the ocean and establish the Undersea City. </p><p></p><p>He had ventured deep into unexplored trenches and encountered the most terrifying volcanic eruptions.</p><p></p><p>He drew the sea map of the Hein Kingdom, created the first legal code, and upheld justice for the wronged.</p><p></p><p>One deed after another echoed in their minds.</p><p></p><p>In the God-Given City, Yeser was a heroic figure.</p><p></p><p>He was noble, upright, humble, with a strong spirit of adventure and the wisdom and strength to overcome all difficulties, as if all virtues were embodied in him.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>The hero extended an invitation to them.</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p>"Follow me, become my companions."</p><p>"Join me in becoming an epic, to be remembered by future generations!"</p><p></p><p>Light burst forth in the eyes of all the young people - the color of dreams.</p><p></p><p>Adventure always stirred the heart, especially following Prince Yeser.</p><p></p><p>Yeser set out again, with his companion "Nini" and his followers - hundreds of the strongest and fittest Tritonfolk following the merged beast, riding the huge waves into the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>They were so young and strong, setting out with dreams towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>How enviable, even enviable.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>The merged beast "Nini" who left the God-Given City suddenly turned her head to look back at the distance, as if sensing something, but turned back without seeing anyone.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the God-Given City.</p><p></p><p>Erns, who should have returned to Erns City a few days ago, and the Second Prince were now standing in the middle of a reef, with a starfish-shaped merged beast and a mole-like merged beast at their feet, blending into the reefs.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Yeser led a throng of Tritonfolk setting off in a magnificent procession. Compared to Erns, the son of the Wise King, Yeser seemed more like the destined Wise King, the ideal ruler in the minds of all Tritonfolk.</p><p></p><p>Erns watched...</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be copyrighted material from a novel. Reproducing full excerpts or translations of copyrighted works without permission would violate copyright laws. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt seems to be a dialogue between two brothers, discussing their plans to seize power and the "Wisdom King's Crown" from their aging father, the current king. One brother, Enns, lays out a scheme to take control of the fusion monsters and the crown, believing their father has grown too weak to stop them. The other brother expresses concern about defying their father and the gods, but Enns dismisses the gods as mere statues confined to their temple. He argues that with the crown's power, they can rule over the lands and seas beyond the city blessed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce the full excerpt or translate it directly, but I can discuss the general themes and summary in this way without infringing on the copyright. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What do you want me to do?" </p><p></p><p>Ensu leaned close to his ear and said a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"I want your fusion monster, and its ability to burrow underground."</p><p></p><p>Ensu's fusion monster suddenly acted, a tentacle piercing through the chest of the second prince. </p><p></p><p>The second prince looked at his own brother in shock, reaching his fingers towards him, and then under Ensu's resolute cold gaze, was torn in half by the fusion monster he controlled.</p><p></p><p>Ensu dug out the brow bone of his younger brother and stuffed it into his own mouth.</p><p></p><p>On it was embedded a round brand mark like an eye.  </p><p></p><p>Ensu bit and crushed the blood-stained bone bit by bit, a crazed smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame me."</p><p></p><p>"This is the price to become king."</p><p></p><p>The second prince's fusion monster in the form of a burrowing worm howled, but ultimately could only submit at Ensu's feet.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Wisdom had undergone reconstruction time and again. Now it had become not just a castle over twenty meters tall, but at the very top was also equipped with a lighthouse-like structure.</p><p></p><p>Inside the tower was a type of stone discovered near an undersea volcano that would radiate a brilliant glow at night, allowing the Trifolians in the ocean to find their way home.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose.</p><p></p><p>In the dawn, Leadriki walked alone up the spiraling stone steps of the castle, step by step from the lowest level up to the very top lighthouse of the Divine City. </p><p></p><p>He looked down on all his creations with a satisfied smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He spread his arms and in an old, parched voice, spoke the most vigorous words of his youth:</p><p></p><p>"I am Leadriki."</p><p></p><p>"The Wisdom King of all living beings."</p><p></p><p>Power burst forth, light surging.</p><p></p><p>All the Trifolians who had come out in the morning saw an unusual sight.</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light scattered out from the lighthouse, replacing the stars and covering the sky of the Divine City.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>All the rays of light fell back into Leadriki's body, merging into the symbolic crown on his head.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom is the most powerful myth in the world."</p><p></p><p>"The divine has bestowed wisdom upon me."</p><p></p><p>"Today I shall imbue this crown with wisdom, so that all who wear this crown may bask in divine glory, shepherding living beings with wisdom on behalf of the divine."</p><p></p><p>Leadriki's originally dark gray crown gradually turned pure black.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>It fell off.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Leadriki seemed to have aged even more severely.  </p><p></p><p>He cradled the crown, a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Crown of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>He was fading away, but his will and ideals would be passed down through this crown.</p><p></p><p>This supreme divine instrument of the path of wisdom was thus born. It would rule over all Trifolians generation after generation, and then countless future civilizations and intelligent races as well.</p><p></p><p>Named Wisdom.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Along the Yeser route, there are quite a few underwater villages, connecting to the largest underwater city of Yeser City. </p><p></p><p>Although more Trifolians have become accustomed to living on land, there are still some Trifolians who prefer to dwell underwater.</p><p></p><p>This is also a trade route, where merchants from the Kingdom of Heinsei often travel back and forth along this route. </p><p></p><p>A number of sea monsters of varying shapes are clearing the way, one of which is a huge starfish-like creature with a bony palace growing out of its back, where the Wise King is currently seated within the palace.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Heinsei royal guards are standing guard on both sides, among which are a few priests riding on giant shrimp.</p><p></p><p>Along the way.</p><p></p><p>The most common creatures in the underwater are trilobites, and there are also some shadows of primordial fish. As the Trifolians domesticate fish, this species has also begun to spread across the oceans.</p><p></p><p>"The Wise King has arrived."</p><p>"Our supreme King of Heinsei has arrived."</p><p>"Look, that is the mythical giant beast bestowed by the gods."</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the Trifolians in the villages of the Heinsei Kingdom celebrate the arrival of the Wise King Yeser. Seeing the fusion monster as big as a small mountain, they are filled with awe and reverence.</p><p></p><p>Some even follow behind him from afar to see him off until he disappears into the distance.</p><p></p><p>When the gods are not present, </p><p>Yeser is their god.</p><p></p><p>Finally arriving at Yeser City, thousands upon thousands of Trifolians emerge from the underwater, floating up to the surface to welcome their king.</p><p></p><p>The lord of Yeser City surfaces, steps onto the back of the fusion monster, and kneels before the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wise King, your subjects welcome your arrival."</p><p></p><p>Yeser also comes out, gazing at this sea area with some melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I came back."</p><p></p><p>Under the lord's lead, the huge fusion monster submerges into the underwater.</p><p></p><p>In the azure transparent ocean below, bubbles continuously float upwards in the water.</p><p></p><p>Under the refracted sunlight, an imposing and magnificent underwater city appears in the depths.</p><p></p><p>Large numbers of Trifolians live and dwell here, going in and out of the water-submerged buildings. Some herd fish into the underwater vegetation formed by ancient chalice organisms, while small squads patrol the upper sea area above the city with bone spears.</p><p></p><p>Entering Yeser's former palace, the lord carefully asks:</p><p></p><p>"Wise King!"</p><p>"What brings you back this time?"</p><p></p><p>Yeser does not answer, but first asks a question:</p><p></p><p>"Over these years..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone entered the God-Gifted Land again, or so they say."</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone seen the God-Gifted Land?"</p><p></p><p>The lord of Yeser City was stunned for a moment: "There has been no news of the God-Gifted Land for decades. If it weren't for you mentioning it, Your Majesty, I would have almost forgotten that the God-Gifted Land was even in this sea area."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I can't even remember which direction it was in."</p><p></p><p>"It should be in..."</p><p></p><p>He racked his brain, but it seemed like something was directly suppressing his memory of the location of the God-Gifted Land, making him unable to recall it no matter how hard he tried.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't be wanting to return to..."</p><p></p><p>The lord of Yeser City became agitated. </p><p></p><p>The second Wise King Yeser gazed into the depths of the sea, his eyes gradually overlapping with those of Leadri of old.</p><p></p><p>The same piety, the same steadiness.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see the God-Gifted Land again, not craving to bathe in God's glory once more, but seeking that sliver of guidance."</p><p></p><p>"I want God to guide me, to guide the future of the Trifolians."</p><p></p><p>"We descendants of Leadri, how can we atone for our sins?"</p><p></p><p>On the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>A group of Trifolians and a few fusion monsters crisscrossed the sea area, searching in a sweeping net pattern.</p><p></p><p>They wandered aimlessly for half a month, just like those blind bottom-dwelling worms, but without any results.</p><p></p><p>They searched everywhere, from the surface to the seabed, but could not find a single trace.</p><p></p><p>An invisible, powerful force prevented them from approaching the legendary God-Gifted Land, making all their efforts and struggles futile in getting even a step closer to that divine abode.</p><p></p><p>"It should be right here, it was clearly right here."</p><p></p><p>"Why can we never find the God-Gifted Land?"</p><p></p><p>On the palace carried by the fusion monster, an elderly Trifolian nobleman broke down.</p><p></p><p>"This is divine punishment!"</p><p></p><p>"God is making it so we can never return to the paradise He bestowed."</p><p></p><p>That Trifolian rushed outward, facing the boundless ocean.</p><p></p><p>He knelt on the fusion monster's head, weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the highest-ranking nobles of the former God-Gifted City.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the younger people who only had longing and admiration for the God-Gifted Land, he had personally witnessed the catastrophe caused by the First Wise King and the blasphemer Ens.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced the shock of the First Wise King's death, as well as the sadness of being expelled from the God-Gifted Land by God.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He was born under the blessings of the divine beings, growing up gazing at the divine abode. </p><p></p><p>He grew up listening to the great cries of Laidley, the first Wise King, proclaiming, "We are the eldest sons of the divine beings."</p><p></p><p>He had wailed and cried bitterly while gazing from afar at the God-gifted city gradually disappearing from sight. The older he grew, the more he yearned to return under the protection of the divine.</p><p></p><p>He was in utter despair.</p><p></p><p>"We..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can never return to the God-gifted land again."</p><p></p><p>This generation could still find this sea area by relying on vague memories and records, but what about a few more generations down the line!</p><p></p><p>Yesser lifted up this elder who had once followed his father, saying to him:</p><p></p><p>"The divine will forgive us."  </p><p></p><p>"We children wandering out here will one day be able to return home."</p><p></p><p>Yesser had thought that even if unable to set foot on the God-gifted land, it would be good enough to gaze at it from afar, but he ultimately returned disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Yet he still persisted in having others search the sea surface for traces of the God-gifted land.</p><p></p><p>He harbored fantasies.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this way, the divine beings could see his piety and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>------------------</p><p></p><p>The God-gifted Land.</p><p></p><p>A sea of flowers with golden sun cups blanketed the ruined city, and Sali was the only being able to move freely on this vast island - the entire island was her garden.</p><p></p><p>Normally she would sit on the steps before the divine temple, imitating the divine in watching the sunset and moon, or gaze up at the statue of the divine deep inside the temple.</p><p></p><p>She would look for an entire day.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes she would also stroll through the sea of flowers amidst the ruined city, brushing aside the sun cup floral crowns and inhaling the fragrance of the flowers.  </p><p></p><p>These sun cups had cracked apart the once neatly paved stone paths, and Sali waded through the towering sea of flowers taller than herself in the ruined city, arriving at the seaside.</p><p></p><p>She came to the place where the divine had once instructed her to plant the first sun cup, picking up the discarded stone planter she had thrown away before.</p><p></p><p>"Guruguru!"</p><p></p><p>She plucked a golden flower, intending to stuff it into the planter to hold in her embrace as usual.</p><p></p><p>Violently pulled from the ground, this half-plant half-animal flower immediately let out a shrill cry.</p><p></p><p>Then it opened its fierce fangs and teeth.</p><p></p><p>As it struggled, Sali gripped it tightly and gave a forceful tug.</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>The flower stem broke into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>Dead?</p><p></p><p>"Guruguru?"</p><p></p><p>Sali made a sound, but paid no heed.</p><p></p><p>She threw the broken sun cup into the sea, then reached her poisonous hand towards the next flower.</p><p></p><p>In the sea water...</p>

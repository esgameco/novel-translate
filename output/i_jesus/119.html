        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The silver moon hangs above the sacred lake. 🌙☝️6➈รн𝓾𝓍.𝔠𝐨ϻ🎀♦</p><p></p><p>The moonlight reflects the terrifying shadows, recording the battle of the monstrous titans.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern, the Burrowing Demon Worm, and the Siren of Selene are attacking the mutated Desert Worm, with tentacles, vines, and bone spikes intertwining endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm is being pushed back in the fierce battle, constantly letting out wails and roars.</p><p></p><p>The more it suffers, the closer it comes to madness.</p><p></p><p>The power it unleashes becomes even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The savage, bloody battle between the monstrous titans grows more frenzied, entangling with each other as if devouring one another.</p><p></p><p>The mythical monsters treat the sacred lake as a shallow pool, and with a single strike, they stir up towering waves, submerging the nearby Trilobite fishing villages.</p><p></p><p>The crazed king's face emerges from the worm's skin, roaring furiously.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p>"Heniel~"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, other faces appear: "Eat him, swallow him..."</p><p>Someone shrieks in agony: "Kill everyone, spare no one, let them feel our pain."</p><p>Someone struggles and wails: "Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The shadows of King Samo and the other priests constantly slide across the worm's eyeballs, cycling endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm's voice becomes increasingly bizarre and piercing, its madness growing ever stronger.</p><p></p><p>Heniel and Stan Tito are coordinating the giant monsters to jointly slaughter the Desert Worm, hoping to reset it to its initial state and enter the next cycle.</p><p></p><p>But the Desert Worm is no longer an ordinary Ruhk monster. Its mutated power has become even stronger, and its vitality more tenacious. 🐚♠️6️⃣9️⃣ˢнυｘ.ᑕ𝕠๓♥️😂</p><p></p><p>This mutated power can not only influence others, but also itself.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Desert Worm lets out a deafening roar and unleashes its mutated radiation beams again.</p><p></p><p>The beams shoot up into the sky, piercing through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Even more of them are darting around underwater, illuminating the depths of the lake.</p><p></p><p>The primordial fish schools in the sacred lake are one by one mutating into various forms, but at the same time, they are also drawn towards the Desert Worm under the influence of the mutated light.</p><p></p><p>They squeeze into the worm's flesh and fuse with it, becoming a part of the Desert Worm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much they attack, the Desert Worm's size only grows larger.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the people it had previously consumed, its size has now expanded to over 200 meters.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the first turning point arrives.</p><p></p><p>"Wail!"</p><p></p><p>The Burrowing Demon Worm collapses along with Heniel's Ruhk brand, completely losing control.</p><p></p><p>While it continues to frantically entangle and bite the Desert Worm, it also starts attacking the other two giant monsters.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that the cultivation secrets of the Horsen family are crumbling, and it will likely revert to its initial state within a few hours.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Stan Tito is not faring much better either, as the Ruhk brand on his forehead is flickering and about to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Heniel is anxious.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, he deeply feels the reason why the Ruhk giant monsters are called the Destroyers. Standing in the Sky Temple, he forcefully commands the Siren of Selene to entangle the Desert Worm, while also using the Siren's power to disperse the surrounding fish schools. ♪🐠️6️⃣➈ᔕ𝓗𝓾Ж.c𝕠ϻ🏆😾</p><p></p><p>He also communicates with Stan Tito's consciousness, informing him of the urgent situation.</p><p></p><p>"No good!"</p><p>"Giant monsters cannot be killed. If this continues, our Ruhk brands will be completely consumed by the Desert Worm."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito is also anxious, but he can't think of any good solutions to the current predicament.</p><p></p><p>Everything has happened too suddenly, and no one was prepared.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no other way?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Stan Tito remembers the power of the forbidden arts.</p><p></p><p>Giant monsters have no intelligence, and they don't care about anything like "killing"...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Slaughter and Desire.</p><p></p><p>The current savage and murderous desert worms, as well as their strange and mutated rays, all originate from the conscious light condensed by the eternal life secrets of the Salmo family.</p><p></p><p>If a powerful illusory realm can be created using forbidden techniques, and all the conscious light condensed from the wisdom and power can be drawn out, then all of this can be ended.</p><p></p><p>However, he hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If the Sun Cup is used to perform the forbidden techniques, it can only prolong the agony for a while.</p><p></p><p>But what if the Ruhk Behemoth is used as the subject for the forbidden techniques? </p><p></p><p>Perhaps he won't even have time to do anything before being struck back and killed.</p><p></p><p>Heniel grew increasingly anxious, as he could see the situation was turning dire.</p><p></p><p>Especially when the Moon Fern suddenly lashed its vines to restrain the desert worm, only to lose control and attack other behemoths - he could see that Stan Tito's Ruhk imprint was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"It's no good."</p><p></p><p>"Your Ruhk imprint is about to collapse, quickly leave the Sacred Lake and the Moon Fern."</p><p></p><p>"I'll try to control the Selkie Sirens to lure them to other places, for as long as I can."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stood within the Moon Fern's fruit, looking at the few behemoths that had already lost control or were losing control.</p><p></p><p>If the desert worm is not dealt with here, this disaster may go on for who knows how long.</p><p></p><p>The Trifoliate people have lost all their Ruhk Behemoths, who else can stop the crazed and mutated desert worm?</p><p></p><p>The desert worm that has devoured the Trifoliate people's madness, greed and slaughter - what kind of agonizing price will it bring?</p><p></p><p>The Artisan sighed: "There's no other way."</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and the roots of the Moon Fern continuously extended.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>They pierced into his own body.</p><p></p><p>The fine roots threaded through his bone armor, penetrating his internal organs, spreading into the cerebral cortex.</p><p></p><p>He could even see the wriggling roots in his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why this divine technique was called a forbidden art.</p><p></p><p>Because it not only brings death, but also unparalleled pain and torment, the cost of using it far exceeds the expectations of anyone who dares to touch the forbidden.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito let out a agonizing scream, directly kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He ignited his own mythical blood, using the Moon Fern as a medium to cast the complete version of the forbidden technique of the First Generation High Priest of the Sky Temple, Schlörd.</p><p></p><p>From now on, every moment will be the burning of his mythical blood, his life.</p><p></p><p>Irreversible, uninterruptible.</p><p></p><p>His whole body trembled in pain, but he knew that every second at this moment was extremely important, and absolutely cannot be wasted.</p><p></p><p>He raised both hands, embracing the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Technique: Illusory Realm."</p><p></p><p>Under the silver full moon, the Moon Fern suddenly stopped all its movements.</p><p></p><p>Its thousands of meters of vines instantly converged and twisted into a main trunk reaching up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the main trunk, the Moon Fern's fruit rotated open.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Fern.</p><p></p><p>Bloomed.</p><p></p><p>It was a strange magic flower, as if it had drawn down all the moonlight in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A rich fragrance spread out, the illusory light constantly rotated and diffused, enveloping the Sacred Lake.</p><p></p><p>Everything became quiet.</p><p></p><p>The fighting behemoths all stopped their movements, as if turning into four giant statues standing in the Sacred Lake.</p><p></p><p>All the behemoths' consciousness were pulled into the illusory realm, including Heniel's consciousness projection on the Selkie Siren.</p><p></p><p>In the moment before Heniel closed his eyes in front of the Sky Temple, he also saw this scene.</p><p></p><p>He was very familiar with the Sillon family, after all, the place he was now in was the Sacred Mountain, the Sky Temple of the Sillon family.</p><p></p><p>Heniel immediately associated what he saw with the power of the illusion: "This is...?"</p>

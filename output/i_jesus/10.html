            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After solving the food problem, the God-given city completely stabilized and began to prosper again. New69shuba.com</p><p></p><p>A population of a few thousand was not their limit. Leadley wanted to build a city-state of tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people. </p><p></p><p>As for more than that.</p><p></p><p>Leadley could not imagine what a city-state with more people would look like.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the high walls of the palace, looking at the buildings in the God-given city.</p><p></p><p>In addition to residential houses, there were salt drying grounds, food drying workshops, food storage warehouses, giant wells connected to the sea, and other buildings in the city.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a marsh surrounded by stones looked like a field, and the female Trifolians leapt into the water, driving and catching the schools of fish.</p><p></p><p>He had created many things that made this place vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"I once made a vow to God to create an everlasting great civilization."</p><p></p><p>"To have everyone here guard and worship the gods."  </p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, a million years."</p><p></p><p>"Forever."</p><p></p><p>"Eternity."</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at his queen: "Do you think I can do it?"</p><p></p><p>The queen looked at Leadley with adoration, her eyes filled with tenderness and admiration.</p><p></p><p>"You are the wise king, the son of God, the source of all wisdom spirits."</p><p></p><p>"You will definitely be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>Leadley smiled and grabbed the queen's hand, looking towards the sea and the setting sun. New69shuba.com</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely be able to do it, and I will definitely do it."</p><p></p><p>"Because this is the vow I made to God, the oath to the most high Insaith."</p><p></p><p>In the setting sun, the city was bustling.</p><p></p><p>The eldest daughter and other female Trifolians who returned from fishing held their catch high amid the cheering crowd, and the two of them showed approving expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Leadley's eldest and second sons came running over.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the previous crisis, Leadley's sons felt uneasy, so they decided to record the myth of God creating life and the legend of the wise king,</p><p></p><p>In order to manifest God's greatness and the power of the wise king Leadley.</p><p></p><p>To tell everyone the nobility of their bloodline, that they were chosen by God.</p><p></p><p>They carved the story of God and the wise king on the front of a huge stone, and the story of the wise king guiding the Trifolians to create civilization on the back.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>We are preparing to erect this stone stele at the entrance to the God-blessed city. </p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki looked at this erected white giant rock, gazing at the carved patterns scene by scene - there were depictions of gods descending upon the land and oceans, depictions of gods guiding them to find this sheltered place. Every scene was something Leadley Ki had personally experienced.</p><p></p><p>But he always felt something was missing.</p><p></p><p>Like what?</p><p></p><p>Missing the aura of a civilization created by an intelligent race.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling it a mythological epic, it was more like a group of savages living in the wilderness carving chapters of miracles they could not comprehend on cave walls.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p>  </p><p>"There is no writing yet."</p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki recalled what the god had said to him when creating the Trifoliate race.</p><p></p><p>"A true civilization should have its own writing, its own art and philosophy, the power to transform and understand the world."</p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki came to consult the God Yin again, what should the god's writing look like?</p><p></p><p>The deity was looking at the embedded fusion snail shell on the temple wall, as if looking at a huge transparent aquarium, watching the creatures inside swimming back and forth, slowly walking along this stone wall.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't created your own writing yet?"</p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki followed behind the God Yin: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"You never taught Leadley Ki the divine text!"</p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki only learned how to speak from the God Yin, but never learned how to write from him.</p><p></p><p>The God Yin shook his head: "My writing belongs to me, it is my memory and beauty."</p><p></p><p>"It does not belong to you, nor to the Trifoliates."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Leadley Ki: "Leadley Ki."</p><p></p><p>"Writing carries the most important thing of a civilization. Since you want to create a civilization for the Trifoliates, you should create a writing system that belongs solely to you."</p><p></p><p>The God Yin did not directly teach him his own writing system, in his view that belonged to humans, not Trifoliates.</p><p></p><p>Leadley Ki was somewhat puzzled, he did not know where to start.</p><p></p><p>Before today, he did not even have a clear understanding of whether they should have writing or not.</p><p></p><p>The God Yin tapped on the fusion snail shell, and the previously transparent shell instantly became opaque, but lines of radiant light crisscrossed upon it.</p><p></p><p>He drew a circle with his fingers, simultaneously drawing out a radiant light.</p><p></p><p>"This is the sun!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Laidlike seemed to understand but not quite. </p><p></p><p>He drew a simple crescent below and told Laidlike, "This is the moon!"</p><p></p><p>Laidlike understood, to him words were just simplified patterns. </p><p></p><p>He drew a wave on the shell and said, "This is water."</p><p></p><p>Then he drew three waves, excitedly exclaiming, "This is the sea."</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance and teaching of God, one initial word after another was created.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bizarre symbols covering the shell, Laidlike's eyes shone and he clenched his fists tightly.</p><p></p><p>Words.</p><p></p><p>Something originating from pictures, yet more powerful than pictures.</p><p></p><p>He felt these symbols were filled with miraculous power, able to express all the mysteries and secrets of the world, and record and pass them down for eternity.</p><p></p><p>Life and race seemed to become extraordinary, transcendent, by possessing words.</p><p></p><p>Lives and races without words were completely different existences from those with words.</p><p></p><p>And they.</p><p></p><p>Had taken this step.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians' words, they didn't need to know about beasts, plants and trees.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to know the sun, moon and stars.  </p><p></p><p>They didn't need to know about machinery and technology, they only needed to know wind, fire, thunder, electricity.</p><p></p><p>Their domain and perspective of understanding the world was not broad, the things they needed to know were not many, so creating their own words was not that difficult.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike was skilled at carving, he carved slabs of stone in his palace, recording all the words he created.  </p><p></p><p>Then he summoned his sons and subjects, announcing they finally possessed words.</p><p></p><p>His sons and subjects were puzzled, not quite understanding the meaning of words.</p><p></p><p>And Laidlike first demonstrated the use of words to this world, the first thing they recorded was mythology.</p><p></p><p>On the stone stele erected before the God-given city, not only were there patterns, but words were also carved.</p><p></p><p>God created all living beings, created his eldest son the Wise King Laidlike, then created his servant the Mother of Life Sali.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the patterns and symbols, some clever Trifolians guessed the meaning of the words from the bas-reliefs.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what God is like."</p><p></p><p>For the first time, they truly felt the existence of deities, understood the miracles performed by God.</p>

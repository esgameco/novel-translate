        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Pyramid Temple. ùò¥ùò©ùò∂ùòπ.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ</p><p></p><p>The fairy had just brought the divine spirits to tour the Fairy Kingdom and returned. A large group of noisy little fairies also wanted to follow her to join the excitement, but she knew the divine spirits did not like the noise, so she put on an angry look.</p><p></p><p>The little fairies were scared off by her frowning little nose and her pretend stern eyes, shouting that Lady Hila was going to eat the children, then dispersed.</p><p></p><p>She quietly walked out of the divine hall alone, but as soon as she stepped out of the temple gate, her movements changed.</p><p></p><p>She floated down the stairs, bouncing and jumping, and finally stopped at the base of the stairs, giggling secretly at the statue of King Laideli.</p><p></p><p>Her golden robe swirled with her light movements, as if she was floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The god's words: "You have done very well," made the fairy dream spirit so happy that she wanted to dance on the spot. She reckoned that she would even laugh herself awake when she dreamed from now on.</p><p></p><p>These words and the memory of touring the Fairy Kingdom would replace her previous beautiful dreams and become her latest magnificent dreamscape.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"I promised the god, I must do even better."</p><p></p><p>The fairy put away her smile and put on a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>But the happiness in her eyes could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>She would occasionally fly into the dreamscape sea, observing the recent situation in the Hinsai Kingdom through the dreams of the Trifoliate people, and everything was improving as she had imagined and expected.</p><p></p><p>The war was over, and the Trifoliate people had entered a stage of recuperation.</p><p></p><p>Although Heniel's ascent to the throne was not very glorious, his abilities and methods were undeniable. </p><p></p><p>He promoted new nobles, issued new decrees.</p><p></p><p>He opened up new fishing grounds, established workshops, and sent envoys to sign trade agreements with the Abyss Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Abyss Kingdom, who had been invisible in the past, for the first time came to the coastal cities to trade with the Trifoliate people, which not only frightened many of the Hinsai people living by the sea, but also brought new opportunities and development.</p><p></p><p>The entire Hinsai Kingdom truly had a thriving atmosphere. Although the major changes had not yet fully arrived, it gave people a sense of vigorous vitality.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she also saw the person that Stan Tito had mentioned at the end.</p><p></p><p>"Sander."</p><p></p><p>She remembered this Trifoliate person named the Preacher, who was the disciple chosen by Stan to inherit his power and will.</p><p></p><p>He was a slave.</p><p></p><p>He was the descendant of the craftsmen who once built the Sky God Temple, and later the descendant of the rebels who were punished by King Yaser for starting a rebellion.</p><p></p><p>Just hearing the name Stan gave him, she knew that Stan hoped he could spread the power of dreams throughout the world and bring hope and light to the people.</p><p></p><p>This is also what the fairy wants.</p><p></p><p>Although the god has already allowed her to establish the Fairy Kingdom and has opened the restrictions of the Divine Cup, unleashing the imprint of divine magic, how to use this powerful force and who to let start the wave of change still needs to be considered.</p><p></p><p>She also recalled the words the divine spirit said when accepting Stan Tito's audience, when the god sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't make it, every time you pray to me for something."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, it's like I'm giving you a box of destruction."</p><p></p><p>"Even if..."</p><p></p><p>"What I put in the box is hope."</p><p></p><p>The fairy shook her head and said seriously, "This time, it will not turn out that way."</p><p></p><p>The City of the Descended God.</p><p></p><p>A group of tall, strong-tailed "monsters" that look more like insects than humans emerged from the sea.</p><p></p><p>They passed through the fishing village and headed towards the majestic city in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The leader wore a stone helmet, which was only worn by knights or nobles of the Abyss Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Other ordinary Abyss Kingdom people were carrying nets full of ancestral fish, baskets of various precious stones, and some unusual valuable items from the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Abyss Kingdom people caused panic among the coastal Trifoliate people, and some even collapsed in fear on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the stories of the Trifoliate people, they were all man-eating monsters, and generation after generation of Trifoliate people had grown up hearing terrifying stories about the Sinful People.</p><p></p><p>"Look."</p><p>"It's the Sinful People!"</p><p>"What Sinful People, those are the Abyss Kingdom people."</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, the king has issued an edict."</p><p></p><p>Sander was not surprised at all by this, as he had already seen the text board in the city announcing the edict issued by King Heniel.</p><p></p><p>With his wisdom and power, he not only learned all the written languages of the Hinsai Kingdom, but also read many psalms and chronicles, learning to pay attention to the outside world, politics and changes.</p><p></p><p>He even learned how to draw maps and write psalms, and a series of other skills.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had inherited the library of the Tito family, the legacy of two generations of saints.</p><p></p><p>He also learned some basic divine magic, but unfortunately, because of his blood...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood concentration was too low, unable to become a high-level priest.</p><p></p><p>In these days, everything outside has undergone earth-shaking changes.</p><p></p><p>King Heniel unified the kingdom of Hinsai and established a new dynasty, the royal bloodline family lost their power, and the Ruhir Colossus withdrew from the historical stage.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also heard the news that the Master had died and returned to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The crazy King of Samor killed his daughter Princess Saliman, using evil occult arts to try to occupy the body of the Ruhir Colossus to gain immortality, but was ultimately struck down by divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>The second-generation saint, Stan Tito, sacrificed his own life to redeem everything, earning the forgiveness of the gods, and finally entered the divine realm together with all the dead from this disaster.</p><p></p><p>Eternally enjoying sweet dreams and peace.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Sander had long heard the news of his death, but every time he thought about it, he couldn't help but feel saddened.</p><p></p><p>He once again recalled the words Stan Tito said to him when he left, and Sander felt a heavy weight on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"I can't waste my time here anymore, I should do something."</p><p></p><p>He said this to himself, but he didn't know what exactly he should do, or how to do it.</p><p></p><p>Sander decided to leave his hometown.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go see the City of Anhol, to see the legendary Sky Temple and the Holy Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Even with the establishment of diplomatic relations between Hinsai and the Abyss Kingdom, he still wanted to go to the legendary Dead Man's Island where the great poet suffered, to walk the legendary Saint's Path and the Yesir shipping route.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps then, he would know what to do.</p><p></p><p>He came to the small hut where Stan Tito once lived, wanting to bid farewell to the Master.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect to see a group of people searching for something here, led by a priest, with a minor noble following behind.</p><p></p><p>Bowing and scraping, fawning excessively.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Sander showed his head, the minor noble immediately spotted him and let out a shout.</p><p></p><p>"It's him."</p><p></p><p>"My lord."</p><p></p><p>"This slave used to come here often, he must have taken the things from the hut."</p><p></p><p>His former master, the lord of the fishing village, recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Sander felt uneasy and immediately turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>But the other side had no intention of letting him go, and hurriedly chased after him with a group of people.</p><p></p><p>Sander swung a stone hammer to fight back, his quick reflexes from the power of wisdom allowed him to quickly knock down the other three men. The priest, although only a junior priest, had obviously stronger combat skills than him.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Sander was forced to roll on the ground to dodge, and the things in his backpack spilled out.</p><p></p><p>And the most conspicuous among them, of course, was the Sun Flower with its petals curled up.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the movements of everyone present stopped, and the minor noble pointed at the object, his hands trembling.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Cup?"</p><p></p><p>"The Forbidden Flower."</p><p></p><p>"So the artisan really is the legendary second-generation saint."</p><p></p><p>The priest glared angrily at Sander, as if looking at some mortal enemy.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you who took it, and your power was also stolen from Saint Stan, wasn't it!"</p><p></p><p>"Thief."</p><p></p><p>"This belongs to the Tito family."</p><p></p><p>Sander tried to explain, "I didn't steal it."</p><p></p><p>"It was given to me by Master Stan."</p><p></p><p>The priest: "Shut up, how could Saint Stan possibly have looked upon a lowly slave like you."</p><p></p><p>But no one believed his words.</p><p></p><p>How could the exalted second-generation saint, the clan leader of the Tito family, possibly have given such a precious thing to a slave.</p><p></p><p>The priest rushed over, wanting to kill this slave who dared to steal the Tito family's treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him."</p><p>"Retrieve the Tito family's property."</p><p></p><p>Sander hugged the flower pot and blew a breath.</p><p></p><p>The petals of the Sun Flower Cup immediately opened, and a series of light beams rang out in front of him, causing all the people rushing towards him to instantly fall asleep on the ground.</p><p></p><p>But the priest was apparently not greatly affected, his figure swaying a few times before throwing the Ruhir Sword in his hand, stabbing towards Sander.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Sander reflexively blocked, and the stone bowl he was holding was directly shattered by the Ruhir Sword, and he fell to the ground as well.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a strong light burst out from the broken stone bowl.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that in the broken stone bowl, the roots of the Sun Flower Cup were tightly entangled and grasping something, and the light was radiating from that object.</p><p></p><p>Including Sander, this was the first time he knew that there was something else hidden under the flower pot.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a gift given to him by Stan Tito, the relic left behind by the great poet.</p><p></p><p>Sander didn't dare to dig it open to take a look, what if this holy object died?</p><p></p><p>The other people present immediately reacted, recognizing what this thing was.</p><p></p><p>The young priest from a branch of the Tito family let out a scream-like cry the moment he saw this object.</p>

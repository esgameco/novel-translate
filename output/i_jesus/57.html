        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The vast and desolate divine temple, it was raining outside the pyramid. </p><p></p><p>"Pitter-patter."</p><p></p><p>Raindrops fell on the steps, flowing down along the grooves.</p><p></p><p>Through the doors and windows of the temple, one could see the noisy rainy world outside. Yin Shen usually enjoyed such scenes, but at this moment, he had no mind to pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fixed on the mythical conch shell within. </p><p></p><p>The wondrous conch shell with intricate patterns, a life-creating tool.</p><p></p><p>It originally had no name, but now in the mythology of the Trifolians, it had a name - the Mother Conch of All Things. The people of Xin Cai believed it created all life in this world.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mother Conch of All Things, a newborn dream sprite was born under the god's watchful gaze. </p><p></p><p>It was different from the other dream sprites, born cradling an egg shell. At this moment, this beautiful creature dressed in a golden divine robe was resting its head on the egg shell, immersed in a dream.</p><p></p><p>From the egg shell, one could directly see its dream.</p><p></p><p>It was a fantastical, gentle light without any color, but pregnant with infinite miracles.  </p><p></p><p>The illusory light emanated from the dream, shining in the real world, casting at the feet of the deity.</p><p></p><p>So gentle.</p><p></p><p>Like moonlight spilling onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"Hee hee hee hee."</p><p></p><p>"A new companion."</p><p></p><p>"It seems more powerful."  </p><p></p><p>"Its dream is so real."</p><p></p><p>A few dream sprites circled around the deity, curiously looking at the newborn dream sprite in the mythical conch shell, whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen touched the conch shell that was dozens of meters tall, and the entire shell became completely transparent.</p><p></p><p>The huge conch shell was embedded in one side of the temple; from inside, one could only see part of its side.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen was sensing everything about this dream sprite.</p><p></p><p>"Dream power."</p><p></p><p>"Second stage."</p><p></p><p>The dream sprite had molted.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Trifolians' wisdom power bloodline, the dream sprites now also possessed second-stage powers. Yin Shen had spent many years, trying time and again, to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found that part to perfect the mythical bloodline of the dream sprites, allowing their power to transcend from the consciousness dimension into the real world.</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians used the pollen of the Sun Chalice to perfect their wisdom power, thus possessing a power similar to psychic abilities.</p><p></p><p>But the dream sprites actually used the egg shells from the Trifolians' infancy as a bridge and medium to interfere with and connect to reality, with the Trifolians' egg shells becoming the carrier for the dream sprites to nurture their dreams.</p><p></p><p>It was because they possessed wisdom and consciousness that dreams were born.</p><p></p><p>It was because they possessed fantasy and reverie that the Trifolians could turn their consciousness and thoughts into a brush to explore the world.</p><p></p><p>The Trifolians and the dream sprites were like an embedded, closed circle.</p><p></p><p>"Roaming among dreams, the sprites release..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Your power!" </p><p></p><p>The words of the god entered the consciousness of the dream sprite. The dream sprite immediately transformed its form.</p><p></p><p>The golden robe flipped up, forming a huge flower cup. </p><p></p><p>It changed from a humanoid life form into a massive sun flower.</p><p></p><p>The eggshell originally pillowed under its head also slowly floated up, blooming with brilliant dream light, just like a highly raised dream sun.</p><p></p><p>The dream egg expanded little by little as it rotated, illuminating the dream realm wherever the light touched.</p><p></p><p>Gradually.</p><p></p><p>It covered dozens of meters around.</p><p></p><p>However, this dream realm was a blank slate, with nothing existing in it.</p><p></p><p>Memories are the cornerstone of dreams and the food of dream sprites. The more powerful memories it devours, the more perfect and powerful its dream egg becomes.</p><p></p><p>God Yin stretched out his hand, with light flowing from between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>That faint starlight fell, dropping into the dream sprite's dream egg.  </p><p></p><p>If an ordinary person used memories to feed the dream sprite, they would immediately and permanently lose those memories.</p><p></p><p>What the dream sprite took away was not just their memories, but their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that this dream sprite could not take anything from the god's memories. That tiny bit of memory about snow that fell from the god turned into endless glaciers in the dream sprite's world. Even the dream egg began to be covered in frost, unable to bear it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The crown of wisdom on God Yin's finger erupted with power, connecting to the dream sprite.  </p><p></p><p>The light of the dream suddenly exploded, instantly spreading out hundreds, thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>The light kept spreading, bursting out of the temple, out of the pyramid.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the entire god-blessed land.</p><p></p><p>The dream sprite murmured in its sleep: "Snow!"</p><p></p><p>"So cold."</p><p></p><p>However, even more wondrous things happened outside the temple.  </p><p></p><p>The drifting rain suddenly turned into swirling snowstorms, with white snowflakes continuously drifting down to the earth.</p><p></p><p>God Yin walked out of the temple step by step. </p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, wanting to catch the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>But the snow passed through the god's hand, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Shari also imitated the god, catching a snowflake, then holding it up to the god's face.</p><p></p><p>That group of dream sprites had never seen such a sight before, joyfully rushing outside to welcome the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>God Yin pulled back his hand, using his mental power to control the snowflakes to float up. Those tiny diamond-shaped ice crystals rotated upwards, stopping in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"When dreams enter reality, they can twist reality."</p><p></p><p>"Truly a miraculous power."</p><p></p><p>When the sun cup's flower bud closed, the huge bubble also slowly rotated and retracted back into the flower bud.  </p><p></p><p>It awoke from the dream realm, descending into the real world.</p><p></p><p>The dream sprite flew out from the womb of all things, facing the god's back.</p><p></p><p>"My creator."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Great creator God, the supreme Insei."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for bestowing life upon me."</p><p></p><p>The god nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>----------------------</p><p></p><p>The second-tier dream fairies who possessed the dream egg had the ability to make dreams come true, but this ability also had limitations.</p><p></p><p>For example, it could turn sand into stones and gems, but could not turn sand into gold. </p><p></p><p>It could turn water into snow and ice, but could not turn water into oil.</p><p></p><p>Rather than changing the essence of materials, it was more like reshaping and refining them.</p><p></p><p>Each dream fairy had its own name, and the newborn was no exception.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy told the god, "God! I've decided!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Hira."</p><p></p><p>Meaning light and hope.</p><p></p><p>The newborn dream fairy was not as lively as other dream fairies, preferring to dream and roam in its own dream world instead.</p><p></p><p>But like other dream fairies, it possessed innocence and simplicity.</p><p></p><p>"Hope?"</p><p></p><p>"Why this name?"</p><p></p><p>The dream fairy Hira told the god, "I like this word, and hope that my birth can bring hope and light to this world."</p><p></p><p>"Just as the divine brought wisdom and life to this world."</p><p></p><p>The god told her, "The world does not care that I created life and wisdom, nor does it care whether you can bring hope and light."</p><p></p><p>"The only ones who care about these things..."</p><p></p><p>"Are people themselves."</p><p></p><p>These people are humans, the Trileans.  </p><p></p><p>As well as Hira and the god Yin.</p><p></p><p>Yin bestowed some of his memories to Hira - memories of smelting metals, firing pottery, refining lamp oil, producing gems, and more.</p><p></p><p>Hira's dream egg grew stronger, and the scope of her dreams expanded.</p><p></p><p>She slept clutching the dream egg beneath the divine altar, her dreams gradually enveloping the entire pyramid, illusion light blossoming in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The pyramid temple, which had become dilapidated over the years, was renewed in Hira's dreams.</p><p></p><p>The broken stairs and faded, blurred murals gradually became clear again.  </p><p></p><p>No longer could any filth or dust tarnish this place.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of adornments decorated the divine hall - the temple gained massive metal gates, gems studded the domed ceilings.</p><p></p><p>Various metal artifacts appeared, lamps lining the pillars and walls.</p><p></p><p>The empty windows gained stained glass.</p><p></p><p>And at night, there were golden lamps.</p><p></p><p>The radiance from the golden, ornate lamps reflected off the dark golden precious objects, bathing the once gloomy temple in a splendid golden light.</p>

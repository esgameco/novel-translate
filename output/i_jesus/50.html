        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Under the pyramid temple, the sea of flowers blooming from the Cup of the Sun remained unchanged. The wandering child Polo returned to the realm of the gods, and Shali, as always, welcomed him. The young girl sat on the high steps, gazing at him and making that familiar gurgling bubble sound.  </p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether she was truly greeting him or just idly calling out. </p><p></p><p>Many things had happened outside - some people died, a new king took over. For the Trilium people, it was the transition from one era to another.</p><p></p><p>Even Polo himself had changed, but here, nothing was different. </p><p></p><p>Time seemed to have stopped in this place. A powerful force separated the land blessed by the gods from the outside world, even cleaving time itself into two halves.</p><p></p><p>"Great God!"</p><p>"Polo has returned."</p><p></p><p>This time, the God was not inside the temple. He stood in the colonnades on the side of the temple, looking at the relief sculptures that Leadrix had once carved for Him.</p><p></p><p>Polo did not know how many times the God had seen this scene. He had not quite understood it before; he had only yearned for novelty and the unknown. But now he vaguely began to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>When one has someone or something to cherish,</p><p>Those wonderful memories become one's precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Polo knelt on the ground, gazing up at the God. For the first time, he was so quiet, simply looking silently at the God's profile.</p><p></p><p>"Have you found the answer?" the God asked him.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Polo's face: "I did not find the answer myself; someone else told me."</p><p></p><p>"God! I met a girl - the one with a talent like a genius, as I told You about. She is called Xing and is Your priestess, as well as the current Queen of the Hein Xai Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Xing perfected her consciousness projection technique. As for how to allow You to descend into this world, Xing also guided me in the right direction."</p><p></p><p>Polo gesticulated animatedly like an orator.</p><p></p><p>"The power of one person is fragile. One person cannot do it, but what about one thousand, ten thousand, or a million people?"</p><p></p><p>"Xing helped me find the answer and made me realize that power has no limit. If I cannot do it alone, then I will create a race - a thousand, ten thousand versions of myself."</p><p></p><p>"Condense it into a massive dream world, a dream kingdom capable of bearing You."</p><p></p><p>"Then You, God, can descend into this..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"...this world."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his words gradually slowed down. </p><p></p><p>Bolo fell into reminiscence, recalling a certain person, recalling a certain thing.</p><p></p><p>The God looked towards Bolo, and Bolo, lost in thought, unexpectedly noticed the God's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this journey has changed you quite a bit. Your carefree white dream has also started to take on color."</p><p></p><p>"Bolo!"  </p><p></p><p>"What have you gained? And what have you lost?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo looked up at the God: "God!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand my own heart."</p><p></p><p>Yet the God told him: "You already understand, you just don't want to lose your freedom, you don't want to face the fact that you've grown up."</p><p></p><p>"Bolo."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, everyone gains while also losing, and loses while also gaining."</p><p></p><p>"You're unwilling to give anything up, so you're destined to not get what you want."</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>The wind blew over the sea of flowers, stirring up waves and also lifting Bolo's golden robe. He drifted with the wind above the sea of flowers, circling around the God.</p><p></p><p>He loved the wind, yearned for the wind.</p><p></p><p>Just as he yearned for freedom.</p><p></p><p>"The weather is really nice today."</p><p></p><p>The God stood in the center of the God-blessed city covered by the Sun's chalice, like a star fallen from the heavens to the human realm.</p><p></p><p>Streams of white rays spilled out from the deity's shadow, flowing towards the sky, overflowing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The God looked at the swaying sea of flowers beside himself and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Bolo."</p><p></p><p>"What do you want your race to be called?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo sounded like he had thought about it long ago, happily saying:</p><p></p><p>"Let's call them Dream Sprites!"</p><p></p><p>"Sprites roaming in dreams, dream spirits guarding the garden for the God."</p><p></p><p>So ordinary, this didn't match Bolo's character at all.</p><p></p><p>The God asked him:</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want to give them a more powerful name?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want to name them after gods anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo recalled the conversation between him and the God when he had just been born, and couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>As he laughed, he also shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Because of ignorance, there is no fear."</p><p></p><p>"The name 'God' is too weighty. Just using the name of a god can make thousands upon thousands of people go to their deaths for it."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone fights under the name of gods, every single thing is guided by gods, not a single choice is made without gods."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to wake up, it's not what I want."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a dream fairy, wandering in my own dreamland sky." </p><p></p><p>"I just want to be carefree."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Bolo suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Then he added one more sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe!"</p><p></p><p>"I can have a few more friends."</p><p></p><p>The god looked at Bolo without saying a word. </p><p></p><p>He finally understood reverence.</p><p></p><p>The god placed his hand on Bolo's head, his golden robe violently shook and then flipped upwards.</p><p></p><p>Ring after ring of dreamy starlight scattered, spreading to hundreds of meters around.</p><p></p><p>Bolo's roots took root in the earth, transforming into a huge sun cup flower, and the head in the flower cup slowly closed its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The ruler of dreams.</p><p></p><p>Fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>Bolo divided a portion of his dream power mythology factor and let it scatter into the sea of flowers. Immediately, dense sun cup flowers appeared with changes in the sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>One after another, huge dream bubbles floated out, enveloping those sun cup flowers.</p><p></p><p>The golden flowers retracted their buds, nurturing dream fairies within.</p><p></p><p>One after another, seven or eight dream imps were born in succession, scattered in various corners of this sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>The buds bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Little heads peeked out from the buds, curiously looking at this world.</p><p></p><p>"Hee hee hee hee!"</p><p></p><p>Peals of laughter filled the sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>The dream fairies released their power, turning this small nearby sea of flowers into a dreamland between dreams and reality.</p><p></p><p>When they filled the god-given land, they might form a vast dream world, and then the God Yin could descend into this world through the cracks of time and space.</p><p></p><p>The dreams of thousands upon thousands of dream imps would surely be able to contain the will of the god.</p><p></p><p>Here.</p><p></p><p>It would become his greatest and most solid anchor, or the embodiment of his will.</p><p></p><p>The God Yin looked at the huge sun cup flower and said to it:</p><p></p><p>"Bolo!"</p><p></p><p>"You did well, exceeding my expectations."</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Bolo kept his eyes tightly closed, but his voice came out from the dream:</p><p></p><p>"This is my promise and my reward."</p><p></p><p>"It was you, God, who created me and guided the direction of my life. You allowed my mischief and tolerated my offenses."</p>

New69bookbar.com</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at the ocean outside the great hall and fell into reminiscence. </p><p></p><p>So many things had happened.</p><p></p><p>It turned out.</p><p></p><p>So long had passed.</p><p></p><p>"Yin...sai...sen!"  </p><p></p><p>"Yin...sai...shen!"</p><p></p><p>In a daze, he heard Redley's awkward and ridiculous tone again, shouting his name in front of the temple gate.</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>Those sinners who committed patricide and blasphemy also heard Redley's last words, announcing that all Trifolians, Yeserl, would be the wise king of the second generation of the Yin Sai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>When Yeserl put on the crown of wisdom, all Trifolians knew what had happened in the temple. </p><p></p><p>The old king passed away, the new king was crowned.</p><p></p><p>The sinners outside the temple suddenly burst into tears, even collapsing disgracefully outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>They cried for the passing of the wise king, but more for their own unknown fate to come.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen turned his gaze over and said indifferently to the Trifolians big and small surrounding the two stone coffins.</p><p></p><p>"Too noisy!"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>As the words came out, he saw a force directly acting on these Trifolians' bodies, affecting their bloodline originating from the primordial Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>The crying stopped abruptly, and they could no longer make a single sound.  </p><p></p><p>They even found in horror that their bodies were also changing, their vocal organs completely disappearing, their hard shells softening, and two tentacle-like things growing out of their heads.</p><p></p><p>Compared to humans, they looked more like insects or soft-shelled shrimp.</p><p></p><p>They could only keep kowtowing towards the temple, praying for the gods' forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>Everything stopped, and they had become a species different from ordinary Trifolians, a species more suited to living in the ocean than on land.</p><p></p><p>They were punished by the gods, deprived of the right to speak.  </p><p></p><p>In the future, they could no longer set foot on land, only dwelling in the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen looked at Redley and said to the second wise king Yeserl,</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"Leave this place."  </p><p></p><p>"Take all the people of the God-given City and establish your kingdom on the continent."</p><p></p><p>"Never come back."</p><p></p><p>That voice, like Redley's wisdom and kingship, was directly imprinted in the minds of all Trifolians.</p><p></p><p>The voice even directly erased the memory of the location of the God-given City in the minds of all Trifolians, causing everyone...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he could not recall the name "City of Divine Blessings". Once they left this place, they would never be able to find the way back.</p><p></p><p>With Leadley's passing, the God Yin lost all interest in the game he had established for this kingdom, and no longer wished to pay attention to it. </p><p></p><p>Yeser looked at the deity in panic, not understanding what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"Great God Yin?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is this? Have we done something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>God Yin stepped down from the divine platform, looking at everything Leadley had created for himself, his voice echoing hollowly in the hall. Empty and cold, no longer showing the tolerance he had for Leadley.</p><p></p><p>"Yeser!"</p><p></p><p>"The blessings I bestowed upon you were only because you are Leadley's descendants, not for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>The deity paused: "He was my firstborn son."</p><p></p><p>"You are not."</p><p></p><p>"This is the blessed land I gave to Leadley, the paradise for him and me, not yours."</p><p></p><p>Yeser went forward on his knees, prostrating himself before God Yin. </p><p></p><p>He spoke in an urgent voice, even crying out pleadingly in the hope that the deity would not do this.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you not need us anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"We are your devout believers, the first lives you created!"</p><p></p><p>God Yin let out a light laugh: "Without a god, you can still survive."</p><p></p><p>"Everything will be as usual, just do not come to disturb me again."</p><p></p><p>"I do not need your offerings, nor do I need your faith."</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>The supreme deity spoke words that Yeser could never forget for the rest of his life, echoing like thunderous bells in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Believing in me is your business."</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Yeser walked down from the pyramid like a lost soul. Suddenly, his father's words not long ago echoed in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"On the path to becoming a king, it is not only about gaining."</p><p></p><p>"It is more about losing."</p><p></p><p>The covenant between the deity and the Wise King existed only between the deity and Leadley, ending with Leadley's passing.</p><p></p><p>The deity's favor existed only for the first Wise King Leadley, the deity's firstborn son, not for the other Trileans.</p><p></p><p>Yeser gathered all the people of the City of Divine Blessings and announced his decision to lead everyone away.</p><p></p><p>"I am your new king."</p><p></p><p>"The Wise King Yeser of the Hein Kingdom, inheriting my father's power and ideals of the Wise King, the successor to his will."</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"We will go to the land and establish a new city blessed by God."</p><p></p><p>"We will follow the footsteps of the Wise King and God, and create our own future on the other side of the sea, in that equally great land of origin."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yesser finished speaking, all the Trifolians knelt hopelessly on the ground, with thousands upon thousands crying in unison. </p><p></p><p>They felt as if the sky had fallen down.</p><p></p><p>They had just lost their king and been abandoned by God.</p><p></p><p>Yesser stepped down from the high platform and walked into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He pulled up one person after another, saying to their trusting gazes:</p><p></p><p>"God has not abandoned us, we still have the land of origin, another vast place God has granted us."</p><p></p><p>"There is endless land and vast coastlines suitable for farming the ancestral fish."</p><p></p><p>"The wise kingship, the ancestral fish, the writing and language God has bestowed upon us are all still here."</p><p></p><p>"One day in the future, we will be forgiven by God and return to this promised land."</p><p></p><p>"Now we go to the other side of the sea to create an even more brilliant future."</p><p></p><p>By the seaside.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of Trifolians left their homeland and went deep into the ocean, accompanied by dense schools of ancestral fish controlled by their wisdom powers.</p><p></p><p>They would first arrive at the city of Yesser, and then depart from that undersea city.</p><p></p><p>Next they would head to the legendary land of origin, another place God had granted them.</p><p></p><p>What no one noticed was that a small number of Trifolians were also exiled to the deep sea - the descendants of Ensu and Bun.</p><p></p><p>These people were called the forsaken by God. They could never speak again, forever unable to use the language of God.</p><p></p><p>Antennae grew out of their heads, and they communicated by touching antennae.</p><p></p><p>In the deep sea, they propagated another branch of the Trifolian people.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>The Song of Praise for the Wise King Leadriki: Final Chapter</p><p></p><p>The first Wise King ended his glorious and illustrious life before God due to the betrayal of his son and the death of his queen.</p><p></p><p>He passed the throne to his most outstanding son Yesser, along with his covenant and promise with God.</p><p></p><p>But the divine was enraged by Leadriki's death and disappointed by the Trifolians' sin of patricide and fratricide.</p><p></p><p>God took back his promised land, expelling all Trifolians from the land granted by God.</p><p></p><p>The divine erased the location and memories of the God-given land from their minds, so they could never return to that paradise promised by God again.</p>

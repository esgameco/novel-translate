            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The queen was ill, gravely ill. On the third floor of the Palace of Wisdom, the queen sat in the stone room by the window, looking out through the window. She had personally witnessed this place transform from a desolate wilderness into a magnificent city. She had also personally helped the Wise King build the first house of the God-blessed city. </p><p></p><p>The kindled flames lit the path towards civilization.</p><p></p><p>She had once watched the sun rise and shine upon God's pyramids and the barren valley, and now she watched the setting sun's last rays fall upon the towering buildings of different heights in the God-blessed city.</p><p></p><p>The sun of civilization had just risen, yet she was about to exit the stage.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike came up behind her stone chair and embraced her from behind.</p><p></p><p>"I've told the children."</p><p></p><p>"I want them to cross the sea to seek the land where God descended, the land of origins, to fulfill my final dream."</p><p></p><p>A proud smile of a life's accomplishments appeared on the face of the Wise King.</p><p></p><p>"The one who finds the land of origins."</p><p></p><p>"I will give him the throne, and personally crown him king."</p><p></p><p>Only then did the queen turn her attention back from the scenery outside the window to look at the also aged Laidlike.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this too rushed?"</p><p></p><p>"Some things can be left for the children to do, there's no need to accomplish everything in our generation."  </p><p></p><p>"Moving too quickly will put too much pressure on the children, and in the end, the result may not be what we imagined."</p><p></p><p>The queen stroked Laidlike's face, her eyes full of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>"We've grown old."</p><p></p><p>"We should also stop and rest, shouldn't we, my king?"</p><p></p><p>Laidlike shook his head, though aged, the ambition could still be seen in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had established the God-blessed city, founded the Hyksos Kingdom, ignited the seeds of civilization and let them blaze brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Just one more step.</p><p></p><p>Just one more step.</p><p></p><p>He believed he could do it, just as he had accomplished those great achievements before, because he was the Wise King, God's favored son.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot wait any longer."</p><p></p><p>"We have conquered the ocean, we should set foot on land again."</p><p></p><p>"We are God's eldest sons, destined to rule the ocean and land."</p><p></p><p>"At least before I die, I want to see us control the land and sea, so that I can die without regrets before God."</p><p></p><p>"I will tell God."</p><p></p><p>"I have done it."</p><p></p><p>"I have fulfilled his expectations of me, and will also present my vow before him."</p><p></p><p>The queen looked at him doubtfully: "A vow?"</p><p></p><p>Laidlike smiled but did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Laidlike thought many would come looking for him, but he waited until nightfall and no one came.</p><p></p><p>After dark, of the seven children, only Yesser came.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Wisdom Palace came to see Laidleki. </p><p></p><p>His sons had already been enfeoffed to various places. Although Laidleki was still their king, they no longer completely depended on him as before.</p><p></p><p>His sons and daughters had opened up their own cities and established their own territories. Compared to their father's dream, they valued their own rights and territories more.</p><p></p><p>Although Laidleki felt lost, his eyes shone when he saw Yeseier for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Yeseier walked into the palace under the moonlight and knelt on one knee before his father.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom King!"</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to go find the place of origin, and then build a new city there. A new beginning!"</p><p></p><p>Laidleki looked at Yeseier, then slowly stood up. He walked straight to Yeseier and placed his hand on his shoulder. </p><p></p><p>Laidleki put his arm around his son's shoulder and they walked out of the palace together.</p><p></p><p>Shoulder to shoulder, father and son sat down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he no longer had the majesty of a king.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeseier."</p><p></p><p>"You are not only my son, but also my companion."</p><p></p><p>"Father is old, and can only rely on you to realize my dream."</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Yeseier had such an intimate heart-to-heart with his father. He was happy, but also saddened by his father's words "I am old."</p><p></p><p>"Father, your dream and ideal, I will realize them."</p><p></p><p>Laidleki laughed heartily, an unusual lack of composure.</p><p></p><p>"When you come back!"</p><p></p><p>"I will give you a gift, the most precious gift I possess."</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Laidleki looked at the reflection in the water, revealing a tall, dark-boned male Trilean with a resolute and majestic gaze.</p><p></p><p>He touched the crown on his head, as if wanting to take it off.</p><p></p><p>This crown was not naturally formed, nor was it forged, but rather Laidleki controlled the growth of his own bone armor into the shape of a crown after becoming the Wisdom King - it was part of his bone armor.</p><p></p><p>"God said, a king wears a crown."</p><p></p><p>"You say."</p><p></p><p>"Why does a king wear a crown?"</p><p></p><p>The queen gazed at his back: "Perhaps to show the difference between the king and others?"</p><p></p><p>"However."</p><p></p><p>"You do seem more majestic after having the crown."</p><p></p><p>Laidleki nodded.</p><p></p><p>"So the crown is the symbol of a king, but besides being a symbol it has no other special qualities."</p><p></p><p>"But if the crown contained supreme wisdom and kingly authority, while also hiding a covenant with the divine..."</p><p></p><p>"Then this crown would be completely different."</p><p></p><p>"It would not only be the symbol of the Wisdom King, but also the embodiment of kingly authority and divine covenant."</p><p></p><p>The queen shook her head: "Another covenant!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of covenant did the king make with the divine?"</p><p></p><p>Laid</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Laidelic's face: "I told the god that I want to make an everlasting vow with all the Trileans, to engrave the faith in the god into our bloodlines."  </p><p></p><p>"At that time, the god said to me."</p><p></p><p>His pupils reflected a starry light and that ethereal, desolate voice.</p><p></p><p>"These things only have meaning to you, they are meaningless to me."</p><p></p><p>"There is no such thing as an eternal civilization."  </p><p></p><p>"Even the sun in the sky will eventually burn out, the universe is inevitably heading towards destruction."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how great a civilization is, it cannot withstand the erosion of time."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how devout the faith, it will be forgotten. Even the grandest, most solid temples and statues will ultimately collapse into ruins."</p><p></p><p>Even today, he still could not understand these words.</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine the sight of the eternal sun burning out, nor did he know how the vast universe would head towards destruction.</p><p></p><p>He had never even seen how the indestructible palaces collapsed over time. He believed the civilization he created would be eternal and immortal, and that his faith could never be erased by any length of time.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Laidelic revealed his plan.</p><p></p><p>"I want all Trileans to never forget their faith in the god. I want to imprint my will into the bloodline of the Wisdom Kingship, so that anyone who wears this crown will, like me, kneel obediently at the feet of the divine."</p><p></p><p>"This is the covenant with the god. As long as one wears this crown, one will offer one's will and most loyal faith to the divine."  </p><p></p><p>"Only by offering one's will to the divine can one become the King of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Laidelic looked at the towering, majestic pyramids outside the window. An expression of extreme fanaticism, even bordering on madness, appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"That's it!"</p><p></p><p>"All future Kings of Wisdom will be like me."</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Heinsen will forever bask in the glory of the god, guarding the divine temple."</p><p></p><p>"Until the end of time."  </p><p></p><p>"Until the day the sun burns out."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the queen stood up and looked at Laidelic in disbelief.  </p><p></p><p>Laidelic had never forced his will on the children before, he had never even used the power of the Wisdom Kingship.</p><p></p><p>He was a kind and rational king, a true King of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>But she never expected that the first time Laidelic would use the Wisdom Kingship would be on his own bloodline and children.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you really going to do this?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say the god doesn't care?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it worth doing all this for your one-sided desire?"</p><p></p><p>The queen grabbed Laidelic's hand: "Let it go!"</p><p></p><p>"The god said he doesn't need your vow, and the children may not want the will and shackles you force upon them."</p><p></p><p>Laidelic's determination exceeded the queen's expectations. He looked at his queen, his pupils filled with resolve.</p><p></p><p>"The god doesn't care!"</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p>

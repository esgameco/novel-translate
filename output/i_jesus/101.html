        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kingdom of Sairol, Deep Water Port. 💔🐉➅❾ˢⓗⓤＸ.Ćσ𝐦💔🍓</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, a terrifying giant creature floats, resembling a jellyfish. Its half-transparent fleshy membrane acts like a massive canopy, and countless swaying tentacle-like vines are like the creepers of an ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>When it inhales, the layers of clouds in the sky are consumed by it, and when it exhales, the clouds are expelled again.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu stands with her priesthood on top of the giant beast. The combined power of the beast and the priesthood will unleash an even more formidable force - this is the mightiest battle formation of the Xilon family.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that the Xilon family has exhausted all its resources to revive the glory of Xinsai.</p><p></p><p>"Sairol family."</p><p></p><p>"You have only one choice - to submit or be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>In the river surrounding the Deep Water Port, a terrifying giant creature over a hundred meters long, with a shell-like armor, gradually emerges.</p><p></p><p>It drags behind it agile and thick tentacles, and a single sweep can propel it forward thousands of meters. One can only imagine how fast it can move in the sea.</p><p></p><p>This is the Sairol sea monster, the Ruhk giant nurtured by the Sairol family.</p><p></p><p>It has previously sunk a small island by directly ramming it with its steel-like head, and a single impact has destroyed a city on the coast that dared to rebel against the Sairol family.</p><p></p><p>The giant monster roars towards the sky beast, but after the sound gradually stabilizes, it becomes the voice of a three-leaf person.</p><p></p><p>"Queen Xinglu."</p><p></p><p>"We have never favored any side. The Sairol family has the right to remain neutral."</p><p></p><p>"The Xilon family cannot control the Sairol family. We have the freedom to not be bound by anyone. ◦•●◉✿ ６９𝓈ᕼⓤχ.ｃ๏ᵐ ✿◉●•◦"</p><p></p><p>The Kingdom of Xinglu wants the Sairol family to abdicate their royal power, which is absolutely unacceptable for the Sairol family.</p><p></p><p>Without the royal power and the Sairol Kingdom, are they still the high and mighty royal bloodline family?</p><p></p><p>Even knowing they cannot resist, they still hope to seek a glimmer of possibility from it.</p><p></p><p>Their last hope, like a lifesaving straw, is the Kingdom of Samo.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xinglu stands on the giant sky beast, and the Ruhk brand on her forehead shines brightly as she raises her scepter.</p><p></p><p>"King of the Sairol family, I have given you a chance before, and I even said I was willing to share the grace of the divine with you."</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>"You have been wavering, and even prepared to accept the conditions of the enemies of the Kingdom of Xinglu, to send troops to attack the Kingdom of Xinglu."</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Xinglu and the Xilon family absolutely cannot allow your existence to remain by our side."</p><p></p><p>These words signify that war is now inevitable.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words are spoken, the priesthood of the Sky Temple begins to control giant boulders to fall from the sky, bombarding the Deep Water Port.</p><p></p><p>Countless boulders fall like meteors.</p><p></p><p>The dense rumbling sounds spread, and violent dust clouds rise in the Deep Water Port, with several sections of the city wall immediately collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Just the first wave of attack has already caused severe damage to the entire Deep Water Port.</p><p></p><p>The giant beast in the sky roars and whirls up a violent wind as it descends, dispersing the dust clouds in the Deep Water Port while also pouncing on the Sairol sea monster in the river outside the city. 🍓☯６９Ŝнⓤ𝔁.ⓒᗝ𝐦🍧🐊</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The clash of the two giant monsters shakes the earth.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, tens of thousands of three-leaf people charge towards the collapsed sections of the city wall, launching the siege battle.</p><p></p><p>Although the key to deciding the victory of the war is the Ruhk giant monsters, in the end, it is still the people who control and occupy the city.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why every major war requires each country to bring a large number of soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The war continues from noon until dusk, with the Sairol family still desperately holding on, waiting for the rescue of the Kingdom of Samo.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>News of the Truce.</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle between the giant monsters surged from the river to the coast, and then back out to the sea. </p><p></p><p>The outcome was still undecided.</p><p></p><p>But under the siege of the Star Roc Kingdom's main forces, Deep Water Port was gradually unable to hold out.</p><p></p><p>Hordes of Star Roc Kingdom soldiers charged into the city, engaging in street battles. The fall of Deep Water Port was now a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, as the sun set, the tides over the sea were also receding bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>The path to the Abyssal Queen's capital appeared on the coastline.</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen noticed this scene and could not suppress her excitement. She shouted towards the presence controlling the Abyssal Leviathans.</p><p></p><p>"Salar family. </p><p>You have lost."</p><p></p><p>The entire Salar Kingdom was in full retreat, and the balance of victory had completely tilted towards the Star Roc Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But she did not notice that in the midst of this fierce battle, one of the Ruhk brands on her forehead was rapidly fading.</p><p></p><p>The sky titan beneath her feet was also gradually becoming more restless, no longer as obedient as before.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in full view of everyone, the sky titan that had served the Silor family for hundreds of years suddenly went berserk, letting out a muffled roar.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The sky titan had lost control. </p><p></p><p>It broke free from the Star Roc Queen's control, as well as the centuries of enslavement and restraint by the Silor family.</p><p></p><p>The sky titan recklessly plunged directly from the sky into the sea, abandoning its advantages to grapple with the Abyssal Leviathans, like two mad beasts tearing at each other.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it no longer protected the Star Roc Queen and the Sky Priests within its body.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it felt very uncomfortable and agitated, as it did not like the "bugs" that had crawled into its body.</p><p></p><p>The first thing it reacted to was to kill those "bugs" that were troubling it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Star Roc Queen and the Sky Priests hidden in the sky titan's air sacs were met with total annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen and the Sky Temple Priests were completely panicked. They felt the air in the air sac being completely drained, and the flesh membranes of the sky titan pressing in on them from all sides like walls.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to escape, they had trapped themselves in an inescapable death trap.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Your Majesty the Queen, how could this happen?"</p><p>"Save me, save me!"</p><p>"Your Majesty, make the sky titan stop!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Sky Temple Priests were crushed by the pressing membranes, turning into a mass of flesh.</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen was also in a panic, desperately calling out but unable to do anything.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p>"It won't stop, it won't stop!"</p><p>"It doesn't listen to me anymore."</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen suddenly realized the reason she could no longer control the sky titan was because one of the Ruhk brands on her forehead had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that she understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The Ruhk brand of the Silor family was gone, the divine spirits had reclaimed the gift they had once bestowed upon Laidliki.</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen's gaze instantly became vacant, all her remaining strength to struggle had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Oh gods!"</p><p>"Is this... a punishment for my lack of piety?"</p><p></p><p>The air was being drained, she first felt difficulty breathing, then the flesh membranes pressed in on her like stone walls.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>She even heard the sound of the sky titan swallowing, as if they were just insects casually gulped down, not even enough to fill its teeth gaps.</p><p></p><p>The Star Roc Queen finally realized, they had never truly been the masters of the Ruhk Titans.</p><p></p><p>Bereft of the divine blessings, in the face of these mythical creatures,</p>

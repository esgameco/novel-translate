        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The high priest of the Yinsei Temple brought several guards, while Prince Wei had over a dozen of his subordinates already on standby. ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà‚ñ∫‚îÄ‚ïê‚ùª‚ûà≈úƒ¶ùì§x.¬¢ùêé–º ‚ïê‚îÄ‚óÑ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>the market guards kept rushing out to assist the high priest of the temple, while a patrol unit that just happened to pass by defected to Prince Wei's side, raising their weapons towards the priest of the Yinsei Temple.</p><p></p><p>Chaos, slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The two sides fought to the death within the market, with blood flowing like a river.</p><p></p><p>The two high-ranking priests engaged in an intense battle, their destructive power astounding. </p><p></p><p>Their power swept through the streets like a whirlwind, able to wield all kinds of weapons, be it stones or anything else, even using a basin of water as a means to kill.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, over twenty corpses lay on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This scene terrified Stan, who sat on the ground cowering in the corner, hugging his head with both hands, still tightly gripping the bone tablet.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that by simply picking up an unremarkable bone tablet on the road, he would be caught up in such a terrible incident.</p><p></p><p>The high priest of the Yinsei Temple was not at all inferior, and only grew more courageous in battle.</p><p></p><p>His thunderous voice echoed through the entire street.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wei!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the City of the Descended Gods, the City of the Descended Gods of the Xilun family, not the Volcano Kingdom of your Hosen family."</p><p></p><p>"So it was you who had the Tito family massacred? What made you commit such an unforgivable crime?"</p><p></p><p>"What was it?"</p><p></p><p>"That made a noble prince raise the butcher's knife against the descendant of the great poet. üëåüëΩ‚ûÖ‚ùæ‡∏£‚íΩ‡∏¢ùìç.ùìí„Ññ‚ìúüêä‚òû"</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Wei remained silent. He did not want to explain, nor did he want to respond to the other party.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to reclaim what was rightfully his - "the final chapter".</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a large group of regular troops armed with weapons arrived at the market.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Prince of the Volcano Kingdom retreated, but it was not a defeat; rather, he was temporarily withdrawing to gather greater forces.</p><p></p><p>The regular troops gave chase, but were stopped by the high priest of the Yinsei Temple.</p><p></p><p>"You cannot catch him."</p><p></p><p>"There is something more important now."</p><p></p><p>The high priest of the Yinsei Temple and the soldiers protected the bewildered Stan and quickly proceeded along the main road.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the high priest used the divination power of his wisdom to read Stan's mind and learn everything he wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>At the side of the Yaeser Palace, in the administrative residence, the city lord was anxiously waiting, until the priest arrived before him.</p><p></p><p>"We've found it!"</p><p></p><p>"Really found it?"</p><p></p><p>"How did you find it?"</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the City of the Descended Gods listened to the entire process, looking with delight at the young artisan and the bone tablet in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the Tito family?"</p><p></p><p>Stan nodded, not daring to say much.</p><p></p><p>The city lord's eyes shone as he looked at the bone tablet held by Stan. His fingers, which had been about to touch the bone tablet, immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>He quickly realized that this was not only an invaluable treasure left by the great poet, but also a source of disaster capable of destroying the entire City of the Descended Gods.</p><p></p><p>Having such a thing in the City of the Descended Gods would be like burying an imminent volcano underground.</p><p></p><p>Even the city lord of the City of the Descended Gods felt extremely anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>In order to fight for the last chapter left by the great poet, and the secrets about the journey to the divine realm, he could not imagine how crazy the people of other kingdoms must be.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this young artisan who had inherited the bloodline of the saint, and the last chapter left by the great poet in his hands, the city lord's heart was filled with a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter Epilogue.</p><p></p><p>The City Lord had a few thoughts running through his mind, and immediately made a decision.</p><p></p><p>He said to the High Priest of the Inca Temple: "Immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, send him and the great poet's final chapter to the Sky Temple, to audience with Her Majesty the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"No delays are allowed."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also instructed: "You must protect him well, this is a gift from the Tito family to Her Majesty the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"And it is also a gift bestowed by the divine spirits to the Star Continent Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, a huge explosion sounded in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Burrowing Demon Worm tore through the earth and emerged, opening its horrifying maw and letting out a wail towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>And standing atop it was a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>The just-departed Prince Weiss had returned at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>The City Lord's reaction was already very quick, but he was no match for Prince Weiss' eagerness to seize the "final chapter".</p><p></p><p>The moment the City Lord saw the giant monster, he blurted out: "Ruhk Giant!"</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Prince Weiss had brought the Ruhk Giant with him, causing all of his plans to fall apart.</p><p></p><p>All the people present turned pale the moment they saw the Burrowing Demon Worm, and fear and trepidation involuntarily crept into their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even though the giant monster was still hundreds of meters away, they were already retreating in fear and terror.</p><p></p><p>This was a fear ingrained in their bloodline, a side interpretation of the invincible power of the giants over the centuries.</p><p></p><p>No matter who it was.</p><p></p><p>Whether ordinary people or soldiers, whether mortals or priests.</p><p></p><p>Or even the High Priest of the Inca Temple who wielded great power, they were all like ants before this giant monster, without the slightest will to resist or struggle.</p><p></p><p>Prince Weiss looked towards the Yesaer Palace, his gaze icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Mortals, tremble before the mythical beast!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to die, hand over what belongs to me."</p><p></p><p>"Hand it over."</p><p></p><p>The giant monster roared and charged towards the Yesaer Palace, crushing the streets into ravines along the way, and the stone buildings on both sides collapsed with a rumble as they were brushed past.</p><p></p><p>Many Trilobe people who failed to escape in time were directly crushed into a pile of bones and flesh on the main road.</p><p></p><p>Just as the giant was about to attack the Yesaer Palace, the sky suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>The bright sunlight seemed to be blocked by something immensely large, and a series of transparent, slender tentacles extended down from the high sky.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A gale swept through the entire Divine Descent City.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up to see a giant creature like a jellyfish appear in the sky, its open umbrella-like body covering the Yesaer Palace.</p><p></p><p>The sky monster and the Burrowing Demon Worm collided violently, causing the entire Divine Descent City to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble~"</p><p></p><p>Many unstable buildings in the city immediately collapsed.</p><p></p><p>This was a collision between the Volcanic Kingdom and the Star Continent Kingdom, as well as a contest of the powers of the sky and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Queen of the Star Continent Kingdom came from the body of the sky monster, echoing throughout the Divine Descent City.</p><p></p><p>"Weiss Hausen."</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the courage to run amok in my kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of the Volcanic Kingdom had no fear or reverence for the Queen: "Courage?"</p><p></p><p>"For the secrets left behind by the saint Tito, for the path to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>"What is courage worth?"</p><p></p><p>"What does the price matter?"</p><p></p><p>Weiss Hausen roared and howled, commanding the Burrowing Demon Worm to challenge the sky monster.</p><p></p><p>For this piece of bone, they were willing to break the peaceful situation that had lasted for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant starting a war.</p><p></p><p>They would not hesitate.</p>

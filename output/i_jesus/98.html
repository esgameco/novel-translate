        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The capital city of the Volcano Kingdom was built on the mountainside, so the city appeared to rise up in steps. - Flowing~*&#039;¨¯¨&#039;*·dance~ ❻➈ᔕᕼ𝕌ˣ.¢ỖＭ ~dance*&#039;¨¯¨&#039;*·~flowing-</p><p></p><p>The more noble the person, the higher their residence. At the highest point stood the magnificent palace, towering ancient castles, and the classical stone tower lighthouse.</p><p></p><p>Crouching above the volcano crater was a ferocious and terrifying Ruhuo giant lava monster.</p><p></p><p>This was the second Ruhuo giant monster of the Volcano Kingdom, symbolizing the power of lava and volcanoes, as well as representing the Volcano Kingdom and the Huosen family.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Sky Behemoth in relation to the Sky Temple of the Xilun family.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the king was in the forbidden garden filled with the Sun's Cup flowers, discussing the war with the Star Continent Kingdom with his sons, who were also military generals.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Continent Kingdom dares not deploy the power of the giant monsters. The Samo family's desert worms have appeared suddenly within the borders of the Star Continent Kingdom, just a few hundred miles from the City of the Divine Servant."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Queen of the Star Continent dares to send out the Sky Behemoth, we and the Samo family will immediately deploy the giant monsters to directly besiege the City of the Divine Servant."</p><p></p><p>"The Death Star has left, greatly reducing their naval power, and the Xilun family has always used it to guard the Sacred Mountain."</p><p></p><p>However, they were not much better off either, as the terrifying speed and air superiority of the Sky Behemoth made them equally fearful and cautious of the Sky Temple and the Xilun family.</p><p></p><p>The princes also spoke of the recent situations they had witnessed on the Sun City battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Star Continent Kingdom is being held back, they are fighting on two fronts and are almost unable to hold on..."</p><p></p><p>"The wavering Sele family, under my persuasion as a vassal, is likely to turn to our side soon."</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long..."</p><p></p><p>The sons were all showing off their achievements, as if they had already won this war, and the protagonists and greatest contributors were none other than themselves.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, everyone felt the ground beneath them shaking.</p><p></p><p>People swayed, and some even fell to the ground with a loud thud.</p><p></p><p>Violent tremors came from deep underground, the shaking of the earth made people dizzy and disoriented. In the palace, some hurriedly grabbed the columns and pressed against the walls, while others fled to the open square.</p><p></p><p>The king led the people to the open square, looking at his capital city. 💢♬➅９ⓢ𝓱𝓾Ж.ｃ๏𝓜👊🎃</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo!"</p><p></p><p>They saw the Drill Worm, originally belonging to the Volcano Kingdom, burrow through the mountain, creating a large hole beneath the capital city.</p><p></p><p>It came from the underground, having drilled through something, causing the entire capital city to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it also revived this dormant volcano.</p><p></p><p>"No, its target is the volcano!"</p><p></p><p>The king's expression changed drastically as he suddenly understood the reason for the tremors, although he did not know who the mastermind behind this was, but he immediately guessed their intention.</p><p></p><p>Building the city on the volcano was to cultivate the lava monsters, but they also knew the inherent dangers, especially the successive kings.</p><p></p><p>But the Drill Worm and the cultivation method that could achieve this were precisely in the hands of the Volcano Kingdom. The Volcano Kingdom had previously been at ease, never imagining that the Drill Worm would one day become their own nightmare.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the volcano crater and just then heard a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Then, a scene of heaven-shaking and earth-shattering proportions unfolded.</p><p></p><p>This volcano, which had been dormant for countless years, had awakened.</p><p></p><p>Surging lava erupted from deep underground, gushing out of the volcano crater and flowing down, with fiery meteors accompanied by rolling thick smoke and rumbling sounds descending from the heights.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Volcano Kingdom looked up at the erupting volcano, their faces filled with horrified expressions, including the king and the princes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the end of the world had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The once high and mighty royalty and priests, the aristocrats who ruled the entire kingdom, were all terrified to the core.</p><p></p><p>They rushed out of the castles and palaces, gathering on the streets and rushing downhill. But their speed was no match for the surging lava, and they watched helplessly as their magnificent palaces, towering ancient castles, and even the lighthouse standing tall on the heights were one by one engulfed and destroyed by the lava.</p><p></p><p>The luxurious-living royalty and the aristocrats who owned vast fishing grounds and slaves perished in agonizing wails, reduced to ashes by the scorching lava. ·.¸¸.·♩♪♫ ➅❾Ⓢнᵘ𝕏.Č𝓸Μ ♫♪♩·.¸¸.·</p><p></p><p>It was the commoners and slaves living at the foot of the mountain who reacted quickly, gathering their families and fleeing in groups towards the distant plain and desert, with most managing to escape with their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The lava monster on the heights stirred, and the Volcano Kingdom's king, riding it, plunged down with a few remaining royalty, trying to flee this land of death.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the ground heaved and rolled, and the Drill Worm appeared before him, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>The Volcano Kingdom's king could no longer maintain his dignity, and he looked at the Drill Worm in a frenzy, asking, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Weis? No, that's not it!"</p><p></p><p>"You can't be Weis."</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice came from the worm's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, esteemed Volcano King!"</p><p></p><p>"Fleeing in a panic, how unfortunate."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the posture a king should have," he said.</p><p></p><p>"As a king, when the capital falls, he should perish with it. That is what a king should do," he continued.</p><p></p><p>The Volcano King, who commanded the Lava Monsters, paused for a moment. Hearing that tone, he finally recalled who stood before him.</p><p></p><p>"It's you, Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"How did you get the Burrowing Worms? And where is Weiss?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's voice was calm. "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The King clenched his fists, his eyes bulging with rage. "Why did you do this?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel laughed. "Of course, it's because..."</p><p></p><p>"I want you dead!"</p><p></p><p>The King was practically going mad. This lowly bastard, this commoner born of black mud. How dare he, how dare he.</p><p></p><p>"You madman!"</p><p></p><p>"Because of you, the Hosen Clan lost the capital, lost hundreds of their kin."</p><p></p><p>"The Volcano Kingdom lost the foundation it had built up over hundreds of years. Do you know that?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not speak, responding only with mocking laughter. The more the King lost his composure, the more Heniel wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The great battle atop the volcano was about to erupt. With a command, the Volcano King made the Lava Monster spew scorching hot red lava.</p><p></p><p>The lava swept across the ground, but the Burrowing Worms immediately burrowed underground to avoid it. However, as soon as the Lava Monster tried to leave the volcano, the Worms would surge out to block it, their fangs and tentacles latching on.</p><p></p><p>The Lava Monster possessed power far exceeding the Burrowing Worms, once the greatest deterrent of the Volcano Kingdom. But now, faced with the Worms' abilities, it could not unleash that power.</p><p></p><p>Heniel controlled the Burrowing Worms, trapping the King and the Lava Monster on the path down the mountain. The King grew increasingly anxious, while Heniel became more and more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum hum~"</p><p></p><p>Another volcanic eruption was coming, a full-scale one this time. </p><p></p><p>Lava surged out like tidal waves, cascading down from the heights in towering, dozens-of-meter-high waves. Thick smoke rose hundreds of meters, tinged with scarlet.</p><p></p><p>The towering lava flows rolled down, engulfing the entire mountain peak, closing in on the battling Burrowing Worms and Lava Monster.</p><p></p><p>However, the Burrowing Worms burrowed underground at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>The Lava Monster was not so fortunate. The terrifying lava consumed it, its monstrous screams echoing for dozens of miles.</p><p></p><p>The Volcano King watched the lava pouring down from above, and the objects being swept away in the billowing smoke.</p><p></p><p>He let out a final roar: "Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>The name he had once given to that bastard child, "Black Mud."</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that one day, this "Black Mud" would become the terrifying black swamp that would completely devour the Volcano Kingdom and the Hosen Clan.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Heniel, controlling through spiritual projection, smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"It's all gone now," he said, gazing at the destruction, the fire, and the lava engulfing the capital. </p><p></p><p>With this single act, he had killed nearly all the rulers of the Volcano Kingdom. All those who could oppose him, those who looked down on him from above, had perished here.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what Heniel wanted.</p><p></p><p>The great armies of Samu Kingdom and their Monsters were being held back at the Volcano Kingdom's borders by the Star Realm Kingdom, engaged in an even more intense slaughter and battle there. Four Luhe Monsters and tens of thousands of soldiers clashed, with the Star Realm Queen and Samu King personally leading the fight.</p><p></p><p>Samu Kingdom had received the news and wanted to rush in to rescue the Hosen Clan, but the Star Realm Kingdom naturally would not let them have their way. </p><p></p><p>They just never expected everything here to end so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Heniel," a line of priests and nobles stood behind Heniel. These priests all had royal bloodlines, but were sidelined members or bastards, whom Heniel had been cultivating for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They had once been frustrated and unfulfilled, but now followed Heniel in his rise. </p><p></p><p>And these nobles were local lords and aristocrats - they saw in Heniel the opportunity to enter the core of power.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Heniel saw excitement, ambition, greed, and desire.</p><p></p><p>"Desire is not shameful. Wanting more is not wrong," he said.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, everything here belongs to us. I will share power and glory with you all."</p><p></p><p>Everyone knelt before Heniel, chanting his name.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, there was movement from the volcano again.</p><p></p><p>A savage, hollow sound echoed through the sky - the roar of a Monster.</p><p></p><p>The Lava Monster, consumed by the volcano, had revived. Its insect-like carapace gradually shed, and the Luhe Monster regained its true form.</p><p></p><p>It crawled across the land, heading towards the distant sea.</p><p></p><p>Without the Luhe mark, no Three-Leaf person could bind and control it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Heniel recalled the divine messenger he had encountered, and the words she had spoken:</p><p></p><p>"The gods will reclaim the power of destruction they bestowed upon the Three-Leaf people."</p>

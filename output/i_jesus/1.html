        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Yin Shen arranged to meet a friend at a tea house. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stretched out his hand from the second floor: "Over here!"</p><p></p><p>A man in the lobby immediately saw him and walked up with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut man was an online writer and also Yin Shen's college classmate. This kind of person probably knew a little bit about everything, but not in great depth. As someone to casually chat with, he was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen liked chatting with him, talking about everything under the sun - science fiction, mythology, history, astronomy, geography, military affairs, folklore, and more. </p><p></p><p>It wasn't very rigorous, just random rambling, but it made one feel relaxed.</p><p></p><p>This time the two went from talking about history to mythology, then from mythology to strange novels, interspersed with Western eerie rumors.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen suddenly said, "Recently, when I fall asleep at midnight every night, I always feel like another self suddenly crawls out of my body."</p><p></p><p>"And all night long, I'm watching myself, until I wake up."</p><p></p><p>"It's kind of like..."</p><p>"The Western concept of astral projection, and the demonic possession from your novels."</p><p></p><p>"What do you think is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Instead of laughing at Yin Shen's absurd words, the crew-cut man seriously considered it for a moment before organizing his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"First, we need to figure out, if humans truly have souls, what are human souls composed of?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they matter or energy?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen pondered for a moment, then said uncertainly, "It seems like neither."</p><p></p><p>The crew-cut man then asked, "What about memories and consciousness? Are they in the soul, or still in the brain?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen said with certainty, "They're in the soul."</p><p></p><p>"I feel like my body is an anchor point, anchoring my soul to this point."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like I just need to struggle a little to go out, but I feel like if I go out, something terrible will happen."</p><p></p><p>"This feeling inexplicably arouses a sense of panic in my heart, so I don't dare go any further."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen suddenly laughed, "Do you think I'm about to awaken some supernatural power or start cultivating immortality?"</p><p></p><p>But the crew-cut man shook his head, "For now, let's not discuss whether what you said is true or not. If humans really do have souls that are neither matter nor energy, and memories and consciousness can be stored in them, then it's not something that can be compared to supernatural powers or immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Things like astral projection and demonic possession are just imaginary existences conceived by the ancients. Compared to that, it would be like the difference between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Even the deities in historical myths, the immortals in Taoist legends, cannot compare to this kind of existence."</p><p></p><p>"Even Pangu who created the universe, the Lord God the creator, Brahma, Chaos, Azathoth, would be powerless against you."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen stood dumbfounded upon hearing this. They were just talking about the human soul, how did it escalate to these supreme creators and deities from various mythologies?</p><p></p><p>"What you're saying is going too far. Could there really be something so formidable?"  </p><p></p><p>"According to what you're saying, if humans have souls, they would be invincible.

You could transcend beyond this universe, even unbound by time."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, isn't that the case?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen continued, "Then doesn't that mean, once the soul separates from the physical body's constraints, it would immediately depart from this universe?"</p><p></p><p>"The soul could even transcend the river of time, traverse space and years, becoming an existence drifting above the timeline?"</p><p></p><p>"I could even freely travel to any era, even alter history?"</p><p></p><p>But the short-haired man expressed his own thoughts, "That's not necessarily true."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen asked, "Why not?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man said, "As I mentioned earlier, the soul you described and this universe are like two non-overlapping planes. Two non-overlapping planes fundamentally have no intersecting points."</p><p></p><p>"Since you have no connection to the universe, from what perspective would you perceive the existence of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot even perceive the universe, how could you perceive time, let alone traverse the timeline?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen suddenly had an answer to the source of that dread in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying, once the soul separates from the body, it would be like a ship that has lost its coordinates and direction, likely to drift away from this universe, never to find its way back?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man nodded, "One possibility is that you still maintain a connection between your existence and the real universe, an anchor point here."</p><p></p><p>"That way, you could observe this universe through that anchor point, becoming an observer drifting outside the universe and time, as I mentioned before."</p><p></p><p>"If you have different anchor points at different time periods..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's even possible that it could become like what you said, becoming an existence that shuttles through timelines."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the words of the short-haired man became gloomy. </p><p></p><p>"But there is also another possibility."</p><p></p><p>"At the moment you detach from the anchor of your physical body, you may be cast out into the unknowable realm beyond the universe."</p><p></p><p>"That place could be another universe, or it could be the source of time itself, or another dimension or an unknown that humans cannot even imagine."</p><p></p><p>"There may be nothing at all there, like a prison, and your soul would be trapped there for a trillion years, a billion years."</p><p></p><p>"Until..."  </p><p></p><p>"Eternity."</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent, and no one spoke for a long while.</p><p></p><p>At this point, however, the short-haired man suddenly laughed and poured more tea for Yin Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Your idea is not bad, quite novel."</p><p></p><p>"I want to use this premise for my next book, it might become popular?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man didn't take what Yin Shen said seriously, thinking it was just another unbridled flight of imagination and unrestrained rambling as usual.</p><p></p><p>However, Yin Shen's mind was complicated, and he stood up to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go first!"</p><p></p><p>"If you do write it, or if you have any new ideas and thoughts, remember to tell me, and we can discuss them together."</p><p></p><p>However, the short-haired man stopped him and took something out of his backpack.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Shen, don't go yet."</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm using your premise, let me give you a nice gift."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen took the box the short-haired man gave him and opened it. Inside was an irregularly shaped stone with an exquisite insect pattern on it.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? A fossil?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man said, "A Redlichia, a type of trilobite."</p><p></p><p>"Although this fossil is not worth much money, just think about being able to see a living creature from billions of years ago appear vividly before your eyes - that kind of shock is priceless."</p><p></p><p>"Take it home and display it, imagine and feel the ancient Earth and these ancient creatures from billions of years ago!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen thanked the short-haired man and walked away while looking at the gift.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he reached the lobby, an out-of-control car suddenly sped from the street outside at over 100 miles per hour, crashing through the glass doors of the lobby and crushing Yin Shen with layers of shattered glass.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shen, holding the fossil, was struck away like a rag.</p><p></p><p>In the pool of blood, Yin Shen's gaze gradually blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Who was driving so recklessly to go from the main road all the way into the restaurant lobby?"</p><p></p><p>But when he finally saw clearly, he suddenly felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p>

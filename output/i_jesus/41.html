        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The new mythical life form, though a combination of the powers of life and wisdom, could not be said to transcend the previous two, but rather existed in parallel to them. </p><p></p><p>Its power was that of dreams and illusions, or one could say the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>A force born from the powers of life and wisdom, yet distinctly different.</p><p></p><p>Leadley's power possessed an ability akin to mind-reading, able to manifest thoughts into a supernatural spiritual force. This newborn mythical life could neither read minds nor manifest thoughts into spiritual force, yet it could create dreams and invade the dreams of others.</p><p></p><p>Shally's power enabled her to create life and gain immortality, able to freely change her form, even altering her size.</p><p></p><p>It certainly could not achieve immortality, but its lifespan far exceeded that of the Trilians. Its body, like Shally's, was wondrous, possessing the ability to travel between the dream realm and reality.</p><p></p><p>Yin took out the Sun Cup, and its bud automatically unfurled.</p><p></p><p>The head within the cup slowly opened its eyes and yawned. </p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Then, it saw Yin.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, it felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>It retracted its head back inside, and the unfurled bud tried to close up again.</p><p></p><p>But Yin reached out his hand, and it could no longer move.</p><p></p><p>Yin used his wisdom power to input the language of the Kingdom of Hynxei into his mind, then communicated with it.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup looked up at Yin with a dazed expression: "Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>Yin could sense it rapidly familiarizing itself with the knowledge and language he had imparted: "Has anyone given you a name before? Or have you given yourself one?"</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup looked around at its surroundings, shrinking back as it gazed at Yin.</p><p></p><p>"Then...who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Yin chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"They all call me God."</p><p></p><p>"You can call me that too if you like."</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup still didn't quite understand: "What is a god?"</p><p></p><p>Yin had heard this question many times before: "Roughly speaking, it is an existence with immense power, so powerful that mortals can scarcely comprehend it!"</p><p></p><p>Yin's explanation resonated deeply with this newborn mythical creature.</p><p></p><p>"Then I want to be called God too."</p><p></p><p>The Sun Cup's stem swayed, and the fear it had felt moments ago gave way to contemplation, as if taking on a formidable name was of utmost importance, filling it with immense excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Shall I be called the Flower God?"</p><p></p><p>"No...I'll be called the Sun God."</p><p></p><p>"The Illusion God or Dream God would work too."</p><p></p><p>Its thoughts leapt rapidly, unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Yin looked at it and said: "God is just a title, not a name."</p><p></p><p>"When you possess power transcending all else, the name God will be bestowed upon you by others."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sun Cup...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sunflower's head looked at Yinshen, then lowered its gaze to look at itself. </p><p></p><p>It felt very small and weak.</p><p></p><p>The title "God" probably had nothing to do with it!</p><p></p><p>This made it feel a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>Yinshen noticed its dejection and spoke to guide it in choosing a name for itself.</p><p></p><p>"I also know of a sun god named Apollo, but besides having the same golden color as the sun, you have no other relation to the sun."</p><p></p><p>The sun cup felt provoked and became unhappy: "What kind of name is Apollo, it doesn't sound good at all."</p><p></p><p>Yinshen said to this somewhat childish new mythical being: "Then what do you plan to call yourself?"</p><p></p><p>The sun cup raised its head: "I've decided. My new name is 69shu.com"</p><p></p><p>"I'll just call myself Poluo!"  </p><p></p><p>Yinshen: "Boluo?"</p><p></p><p>The little head in the flower cup seemed to hear the teasing in Yinshen's tone: "It's Poluo."</p><p></p><p>--------------------</p><p></p><p>On the steps outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>Poluo swayed as he headed downwards, his stalk moving no slower than legs, but he still felt it wasn't fast enough.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the steep stairs and suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He flipped over the huge flower cup, and the cup became a shining golden robe, covering the lower half of the stem and roots.</p><p></p><p>Wearing just the robe exposing his head, he looked like a child in clothes.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p>He leapt up, gliding down from the heights.</p><p></p><p>The shining golden robe swayed in the wind as he slid down.</p><p></p><p>"Woahhhh!"</p><p>"Look at me riding the wind."</p><p>"Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>In the valley, he passed through the ruined city and wandered through the marshes.</p><p></p><p>With his body covered by the robe, his movement didn't look like running but more like a snake or ghost gliding along the ground.</p><p></p><p>He could disappear from the real world at any time and leap into his dream realm.</p><p></p><p>He was a being existing between reality and dreams, happily roaming the realm of the gods, the garden of the racing gods.</p><p></p><p>Life on the island wasn't too exciting, but it was quite pleasant.</p><p></p><p>However, Poluo was clearly not a child content with solitude. Unlike Yinshen and Shali, he had a strong curiosity and yearned for the fresh novelties of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the beach, gazing out towards the distant sea.</p><p></p><p>Finally,</p><p>He came before the god.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe!"</p><p>"Great deity!"</p><p></p><p>He twisted his body shyly, as if making an embarrassed request.</p><p></p><p>After spending so much time together, he was no longer as afraid of Yinshen.</p><p></p><p>The god didn't even look at him, but could already see his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the temple good enough?"</p><p>"Or is this island not big enough?"</p><p>"And is the outside world definitely better than here?"</p><p></p><p>Poluo shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Bolo shook his head: "Oh God!"</p><p></p><p>"This place is nice, but it's unchanging, just like the great You, eternal and magnificent."</p><p></p><p>"The outside world can't compare to Your kingdom, but the outside world is constantly changing."</p><p></p><p>Longing shone in Bolo's eyes. </p><p></p><p>"Out there!"</p><p></p><p>"Every day new people and things appear."  </p><p></p><p>"Each morning is different, each person and city has fresh stories."</p><p></p><p>Bolo circled around the deity's feet like a child, pleading with him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he said with some coyness:</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't You go to the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so interesting and lively there!"</p><p></p><p>The God Yin clearly wasn't buying Bolo's act: "I don't like noise and commotion."</p><p></p><p>Bolo carefully asked: "Is it because You can't truly descend into this world?"</p><p></p><p>God Yin's gaze dropped, and Bolo immediately trembled and knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"How did you know that?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo said tremblingly: "I found out from Shari!"</p><p></p><p>God Yin: "Shari couldn't possibly have told you."</p><p></p><p>Although a bit afraid, Bolo was still proud of his actions: "I saw it in Shari's dreams."</p><p></p><p>This was a little rascal. </p><p></p><p>An impulsive little rascal who spoke without thinking, doing whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>God Yin didn't speak, his mind immersed in the mythical shell, without much thought to chat with this little rascal.</p><p></p><p>But Bolo bounced around behind the God, like a child trying to get an adult's attention.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Then let the clever and wise Bolo solve Your troubles! I can definitely find a way for You to descend into this world."</p><p></p><p>"Then as Your messenger, I'll travel the world's greatest cities with You."</p><p></p><p>The child spun around excitedly, saying:</p><p></p><p>"You and Your cleverest messenger Bolo will taste the most delicious food, smell the most fragrant flowers."</p><p></p><p>"Feel the wind on the mountains, feel the ocean waves, listen to faraway foreigners recount their life journeys and interesting stories."</p><p></p><p>God Yin smiled at Bolo's innocence and fearlessness, while also seeing through his little scheme.</p><p></p><p>"You just want to go out and play!"</p><p></p><p>"Using lies to deceive God, do you know the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>Bolo became afraid: "Bolo may not be able to do it, but Bolo can go outside and find someone who can."</p><p></p><p>God Yin meant to give this boastful dream lord and brat a taste of his power, to let him know everyone must be responsible for their words and actions.</p><p></p><p>"If you can't do it, I'll confine you to the dream world."</p><p></p><p>"For a hundred years you won't be allowed out."</p><p></p><p>God Yin's move struck at Bolo's weakness, making him shudder with dread.</p><p></p><p>What he feared most was loneliness.</p>

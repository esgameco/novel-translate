        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd gathered in the royal palace consisted of soldiers, attendants, generals, nobles, and priests. They packed the once spacious palace to the brim.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all eyes were fixed on Heniel, who stood by the throne and gripped the scepter of Hinsai.</p><p></p><p>Among those gazes, there was shock, worship, hatred, and ambition.</p><p></p><p>Only Stan Tito was different. He blankly stared at the stone sarcophagus.</p><p></p><p>He did not care who became the king, nor did he care who would rise to the peak of power.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Queen passed away?" </p><p></p><p>He found it hard to accept that the Queen had died just like that, feeling a sense of collapse similar to the legendary Yesser King witnessing the shattering of the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>In Stan's eyes, the Queen was so noble and powerful. The might of the sky behemoth was almost divine in his imagination, soaring through the clouds and the heavens. There was nothing in the world of Hinsai that could defeat it.</p><p></p><p>He still vividly remembered the scene of himself, a mere craftsman and commoner, stepping into this place, while the Queen stood by the window, her body bathed in the sun's radiance. </p><p></p><p>That image was so sacred and beautiful. She kindly asked for his name, and her smile gave the awkward craftsman's son the courage back.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time he experienced the bearing of a true ruler.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito pushed his way to the front and approached the throne, asking Heniel, "Grand Duke of Volcanoes, how exactly did the Queen pass away?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel bowed his head and said in a sorrowful, heavy tone, "The Queen died under the loss of control of the sky behemoth. Although the reason for the monster's rampage remains unknown, it must be related to the Sele Kingdom and the Samo Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"This scene was witnessed by all the armies of the kingdoms."</p><p></p><p>Heniel sighed, "Alas, I was busy attacking the City of Sea Witches at the time, and could not arrive in time to save the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"However," Heniel declared, "the Queen's passing does not mean everything is over."</p><p></p><p>"I, Heniel, will make those who harmed the Queen pay the price, and I will also inherit her will."</p><p></p><p>Heniel's roar won cheers from the soldiers and generals present. </p><p></p><p>Soon, the nobles and priests also began to applaud sporadically, looking around.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito had received the answer, and he believed it, as if this was the only way the noble and powerful Star Raven Queen could have fallen.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the fierce battle between the sky behemoth and the burrowing demon worms in the City of Divine Descent, where the city was destroyed and the palace collapsed. </p><p></p><p>He had also seen the Samo Kingdom's behemoth break into the city, with people fleeing in panic and thousands trampling each other.</p><p></p><p>Now, he experienced the death and terror brought by the behemoths once again.</p><p></p><p>He murmured, "Oh Ruhe, the divine gift!"</p><p></p><p>"Why do you always bring destruction?"</p><p></p><p>Heniel announced that he was taking over the City of Divine Servants, and proclaimed his policies to all. In order to prevent a potential war with the Samo Kingdom, he made military deployments and personnel arrangements.</p><p></p><p>These series of actions allowed Heniel to start controlling the City of Divine Servants and the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>The crowd dispersed, leaving Heniel, the center of the storm, and Stan Tito behind.</p><p></p><p>Heniel nodded to Stan Tito, "Lucky son, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's expression was sorrowful. "Yes, but I never imagined it would be like this."</p><p></p><p>"I still remember what you once told me - only those who go against the current can master their own fate and the world."</p><p></p><p>The Lucky Son looked up at Heniel and forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Grand Duke Heniel."</p><p></p><p>Heniel stared intently into Stan Tito's eyes and suddenly asked, "Lucky son, do you think I will become the king?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito paused for a moment. "That is not for me to know."</p><p></p><p>Heniel had prepared himself to ascend the throne, but throughout history, no one of his background had ever become a king. </p><p></p><p>He hoped that the great...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The descendant of Saint Tito, the recognized lucky son, came to pay tribute to him, proving the legitimacy of his ascension to the throne, as he was blessed by the divine.</p><p></p><p>"If I become the king, would you be willing to bless me?"</p><p></p><p>"If that day truly comes, I hope you can hold up the chapter of Saint Tito, and stand by my left side."</p><p></p><p>"Even, I am willing to hand over the Sky Temple to you."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was even more astonished: "I am just an ordinary person, not a priest."</p><p></p><p>Henir was obviously not a person who followed the rules, he was someone accustomed to breaking conventions.</p><p></p><p>"So what?"</p><p></p><p>"Does serving the divine rely on power?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it relies on piety towards the divine."</p><p></p><p>Henir looked at him seriously: "Descendant of the Saint, the most pious lucky son."</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't someone like you, who controls the Sky Temple and serves the great Insai God, be the one?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito: "If that day truly comes, I will consider it."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito did not immediately agree, but he also did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>This was also in line with his usual character, low-key and weak.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary person who went with the flow.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>The mansion of the Saint family suddenly had an uninvited guest, who had climbed over the wall and entered the courtyard in the middle of the night.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito woke up in the middle of the night and received this visitor, who was the high priest of the Insai God Temple in the once divine-descended city, and also one of his few friends in the Star Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The priest looked a bit rushed, constantly panting.</p><p></p><p>The first sentence he spoke made Stan Tito's expression change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"There is a problem with the Queen's death."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito immediately stood up: "What's the problem? Where is the problem?"</p><p></p><p>The priest leaned in: "Before the Queen was killed in battle, Henir had given orders to his subordinates to wait for an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Henir had already known about the Queen's death and had prepared for it."</p><p></p><p>The priest angrily slammed the table, his eyes full of bloodshot: "This is all a conspiracy, Henir must be involved in the Queen's death."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito: "How do you know this?"</p><p></p><p>The priest continued: "I never believed Henir's words, to investigate the true cause of the Queen's death, I controlled this person."</p><p></p><p>"I read this information from his memories."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the priest took out an object.</p><p></p><p>It was a newborn Sun Cup, only the size of a palm, with a magical symbol engraved on the delicate golden flower cup.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito did not reach out, but asked, "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The priest handed this object to him, letting Stan Tito take it.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Sun Cup with an illusion spell cast on it, I have made a few of them."</p><p></p><p>"The information and images I have read are inside, if you encounter any danger, it can also help you."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito hesitated for a moment, but still took the Sun Cup.</p><p></p><p>He asked the priest: "Why give it to me?"</p><p></p><p>The priest: "Henir has already set his sights on me, if anything happens to me, these secrets may never be discovered."</p><p></p><p>"Stan!"</p><p></p><p>"Although you don't have the power of wisdom, I believe you have extraordinary potential and strength."</p><p></p><p>"You are the descendant of Saint Tito, the chosen lucky son."</p><p></p><p>"From the first time I met you, I felt that you must be bearing a great mission on your shoulders, just like your ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The priest looked at Stan Tito with sincere eyes, as if trying to convey his innermost thoughts to him.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito was silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, not making eye contact with the priest.</p><p></p><p>"You think too highly of me, I'm just an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>The priest laughed: "The beginning of a legend is always ordinary and common."</p><p></p><p>He left Stan Tito's mansion and set out on the main road of the God Servant City under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw shadows lengthening and sliding across the other side.</p><p></p><p>The priest immediately sensed something amiss and quickly ran towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>Turning the street corner, the sounds of battle and slaughter could be heard.</p>

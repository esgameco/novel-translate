        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Sky Temple was finally completed after much toil and struggle. Including the time spent beforehand, it took over a decade to fully construct. </p><p></p><p>This divine hall, which consumed half the national strength of the Kingdom of Hein and Yeser's heart and soul, stood towering like its name, as if suspended in the sky itself.</p><p></p><p>This was an unimaginable great spectacle, fit only for deities and their servants to reside within such a palace. </p><p></p><p>Yeser looked up, his gaze piercing through the sea of clouds to catch a glimpse of the Sky Temple's corner.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally built."</p><p></p><p>With an anxious heart, he walked along the road like celestial stairs.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain arms to both sides were carved colossal statues hundreds of meters tall - two kneeling kings welcoming the descent of the divine.</p><p></p><p>This path could only be trodden by the ruler of Hein and the deities themselves. </p><p></p><p>Others wishing to ascend could only take the side paths up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yeser proceeded upwards along this road, excitement and anxiety welling up in his chest until he almost couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>He gazed longingly at the Sky Temple high above, murmuring:</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you see? This is my gift to you."  </p><p></p><p>"Like my father Redrik, I am devoted in such pious worship of you."</p><p></p><p>He stepped into the temple, standing expectantly in the center of the magnificent hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple, besides the exquisitely carved divine statues, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>The first year, the king went to the Sky Temple to hear the divine words, but the deity never descended.</p><p></p><p>The second year, Yeser knelt before the statue.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"If you hear my prayers, please grant me revelation!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeser listens to your will, accepts your guidance and arrangement of my fate."</p><p></p><p>The king went again to the Sky Temple to hear the divine words, but the deity did not appear.</p><p></p><p>The tenth year.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose in the east and set on the other side, while the stars appeared in the darkness.  </p><p></p><p>In that darkness, the gradually aging Yeser knelt alone in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"God has not come!"</p><p></p><p>Yeser gazed up hopelessly at the divine statue in the Sky Temple. Unlike his father's carving, that statue was mysterious yet warm, like the light of the stars.</p><p></p><p>This statue he had carved himself was magnificent and imposing.</p><p></p><p>"Have I really made a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"If I am wrong, then give me a sign, or punish me."</p><p></p><p>He knelt beneath the statue, his voice choked with sobs.</p><p></p><p>"Please don't..."</p><p></p><p>"Please don't...abandon us."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the high priest Schloed of the Sky Temple suddenly walked out.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Come, come to Yesser's back. </p><p></p><p>He humbly stooped and knelt behind Yesser.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"God has not abandoned us, he has always been here."</p><p></p><p>Yesser turned his head: "Have you heard God's revelation again?"</p><p></p><p>Schloder looked at the statue of God with extreme fanaticism. </p><p></p><p>"God has bestowed divine powers upon me, this is God's revelation."</p><p></p><p>"God is unwilling to descend because of the sinners, those sinners punished into the abyss by God but who arbitrarily escaped."</p><p></p><p>"They fled the abyss, disturbing God's domain."</p><p></p><p>"Only by eliminating them, driving them back into the abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Will God look upon us again."</p><p></p><p>Having been the high priest for so many years, controlling this sky temple and the magnificent city, he had become a privileged figure second only to the King of the Hein Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>His demeanor became mysterious and ethereal, and his speech became lofty and possessed a bewitching power.</p><p></p><p>Time and again he proclaimed himself as the one who received God's revelation, claiming he was the priest chosen by God.</p><p></p><p>What he could not accept, of course, was the notion that the people of Hein were abandoned by God.  </p><p></p><p>If the people of Hein were abandoned by God,</p><p></p><p>Then what was he, the high priest of this sky temple? What was he, this man of divine revelation?</p><p></p><p>He.</p><p></p><p>Could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>The guards who rushed from the God-descended City brought news from the distant sea.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"The sinners killed the lord of Siren City, and half of Siren City's people were massacred."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until...wait until..." The guard was extremely grieved, it seemed some of the dead were people he knew.</p><p></p><p>"When the high priest arrived, those sinners had all fled."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"We lost so many people!"</p><p></p><p>The sinners rampaged like beasts in the sea, plundering the Trifolium people's fishing grounds, attacking Trifolium cities.</p><p></p><p>The fusion monsters had also slaughtered countless sinners over the years, yet the sinners only became more rampant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those sinners became increasingly cunning and vicious, massacring the people of the Hein Kingdom in retaliation, resulting in the current situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were only seven fusion monsters in total, most scattered across coastal cities, unable to go deep to suppress the sinners.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Hein Kingdom were increasingly unwilling to venture into the distant seas, one by one fleeing back to the nearby seas or onto the mainland cities, gradually losing control over the distant seas.</p><p></p><p>If this continues,</p><p></p><p>The ocean may no longer belong to the Hein Kingdom in the future, but to these sinners instead.</p><p></p><p>Aside,</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The minister said, "But that is the sea area near the land blessed by the gods. If it is occupied by the sinful people..."</p><p></p><p>He did not finish speaking, but Yesaier knew that this would be a huge blow to his prestige. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the high priest Sholod jumped out again to express his view.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"It is these sinful people who have disturbed the gods, causing the gods to be unwilling to descend upon the city in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"If we can expel these sinful people before the eyes of the gods, the gods will surely see it."</p><p></p><p>Yesaier turned to look at Sholod. He originally wanted to say something else, but after observing some details, he suddenly asked:</p><p></p><p>"Sholod."</p><p>"Why haven't you aged?"</p><p></p><p>Sholod said in his mysterious and bewitching tone: "Your Majesty!"</p><p>"It is because of the divine power bestowed by the gods, the power of the Sun Chalice."</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice on his shoulder swayed, casting a golden glow on his body, making him appear mysterious and sacred.</p><p></p><p>He did not know about it before, and only recently discovered the secret within.</p><p></p><p>After merging with the Sun Chalice, he himself had become a form of life between a plant and an animal.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Chalice extended his lifespan, and he estimated that his lifespan would be more than half longer than that of an ordinary three-leaf person.</p><p></p><p>He had long intended to demonstrate his divine power to the King of Wisdom, thereby gaining greater power and recognition.</p><p></p><p>He urged Yesaier again: "Your Majesty!"</p><p>"This is divine powerâ€”the power of the Chalice of the Gods."</p><p>"The Sun Chalice is not only the power bestowed upon us by the gods to perfect our wisdom and ability, but it also grants us the sublimation of life. Only by fully merging with the Chalice of the Gods can we obtain the true power bestowed by the divine grace."</p><p></p><p>"This is the miracle bestowed by the Insai God, and it also represents that his glory has never left us."</p><p></p><p>Yesaier's body was aging, and he was no longer as healthy as before, able to easily cross the sea and engage in battles.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Yesaier had some aversion to the power obtained by introducing foreign objects into his body, but at this moment, he was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really possible?"</p><p></p><p>Sholod demonstrated his power to him, the symbiotic power of the Sun Chalice, and the divine art of the Illusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Drink the Sun Chalice, and you will gain divine power."</p><p>"Merge with the Sun Chalice, and you will be one with the gods."</p><p></p><p>He opened the illusion art, and the palace turned into an ocean, and the stone slabs turned into water surfaces.</p><p></p><p>Sholod walked on the water surface and knelt before Yesaier.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, look."</p><p>"This is the power bestowed upon us by the gods!"</p><p>"Just like the bestowed power and grace, it is a divine art originating from the gods."</p><p>"You are the king of Heinxai, and the power bestowed by the gods belongs to you."</p><p>"As long as..."</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yesaier City. New69bookbar.com</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand monsters surrounded Yesaier City and engaged in killing and fierce battles with the soldiers guarding the city. Rays of light shone into the sea bottom from the surface, and corpses floated up from the sea bottom one after another. </p><p></p><p>These sinners possessed formidable combat power, they were frenzied and bloodthirsty.</p><p></p><p>Although the defending soldiers were trained, their peaceful lives made them unable to compare with these monsters that emerged killing from the deep sea abyss. </p><p></p><p>Adding to the monsters' vast numbers, the defenders of Yesaier City were forced to retreat step-by-step, fleeing from the surface into the city.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The lord of Yesaier City, riding a giant shrimp, fought fiercely with these monsters on the sea surface with a group of people, but was eventually surrounded and killed by a monster over two meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Along with the giant shrimp he was riding, he became food for the monsters.</p><p></p><p>The guards under the lord shouted for the lord's son to leave.</p><p></p><p>"We can't hold on anymore, Yesaier City is done for."</p><p>"Quick, go tell the king!"</p><p>"The descendants of the blasphemer Ensi, they've returned."</p><p></p><p>The lord's son was terrified by the dense monsters on the distant sea surface and fled for his life, while the guards blocked the pursuing monsters for him.</p><p></p><p>As the guards were killed one by one, thousands upon thousands of monsters rushed towards the undersea city and slaughtered their way in.</p><p></p><p>The massacre descended, no one survived.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier City.</p><p></p><p>Had fallen.</p><p></p><p>The monsters occupied this prosperous undersea domain, seizing their fishing grounds and everything.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, a few injured tritons crawled out from the sea bottom.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly crawled ashore and entered the God-descended city.</p><p></p><p>Yesaier was woken up in the middle of the night and entered the great palace to receive the lord's son, who was also a descendant of Yesaier, one of the royal bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>He knelt weeping in the great hall, and the first words out of his mouth were:</p><p></p><p>"King!"</p><p>"Yesaier City...is gone."</p><p></p><p>Yesaier immediately stood up and looked at him gravely.</p><p>"Gone?"</p><p>"What happened to Yesaier City? Where is your father?"</p><p></p><p>He recounted bit by bit the tragedy that occurred in Yesaier City, speaking with a trembling voice, as if he dared not recall that inhumanely cruel scene.</p><p></p><p>"Father is dead, eaten alive by those sinners."</p><p>"It's estimated that no one in all of Yesaier City survived."</p><p>"King!"</p><p>"Those sinners exiled by the gods have crawled out from the abyss of the sea bottom again."</p><p></p><p>Yesaier's pupils dilated.</p><p></p><p>So many years had passed, he had thought he would never again have anything to do with Ensi and Buen, but never expected to encounter them again in this way.</p><p></p><p>The ministers of the Xinyanse Kingdom immediately stepped forward: "King!"</p><p>"We must take back Yesaier City, it is our most important undersea domain..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The City."</p><p></p><p>"We have several other cities and numerous villages in the deep sea. Once these sinners gain a foothold, they will all be under threat." </p><p></p><p>Yeser had no intention of giving up Yeser City either, but these sinners were different from the people of Heinxai.</p><p></p><p>These abyss sinners were deprived of the higher wisdom bestowed by the gods, degenerating into existences like trilobites and ancestral fish, their bloodlines almost no longer belonging to the trilobite people.</p><p></p><p>The power of the King of Wisdom could do nothing about them.</p><p></p><p>Yeser pondered for a moment and then decided on a strategy. "Send a few priests with the Luhu Giants to take back Yeser City!"</p><p></p><p>"Expel these sinners and drive them back into the abyss."</p><p></p><p>Although the reappearance of the sinners shocked Yeser, it was not a major crisis for him.</p><p></p><p>It was just that this incident gave Yeser an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, there was an accident at the temple built for the gods, and even the statue of the gods that he had carved with his own hands had collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Now the sinners punished by the gods had reappeared in the territory of the Kingdom of Heinxai, as if the gods were truly bringing down a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Several priests of the gods, riding on strange shrimp, advanced wave after wave, with the leader standing on the head of the Luhu Giant.</p><p></p><p>From afar, they saw the monsters rampaging in the sea, and the leading royal priest showed a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>"Ugly monsters should stay obediently in the abyss."</p><p></p><p>The dozens-of-meters-tall giant descended on Yeser City, its terrifying tentacles spreading hundreds of meters from the sea, one tentacle after another strangling, tearing, and piercing through those monsters.</p><p></p><p>In the ocean, no one could resist them.</p><p></p><p>The mythical Luhu Giants, servants of the gods from the Shari clan.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the fusion monsters immediately caused those occupying Yeser City to flee in panic, not even daring to look back.</p><p></p><p>But it did not end there.</p><p></p><p>They scattered into the ocean, running away whenever they encountered fusion monsters, but specifically plundering and attacking villages or even cities without fusion monster guards.</p><p></p><p>One or two fusion monsters could guard a city, but could not guard such a vast sea area, let alone drive them out and exterminate them completely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these monsters bred extremely quickly, and after entering this fishing ground of the Kingdom of Heinxai and having access to food, even more so.</p><p></p><p>The more monsters were killed, the more there were, while the trilobite people were exhausted from fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Under Yeser's rule, his people and the descendants of Ensi in this sea area began their destined confrontation in this unexpected way.</p><p></p><p>Hatred still spread through their bloodlines, and the killing never ceased.</p><p></p><p>---------------------</p><p></p><p>In the Garden of the Divine Cup in the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>This indoor garden had now become a sea of golden flowers, among which...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Sun's Chalice was filled with seeds carefully nurtured by the High Priest Shlod.</p><p></p><p>Shlod waved his hand, and the water from the basin he was holding was scattered into the soil. </p><p></p><p>This was the power of a High Priest.</p><p></p><p>When Shlod was inspecting the Sun's Chalice, he was accidentally pricked by its root system.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a cry of pain.</p><p></p><p>Then he discovered that the roots of this Sun's Chalice were actually drilling into his bony armor and flesh, as if trying to merge with his flesh and grow together with him.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Shlod had a sudden realization - could the true purpose of the Sun's Chalice not just be to consume its pollen, but to combine with oneself, to fully master the power of this divine creation?</p><p></p><p>Shlod had already realized that the Sun's Chalice was a half-plant, half-animal existence. Seeing it drill into his flesh now further confirmed his speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Divine creation."</p><p>"I knew it couldn't be that simple."</p><p></p><p>Shlod was extremely excited and immediately began researching in this direction. He felt that not only had he become the first High Priest, but perhaps he would also pioneer a way to wield divine power.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated attempts and constantly communicating with the Sun's Chalice using his wisdom and power, Shlod actually managed to grow the Sun's Chalice into his own body, making it a part of himself.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The stone door opened, and Shlod walked out from the Divine Chalice Garden.</p><p></p><p>His appearance had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Roots extended along the cracks in Shlod's bony armor, taking root in his flesh, deeply integrated with his organs and fully merged with him.</p><p></p><p>This was unseen within his body, but on the outside...</p><p></p><p>The flower cup of the Sun's Chalice on his shoulder swayed in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Bizarre, yet with an extraordinary, uncanny beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Divine technique!"</p><p>"Realm of Illusion!"</p><p></p><p>Shlod waved his hand, and the Sun's Chalice protruding from his shoulder bloomed, scattering golden light within dozens of meters.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who smelled the fragrance would fall into the illusion created by Shlod. He could directly influence the area dozens of meters around him - even divine priests could not escape the illusions he created.</p><p></p><p>This was a power rivaling that of the mighty Luhug monster, the power of an alternate path.</p><p></p><p>Shlod was extremely excited, feeling he had found the right path.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p>"This power is too powerful!"</p><p>"This is the true power bestowed upon us by the divine!"</p><p></p><p>However, the priests beside him looked at Shlod with concern, as this bizarre form seemed rather abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"High Priest Shlod!"</p><p>"Is this really okay? They are not dead things, but living beings."</p><p>"The divine bestowed power, but perhaps this is not how it should be used."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other's doubt, Shlod looked at them with displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Do you need to speculate the will of the divine? I am the one who receives divine revelation."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A crystal stone containing the mythical power of wisdom was attached to Sander's forehead. As the divine messenger activated the power within the crystal, the silver mythical blood inside it became alive and vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"The power is bestowed."</p><p></p><p>Sander began to levitate in mid-air as silver radiance surged into his body from all directions.</p><p></p><p>He saw the figure of Stan Tito, as well as another more ancient shadow.</p><p></p><p>The two figures circled around him, as if whispering in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they merged with him.</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger told Sander, "Now, you have inherited the power of the two generations of saints, Stan Tito and the great poet. There are few in the realm of Xinyinxai whose wisdom and power exceed yours."</p><p></p><p>Sander did not feel excited. His expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger asked him, "Why aren't you excited? With such great power, shouldn't you be thrilled?"</p><p></p><p>Sander replied, "This is not my power, it is the power of the saints."</p><p></p><p>"I am merely the temporary custodian of this power."</p><p></p><p>"It does not belong to any one person. It is the realization of the hopes and dreams of the two generations of saints, the force that will propel the future of Xinyinxai."</p><p></p><p>Sander looked into the fairy's eyes: "So I know how I should use it, and I will never abuse it."</p><p></p><p>"I will not be conceited for possessing it, nor will I lose myself because of its greatness."</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger was surprised: "Now I understand why Stan Tito chose you."</p><p></p><p>Sander followed the divine messenger and left the fairy realm, riding a ferryman's boat through the dreamscape of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>They finally arrived at the edge of the dreamworld and saw the fantastical sun.</p><p></p><p>As the divine messenger approached the sun, its dreamlike form gradually revealed its inner contours - a golden holy grail.</p><p></p><p>Sander's eyes were dazzled by the brilliant light, and only the power emanating from his spirit could vaguely perceive the outside situation.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>The fairy of the dreamworld told him, "This is the item the great poet brought back. You should know its name."</p><p></p><p>"The divine artifact - the Holy Grail."</p><p></p><p>Sander dared not speak. He had seen it in the great poet's "The Final Chapter", knowing the great poet had gone to the divine realm to return this relic left in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a divine object, he did not dare to lift his head. In his humble opinion, being able to bask in the light of the divine artifact was the greatest honor.</p><p></p><p>The fairy watched as the sun slowly rotated, until the Holy Grail faced the other side, and then said, "Do you see the divine script written on it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Grail carries the dreams of the divine spirits, which are the laws of the world. But there is another thing engraved on the cup's wall."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Spiritual Covenant, or you can call it the Holy Grail Pact."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the divine messenger's instruction, Sander finally lifted his head to look at the radiant divine artifact. Although he could only vaguely see the words, or rather, the complex three-dimensional entity, just a glimpse of it made a flood of unfathomable information rush into his mind, as if threatening to burst his head.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Spiritual Covenant?" Sander asked the divine messenger evasively.</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger replied, "It is the contract that Stan Tito signed on behalf of all the sentient beings in the mortal world and the divine realm, the contract where he renounced the power of destruction and prayed to the divine for the power of creation."</p><p></p><p>"Mortals who wish to use the power of the divine realm must communicate with the existences in the divine realm through the Holy Grail and the Spiritual Covenant, which are also the fairies of the fairy realm."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the covenant exists, the Three-Leaf people can borrow the dreamlike creative power of the fairies through the covenant and rituals."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, a price must be paid."</p><p></p><p>Sander immediately noticed the key point in this sentence: "A price?"</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger nodded, "Yes, anything borrowed must be paid for."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the rituals is the price you pay to the fairy realms, and the fairies of the fairy realms lend you their power through the covenant and rituals."</p><p></p><p>"And the price..."</p><p></p><p>"Is that the memories of all the priests who have signed the Spiritual Covenant will not return to the stars after death, but will become a part of the fairy realm, merging into the fairies' dreams."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you project your spiritual power through your divine consciousness, divide a part of the projection and attach it to this divine artifact, the Holy Grail, you can communicate with the dreamworld and use the power of the rituals."</p><p></p><p>"If you're lucky, you may even glimpse a corner of the divine spirits' dreams and the faint imprints of the laws of the universe."</p><p></p><p>"Even..."</p><p></p><p>"If you can somehow combine the imprints of the divine laws and the power of wisdom, you may be able to create a third-tier divine art that belongs to the power of wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Sander was very interested in this: "Divine messenger, what is the difference between divine arts and rituals?"</p><p></p><p>"Divine arts are your own power, while rituals are the power you borrow from the dreamworld and the fairy realms."</p><p></p><p>He pondered, although he had only studied some basic divine arts through the Tito family's archives, he could see that he had a natural talent in this area.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the divine messenger asked him seriously for the second time:</p><p></p><p>"Sander, are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>Sander looked up: "If the price is this..."</p><p></p><p>"I am willing."</p><p></p><p>The divine messenger nodded and granted his wish.</p><p></p><p>Sander's spiritual power divided a part of itself and was projected permanently onto the Holy Grail, merging with the Spiritual Covenant.</p><p></p><p>From now on, no matter where he was, his consciousness and the power of wisdom could communicate with the dreamworld through this Spiritual Covenant.</p><p></p><p>As long as he followed the proper rituals...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the central region of the fairy-tale-like kingdom, within a towering tree-like structure, lies the Fairy Library.</p><p></p><p>Curled up in a corner, the three-leaf people are intently studying a long scroll, illuminated by the soft glow of a lamp.</p><p></p><p>The scroll is titled "The Power of Authority."</p><p></p><p>"How amazing!" </p><p></p><p>"So this is how power works, no wonder the blood of legends requires the pollen of the Sun Cup to transform."</p><p></p><p>"This is the secret of authority!"</p><p></p><p>Sander absorbs the knowledge bestowed upon him by the divine messenger like a sponge, not daring to let his focus waver for a moment.</p><p></p><p>For he knows that this knowledge does not belong to him alone, but to all three-leaf people. </p><p></p><p>This is the future that Saint Stanton Tito sacrificed himself to open up for all three-leaf people.</p><p></p><p>He cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake in his learning, for that would be an unforgivable sin.</p><p></p><p>He discovers that the records of authority power in the Fairy Library differ from the writings of the Tito family regarding junior and senior priests.</p><p></p><p>The fairies have divided the power of authority into three tiers.</p><p></p><p>The first tier is the basic power of the blood of legends, which can only affect the realm of consciousness and illusion.</p><p></p><p>The second tier is when the blood of legends becomes complete, granting the power to directly influence reality.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of wisdom authority manifests as spiritual power, while the expression of dream authority is akin to the power of the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>At the third tier, the power of divine dreams and the imprint of magical laws are required.</p><p></p><p>The authority wielder begins to possess a portion of the power of the laws, through which they can manipulate and interfere with reality, granting them miraculous abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the laws."</p><p></p><p>"The power that originates from the divine dreams."</p><p></p><p>Sander's eyes shine with admiration, for this means that at the third tier, one would possess a part of the power of the divine.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the fairies can create all sorts of wondrous things through the power of their realms.</p><p></p><p>It is not the fairies themselves that are powerful, but the gods.</p><p></p><p>The divine dreams contain the ultimate truths of the world, encompassing the laws of the universe.</p><p></p><p>He cannot even begin to imagine how mighty and grand the existence of the gods must be.</p><p></p><p>He looks towards the depths of the fairy kingdom, his pupils dilating.</p><p></p><p>According to the fairies, at the deepest part of the dream world lies the divine realm, the abode of the great Insei.</p><p></p><p>He systematically learns about the division of authority power and how to establish contracts with the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he begins to study and practice the power of rituals.</p><p></p><p>The performance of rituals is divided into three steps:</p><p></p><p>The first step is to draw the ritual array, which contains partial spirit contracts and the true names of the fairies.</p><p></p><p>The second step is to prepare the materials, as different rituals require the consumption of different materials, such as ores for an iron ritual or just soil for a clay ritual.</p><p></p><p>The third step is to activate the ritual array, which requires the expenditure of the three-leaf people's spiritual energy to guide and shape the outcome, resulting in various forms based on the intentions of the ritual master.</p><p></p><p>He leaves the Fairy Library and finds a spot outside to begin.</p><p></p><p>He carefully draws the ritual array, cross-checking every detail against the long scroll to ensure accuracy.</p><p></p><p>He then starts to prepare the ritual materials, meticulously examining each component and questioning their purpose.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he activates the ritual.</p><p></p><p>The ethereal form of a dream egg hovers above the array, its golden light swirling and alternating.</p><p></p><p>The materials instantly melt and fuse together, transforming into something else.</p><p></p><p>To his amazement, he has successfully conjured the legendary Ruhel ore and shaped it into a Ruhel sword.</p><p></p><p>Swinging it a few times, he feels the blade becoming even sharper, harder, and more corrosion-resistant, thanks to the combination of various ores and materials he used.</p><p></p><p>The exhilaration of his first successful ritual attempt is unparalleled for Sander, even surpassing the thrill of obtaining the saint's authority power.</p><p></p><p>"I did it!"</p><p>"I really learned it!"</p><p>"The power of rituals, the power of hope."</p><p></p><p>He runs excitedly through the fairy kingdom, dancing and laughing like a madman, startling the bewildered fairies.</p><p></p><p>The fairies watch in fear, whispering among themselves about the crazed three-leaf person.</p><p></p><p>Sander quickly regains his composure and returns to the Fairy Library, determined to learn all the rituals, for each one is a precious gift from the gods to the three-leaf people.</p><p></p><p>In the days that follow, Sander succeeds in mastering one ritual after another, creating not only swords but also mirrors, pottery, glass, and silk - all manner of wondrous things that have never before existed in the three-leaf people's world.</p><p></p><p>During his time in the fairy kingdom, Sander learns an astonishing number of rituals at an incredible pace.</p>

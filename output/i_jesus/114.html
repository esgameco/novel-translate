        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A long, long time ago, the Kingdom of Sammo had a royal priest who had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"If the power of consciousness on the outer layer can be manifested as spiritual power, then the wisdom and memories at the core of consciousness can also be transformed and manifested independently by following the spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Then, when the physical body is about to decay, the wisdom and memories can be transplanted to another body."</p><p></p><p>"Would that mean humans can achieve immortality?"</p><p></p><p>This crazy idea took root like a seed and grew rapidly, impossible to erase.</p><p></p><p>To touch the taboo of immortality with a mortal body is the deepest desire hidden in the hearts of all ordinary people. </p><p></p><p>Even if they know the unimaginable, grave consequences of attempting it, mortals would still try everything to do so.</p><p></p><p>Only the priests had the power of wisdom, so the royal priest could only use other priests as experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't long before his evil deeds of using his own kind as test subjects were exposed, along with his cruel underground laboratory, revealed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>All those with the bloodline of legends unanimously demanded that this madman be killed - the royals, the priestly families with the power of wisdom, and the nobles of the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, the king of the Sammo family at that time, after killing the royal priest, preserved the results of his research.</p><p></p><p>In secret.</p><p></p><p>The Sammo family has been exploring the secrets and methods of immortality all along.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman walked through the prison, her footsteps echoing clearly as she stepped in the puddles.</p><p></p><p>Seeing all those strange madmen, bizarre life forms, and even things that were not sure if they could be considered alive, she suddenly felt a surge in her chest, an intense urge to vomit.</p><p></p><p>She turned to look at the King of the Sammo Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>That gaze was as if she was seeing her father for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"So these people... </p><p></p><p>"Were they once priests, or even members of our own Sammo family?"</p><p></p><p>"Father, how could you do this?"</p><p></p><p>She had heard the rumors about the Sammo family possessing the secret of immortality, but she didn't know the details were like this.</p><p></p><p>The King spoke coldly, utterly unconcerned, "Most of them were willing, or were already near death."</p><p></p><p>"I gave them a chance to live again, they should be grateful to me."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman's voice changed, not knowing if it was out of fear or disbelief at her father's words.</p><p></p><p>"Do they know they would end up like this?"</p><p></p><p>If given a choice, she would rather die than become like them.</p><p></p><p>The King snorted, "To touch the power of immortality, of course a price must be paid."</p><p></p><p>"Although there are some flaws, I have indeed given them a chance to live again."</p><p></p><p>The King himself was a high-level priest, even considered exceptionally gifted.</p><p></p><p>Most of these were his own creations, with only a few made by the high-level priests of the kingdom under his guidance.</p><p></p><p>He stood in front of one of the prison cells, reaching out to touch the chanting, shrimp-like creature inside.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with obsession and longing.</p><p></p><p>"This is immortality, a power only the divine possess."</p><p></p><p>"Look at them."</p><p></p><p>"This power is so perfect, so powerful."</p><p></p><p>"The will of the deceased has left their body, continuing to exist in another."</p><p></p><p>"The secret of immortality has been perfected over generations, and finally succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"It is I who made immortality possible."</p><p></p><p>The previous frantic madness in his expression had given way to a sense of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his immortality secret, he was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Saliman looked at the beings in the prison, each one of them in a dazed, abnormal state, devoid of any normal existence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The ramblings of the insane are among the best of them.</p><p></p><p>Most are like a pile of rotten mud, writhing on the ground like insects, their foul and filthy bodies gnawing on the garbage on the ground.</p><p></p><p>She approached him, kneeling on the ground and grabbing her father's right arm with her own hands.</p><p></p><p>"Can this still be called success?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Give up! There's still time."</p><p></p><p>"Don't try anymore, it's too terrible."</p><p></p><p>"We'll negotiate with Heniell, we..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish, the King violently shook her off.</p><p></p><p>"Negotiate?"</p><p></p><p>"Negotiate with a false king? With a vile usurper of the throne? Then we surrender and submit to him?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what nonsense are you spouting?"</p><p></p><p>"I have not failed, and they are not insane."</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman sat on the ground, looking around.</p><p></p><p>Then, with an expression more painful than crying, she said, "Your Majesty, is this not failure?"</p><p></p><p>The King gradually introduced his secret of eternal life: "They are in chaos, only because two wisdoms and memories overlap, and no one knows who is the main one.</p><p></p><p>"Their consciousness is in conflict, so they are in chaos."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"I have found the solution, the true secret of eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"We will achieve true immortality, without even needing to change bodies."</p><p></p><p>The King's expression gradually became feverishly intense.</p><p></p><p>He spread his arms, even rising on his toes, his whole body tense and strained.</p><p></p><p>"The Ruhk Behemoth."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Behemoth will give us infinite possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"The Ruhk Behemoth is devoid of intelligence, it is the most suitable vessel for the art of consciousness transmigration."</p><p></p><p>"We not only can become immortal, but also eternally wield the power of the Behemoth."</p><p></p><p>"What Black Mud Child, what Behemoth Power."</p><p></p><p>"From now on,"</p><p></p><p>"We will be the eternal myth, we will be the immortal Behemoth."</p><p></p><p>"Nothing can stop us anymore, aging, death, enemies will all be reduced to ashes before this power, even the sky and the earth cannot hinder us."</p><p></p><p>His Majesty the King trembled with excitement, spittle flying from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He finally revealed his plan - to transfer his wisdom and memory into the body of the Ruhk Behemoth.</p><p></p><p>He will live eternally with the Behemoth, and forever possess its mighty power.</p><p></p><p>Only, His Majesty the King and the royal priesthood have tried this on many people before, transferring consciousness into other Trillianes, even into strange shrimp and the damned of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But he has never tried it with the Ruhk Behemoth before.</p><p></p><p>Because only the King, or the heir to the throne, can control the Ruhk Behemoth.</p><p></p><p>But now the time has come.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his daughter with a crazed smile, approaching her in what he thought was an affectionate manner.</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>"My daughter."</p><p></p><p>"Will you be the first to try this power of immortality for your great father?"</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman looked at her father's eyes, falling into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>She finally understood why the King had brought her here to witness the power of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Princess Saliman looked at the mad King, his smile so terrifying in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She saw her father as a horrifying demonic shadow emerging from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to!"</p><p></p><p>"Father, I don't want to become that!"</p><p></p><p>The princess scrambled up from the ground, trying to flee in terror.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as she emerged into the central hall of the castle, the tentacles of the desert worms burst through the stone floor, binding her.</p><p></p><p>A large hole opened in the ground, and she was dragged down into the depths below.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the castle was a vast open plaza, the walls embedded with glowing stones illuminating the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of the royal priests were already standing solemnly at the edges of the plaza, their expressions solemn and grave.</p>

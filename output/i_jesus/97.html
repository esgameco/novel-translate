        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the Star Realm Palace of the City of the Divine Servants. </p><p></p><p>The walls were engraved with star charts, symbolizing the Queen of Stars; the dome was carved with a sea of sunflowers, symbolizing the divine messenger Polaris and the great Insai deity.</p><p></p><p>The earth-burrowing demonic worms coiled up in front of the sacred lake, like a mountain of flesh.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant beasts had caused panic throughout the foothills of the sacred mountain, but the sight of the sky-soaring celestial beasts and the death stars in the sacred lake gave the people courage and confidence.</p><p></p><p>Heniel walked step by step into the palace, humbly kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Star Realm Queen: "Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"As a person from the Volcanic Kingdom and the Hosen Clan, why have you come to the Star Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Queen sat on the throne with a majestic yet gentle demeanor, one hand resting on the Insai scepter.</p><p></p><p>Heniel straightened up, still maintaining a respectful posture.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Queen!"</p><p></p><p>"I am not of the Hosen Clan, my name is Heniel, I have no surname."</p><p></p><p>"I am just a..." </p><p></p><p>"The black mud under the feet of the Hosen Clan."</p><p></p><p>The people present were silent, unable to understand why Heniel so despised the surname of the Hosen Clan, as in this era almost everyone took pride in their clan name, even commoners would hope to include their ancestral surname when addressing themselves.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Hosen were a royal bloodline family.</p><p></p><p>They did not understand Heniel's past, and had never even heard of his name before.</p><p></p><p>Heniel did not explain why, he only said what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"I have come here because only the Star Realm, only Your Majesty the Queen, can give me what I desire."</p><p></p><p>After stating what he wanted, Heniel also mentioned what he was willing to offer in return.</p><p></p><p>"I have my own power in the Volcanic Kingdom, I can control the forces that were once loyal to the mighty Hosen. I also possess the earth-burrowing demonic worms of the Volcanic Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"If Your Majesty helps me, I can become the master of the Volcanic Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"If I can become the lord of the Volcanic Kingdom, I will forever serve you, and make you my sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, there will be no more Volcanic Kingdom, no more royal bloodline Hosen Clan, I am willing to become the Duke of the Volcano under your scepter and crown."</p><p></p><p>He even stated a condition that the Star Realm Kingdom and the Seiron Clan could not refuse.</p><p></p><p>"If you are willing, I will help you end the centuries-old struggle between the royal bloodlines, and restore everything to the Insai."</p><p></p><p>Heniel knelt on the ground and cried out solemnly and humbly.</p><p></p><p>"Everything will belong to the great Star Realm Queen."</p><p></p><p>"The last of the Insai royal bloodline, the King of the Seiron Clan."</p><p></p><p>With one sentence, Heniel ignited the flames in the hearts of all the people of the Star Realm Kingdom and the Seiron Clan.</p><p></p><p>The priests and nobles present one by one turned their gaze towards the Star Realm Queen, seated high on the throne.</p><p></p><p>All their eyes shone with desire. </p><p></p><p>All for that one phrase - "the Insai royal bloodline".</p><p></p><p>This was the glorious legacy etched in the minds and memories of all the Seiron Clan, for they had once been the masters of the Insai.</p><p></p><p>One may never have possessed something, but once they have had it, they can never accept losing it again.</p><p></p><p>No one spoke, but an irresistible will descended upon the place, affecting everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Star Realm Queen could remain calm, she could not suppress the yearning of the entire Seiron Clan.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Heniel and asked her final question.</p><p></p><p>"Why should the Star Realm Kingdom and I trust you?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Why?" the queen asked.</p><p></p><p>Henryl gave a convincing reason: "I can swear an oath before the God of Insei."</p><p></p><p>"When I become the Grand Duke of the Volcano, I will swear allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen."</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to recite the 'Last Chapter' by the great poet Tito under the gaze of the deities and their messengers in the temple."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said these words, there was no more questioning.</p><p></p><p>In a world where the supreme God and the Creator exist,</p><p></p><p>no one dares to deceive the great God of Insei.</p><p></p><p>Queen Xiluo descended from the throne, placing the scepter on Henryl's shoulder, signifying her acceptance of him.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome."</p><p></p><p>"The Kingdom of Xiluo will assist you, my Grand Duke of the Volcano."</p><p></p><p>Henryl bowed his head, hand placed on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"This is my highest honor, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Temple, before the God of Insei, Henryl swore an oath of loyalty to Queen Xiluo.</p><p></p><p>The priests of the Xiluo family were overjoyed, seeing in Henryl a great opportunity to turn the tide of the current battle and a chance for the Xiluo family to regain its glory.</p><p></p><p>With Henryl and his Burrowing Worm, the Kingdom of Xiluo no longer had to worry about the siege from the Volcano Kingdom and the Samo Kingdom, and had even begun to prepare for a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>The young son of a craftsman stood in the corner, his gaze meeting Henryl's.</p><p></p><p>Henryl recognized Stan Tito the moment he saw him.</p><p></p><p>Among the priests of the Xiluo family and the noble-born, Stan Tito still stood out prominently.</p><p></p><p>"Stan Tito, I know you."</p><p></p><p>"The Fortunate Son."</p><p></p><p>Henryl took the initiative to approach and converse with Stan Tito. The taciturn son of the craftsman bowed and nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito asked him, "As a descendant of the Volcano Kingdom and the Hoesen family, why are you doing this?"</p><p></p><p>Henryl replied, "Because the Hoesen family has fallen, and they are no longer worthy to wear the inherited crown."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito saw confidence and wildness in Henryl's eyes, the kind of confidence that could change everything, the kind of wildness that dared to challenge anything.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had never experienced himself.</p><p></p><p>The son of the craftsman suddenly remembered a line he had heard, from a dream that may or may not have been real.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard people say I'm like a marionette."</p><p></p><p>"Do you feel that way?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this saying that I'm a person without a self, or is there some other meaning to it?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito had thought about this line many times, and he was truly concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>Henryl smiled: "Fortunate Son, truly strong people do not believe in luck."</p><p></p><p>"Only those who go against the current can master their fate and the world."</p><p></p><p>He patted Stan Tito's shoulder: "The day when no one calls you the Fortunate Son anymore, that's when you will no longer be a marionette."</p><p></p><p>"That's when you will become a truly powerful person, worthy of being admired and feared by all."</p><p></p><p>Henryl calmly walked away, facing the greatest challenge of his life, but unafraid.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito watched his retreating back: "Henryl."</p><p></p><p>"Black mud?"</p><p></p><p>He felt that what he saw was not just a lump of black mud, but an endless, pitch-black swamp.</p><p></p><p>Henryl strode through the long corridor outside the Sky Temple, his eyes shining with radiance.</p><p></p><p>The words he had just spoken were not only directed at Stan Tito, but also expressed the strongest desires and will deep within his own heart.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The azure blue lake, the primordial fish leaped out of the water. </p><p></p><p>One by one, the villagers from the town at the foot of the mountain and the commoners living in the cave houses came out, looking towards the distant plumes of smoke.</p><p></p><p>Once they saw the arriving people and the Seilon family's signature Ruhk giant, everyone became restless.</p><p></p><p>"The Queen has returned."</p><p></p><p>"It's the Queen who has returned."</p><p></p><p>"The Star Queen and the messenger of the gods!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd gathered by the lakeside, waving and cheering towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain path stairs leading to the City of the Divine Servants, row after row of soldiers knelt on the ground, waiting. The rules set by the former King Yesir had long been abandoned by now.</p><p></p><p>There were also many priests and nobles bound and detained at the city gates of the City of the Divine Servants.</p><p></p><p>Star and Baro stood side by side, ascending the stairs step by step.</p><p></p><p>Seeing all the familiar sights here, she couldn't help but say,</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, after going in a big circle, I've returned here again."</p><p></p><p>Without stopping their steps, the towering statue of King Lederik knelt on one knee, humbly bowing his head towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>That gaze just happened to fall on Star and Baro.</p><p></p><p>"Baro."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think King Lederik could have foreseen that his descendants would end up like this?"</p><p></p><p>Baro thought for a moment: "He must have hoped that his children would be even better than him. He was a great and benevolent king."</p><p></p><p>"But he was not a god, and had no way of seeing the future."</p><p></p><p>Star suddenly remembered that divine proverb, which everyone believed was a warning from the gods to King Lederik.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it was.</p><p></p><p>The beginning of the original sin of the Trifoliate people.</p><p></p><p>"The abyss of desire will never be satisfied no matter how much you give, and the mountain of resentment will never disappear no matter how much grace is bestowed."</p><p></p><p>The gods had already seen everything, but King Lederik still stubbornly believed in his children.</p><p></p><p>Star sometimes wonders, if King Lederik had followed the divine proverb back then, and they had not been expelled from the divine paradise, what would it be like?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they would still be enjoying the protection of the gods in the divine paradise, but they would not have the future.</p><p></p><p>"Oh gods!"</p><p></p><p>"Was expelling us from the divine paradise also a way of giving us a future and freedom?"</p><p></p><p>Star recalled the Sky Temple, and also sent people to reclaim the City of the Descended Gods and the vast territories.</p><p></p><p>She sat on the throne in the palace of the City of the Divine Servants, and many below suggested immediately going to war to punish the three major royal bloodline families that had betrayed the Star Queen.</p><p></p><p>But Star shook her head: "Let it end here!"</p><p></p><p>"End the war, end this endless cycle of bloodshed between the royal bloodline families for the crown."</p><p></p><p>"Let time prove who is right."</p><p></p><p>She was not going to continue the fight.</p><p></p><p>The other three major families had already shrunk and fortified their territories, like iron plates that had been cultivated for generations. Without the Wisdom Crown, any other person wanting them to submit would have to go through endless battles again.</p><p></p><p>Baro looked at Star: "Then there will be no more Hinsai."</p><p></p><p>But Star said, "There is no more Hinsai the King, but Hinsai still lives eternally in the hearts of all people."</p><p></p><p>"We are Hinsai, and Hinsai is all the Trifoliate people, not just a person wearing the crown."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p></p><p>"The moment the Wisdom Crown was lost, this moment was already destined."</p><p></p><p>The Hinsai Kingdom split into four kingdoms, each established by the four major royal bloodline families.</p><p></p><p>The kingdom founded by King Lederik, the dynasty that King Yesir found the origin and flourished.</p><p></p><p>All perished in four generations.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the sea</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An abandoned underwater ancient city.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the ancient city stood a towering pagoda, its peak emerging from the sea, engraved with the name Yesaer.</p><p></p><p>Group after group of condemned souls swam back from the shallow seas to the deep, arriving here.</p><p></p><p>The condemned souls who had regained their wisdom were clearly very different now. Alia, the king who had bestowed upon them blood and wisdom, had died, and they had also broken free of their constraints. </p><p></p><p>Although there were still not many wise leaders, as long as the bloodline of wisdom was passed down, the number of wise condemned souls would grow.</p><p></p><p>The first condemned soul to reawaken his wisdom stood atop the ancient city's pagoda and proclaimed to all the condemned souls.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards."</p><p></p><p>"We have another name, the people of the Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"We come from the depths of the Abyss, and we will establish our kingdom here."</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands gathered here, occupying the underwater ancient city built by King Yesaer and his second-generation descendants. They learned to herd and raise the progenitor fish, just as the Trilobe people did, and they also inherited the Trilobe people's written language.</p><p></p><p>In the vast ocean, they established a new kingdom.</p><p></p><p>--------------------</p><p></p><p>Decades later.</p><p></p><p>The Star Realm Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Without Queen Xingxai, the power struggles and infighting within the royal bloodline families had ceased. Without the suppression and constraints of King Xingxai, the royal bloodline families no longer worried about the repercussions of expansion.</p><p></p><p>They began to shift their gaze outward, rather than inward. </p><p></p><p>They focused their efforts and energy on governing the country, setting their sights on expanding their territories.</p><p></p><p>They bravely broke free of their shackles and constraints to explore the distant lands, establishing city after city, town after town, and village after village.</p><p></p><p>The different countries had their own unique laws and systems - some completely inherited Xingxai's institutions, while others were dominated by the rising powers of merchants and workshop owners.</p><p></p><p>Some were entirely religious states, attracting a large number of devout followers, regardless of whether they were slaves or commoners.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to have improved, becoming more vibrant.</p><p></p><p>A flourishing of diverse developments, no longer stagnant and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Star Queen listened to the requests of the ministers and priests, then suddenly summoned everyone.</p><p></p><p>"After all these years, you have all done better than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>"The Star Realm Kingdom has prospered thanks to all of your efforts."</p><p></p><p>"As the Queen, I want to express my gratitude to all of you here."</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the palace returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen then let everyone return to their places, and continued.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I have an extremely important announcement to make."</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen had the young Trilobe woman sitting beside her, the current high priestess of the Sky Temple, stand up.</p><p></p><p>In front of everyone, she handed the scepter passed down from King Laideli to this high priestess.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards."</p><p></p><p>"You shall be the high priestess of the Sky Temple, and also the Queen of the Star Realm Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The young high priestess, at a loss for words, knelt on the ground, grasping the scepter.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I... I..."</p><p></p><p>The ministers were in complete disarray, not understanding why the Star Queen was transferring the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty! What is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen had been preparing for this day for a long time, and had already arranged for her successor.</p><p></p><p>She was just waiting for everything to be stabilized, for the Star Realm Kingdom and the Sky Temple to no longer need her.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Realm Kingdom no longer needs me, and it's time for me to do what I want to do."</p><p></p><p>She swept her gaze over the crowd below, speaking in a commanding tone.</p><p></p><p>"In the name of the Star Queen, I present to you the new Queen and high priestess of the Sky Temple."</p><p></p><p>The new Queen ascended the throne, receiving the kneeling obeisance of all present.</p><p></p><p>The Star Queen stood behind the new Queen, witnessing the birth of the new ruler alongside the statue of the deity.</p><p></p><p>When the people raised their heads...</p>

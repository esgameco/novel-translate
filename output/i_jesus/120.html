        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the divine art unfolded, all the wise consciousnesses fell into the illusory realm of Stan Tito, especially within the body of the desert worm. Nearly a hundred consciousnesses plunged and were dragged into it. ‚ô™üê†‚ùª‚ûà·îïùìóùìæ–ñ.cùï†Áà™üèÜüòæ</p><p></p><p>The line between reality and illusion was divided.</p><p></p><p>Once everyone entered the illusory world, they could no longer sense the existence in reality.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful their strength or how massive their bodies, they could not exert it here.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their physical bodies in reality could no longer constrain them.</p><p></p><p>The embodied consciousness of Stan Tito stood on the equally hazy Forbidden Flower, watching the light that constantly fell from above, watching the light gradually turn into a stream of figures.</p><p></p><p>"I've changed back, I've changed back!" The distorted and deformed priest regained his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>"You're out?" One consciousness after another recovered from the pain, torment, and madness.</p><p></p><p>"The eternal suffering, the endless darkness, I've finally escaped." They could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, it's over, everything is finally over." They were ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>The light of consciousness, after breaking free, also found itself gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>But even so, those lights of consciousness were eager to escape the shackles of the Ruhk giant.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were to dissipate and scatter in the heavens and the earth, they were still so joyful.</p><p></p><p>Death at this moment was not a punishment, but a gift.</p><p></p><p>Only the mad king in the illusory realm stubbornly clung to a dense black mist, refusing to leave.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"This is mine, this is mine."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito raised his hand, and even though the king's silver light shadow refused to leave, it was still pulled out.</p><p></p><p>In the void between the Ruhk giant's body, it disintegrated into luminous dust.</p><p></p><p>Even at the moment of total annihilation, his face was still crazed.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>From the dense black mist, a slender silver shadow emerged.</p><p></p><p>She glided down from above, bringing a trail of stardust to stand before Stan Tito.

The moon in the distance still hung in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman, without turning back, sensed that Heniel had woken up.</p><p></p><p>The night wind was exceptionally cold, and the voice here seemed to have no warmth, with a faint sense of melancholy and indifference.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel."</p><p></p><p>"It's your turn now."</p><p></p><p>Heniel sat up, with a puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"My turn?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to kill me as well?"</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito shook his head: "Don't be afraid, I'm not here to kill you."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you can rest assured and become the King of Xin Sai, and no one will hinder you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Heniel smiled, with a touch of pride: "You also think I should become the King of Xin Sai. I am much stronger than those royal families, aren't I?"</p><p></p><p>The craftsman laughed: "Don't get it wrong, I'm not your follower or admirer."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that if you die here, this war may never end."</p><p></p><p>"The entire kingdom of Xin Sai will be plunged into division again, and countless ambitious and crazy people will emerge again, and no one knows what those crazy people will bring to Xin Sai."</p><p></p><p>The craftsman turned around, and Heniel finally realized that he was not real.</p><p></p><p>In front of the moonlit cliff, his figure was like a moving mass of water.</p><p></p><p>He was just a shadow condensed by an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's life was about to end, and he would follow the Moon Fern into the next reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The craftsman still had something he couldn't let go of.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Heniel, or rather at the Ruhk brand on his forehead, and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just saying, it's time for you to give up the Ruhk monster."</p><p></p><p>"The era of the monster must come to an end, too much price has been paid!"</p><p></p><p>Heniel's expression changed when he looked at the illusory shadow: "Is this the price of using the forbidden art?"</p><p></p><p>"So you came all this way to die for this?"</p><p></p><p>After sending one person after another, Stan Tito was no longer afraid of death at this moment, because he knew that there were things more terrible than death.</p><p></p><p>"I never knew what I should do or what I should want in the first half of my life."</p><p></p><p>"I always followed other people's arrangements, followed other people's orders. My father told me to be a craftsman, so I became a craftsman."</p><p></p><p>"The Queen made me the Lucky Son, so I became the Lucky Son."</p><p></p><p>"But this decision is my own."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito's eyes were lost in memories, and he thought of his ancestor, the great poet Tito.</p><p></p><p>"People!"</p><p></p><p>"After understanding the meaning of one's existence and one's mission."</p><p></p><p>"It's really completely different."</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, I feel that I am truly alive."</p><p></p><p>"Even if my life is only this moment, that is enough."</p><p></p><p>The craftsman lowered his head and looked into Heniel's eyes with a smile: "We don't need to pursue the eternity of life."</p><p></p><p>"Because at this moment."</p><p></p><p>"Is the eternity of my life."</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito stepped forward and approached Heniel.</p><p></p><p>Heniel was unable to resist the power of Stan Tito, who was at the peak of the Trileaf's power, and was touched on the forehead by his finger, and his consciousness involuntarily began to act according to his command.</p><p></p><p>"Release them."</p><p></p><p>"Let the monsters return to the sea, to the embrace of the gods."</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Lake.</p><p></p><p>The Siren suddenly let out a cry, and the "armor" on its body disappeared, and it returned to its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the monster eggs at the bottom of the lake also happened to grow out again at this time.</p><p></p><p>That was the desert worm that had returned to reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Heniel noticed that in the distance on the horizon, there were two Ruhk monsters crawling on the earth.</p><p></p><p>In the moonlight, their huge bodies looked only as big as a finger from the Sky Temple.</p><p></p><p>Heniel watched the last two Ruhk monsters run towards the distance, one after the other, with the sea as their destination.</p><p></p><p>The Trileaf finally lost the power of the monsters completely,</p><p></p><p>Stan Tito also quietly watched this scene: "What a powerful force it is, it can destroy everything of the Trileaf, and bring disaster to the entire Xin Sai."</p><p></p><p>"But it can't bring happiness and the future."</p><p></p><p>With the wind blowing, Stan Tito completely turned into the light of the illusion.</p><p></p><p>The elongated light dust went towards the distant moon, towards the Ruhk monsters crawling on the earth, as if to follow them to the sea.</p><p></p><p>In the air, his voice lingered.</p><p></p><p>"Heniel!"</p><p></p><p>"Be a good king!"</p><p></p><p>"Without the monsters, you are just a king."</p>

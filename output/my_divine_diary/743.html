        <h1>Chapter 743</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The captain left the small world with his mind in a jumble, his strides appearing somewhat disorderly.</p><p></p><p>He tried to organize his thoughts, considering how he would communicate this matter to Xia Qingjun later.</p><p></p><p>The more he walked, the clearer his thinking became: "Although Mr Feng Cheng's proposal sounds a bit absurd, upon careful consideration, there is actually nothing wrong with it! After all, humans now are not the same as humans in the past.</p><p></p><p>In the war with the Eight-Armed race, humans have gradually gained a certain advantage and steadied their footing. To be honest, the current ability of the Compound Eye race is merely that of a super detector, which can help us monitor the Eight-Armed race's every move, while also stealing their latest technology...</p><p></p><p>It sounds very important and indispensable, but compared to the Compound Eyes' usefulness to humans, their threat to humans is somewhat greater.</p><p></p><p>After all, humans who now occupy a certain advantage need to maintain the current state. And the Compound Eyes may completely defect to the Eight-Armed side at some point in the future, handing over human technology to the Eight-Armed race and disrupting the current balance - that would be a true disaster...</p><p></p><p>It's better to take this opportunity of a rift to subdue them and bring them under complete control.</p><p></p><p>That way, the Compound Eyes can still serve as our detectors, but we won't have to worry about them betraying humanity and turning against us..."</p><p></p><p>The more the captain thought, the lighter his steps became, walking with a whooshing sound.</p><p></p><p>When the captain saw Xia Qingjun, he excitedly said, "Leader, I have an important matter to discuss with you!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun had a quiet room set up by Su Hao using spatial technology that could block the Compound Eyes' surveillance.</p><p></p><p>After entering the quiet room, Xia Qingjun asked, "What did Da Qiang and the others say?"</p><p></p><p>The captain replied, "It's confirmed, the incident with the Compound Eyes was indeed done by Da Qiang."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's eyelid twitched, "Just as I suspected..."</p><p></p><p>It would be hard to guess wrong about something like this.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Da Qiang's assistant Jia Fengcheng suggested that we seize the opportunity to take over the Compound Eyes' home planet and bring it under our control, eliminating the potential threat they pose.</p><p></p><p>Haven't we been worried all along that the Compound Eyes would steal our technology and pass it to the Eight-Armed race, reversing the current situation? As long as we fully control the Compound Eyes, we can ensure there are no worries."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun rotated the cup in his hand, lost in thought, as the captain waited silently.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Xia Qingjun said in a low voice, "It's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Over the many years of interacting with the Compound Eyes, humans had always placed great importance on credibility and established an excellent reputation among them.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun greatly cherished this credibility and did not wish to trample on it lightly.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how precious something was, as long as the price could be paid, as long as there were sufficient benefits, it could be sold...</p><p></p><p>Even the "credibility" maintained for many years.</p><p></p><p>In other words, wasn't "credibility" meant to be torn up at the most critical moment in exchange for sufficient benefits?</p><p></p><p>Once the decision was made to tear up credibility, it meant there was no longer any need for it from then on.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Compound Eyes and humans were ultimately two different races in the universe, and every step had to be taken carefully, because one misstep could very likely lead to the disappearance of humans from the Yunhuan system.</p><p></p><p>Not of our kind...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was roaming the Compound Eye gathering place, rapidly absorbing their language, Feng Cheng sent a message in the group about the disappearance of Compound Eye individuals.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Su Hao quite a bit: "Oh? I acted so stealthily and quickly, yet I was still discovered! The Compound Eyes' investigative abilities are indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "The Compound Eyes actually don't know it was you who did it. It's just that they're single-minded and assumed it was done by the human side. Coincidentally, the captain knows about our abilities, so he guessed it was you right away."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I see. Well, I haven't done anything to those hundred-plus Compound Eyes, I just detained them temporarily to avoid trouble. I was planning to release them at some point, but now it seems that releasing them would only confirm that it was the human side behind this."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "No need to release them. I've already suggested to the captain that they seize this opportunity to send warships over and directly take over the Compound Eyes' planet to control them.</p><p></p><p>That way, it'll be convenient for you to study them, Master Wei, while also preventing the Compound Eyes from colluding with the Eight-Armed race once humans become more powerful and causing us trouble in turn."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ya Shan sent a thumbs-up emoji.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "That's a good method. You all can proceed! If we can take over the Compound Eyes' planet soon, it might save me some trouble."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the approval of the two leaders, Feng Cheng became even more convinced that his decision was correct: when facing a problem, address it at the source and eliminate it completely. If the problem can't be solved, then solve the one asking the question.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the human side responded, stating that it was not their doing, while also accusing the Compound Eyes of making baseless accusations against humans as the culprits without sufficient evidence.</p><p></p><p>They also expressed that humans had reason to suspect the Compound Eyes had ulterior motives and were deliberately provoking an incident.</p><p></p><p>If the Compound Eyes made reckless false accusations without being able to provide a satisfactory explanation, then they would lose humans as a powerful ally!</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the human response, the Compound Eyes were simply dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined that humans would commit wrongdoing and not admit it. But to actually turn it around and accuse the Compound Eyes of provoking an incident without cause?</p><p></p><p>Unable to bear it any longer, they replied to the humans, stating that it was indeed done by humans, with humans' spatial technology as evidence, and that the Compound Eyes' intelligence capabilities did not require evidence.</p><p></p><p>They also accused humans of secretly plotting against their allies, warning that if their tribesmen were not promptly returned, humans would also lose the Compound Eyes' trust.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The two sides traded accusations, quarreling more and more fiercely, but humans never admitted to abducting Compound Eye individuals.</p><p></p><p>On the Compound Eye side, many elders gathered to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>"I saw through the evil nature of this human race long ago. The trust built up over so many years is nothing but their disguise. Humans cannot be trusted!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said! If we didn't lack better choices back then, would we have cooperated with humans? There used to be such kind races in the universe, but unfortunately they were wiped out by the Eight-Armed race long ago..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! It feels safer to cooperate with kind races. Humans are too evil."</p><p></p><p>"It's too late to say anything now! The key issue is, what if humans don't admit it? Even the Eight-Armed race can't do anything to them, let alone us."</p><p></p><p>"Such an outrage! One can imagine that in the future, humans will become even more reckless, to the detriment of our children."</p><p></p><p>"I still can't figure out why humans developed so rapidly. Out of nowhere came all sorts of new technologies, without any warning signs."</p><p></p><p>"You think maybe humans were secretly developing new technologies behind our backs from long ago? They just didn't become unrestrained until the technologies matured recently."</p><p></p><p>"Very likely. You can tell from how halfhearted humans were in teaching us - our children studied with humans for so long, yet not a single qualified scientist emerged...humans must have been holding things back!"</p><p></p><p>"Humans are simply too despicable! They will surely face due punishment."  </p><p></p><p>"What should we do? We currently have nothing that can threaten humans. Why don't we focus all efforts on recording human technologies, then use that to threaten them by giving their tech to the Eight-Armed race?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After much discussion, the Compound Eyes finally arrived at a plan that satisfied all the elders: record human core technologies to use for threats!</p><p></p><p>This was a method they were very familiar with. All this time, they had been using the location of the human "blue light" to threaten humans and force them to serve the Compound Eyes, which had worked for many years without major issues.</p><p></p><p>This gave them the illusion that humans feared threats.</p><p></p><p>It was only two or three decades ago that humans suddenly rose to prominence, and the "blue light location" threat lost its effect on them.</p><p></p><p>So the Compound Eyes needed to regain something they could use to threaten humans, in order to restore their status in the "human-Compound Eye" alliance.</p><p></p><p>The most elderly grand elder gave the order: "All observatory temples, focus all efforts on recording human core technologies!"</p><p></p><p>The human approach was simple - they put out some seemingly real but fake technologies for the Compound Eyes to take...</p><p></p><p>Then one day, the Compound Eyes, thinking they had mastered all of humanity's core technologies, got cocky and directly sent a threat notice to humans, informing them that with just a button press, all of humanity's technologies would appear on the Eight-Armed race's home planet.</p><p></p><p>In response, Xia Qingjun and the other high officials showed faint smiles, then immediately declared war on the Compound Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a massive human fleet arrived at the Compound Eyes' home planet...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 697</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Since he knew that all these insect swarms were controlled by the same system, Suhao's interest now was not just collecting a large number of insect specimens.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was a specimen of the 'control system'.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this was even more valuable than the insects themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the insects' 'control system' was the queen insect or something else, that remained to be determined.</p><p></p><p>The next step, Suhao planned to find the queen insect.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then casually grabbed an innocent insect, injecting his blood energy into its body, recording all its information into the bullet space, including its extremely faint consciousness, which was also locked in the small black room.</p><p></p><p>He then threw it away, letting it return to the embrace of the insects.</p><p></p><p>Suhao flew up high, avoiding the insects' attacks, then focused inward into the bullet space, retrieving the consciousness information of the insect he just recorded to observe carefully.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao made a new discovery.</p><p></p><p>New signals kept appearing out of nowhere in the insect's consciousness information, issuing it various action commands, controlling its movements.</p><p></p><p>"This...isn't it similar to how I hide in the 'second space' to control the [Eight-Armed God]? I use the synchronized consciousness information of the bullet space, but how does it achieve this? And how does it synchronize the activities of all the insects on this entire planet?"</p><p></p><p>Commanding the insects to attack Suhao did not affect its ability to control the other insects to continue their breeding efforts. More powerful than even a multi-threaded computer!</p><p></p><p>Suhao captured a few more insects and recorded their consciousness information into the bullet space to observe their operations, finding they were all the same.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a bit, selected one insect, and erased its consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He found that after its consciousness was erased, the insect just lay there motionless.</p><p></p><p>Then by transmitting signals through the small black room to that insect, it started moving clumsily...</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help cursing: "F**k, it's similar to my small black room's function! But the number it can control is beyond imagination! Most crucially, how does it achieve this? Unthinkable."</p><p></p><p>Then he thought of a question - could he communicate with the controller behind the insects through the insects?</p><p></p><p>After all, in Suhao's view, the insects' controller was very straightforward...</p><p></p><p>So Suhao tried communicating with the insects in various languages, but found they had no effect. Finally, he directly packaged the semantic consciousness of 'who are you?' and sent it into the insect's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He found that the insect he sent the semantics to became very strange, its consciousness signals became extremely chaotic, and after a moment, that insect lost all motion and was devoured by the other insects.</p><p></p><p>"Detected an anomaly and was abandoned, huh? Seems communication is impossible."</p><p></p><p>The insects had intelligence and could make very accurate rational judgments about their environment, but lacked the cultural foundation of 'language', so they could only act on instinct.</p><p></p><p>Colloquially speaking: no wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Suhao believed it was a beast with a clever brain.</p><p></p><p>Since communication was impossible, how could he find the queen insect?</p><p></p><p>"Let's try!"</p><p></p><p>He transformed back into the [Eight-Armed God] form, then burrowed into the insect swarm, heading towards the planet's interior.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Suhao burst out from the other side of the planet's surface, then reverted to human form.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many insects, this aimless searching will never find the queen insect."</p><p></p><p>To find the queen insect, Suhao had two plans: first, cultivate one himself from insect eggs, without needing to cover the entire planet, as long as he could study their control system; second, wait until returning to Planet Blue, where with suitable equipment, he could create an 'exploration cube' to directly throw down onto the planet, letting the 'exploration cube' automatically search.</p><p></p><p>The insect swarms and Suhao's 'cubes' were both classified by him as 'planet viruses' that would destroy a planet's original structure.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the insect swarms, Suhao believed his 'cubes' were stronger and even more uncompromising. Just throwing down one 'cube' would completely destroy this planet along with the insect civilization.</p><p></p><p>So there was no need to worry about the cube being no match for the insects.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another day passed, and Suhao had collected a large number of different insects, planning to return to the Yuoxing Spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not successfully find the queen insect's location, the purpose of this trip had been achieved, and staying here any longer was useless.</p><p></p><p>He took out a few positioning stones, hiding them inside the black substance that the insects' subconscious ignored, confirming they were not dug out and destroyed by the insects, then teleported back to the dorm small world.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the dorm and told the captain: "I've seen the insect planet. Captain, you can leave anytime."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked deeply at Suhao, then commanded the ship to slowly depart from the star domain.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the warp drive activated, and the Yuoxing rapidly left the insect star domain.</p><p></p><p>After traveling for ten days, the warp drive shut off again, and the Yuoxing stopped in the empty space outside the insect star domain.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately conduct a full inspection inside and outside the ship to confirm no insect eggs are attached."</p><p></p><p>"Re-analyze the signal, confirm cloaking status, confirm complete escape from the Eight-Armed lockon signal nest."</p><p></p><p>"Repair the ship's facilities, report remaining reserve energy."</p><p></p><p>"Report current situation to Planet Blue, request return voyage."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, all matters were confirmed complete, and the Yuoxing had indeed completely escaped the Eight-Armed lockon as expected. They also received Planet Blue's approval for the return voyage.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p></p><p>The captain took a deep breath, glanced at the crowd below suppressing their excitement, and said solemnly: "Destination Planet Blue, activate engines."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>The Suhao in the dorm's small world felt something: "Returning to Planet Blue, huh? Perfect timing!"</p><p></p><p>This voyage would traverse the vast interstellar space, a long distance that even the fifth-level warp drive would need a very long travel time to reach.</p><p></p><p>And Suhao could take this time to improve the [Eight-Armed God]'s abilities, replicate more spare bodies, and try to evolve into the [Insect God].</p><p></p><p>Of course, most importantly, he needed to cultivate the queen insect and find a way to decipher how it controlled the vast numbers of insects.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that if he mastered the queen insect's method of controlling the insects, his power system might undergo a fundamental transformation.</p><p></p><p>As for what form it would take, he had no idea yet.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I'll know after thoroughly researching it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ship successfully activated the warp drive and entered faster-than-light travel.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't rush to start researching right away, but first entered the bullet space to carefully analyze the current situation and plan future goals.</p><p></p><p>"It's been almost four years since I was reborn into this world. Not only have I recovered all my powers, but I've also successfully evolved into the [Eight-Armed God] as my avatar, avoiding the 'Fate Wave' lockon.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that from this life onwards, I've broken free from the 'ill fate' that used to follow me incessantly, drawing a line from my previous state.</p><p></p><p>I've regained my free self, recovering my freedom through my own efforts! In the future, I still need to keep striving to thoroughly analyze the principles of the 'Fate Wave', and then master it!"</p><p></p><p>He thought silently, then sat at the desk, materializing paper and pen as usual, starting to write and draw in the notebook:</p><p></p><p>In other words, my power is only relative. In this world, I may no longer be able to rely on spatial abilities to be invincible.</p><p></p><p>If I encounter an attack exceeding my defense limits without spatial abilities to evade, I could very likely die!</p><p></p><p>But so what if I die? It's just the [Eight-Armed God] dying, not my main body, so overall it's not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>My main body is now hidden in the planet where the Eight-Armed supply station is located, and in the second-level space of the Yuoxing's dorm small world, undetectable by anyone.</p><p></p><p>After returning to Planet Blue, I'll find a new place to hide.</p><p></p><p>The universe is so vast, I don't believe anyone could 'coincidentally' find my main body.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to be careful of is not letting anyone know where my main body is hidden.</p><p></p><p>If they can't find my main body, even the strongest spatial interference ability is irrelevant."</p><p></p><p>Writing to here, Suhao felt relaxed in body and mind.</p><p></p><p>What's the difference from being invincible then?</p><p></p><p>If the [Eight-Armed God]'s body is destroyed, it has zero impact on me, I can just control another one, endlessly!</p><p></p><p>Heh, just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm cheating! But, this is also part of true power, right?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 714</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After causing a huge commotion in Victory City, Yashan and Fengcheng returned to the small world and carried on as usual, without anything to do.</p><p></p><p>But outside, things had already escalated. Many people were frantically demanding that the Republican government bring the murderers to justice and give all the deceased people justice.</p><p></p><p>According to them, even the friends and family of the hero Xu Shiqiang could not ignore the law and wantonly harm others' lives.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the Republican organization officially issued a statement, making the incident public and strongly condemning the evil acts of Yashan and Fengcheng. Then an announcement stated: The two murderers have been arrested and will be publicly tried and executed soon.</p><p></p><p>Then, two death row inmates with Yashan and Fengcheng's faces were publicly executed, telling everyone that immense power is not for wanton abuse - the law is the bottom line for everyone!</p><p></p><p>As time passed and various hot topics occupied people's attention, fewer and fewer people mentioned that bloody explosion incident.</p><p></p><p>Soon, people forgot about Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>By then, Yonghua's nickname 'Young Lady' became known to the public. Those who saw her truly addressed her as the Young Lady.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, no one dared to go against Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the seeds of hatred were inevitably planted in some people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>But to Su Hao and the others, it didn't matter!</p><p></p><p>What he cared about now was how well he could develop his Starlight Roaming ability!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Four years later. Victory City Administrative Center.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and a group of high officials watched a long video together.</p><p></p><p>This was transmitted back from a spacecraft sent out years ago to carry out a special mission - deploying the 'Star Shredding Cubes'.</p><p></p><p>After more than five years, the warship finally completed the mission and sent the mission video back.</p><p></p><p>After watching the video, the officials were trembling with excitement, their faces flushed red, veins bulging, breathing labored......</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>A tiny metal cube destroyed an entire planet in just two hours!</p><p></p><p>In the video, the planet was expanding madly, a doomsday scene, the elliptical metal writhing and pulsating...</p><p></p><p>After watching, they all felt numb. Especially when they saw the 'igniter' dropped, the planet seemed to ignite, spewing out massive amounts of material like a sacred sword in the cosmos...</p><p></p><p>Excitement and fear mingled in a special emotion they had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing these weapons were created by humans, not the Octopus Race!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the creator didn't test this weapon on Bluelight..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the creator doesn't have anti-human sentiments..."</p><p></p><p>They felt so fortunate, and realized that the way things had unfolded was perfect!</p><p></p><p>The future was too beautiful to imagine!</p><p></p><p>After watching, everyone was immersed in tremendous shock, then looked at Xia Qingjun with fiery gazes.</p><p></p><p>After calming down a bit, Xia Qingjun said flatly, "This is a product developed by Xu Shiqiang!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shiqiang again? No wonder the leader has been single-handedly protecting him against everyone."</p><p></p><p>"We heard before that Xu Shiqiang was a scientific research talent, but I didn't believe it at first. Now I have to believe it."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shiqiang really is a precious human treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Made by Xu Shiqiang? Isn't he just a soldier?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! You old fossil, what's wrong with being a soldier? You really can't keep up with the times. Retire early and go enjoy your elderly years. Always occupying a position unwilling to step down."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you calling an old fossil? Why don't you step down yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm only 180 years old, you're almost 400 and about to be buried in the ground. If you're not an old fossil, what are you? Who was it that turned red in the face and cursed Xu Shiqiang as a naive brat who didn't know anything? Huh?"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the two sides who disliked each other started quarreling.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's whole face went dark. No matter how restrained he was, he couldn't help his rising anger - this group was so reckless, where did they put his position as leader?</p><p></p><p>He slammed the table and stood up abruptly, uncharacteristically assertive for once: "All shut up! Don't you know your own status? If you keep bickering in this situation, you're all dismissed and can roll out."</p><p></p><p>In the past facing such situations, he would mainly try to appease and reconcile, but today, Su Hao's success somehow gave him courage!</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition: Xu Shiqiang was far more reliable than these undying old fellows!</p><p></p><p>If humanity's hope was pinned on them, it would truly be bleak. But Xu Shiqiang might really be able to give humans the power to contend against the Octopus Race.</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun got angry, the effect was remarkable, much simpler than his previous painstaking reconciliation efforts.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, being hot-tempered could really save a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The meeting soon dispersed.</p><p></p><p>This video viewing had a good effect - the previous dissatisfaction with Xia Qingjun's protection of Yashan and Fengcheng completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao's value truly took root in the hearts of humanity's higher echelons.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the vast emptiness of the Cloud Ring System, an enormous pink crystal armored figure abruptly appeared and flew at an extremely high speed.</p><p></p><p>The thick outer pink crystal armor contracted and slimmed down, quickly becoming a sleek, agile armored figure. It turned its head, scanning around as if identifying its location.</p><p></p><p>This was Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He had been flying in 'Starlight Roaming' through the Cloud Ring System for nearly five years! However, in that five year period, the range of star domains he explored was not very wide.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the entire Cloud Ring System, his activity range was just a small circle.</p><p></p><p>But the exploration over these few years allowed him to gain profound insights into 'Starlight Roaming', constantly optimizing it into a more convenient and practical skill.</p><p></p><p>Previously when traveling, he still needed to enter the elliptical small world, taking thirty seconds to prepare before and after.</p><p></p><p>Now there was no need for such trouble - he only needed to construct the corresponding formation externally, and could activate Starlight Roaming and enter faster-than-light travel in just five seconds.</p><p></p><p>How much more powerful was that compared to any warship?</p><p></p><p>As long as he had sufficient 'source', he could travel freely.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, Su Hao's first goal of 'faster-than-light travel' could be considered achieved.</p><p></p><p>Now, he planned to end his Starlight Roaming practice and return to Bluelight to complete his second learning goal.</p><p></p><p>"Next I'll study interstellar communication technology. This technique may be similar to how the Mother Bug controls its swarm!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao didn't hesitate and transmitted directly back to the small world on Bluelight.</p><p></p><p>Over these few years, whenever he reached a suitable planet, he would leave a positioning stone to facilitate movement.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to return here again, it was just a thought away.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the experimental base, Yashan and Fengcheng immediately sensed his return. In the blink of an eye, the two appeared before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord Wei, you're back! Looks like you've gained quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled happily, "This experiment went quite smoothly. I've completely mastered 'Starlight Roaming' and can now freely roam the cosmic star systems."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Congratulations to Great Lord Wei on another breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "Great Lord Wei, can we learn Starlight Roaming too?"</p><p></p><p>These past few years, he had been raiding the Octopus Race's colonial planets to steal spaceships. With only positioning stones and flashing, his movement in the vast space was really too slow and not agile enough!</p><p></p><p>He desperately wanted to be able to swiftly traverse space like Su Hao, going wherever he wanted at will.</p><p></p><p>Combined with teleportation and flashing, it would be true freedom of movement.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course you can. This skill isn't that complicated. The only part that's a bit difficult is the 'spatial barrier projection', but if you practice more, you'll quickly master it. However, using it skillfully and naturally isn't simple.</p><p></p><p>I've uploaded the Starlight Roaming materials, you can take a look. It's best to grasp it soon, it will also make future actions more convenient."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng's eyes lit up, "That's great!"</p><p></p><p>Their biggest worry was that, like with 'Second Space' and the 'Small World', they wouldn't be able to learn it...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "What about you two? Any gains? Fengcheng has been quite busy out there these past few years, destroying three Octopus Gods in total. But I don't know if he's produced any results from all that trouble."</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, Fengcheng's raids to steal spaceships went quite smoothly. But later the Octopus Race caught onto his patterns and used their 'spatial disruption' ability to restrict his teleportation and flashing abilities.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Octopus Race's warships treated him like a target practice dummy, blasting him to pieces with their main cannons. After having three Octopus Gods destroyed in succession, Fengcheng finally restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>From 'picking up ships' it became 'robbing ships', and finally degraded to just 'stealing ships'.</p><p></p><p>Yonghua came running over slightly out of breath before Fengcheng could speak.</p><p></p><p>While running she shouted loudly, "Great Uncle! You're finally back, Great Uncle!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just nodded, "Yonghua, it's been a few years, you've grown quite a bit taller."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua didn't stop for a moment, rushing up to grab Su Hao's clothes, "Great Uncle, please change my brain for me!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Su Hao was slightly stunned, then quickly looked towards Yashan and Fengcheng.</p>

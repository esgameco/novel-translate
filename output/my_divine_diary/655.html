        <h1>Chapter 655</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Putting it into concrete terms, a question arises: what to do with the 'spiritual eye'?</p><p></p><p>It wasn't fundamentally different from the Sense Stage they used to break through the 'Spirit Transformation Realm'.</p><p></p><p>It was all a matter of creating an external object, then writing a 'signal conversion program' and accessing the consciousness!</p><p></p><p>As long as the first step of 'finding the fluctuation patterns' was completed, it was basically a success.</p><p></p><p>However, the first step wasn't easy.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in order to continue obtaining that particular fluctuation, Su Hao threw down the 'Shattered Star Little Cube' into Planet 10 from time to time, tossing it around to capture the fluctuation and then analyze it.</p><p></p><p>In this way, another two years passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly said, "Yashan, excluding the source galaxy, what is the closest galaxy to here?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan froze and realized that Boss Wei was trying to leave this place and go to the next galaxy.</p><p></p><p>He casually called up the star map and said, "It's called Purple Wolf Star, located in the 'Beehive Constellation Second Ring Outer Bit', twelve light years from here, with a stellar mass more than twenty times larger than Feather Weaver Star, and only eight planets rotating around it."</p><p></p><p>The large galaxy that Su Hao and the others were currently in, called the 'Pan Yang System', was like a disk with a radius of roughly 90,000 light years, and they were at this time. Were in a position 40,000 light years from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>Meaning, to reach the location of the black hole at the center of the Pan Yang system, they would have to sail at the speed of light for 40,000 years, and to break away from the Pan Yang system and sail into the empty land, it would take roughly 50,000 years.</p><p></p><p>Either way, it wasn't something they could do.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually asked, "Is the sailing direction toward the inner circle of the galaxy, or the outer circle?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Inner circle."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately made a decision, "Okay, in a month's time, we'll go to the Purple Wolf Star."</p><p></p><p>The further one sailed to the inner circle, the more galaxies it corresponded to, the richer the material would be, and Su Hao would have a greater chance of obtaining what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the inner circle cosmic energy, compared to the outer circle, was more intense, and there was a higher possibility of giving birth to fluctuating induction substances.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao set the voyage, several people immediately took action, calculating the voyage trajectory, calculating the landing point, and at the same time, recovering the detectors scattered all over the Feather Weaving Star, ready for transfer.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had a plan before, which was to constantly move their position at the speed of light, to test whether the Doom System could catch up with them who were constantly shifting rapidly.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't, then it would be interesting to play the game of 'you chase me and I run away' with the Doom System, and it might grow from hatred to love and automatically submit to Su Hao's feet.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Su Hao and the others, who had finished replenishing their material, set sail again, flying towards the empty universe, aiming straight for the 'Purple Wolf Star'.</p><p></p><p>Then the crowd began to look forward again, "Will we encounter aliens?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time passed year after year, Su Hao and the others were immersed in the building of the 'Spiritual Eye' and could barely feel the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Within the airship, the seasons of spring, summer, fall, and winter changed, the grass and trees withered, and the native critters on the island changed generation after generation, maintaining their original appearance.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that had changed was the five children who had grown up within the airship, they had lived on the airship for twelve years, and at this time, they were already five twelve year old young teenagers.</p><p></p><p>The airship was full of them.</p><p></p><p>They had never lived on a planet before, and it was as if the small island of the spaceship, the various mechanical rooms and laboratories, and the 'sun' and starry sky above their heads were their entire world.</p><p></p><p>They also didn't have a clear understanding of concepts such as 'infinite earth', and could only know all of this from the simulation videos and the mouths of their elders: we, humans, originally lived on a huge, incomparable and vibrant planet.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, experiencing it in person and seeing it on video were ultimately two different feelings.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'vibrant' planet was just an illusion to them.</p><p></p><p>This day Fei Yuan came from the distance, while the five little teenagers were already sitting quietly at the pavilion, waiting for class to begin.</p><p></p><p>Both sides greeted each other, and after Feiyuan taught a math lesson, it was time for the cultivation session.</p><p></p><p>This was the session that the five young teenagers looked forward to the most, not only because Feiyuan's lessons were interesting, but also because through cultivation, they all felt a change in themselves.</p><p></p><p>When Ling Baihua closed her eyes, she was able to feel the pulsations of life in her surroundings, and she could even see that the breeze was blowing the blades of grass to the point that they were gently trembling.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Xiafeng was able to feel the movement of his body's five organs and six viscera, and he could also precisely control the muscles in his body to make movements that ordinary people could not make.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qiu Ye's hearing was superb, and even if he plugged his ears, he could still hear the whispers of the small animals.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In other words, Fei Yuan's 'breaking the surface with a point' experiment was basically a success.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power, it was possible to break through the limits of the human body's own physical body by converging energy through the 'Focus System'.</p><p></p><p>Only, using this method to break through the limitations of spiritual power would have some after-effects to a greater or lesser extent.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ling Baihua, who could feel the pulsations of life in her surroundings, was more or less slow to react when she opened her eyes to observe; for example, Yuan Xiafeng was able to control his own body, causing him to become unusually active, always more irritable, and wanting to look for siblings to fight with; for example, Yuan Qiuye's over-hearing was slightly weaker corresponding to other senses ......</p><p></p><p>Fei Yuan guessed that this might be the reason why spiritual power, after converging at one point, affected other aspects of development.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, his experiment, it worked!</p><p></p><p>After giving these five children an acceptance of their cultivation results, Feiyuan's tone changed and said, "You are twelve years old this year, congratulations on successfully graduating from the small school and officially entering the middle school."</p><p></p><p>The five little ones were surprised, "Graduated from elementary school?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan added, "The second stage of study is: Immortal Cultivation! I hope you guys will continue to work hard and completely change the trajectory of your lives."</p><p></p><p>Five Little Ones: "Immortal cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan said, "Cultivating Immortality can prolong your lives, and perhaps one day in the future, you'll be able to encounter a living planet that you've longed for in this vast universe, and then, you'll know what our home planet is like."</p><p></p><p>Of course, such a probability wasn't high, but without actually going out and exploring the end of life, who could be sure that one really couldn't encounter it?</p><p></p><p>After class, Feiyuan returned to the lab and briefly reported the results of the five children's cultivation to Su Hao, then said, "Mr. Javi's 'breaking the surface with a point' theory of spiritual strengthening is feasible from the results of the experiment.</p><p></p><p>Currently, I have brought these five children onto the path of cultivation, I will continue to guide their spiritual cultivation and make various attempts, and it is expected that within fifty years, I will be able to come up with a more reliable conclusion."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed a smile and said, "Your thinking is right, perhaps 'Above the Transformation of God', will soon be successful. Feiyuan, you really are a rare genius."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan also shook his head and smiled, "What I can have are just immature ideas, and these ideas, they are not complicated, and people in general just don't connect them ...... to each other The one that really allows things to progress quickly is still you, Mr. Javi.</p><p></p><p>Your degree of erudition, over the years, has refreshed my knowledge time and time again.</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid I'll never be able to catch up with you."</p><p></p><p>The longer he was in contact with Su Hao, the self-confidence in Feiyuan's heart was crushed to near nothing, which was the legendary: 'collapse of the dao heart'.</p><p></p><p>Now, the heart that wanted to outshine Su Hao in every way was long gone.</p><p></p><p>He thought more about living well, following Mr. Javi as he traveled through the universe, and seeing all sorts of amazing things.</p><p></p><p>The heart of fighting was faded and the desire to explore was stronger, this was his new pleasure, right?</p><p></p><p>Flying Regulus laughed bitterly and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned and said, "My 'foraging for one' coding for the 'Spiritual Eye' is basically complete, in at most two years, you'll be able to use your homemade eyes to see colors you couldn't originally see!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yuan simply couldn't imagine how the Mr. Jarvie in front of him had coded the 'Foraging One' substance so that it could connect to the brain consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This was simply impossible to accomplish in his opinion!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao ignored Feiyuan's shocked color and asked, "How is the design of your 'spiritual eye' structure diagram?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan said, "It's already made, but the current product has too many flaws and too much interference, so we're still optimizing it. Originally, we wanted to use a spherical structure, but later realized that there were too many restrictions, so now we are changing to a circular structure.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty lies in the processing of the signal, and we are considering plugging it into the 'Knowledge Station' system."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded with satisfaction, "It's best to integrate it with the Sense Stage."</p>

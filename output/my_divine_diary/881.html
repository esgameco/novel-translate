        <h1>Chapter 881</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"My name is Mountain Chicken Bro, a small-time hoodlum with grand ambitions. I firmly believe that I will definitely become a powerful martial arts master in the future. Unfortunately, after freeloading at the Red Flower Brothel, I failed to escape as planned and was cornered and hacked to death in a dead-end alley.</p><p></p><p>But heaven did not abandon me. I inexplicably woke up and gained a new life. Although I don't know why this happened, I vow that I will become a martial arts master, making up for the regrets of my previous life.</p><p></p><p>I am no longer called Mountain Chicken Bro, that is in the past. From now on, I will be called Loren Maddy."</p><p></p><p>A new life, a new journey. Mountain Chicken Bro was full of longing for the future, just waiting to make a big splash after growing up.</p><p></p><p>For now, Mountain Chicken Bro and his nominal mother lived with that overly enthusiastic bearded man.</p><p></p><p>In this crazy and chaotic gold rush town of Heaven's Prairie, without a strong man to watch over them, even great wealth could easily fall into others' hands, and their very lives could be at risk.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mountain Chicken Bro decided to temporarily live under another's roof, even though he occasionally discovered the kind-faced bearded man had an improper relationship with his mother.</p><p></p><p>"I need strength, to become a martial arts master with the ability to protect myself and my mother. I heard in the Brave World there is a special Brave Fruit. Eating one can grant a person tremendous power. In a few years, I'll go venture into that Brave World."</p><p></p><p>Waking from death made him realize his own extraordinariness. He was full of confidence in the future.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity Brother Zhi didn't come with me, otherwise we brothers could adventure through the world together again."</p><p></p><p>He got up and walked outside: "Starting today, I'll train my body diligently, striving to gain tremendous power as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Two minutes later, Mountain Chicken Bro cursed loudly: "Damn! So tiring, can't run anymore, need to rest a bit first."</p><p></p><p>And that "bit" of rest lasted a whole day.</p><p></p><p>The next day he ran two laps, then cried out about his weak legs and rested again: "I'll get used to this world first, then train my body. With such hard work, I'm sure to become a martial arts master."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the bearded man roared with laughter: "Little Maddy, what are you doing with that little bit of fuss every day?"</p><p></p><p>Mountain Chicken Bro said coldly: "My grand ambition is something a gold digger like you can't understand. I'm training my body every day. I want to become stronger, earn a lot of money, and have many women."</p><p></p><p>The bearded man couldn't stop laughing, then showed off his brawny muscles: "Then you'd better get serious. Just messing around a little each day won't make you stronger. See these powerful muscles of mine? Even with such strength, I'm still not qualified to venture into the Brave World. If you want to make more money and sleep with more women, you've got a long way to go."</p><p></p><p>Mountain Chicken Bro seemed insulted, his face flushing as he said: "That's why I said you don't understand my grand ambition. Mind your own business. I will definitely become powerful, just you wait and see."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Mountain Chicken Bro's actions were all seen by the Eighteen Deities.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari couldn't bear to watch: "This kid is the incarnation of the World's Will? He looks spirited enough, but he just lies down after a bit of movement, too weak! In my Golden Land, he's one of my subjects, but his soft appearance is embarrassing for me."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, maybe his potential hasn't been unlocked yet. Look, he works so hard every day, full of energy, with an intense desire to become powerful. You can see the burning passion in his heart. He's a bit lazy, but he's still young."</p><p></p><p>"A heart full of desire for power, yet no real action. Aren't there people like that all over? If this person wasn't a bit different from others, and Lord Leanne hadn't specially instructed us to look after him, I wouldn't even look at him."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he seems just like those kids with empty fantasies. True masters naturally exude a tenacious quality. He's definitely not like that."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, hey, are you all criticizing the incarnation of the World's Will? He's just awakened. Don't look at a child through the lens of a mature hero. Everyone goes through a metamorphosis. We did too. Please be more tolerant."</p><p></p><p>"I can tolerate it, but I don't have the patience to observe such trash every day. I'd rather play games."</p><p></p><p>"Not doing the mission? That's 10,000 points every ten years."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have the patience either. And we don't all need to watch at the same time. For the same period, one observer is enough. How about we draw lots to set the observation order?"</p><p></p><p>"Makes sense, I agree!"</p><p></p><p>So the deities began drawing lots, and Bari the Golden God drew first position.</p><p></p><p>Bari: "......"</p><p></p><p>He could hardly believe that out of the eighteen deities, he actually drew first. What rotten luck!</p><p></p><p>The Order God Red Light smiled: "This child has a connection with you, Lord Bari. The task falls to you now."</p><p></p><p>The other deities then went off to play games, leaving only Bari staring blankly at the incarnation of the World's Will, the young Master Loren Maddy. As he watched, he couldn't help criticizing again: "This laziness and inability to endure hardship seems branded into his bones. I can't imagine how this World's Will could metamorphose into a true 'powerful' figure."</p><p></p><p>Don't look at how the eighteen deities never act properly. They deeply respect each other, because over their long years together, they've all discovered each other's unique bright points. Every single deity has an extraordinarily tenacious spirit - they naturally possess a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>This has nothing to do with whether they are deities or not.</p><p></p><p>In other words: It's precisely because they possess this powerful aura that they were ultimately able to become near-eternal deities, not that they gained this aura after becoming deities.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Bari hadn't detected any tenacious will from Mountain Chicken Bro. He kept shouting about "becoming a martial arts master", but what use was that?</p><p></p><p>Bari carefully reviewed the mission details again, confirming this was indeed the one, and said: "Nevermind, I'll just watch. But it's a whole year before the next rotation, too long. Why don't I give him something to do? Not only must I protect him, I'm also responsible for letting him face some setbacks to spur his growth."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Bari had a bright idea: "I'll let that bearded adoptive father develop some greed, and steal the gold he's hidden away. Heheh, easy, as gold prospectors obsessed with gold, no one understands better than me. Let's do that!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari gave himself a thumbs up for his cleverness.</p><p></p><p>Not only would he perfectly complete the mission, he'd have some fun too.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Suhao inserted Mountain Chicken Bro's consciousness into a boy's mind and waited for him to awaken, he used the "Seeker Zero Spirit Eye" to observe the "ripples" extending from the void and connecting to Mountain Chicken Bro's brain.</p><p></p><p>Like threads and blocks, like smoke and mist, they twisted and changed form, seeming to pass through all obstructions as they connected to the distant unknown regions of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Crosser Program succeeded. Mountain Chicken Bro has been locked onto by the ripples. As long as I follow the ripples outward, I'll eventually find their source. However, the current ripples aren't clear enough yet. I need to wait for more of Mountain Chicken Bro's actions. From my past observations, the greater the change to the world, the clearer the ripple lock, and the stronger the force fed back.</p><p></p><p>So I need to let Mountain Chicken Bro gain some power, then have him really stir things up across the world. Mountain Chicken Bro, I gave you another chance at life, don't let me down."</p><p></p><p>A crosser only gets one opportunity. If they fail to grow properly and die halfway, it means they're unsuitable as a crosser. Suhao will store their consciousness in the "Experimental Materials Station" for future experiments.</p><p></p><p>After observing Mountain Chicken Bro for a while and finding that aside from being much fainter than their three crossers, his ripples had no other special issues, Suhao flew out into the planet's outer space to carefully sense the faint ripples.</p><p></p><p>"I can clearly sense that over time, the ripples are gradually growing stronger, at quite a fast pace...Is this normal, or caused by some reason? Or could it be an influence left behind by we three? If so, Mountain Chicken Bro might die as soon as he wakes up..."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, deciding not to dwell too much on this issue for now. As time passed, the answer would inevitably reveal itself.</p><p></p><p>"Originating from Mountain Chicken Bro's consciousness and extending into the unknown starry void, the Seeker Zero Spirit Eye alone can't perceive the endpoint. Then I'll explore outward by following the ripples."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Suhao sent out over a thousand clones, flying out from various angles to explore along the twisting direction of the ripples.</p>

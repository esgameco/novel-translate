        <h1>Chapter 836</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The situation had developed to this point, and Nati knew that the only choice left for him was to cooperate with Leian Oakes in exchange for his life.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still cherished his own life very much and was unwilling to gamble his life on whether Leian could kill him, who was a 'divine light'.</p><p></p><p>For him, he would only struggle desperately when Leian tore up the verbal agreement and tried to kill him.</p><p></p><p>If he could live longer, he would have more opportunities to find Leian's weaknesses...</p><p></p><p>The most fundamental reason was that his arrogance as a deity had already been shattered during the extremely short period of contact with Leian Oakes.</p><p></p><p>He was still very powerful, but he could not deny that Leian Oakes was even more powerful. Before finding Leian's fatal weakness, perhaps even if all the other deities combined, they would not be Leian's match.</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder Nati surrendered under Suhao's might: "If what you say is true, I agree to your request, Leian Oakes. However, I have one condition."</p><p></p><p>Suhao generously said, "As long as you agree to cooperate with my experiment, anything is negotiable."</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder Nati said, "First, during the experiment, you are not allowed to harm my divine light, and the integrity of the divine light must be maintained;</p><p></p><p>Third, after completing your experiment, let me return to Dragon Land and never bother me again. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>After listening, Suhao readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because Suhao agreed too readily that the God of Thunder Nati became suspicious in his heart...</p><p>Would he tear up the agreement since he agreed so readily?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace of the Salvation City on the Varan Continent, the avatars of ten deities were chatting while drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>The main deity, the God of Salvation Baishen, this time took the form of a square and serious-looking man, sitting very upright. He said seriously, "Our dispatched divine envoys have returned. The Earth God Weila of the Mountain Tribe expressed full support for our actions and will soon come here in person with all the Mountain Tribe deities to discuss the campaign.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragon Tribe, as you all expected, that old black dragon was even unwilling to let us finish speaking and clearly wanted to shield that new red golden dragon deity. According to him, he believed we were plotting some conspiracy in the dark and threatened that if we dared to confront him directly, he was not afraid of anyone...</p><p></p><p>That red golden dragon deity, the God of Thunder Nati, was even more exaggerated. Our divine envoy didn't even get to see him once. Obviously, his attitude was very clear: Let's fight it out, who's afraid of whom!</p><p></p><p>Our envoy did see the other red golden dragon's deputy deity, the Goddess of Beauty Fuler, but according to her, she didn't want to get involved in this matter and said to find the God of Thunder Nati if there were any problems."</p><p></p><p>The deputy deity of Order, the Red Light, felt his whole body become excited. He licked his lips and said, "In fact, to truly resolve the problem, we still need to have a real fight. Looking back through history, which memorable event was resolved through negotiation? None of them, they were all resolved through bloodshed and violence. War is the best way to establish a new order."</p><p></p><p>The main deity of Resurrection, Zhouxia, laughed heartily, "Red Light, with all you said, you just want to fight, don't you? You can go stir up trouble in Dragon Land, I support you."</p><p></p><p>The deputy deity of Order, the Red Light, shook his head with a sneer, "It would be meaningless for me to go alone except to sacrifice an avatar. I admit I'm not a match for that old black dragon."</p><p></p><p>The deputy deity of Bathing Light, Yi, said indifferently, "If the information our divine envoys brought back is true, then the attitude of the dragons is very clear - they are unwilling to cooperate with us.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their attitude towards the newborn deity, what's worth our attention is that they have unilaterally violated the 'No New Deities in the World Covenant' we had previously established. They should have shared the responsibility of safeguarding each other's interests, but they have not fulfilled their due responsibility.</p><p></p><p>So we can consider that the dragon deities have unilaterally withdrawn from our organization. Since that is the case, we can exercise our responsibility without their consent."</p><p></p><p>The main deity of Resurrection, Zhouxia, asked with interest, "Oh? Then how does Sir Yi think we should exercise our responsibility?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy deity of Bathing Light, Yi, said, "It's very simple, all of us deities will charge into Dragon Land and temporarily take control of all areas of Dragon Land until we find the new red golden dragon deity."</p><p></p><p>The deputy deity of Order, the Red Light, sneered, "That's exactly what I want, but obviously the dragon deities won't agree."</p><p></p><p>Yi said indifferently, "We didn't expect them to agree. In fact, it's better if they don't agree - we can use this as an excuse to launch a full-scale attack on the Dragon Tribe, deploying all the forces of our believers and divine envoys. We'll bypass the dragon deities and dragon envoys, focusing mainly on slaughtering the ordinary dragons.</p><p></p><p>In terms of numbers, our humans and the allied Mountain Tribe have the advantage. As long as we find the red golden dragon and the three red golden wyverns from the video, kill them all, I judge that the new deity is still emotionally driven and won't be able to hide, and will come out to attack us directly.</p><p></p><p>At that time, we can concentrate all our forces to encircle and annihilate him!"</p><p></p><p>The main deity of Resurrection, Zhouxia's eyes lit up, "Brilliant! Not only can we lure out the new deity and kill him by concentrating our forces, but we can also take this opportunity to slaughter the ordinary dragons openly and weaken the Dragon Tribe's power. Most importantly, if the dragon deities come after us later, we can shut them up directly by citing the 'No New Deities in the World Covenant'. It's a strategy that kills three birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this is Sir Yi's plan, I'm full of admiration! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>After listening, the other deities' eyes slowly lit up as they expressed their approval one after another.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the main deity, the God of Salvation Baishen, turned to the deity of Night, Yongshi, and said, "What is your opinion, Sir Yongshi?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, as long as the three main deities agreed, the matter would be settled.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi showed a hint of a smile, "With such a brilliant strategy, I can't think of any reason to object. Of course, I fully support it."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Deity Bali glanced at the Bathing Light Deity Yi while stroking his chin, thinking to himself, "This guy, who claims to be the upright deity bathed in light, unexpectedly plays one trick after another when it comes to conspiracies. He's really too sinister, just like Yongshi with his belly full of dirty tricks. In the future, I need to be careful and wary of this guy."</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity Red Light licked his lips, "Then, when shall we start? My believers are already impatient!"</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation Baishen said seriously, "Of course, the sooner the better. Since you all agree with Sir Yi's view, then we'll proceed according to Sir Yi's plan, and I invite Sir Yi to be the overall commander for this operation. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Night Deity Yongshi showed a hint of a smile, thinking to himself, "This way, even if something goes wrong, it will have nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, south of the ancestral lands of Dragon Land, in the territory of the Black Lightning Dragon, a huge blackish dragon over thirty-five meters long was lying in the palace, enjoying the services of a group of sturdy and beautiful black female dragons.</p><p></p><p>As the blackish dragon was purring in pleasure, a female dragon envoy asked gently beside him, "Great Thunder God Ancient, the human divine envoy who came to pay respects to you a few days ago said that the Golden Dragon Tribe has given birth to a new deity, and it's even a main deity. It seems to be true. Are you really not concerned?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Ancient roared with laughter, "What a joke! There are only eighteen deities, and there will be fewer and fewer in the future. How could a new deity be born? The human deities are just bored and want to play some dirty games. It has always been like this for thousands of years. I am the Thunder God Ancient, how could I have time to indulge them in such petty games?"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, a surge of strong self-confidence emanated, "They can run wild and play their games, but if they dare provoke me, they will suffer the consequences. I am known as the strongest eternal deity, ahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The female dragon envoys, upon hearing this, snuggled even closer and endlessly praised the greatness of the Thunder God.</p><p></p><p>This made the Thunder God Ancient even more open-hearted, and at the same time, a thought arose: "Perhaps because I haven't taken action for many years, the living beings have forgotten the fear of being ruled by me. If so, I hope the human deities can stir up some excitement, so that I can stretch my muscles, and take the opportunity to settle old scores.</p><p></p><p>There are too few challenging things these days."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, this group of mischievous human deities still had some use.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Ancient suddenly said, "Xiya, my beloved consort, go on my behalf to find that fool golden dragon Nati and inquire about the rumors of the new deity in the Golden Dragon Tribe! And tell him that if a new deity is born in our Dragon Tribe, I will definitely protect it with all my might."</p><p></p><p>A female dragon beside the Thunder God Ancient rubbed against him before rising, "Respected Ancient, Xiya will complete your task."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Ancient showed a strange smile, his mouth widening more and more until he finally burst into loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>Protect the new deity? That was impossible; devouring the other party would better serve his interests.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he believed that the entire Dragon Tribe only needed him as the sole deity, for with his abilities, he could ensure the survival and continuation of the entire Dragon Tribe, and there was no need for five deities - two from the Golden Dragon Tribe and three from the Black Dragon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>If he could find the main bodies of the other four deities, he would definitely find a way to devour them all...</p>

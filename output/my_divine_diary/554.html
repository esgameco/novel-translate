        <h1>Chapter 554</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After much hassle, Gu Yin finally agreed to awaken Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of money, of course, and after verifying that the mission records from back then matched up, as well as Su Hao's solemn guarantee.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Gu Yin would never casually awaken two people of unknown origins.</p><p></p><p>According to the association's rules, the association could only recruit residents from its jurisdiction to become Source Mages.</p><p></p><p>There were many reasons for this, with ease of management being just one insignificant factor. Fundamentally, it was to maintain the special structural position of the entire Source Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>The rigid rules were set, but there was still room for flexibility. As long as you didn't say anything and I didn't say anything, many things could be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>And the small town of Huai Shui Zhen, with only a little over a thousand residents, was even more flexible, flexible to the point where basically no one was managing it.</p><p></p><p>In less than an hour, Gu Yin brought Ya Shan and Feng Cheng back, her face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yang, where did you find these two talents? They're almost catching up to you!"</p><p></p><p>She was truly shocked. In her eyes, these two youths who appeared out of nowhere possessed extraordinary talents, rarely seen. Even in populous cities, such a talent might not appear for a decade.</p><p></p><p>What baffled her the most was how their small town of Huai Shui Zhen could possibly produce three extremely talented Source Mages at the same time!</p><p></p><p>There must be some hidden factors that she didn't know about. It was simply inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's expressions showed surprise, complexity, and smugness, clearly having successfully awakened as Source Mages. Su Hao laughed and said, "Didn't I tell you? I rescued them during a mission, and when I saw them, it felt like seeing long-lost brothers. How was it, did it go smoothly? What kind of Mages did they awaken as?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin exclaimed in wonder, "The one called Ya Shan awakened as a Rare Source Mage of the Quality System. As for Feng Cheng...the Illusion System, a Divine Source Mage. This is actually the first time I've personally awakened a Divine Source Mage."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said in surprise, "Oh? Feng Cheng is an Illusion System Source Mage? What abilities does he have?"</p><p></p><p>Since Feng Cheng had no Source, he couldn't demonstrate, but he followed his senses and said, "It's hard to explain clearly. It seems my thoughts can interfere with the physical world, similar to my hands. Within the range my hands can reach, I can do anything. Now it has become my perceptual range, so I can do anything..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan blurted out, "Isn't that what's usually called superpowers?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng wondered, "What superpowers?"</p><p></p><p>Before Ya Shan could answer, he searched for information about superpowers on his omnipotent assistant and nodded, "It's more or less like superpowers."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said in amazement, "I didn't expect that you, Feng Cheng, would awaken such a formidable ability. You're practically invincible."</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that after Su Hao imprinted core runes like 'Perception' on Feng Cheng, combined with 'Divine Thought', his perceptual range had at least a 150,000-meter radius.</p><p></p><p>If his superpower radius was truly 150,000 meters...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled foolishly, "If that's the case, then I'll be able to do chores at the fastest speed from now on. Washing clothes, cooking, grilling meat, cleaning, and so on, I can do them all simultaneously. It's very convenient."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes also lit up, patting Feng Cheng's shoulder enviously, "Your ability is even more powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin secretly mocked, "A fine Divine Source Mage of the Illusion System, yet the first thing he thinks of is washing clothes and cooking. What a talent, befitting an Illusion System Source Mage..."</p><p></p><p>"Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, you two did well, hahaha!" For Su Hao, this was perfect. Ya Shan was a Quality System Source Mage, Feng Cheng was an Illusion System Source Mage, and he himself was an Ability System Source Mage. With the three of them collaborating on experiments, they could quickly figure out the three major conversion mechanisms of Source.</p><p></p><p>He was itching with anticipation, wishing he could pull the two of them into the lab right away for some good experimentation.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no rush. The two of them were too unfamiliar with Source at the moment and needed to train for a while to become proficient in mastering their Source abilities.</p><p></p><p>After thanking President Gu Yin again, he said, "President Gu Yin, how about letting these two join the Yang Wang Xing Squad as well? Let A Xing help guide them for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin frowned, "Your Yang Wang Xing Squad already has three people. Adding more would be too many. I suggest splitting them into other squads!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin didn't want the two talented youths Ya Shan and Feng Cheng to join the Yang Wang Xing Squad because in her view, the squad leader A Xing was far too reckless, constantly wanting to rush into bizarre disasters to seek death. That kind of spiritual obsession was beyond saving. She didn't want Ya Shan and Feng Cheng to accompany them in courting death. It would be more stable to have other more experienced squad leaders guide them.</p><p></p><p>That's right, in her view, the Yang Wang Xing Squad was a lost cause, it was only a matter of sooner or later...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood her concerns but said directly, "Five is just right. That way, the Yang Wang Xing Squad's configuration will be very complete and safer too. Don't worry, President Gu Yin!"</p><p></p><p>Normally, as long as a squad wasn't at full capacity, new awakened Source Mages could join whichever squad they wanted - this was the freedom of Source Mages.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin sighed and waved her hand, "Go on then!"</p><p></p><p>She would just pretend she had never helped these three awaken! Every year, who knows how many Source Mages end up buried in the wilderness. But these three would surely have a burial ground somewhere...</p><p></p><p>What else could she do if someone insisted on seeking death despite advice? She would just act as if she had never met them. Besides that, what else?</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao and the others left, Gu Yin sat dejectedly behind her desk, staring blankly at a painting on the wall. Finally, she muttered, "The ideological lessons over the years have failed."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Whether they could join the Yang Wang Xing Squad or not, Su Hao's words didn't count - they needed A Xing's approval.</p><p></p><p>After a phone call, A Xing and A Wang quickly appeared in the association's main hall. The moment they saw Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, their faces fell in disappointment, "They're not cute girls..."</p><p></p><p>They had been desperately hoping for an adorable girl to join their squad. But reality was always so cruel - those with a fate tied to their squad were all proper, tea-pot-mouthed men.</p><p></p><p>They had repeatedly invited the unattached Xiao Tang to join, but after much hesitation, as if afraid of awkwardness, she had rejected them and chosen to join another squad instead, leaving them disappointed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Now, if they accepted Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, their Yang Wang Xing Squad would be all men!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, A Xing and A Wang's faces became so contorted they almost twisted.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao consoled them, "A Xing, A Wang, look on the bright side. Look, these two aren't bad-looking either. With them, our squad will have five handsome guys. Once we become famous, we can form a boy group. We'll definitely become the dream boys of countless beautiful girls. A five-handsome-guy group, think about it carefully - would you rather have one or two cute girls, or all the beautiful girls in the world?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang's eyes gradually lit up, "That makes sense! Do we even need to think about it? Of course we want all the beautiful girls in the world!"</p><p></p><p>As proper men, they should have ambitions as vast as the world.</p><p></p><p>And so, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were given new names by A Xing - A Shan and A Feng. Then they found the counter girl Gu Lan to register them.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the squad's name changed to the 'Feng Shan Yang Wang Xing Squad'.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lan commented, "Your squad has the longest and hardest to remember name. Why not go for something shorter?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing grinned, "Hahaha, Gu Lan, you don't understand. This is romantic!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lan rolled her eyes at A Xing.</p><p></p><p>A Xing waved his hand grandly, "Let's go, to our usual place to celebrate the addition of our two new squad members! I'll also introduce you to the charming girls of Huai Shui Zhen, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>As they walked, A Wang suddenly sidled up to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, "A Shan, A Feng, why are your faces so fair, even fairer than me? Do you have some special whitening formula? Let's exchange notes..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan took a careful look and said, "But you're not dark either! A face as fair as yours is truly rare."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>This scratched A Wang's itch, and he couldn't help but laugh, "I've been paying attention to whitening since I was young. They say girls like fair-skinned guys. Looks like you two are kindred spirits, hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed, "I have plenty of whitening formulas, top-secret ones too. Use them and I guarantee your face will glow like a light bulb."</p><p></p><p>A Wang was amazed, "Awesome!"</p>

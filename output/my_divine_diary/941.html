        <h1>Chapter 941</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Feng Cheng suddenly thought of something and followed up with, "Boss Wei, now that we have fewer and fewer travelers on hand, and we expect to be out of them in a few decades, do you have any more to spare? I'd like to have a little more."</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "Boss Wei, I've found that those who are filtered out from the travelers are more in line with my requirements, so I need some on my side as well."</p><p></p><p>Now that Boss Vi was preparing to go into seclusion, these problems that they had no way of solving had to be brought up before Boss Vi officially went into seclusion, or else they would just have to wait.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Feng Cheng mention this matter, Su Hao then realized that the seven thousand crossers that had been included in before had almost gone through a round of training, and the Cross Star's automatic crosser placement system was about to face the risk of being cut off.</p><p></p><p>After he thought about it, there were some of the crossers who had previously failed in their experiences and died, but had certain redeeming qualities that were additionally saved by him, and he directly allocated this part of his consciousness information to the two.</p><p></p><p>And opened the traverser inclusion authority to them, so that the two of them could include the consciousness information into the pinball space according to their own needs, and allocate it into their respective 'consciousness pools'.</p><p></p><p>"I have opened a 'Consciousness Pool' for you, with a capacity limit of ten thousand, you are free to include and place them, but note that if these consciousnesses are unable to grow up smoothly and turn into our fellow travelers, then after a maximum of two placements, the consciousnesses will have to be put into the recycling station for destruction. "</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously said, "Can't it be utilized over and over again?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I've tried to utilize it repeatedly, the idea was good, but the end result was not good, and it also brought endless pain to the other party."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng said, "Understood Boss Wei."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Any more questions?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Boss Wei, the infinite land plan you mentioned before, will it be implemented? Feng Cheng and I seriously thought about it some time ago and found that with space technology, it is possible to realize it, and if it is confirmed to be implemented, we can find some planets to try it out in our spare time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Will do! If I successfully leave the gate this time, I will immediately start forming infinite lands to connect all the living planets!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On this day, it was the day that the eighteen deities were on a joint vacation, and they gathered on the Cross Star once again, looking for a place with beautiful mountains and water, and set up a barbecue hut, barbecuing and partying and chatting and farting.</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold-Barry skillfully coated the meat skewers with sauces and sprinkled them with chili peppers, and took a big bite of it, and as he ate, he suddenly realized that it wasn't the right taste.</p><p></p><p>He wondered, ''Your Excellencies, after such a long time, why hasn't His Excellency Lei An come out to meet us? This makes me very bottomless ah."</p><p></p><p>The God of Heavenly Suppression-Nati consoled him, "Don't worry, Sir Barry, as long as we work for Sir Lei An with all our heart, he will teach us the real thing after 10,000 years, so be patient, you're already so old that you can't wait 10,000 years."</p><p></p><p>Barry sighed, "Ten thousand years, that's too long, I can't wait any longer now."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand and clenched his fist, "I've fallen in love with my physical body, so strong and perfect, it's just a pity that nowadays it can only be confined to a few hundred planets, it's difficult to fly into space to travel the universe."</p><p></p><p>After they had accepted the task of building the 'Primordial Lord God', Su Hao had given them teleportation arrays to and from the various trial planets, allowing them to move around freely, but they hadn't learned the 'Starlight Swimming' or teleportation, which prevented them from going to places farther away.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing the colorfulness of the universe, they weren't willing to stay above the tiny planets, and they were curious about the more distant universe.</p><p></p><p>The God of Redemption-Hundred Bodies turned into a little girl's appearance and laughed, "I think His Excellency Lei An has forgotten about us, he doesn't need us anymore, it's just that we're the ones who got ourselves together to work for him."</p><p></p><p>The God of Recovery - By Summer immediately said, "Forgotten? How can that be, we should know that our system is able to directly contact His Excellency Lei An, only that it has now risen to 10,000 points a time. It means that His Excellency Lei An has something very important to do right now and wants us not to disturb. He will inevitably come to us when he's done with his business."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe! At least now we're able to travel to and from several hundred planets, it's much better than before, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"How would someone who has seen the stars be willing to be confined to one planet? The heart has gained freedom, but without wings to fly, it's a pain."</p><p></p><p>"Then what if Lord Lei An really forgot about us?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll beat up whoever proposed to work for His Excellency Lei An for 10,000 years in the first place."</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked wistfully at Natty, who immediately pointed at the God of Bathing Light-Easy and defended, "It has nothing to do with me, right? It was His Excellency Yi who encouraged everyone to go. And bodies are expensive, where would I have the points to repair them if I break them, Your Excellencies please calm down a bit."</p><p></p><p>Yi smiled faintly, "I have records, want to see?"</p><p></p><p>Natty suddenly felt that the kebabs didn't smell good anymore, "......"</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the system prompted that a new World Will was about to descend.</p><p></p><p>He immediately changed the topic, "There's a new world will being born, will there be any good seedlings this time? Come come come, let's all take a look."</p><p></p><p>Barry muttered breathlessly, "This world is a mother, right, to be able to give birth to world wills unceasingly, it's simply unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowd opened the system to watch the world will in real time.</p><p></p><p>In a warehouse, ten men and women awoke in turn, three of them got up and looked at their surroundings and their hands incredulously, murmuring, "I ...... I'm back? I was reborn? No, not reborn, but resurrected. That is to say, I have been given a second chance! This time ...... this time I must ......"</p><p></p><p>Soon all ten people awoke, and those who woke up for the first time were confused, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The three second time travelers were very vigilant in observing the others, and soon found each other, gathered together, and tried, "I've experienced five trial worlds."</p><p></p><p>"I've experienced four."</p><p></p><p>"Then I've had a bit of luck and experienced six."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that all but three of us are newcomers."</p><p></p><p>"No, actually, we're newcomers too... notice your status? It's all zeroed out, and truth be told, I died in the fifth world, which would be the second reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>"So, we were judged by the system as newcomers and joined the newcomer's team to start over?"</p><p></p><p>"It can be interpreted that way."</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at each other and said something, and they all saw the color of excitement in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone extended his hand and said, "Let's work together! This time, we will definitely be able to successfully complete the final trial."</p><p></p><p>"Cooperate for now, and we'll talk about the specifics after we complete our first mission and return to space."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Although the three were not teammates at one time, they had a very tacit understanding with each other, and after quickly communicating, the man from the six worlds stepped forward and raised his hand to shout loudly to attract the attention of the others.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, please listen to me!"</p><p></p><p>After seeing everyone looking at him, he added: "It is with great regret that I tell you all that you can't go back, right now you are experiencing a trial game organized by the gods, and only by completing the final trial can you successfully survive.</p><p></p><p>You guys think back carefully, did you hear the first mission description? The flood will come here in half an hour, if you can't escape successfully, then the end is to be washed away by the flood and die.</p><p></p><p>Those of you who don't want to die, listen to the arrangements of our three senior people and ensure that you pass the test successfully."</p><p></p><p>Someone questioned, "Senior ones?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to explain, when we escape this place, you will understand everything."</p><p></p><p>The quality of these three was too much better than the others, and when faced with the disobedient ones, they directly beat them up, and soon they organized the crowd and began to flee.</p><p></p><p>The gods who had watched the performance of the travelers the entire time were astonished at the scene.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with those three world wills?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't these the newborn world wills? Why does it feel like they know a lot about it."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the world is putting back those failed world wills that died before?"</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely, I think the world will is confused in the head and made a mistake, so what's the point of these failures being cast back? The facts have already proven that they failed."</p><p></p><p>"I think it's because the world is too lazy, it can't think of new personalities anymore, so it simply cast back the new ones from before."</p><p></p><p>"It feels interesting, dead people reborn again, can they learn from their past failures? It's really worth looking forward to."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so, because there are some character weaknesses that don't go away just because you've died once, the mistakes you should have made will still be made. Those that can be changed are called shortcomings, those that can't are called weaknesses, most of those world wills that died died on their weaknesses."</p><p></p><p>"Somewhat reasonable, but not all of them are like that, let's wait and see."</p><p></p><p>"I've recently fallen in love with writing novels, I suddenly had a great idea, I decided to write a novel related to this."</p><p></p><p>"Good luck with the big sale."</p><p></p><p>For a while, the deities seemed to have found a new joy, and their attention was focused on these second reincarnation travelers, waiting for them to create miracles.</p><p></p><p>They had never thought of such a situation as 'the will of a dead world being reborn' before, and it was very new to them.</p><p></p><p>The sadness of being forgotten by Su Hao disappeared for the most part.</p><p></p><p>......</p>

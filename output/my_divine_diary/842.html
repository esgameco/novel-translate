        <h1>Chapter 842</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This is unfair! When creating the separate will, you must have secretly intervened, otherwise why am I not the main body, but a separate incarnation? Logically speaking, I should be the main body, I should be the God of Eternal Thunder - Gu."</p><p></p><p>"Bastard! You're just a lowly and weak separate incarnation, how dare you call yourself the God of Eternal Thunder - Gu in front of me? Without me, you are nothing! Shouldn't you be grateful that I created you?"</p><p></p><p>"Bastard, what kind of dragon are you that I wouldn't know? Be grateful to you? I spit on that, you dragon race trash, you only became a god by chance plus shamelessness, viciousness and cruelty."</p><p></p><p>"How could I have created an ungrateful piece of goods like you who can't tell right from wrong? If I didn't have to deal with you, I would have killed you right now, just for that bit of soul force."</p><p></p><p>"Come at me if you dare, let Lord Lei An remove the restrictions, and we'll redistribute again. I'm the main body."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's testing method was simple: first let the deities control a separate incarnation, then put their main body and incarnation in adjacent small spaces, separated by a spatial structure barrier, and ask them to chat idly with their incarnation...</p><p></p><p>Before long, the originally harmonious main body and incarnation started arguing.</p><p></p><p>After they realized they were fundamentally different, they inevitably started arguing and exposing each other's secrets.</p><p></p><p>The root cause was that the incarnation found that over time, without the massive signal exchange with the main body, the soul force carrying the separate will was gradually weakening, causing the complete consciousness to tend towards collapse.</p><p></p><p>This collapse was not fast or complete. As long as the will was based in the brain, the separate will would not completely dissipate and die. But inevitably, it would become a completely different will.</p><p></p><p>This process of collapse could be seen as the degeneration of the will.</p><p></p><p>So the separate will was unhappy, why was it collapsing...why did it enter the incarnation...</p><p></p><p>Then the main body was also unhappy, how dare you, a small incarnation, question the main body?</p><p></p><p>So, as they wished, Su Hao removed the spatial barrier separating them, allowing the fiercely arguing main body and incarnation to reconnect and merge.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao saw the strange, rapidly changing expression on the dragon face of the God of Eternal Thunder - Gu, extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked, "Lord Gu, how does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Eternal Thunder - Gu couldn't speak for a long time, unable to express that strange feeling no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago he was arguing with his incarnation, and the next moment they had merged...</p><p></p><p>He had cursed himself out? And gone overboard with it?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the conflicted look on the God of Eternal Thunder - Gu's face, Su Hao didn't push him, simply saying, "It's okay if you can't express it."</p><p></p><p>Then he casually separated Gu's main body and incarnation again.</p><p></p><p>Not long after being separated, the incarnation was hopping mad again: "Damn! I'm an incarnation again? Main body, you cheated! No...the main body doesn't seem to have messed around, I am the main body, no, I'm the incarnation...bastard...I don't understand!"</p><p></p><p>Not just the God of Eternal Thunder - Gu, Su Hao tormented the other deities as well.</p><p></p><p>After being tormented, the deities all developed psychological shadows about creating separate wills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, tormenting these deities was not Su Hao's main goal. His main goal was to study how soul force carries separate wills and enters incarnations.</p><p></p><p>If he could figure out the principles, then he could smoothly solve the problem of brain transplants from his previous life, and smoothly transfer the consciousness information from the dragon hatchling's brain to other bodies or the 'spirit brains' he made, achieving immortality.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was solving the 'spiritual power' issue of the spirit brain.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe fusing soul force and the spirit brain together could give the spirit brain multi-dimensional spiritual power, completely solving this problem."</p><p></p><p>But that was something to research later. After casually recording this guess in his log, he turned his thoughts to another issue: why did the soul force carrying the separate will degenerate after losing its connection and exchange with the main body? How did the deities replenish their soul force after expending it?</p><p></p><p>Figuring this out might allow him to gain deeper insight into the Ten-Colored Plates.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Maybe it has to do with information bodies. No need to rush, one step at a time, there's plenty of time. And I don't need to worry about ruining these deities, there are still thirteen more outside. If I ruin them all, I should still be able to find the home planet of the Ten-Colored Plates! I believe there are many of these Ten-Colored Plates in this universe."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The human and Mountain Elf deities didn't know they were already being targeted.</p><p></p><p>After finding no trace of Dragon Race deities anywhere in the Dragon Continent, they couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled: That shouldn't be right? Those old dragons had such fierce tempers, we peed all over their den, yet they could still hold back?</p><p></p><p>Among the human deities, the God of Eternal Night - Yongshi and the God of Gold - Barlimo inexplicably thought of their suddenly disappeared incarnations...</p><p></p><p>The two deities secretly met to exchange information.</p><p></p><p>Barlimo said uneasily, "Lord Yongshi, I feel something is off. Ever since coming to the Dragon Continent, I've felt an ominous aura from this eerily quiet place."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi nodded slightly, "Perhaps we two have had more contact with the 'Hidden God', so I feel it too. When the divine messengers previously reported that the main god of the Red Gold Dragons, Lord Nati, did not receive them, I was very puzzled. When divine messengers come bearing the will of deities, no matter what, a deity incarnation needs to receive them. This has been the unspoken rule between all deities for so many years, it's hard to just not see them."</p><p></p><p>"I guess Lord Nati didn't see our messengers for some other reason. Now, not just Lord Gu but the other deities have also disappeared without a trace..."</p><p></p><p>Barlimo followed up, "At first it was just not seeing Lord Nati, the other deities all responded. But in less than a month, all the deities on the Dragon Continent disappeared, which makes it hard for me to ignore the connection between these two things. This isn't as simple as them just hiding.</p><p></p><p>And this whole series of events began after that Red Gold Dragon returned to the Dragon Continent. No, to be precise, everything started after that explosion in the Cloudrealm Mountains, closely tied to that Red Gold Dragon."</p><p></p><p>The two deities looked at each other, seeing the wariness in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi smiled faintly, "Nothing is eternal and unchanging, all things in heaven and earth go through cycles of tribulation. That includes us deities.</p><p></p><p>Barlimo, the situation is unclear now, but this may be an inevitable tribulation we deities must face. Considering you are my deputy god, I'll remind you, stay vigilant at all times, and try to hang back, don't be rash."</p><p></p><p>Barlimo understood Yongshi's meaning: Don't take the lead yourself, let the other deities be proactive, you just cheer from behind.</p><p></p><p>Barlimo nodded, "I understand, Lord Yongshi."</p><p></p><p>He was very clear on this principle. This was why after being defeated by Su Hao, he directly found the God of Eternal Night - Yongshi, essentially trying to pass the buck to Yongshi while benefiting himself on the side.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect things to be much more complicated than he imagined, even provoking all the human deities to wage war against the Dragon Race deities.</p><p></p><p>Barlimo then asked, "So does Lord Yongshi still plan to join the other deities in searching for the Hidden God?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi just smiled, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Barlimo felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>By now, the deities' sects had organized huge forces of divine guards and soul cultivators, advancing through two channels towards the Dragon Continent. It was estimated that in another month, they would land on this great continent and launch a battle that would leave a heavy mark in the history books.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Dragon Race's ancestral lands on the Dragon Continent also received news that the human armies were invading the Dragon Continent and declaring war on the Dragon Race.</p><p></p><p>The dragons instinctively wanted to find their deities to follow into battle and drive the invading humans back.</p><p></p><p>But soon, all the high-spirited dragons were dumbstruck, because they realized their deities were nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>They searched everywhere the deities' temples and dragon messengers frequented, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that the dragons realized, besides the deities and messengers, there was not a single authoritative figure left in the entire Dragon Race.</p><p></p><p>After all, the dragons were different from humans. They had no concept of soul cultivator ranks, only valuing individual might. They normally did their own thing, going to the messengers if there was an issue, rarely forming groups. As a result, there were no large teams or extremely prestigious dragons to take charge now.</p><p></p><p>The phrase "a swarm of dragons without a leader" perfectly described the predicament the Dragon Race currently faced.</p><p></p><p>One-on-one against human soul cultivators or divine guards, the dragons weren't afraid. Even facing groups of human soul cultivators, they had ways to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>But against human divine messengers, they could only get beaten down.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the mother dragon Shaduo, who had gone out hunting for her two hatchlings, happened to meet an acquaintance Red Gold Dragon and learned from this dragon friend about the human armies invading the Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>When that Red Gold Dragon friend lamented, "It's just that we don't know where our Dragon Race deity lords have gone? Could it be our deity lords have abandoned us? Will the lords return to save us?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo secretly thought, "The deity lords have not abandoned us, the lords have just been captured by my son and are being properly detained..."</p><p></p><p>But of course, even if she told the truth, no one would believe her.</p>

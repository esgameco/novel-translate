        <h1>Chapter 616</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The scene unfolding before his eyes exceeded Feizhou's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Someone was actually performing how to transform an ordinary object into a source right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This was even more absurd and unbelievable than his godfather being his real father.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't such an ability only possessed by 'gods'? Wasn't such an ability mastered only by the Creator?</p><p></p><p>Yet, what did he just witness?</p><p></p><p>Feizhou remained speechless for a long time, finally muttering: "This...how is this possible! How could a human achieve such a level..."</p><p></p><p>Usurping the authority of gods, countless people throughout human history had made countless attempts, but the ultimate answer was always: impossible!</p><p></p><p>What left him most dumbfounded was that he had actually participated in it!</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng's reactions were completely different. They smiled and congratulated Lao Da Wei on making further progress, seemingly not at all shocked!</p><p></p><p>And indeed, that was the case.</p><p></p><p>Could anything Lao Da Wei set his sights on escape?</p><p></p><p>It was merely a matter of how long it would take to crack it!</p><p></p><p>All of this was within the expectations of the two of them!</p><p></p><p>He demonstrated his new technique without any worry that Feizhou could learn it.</p><p></p><p>Because achieving this was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Even if he openly told everyone that the secret to transforming matter into source was the foci of an ellipse,</p><p></p><p>There were almost no others who could freely transform matter into source like him. Knowing the principle did not mean being able to do it.</p><p></p><p>Theory and reality were separated by an ocean, and only someone as erudite as Su Hao could easily build a bridge across it.</p><p></p><p>Without sufficient knowledge and various technical reserves, others would be unable to accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao never worried that others would learn his new technique. If it could be used to develop new things, he would be overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>His goal had always been to learn more, acquire more knowledge, and explore the unknown of this universe. Whether others knew or not did not conflict with his ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite was that it did not threaten his core existence.</p><p></p><p>As long as his core was not threatened, even if it was the 'source', the authority of 'gods', Su Hao could share it without blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>At the root, the 'source' was merely a tool for Su Hao to explore the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The four arrived at the dining room. Yashan and Fengcheng served up the delicious dishes they had prepared, full of appealing colors, aromas and flavors. Just looking at them could make one's mouth water.</p><p></p><p>Except for Feizhou who was a bit restrained, the others ate heartily, drank deeply, and were extremely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao cut off a large piece of crispy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside roasted meat, put it in his mouth, took two bites and praised: "This roasted meat is undoubtedly from Yashan's hands. I didn't expect that after so many years of not cooking, Yashan's culinary skills have not declined but improved. Truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Yashan humbly said: "That's a must. If I hadn't made some progress, how could I dare serve it up?"</p><p></p><p>Then he added: "I don't know if it's just my perception, but this kid Fengcheng's cooking skills have greatly improved since being brought to try meat by Axing and the others."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng swallowed the roasted meat in two or three bites, and immediately said: "That's because I've realized the true meaning of life. Not just my cooking skills have greatly improved, but also my knowledge. It won't be long before I catch up to you two elders."</p><p></p><p>Yashan mocked: "You little brat, always running off to that Immortal Palace every few days. Dreaming of catching up to me in the daytime!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "Hey! Do you know how the assistant evaluates me now?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "Could it be 'clueless about everything'? Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's mouth twitched: "How could that be? The assistant's evaluation of me is 'little addition and subtraction master'! Although the evaluation is not high, I'm already very satisfied. If I study hard for another year, I'll definitely be able to make further progress and reach the realm of 'little multiplication and division master'! By the way Lao Da Yashan, what level has the assistant evaluated you at?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed: "I've already reached 'apprentice researcher'."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh--" Fengcheng gasped in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly believe that Yashan had already reached such a level!</p><p></p><p>The assistant's levels were 'clueless about everything', 'newbie', 'little master', 'library', 'computer', 'researcher', 'scholar', 'explorer'.</p><p></p><p>These were small levels casually set by Su Hao to motivate Fengcheng to study hard, and Fengcheng really bought into it.</p><p></p><p>What Fengcheng didn't expect was that the assistant's evaluation of Yashan had reached the researcher level. Looked at this way, the gap between him and Yashan was still absurdly large.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately said loudly: "No way! My self-esteem has been severely damaged. Starting tomorrow, I'll double my study tasks and won't go to the Immortal Palace to play music anymore."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also laughed: "Does Fengcheng need me to give him a shot to temporarily seal that ability? It can be unsealed whenever he reaches the researcher level."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's face immediately fell: "Never mind! Having it and not having it are two different things."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Feizhou listened to Su Hao and the others discussing esoteric topics, completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking his fill, Su Hao turned to Feizhou and said: "Feizhou, you've really helped me out big time this time. Is there anything you want? Feel free to say it, and if it's something I can do, I'll definitely help you achieve it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng immediately fell silent and turned to look at Feizhou. They didn't expect this kid to be so valued by Lao Da Wei, who promised him a wish. That was no small thing - even if he said he wanted to live 5,000 years, Lao Da Wei could probably grant him longevity!</p><p></p><p>It was Feizhou himself who didn't realize just how rare such an opportunity was. Being stared at by Yashan and Fengcheng, he felt rather awkward and his face flushed red with shyness.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng inwardly shouted: "Quick, say it! Ask for longevity! Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>But to their surprise, Feizhou shook his head: "I don't really want anything. Plus in this half year, I've already learned a lot from Mr. Jia Wei. Of course, if I could come here often to read books, that would be even better. The knowledge recorded in the books here exceeds my imagination."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng's eyes widened as they inwardly sighed: "This kid is impressive, he even knows how to take a step back to make progress! No wonder Lao Da Wei values him."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also smiled: "That's no big deal, you can come whenever you want."</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a positioning stone and handed it to Feizhou: "Keep this stone on you. If you encounter danger you can't overcome, inputting a bit of source into it might just save your life."</p><p></p><p>Feizhou didn't stand on ceremony either, taking it with thanks and curiously observing it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This thing could save lives? It looked no different from an ordinary egg-shaped stone, he couldn't see how it could save lives.</p><p></p><p>However, Feizhou had not the slightest disdain. After all, the one giving him the stone was someone who had usurped the authority of the Creator.</p><p></p><p>After Feizhou left, Su Hao took Yashan and Fengcheng into space.</p><p></p><p>Below their feet was this beautiful spherical planet. Beyond that were the myriad stars and the impenetrable darkness of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it made one's heart fill with trepidation, sighing at the vastness of the universe and lamenting the insignificance of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao directly transmitted his voice to Yashan and Fengcheng: "Yashan, Fengcheng! We have now cracked the core secret of the 'source', achieving our main goal.</p><p></p><p>Unless something unexpected happens, in at most 500 years, we will depart this planet aboard the small world base and explore towards an unknown region of the universe. We'll go as far as we can until death comes."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng's souls trembled as they sensed an indescribable aura emanating from Su Hao, washing over them. In that moment, they felt different.</p><p></p><p>Everything felt different. Because at this moment, Yashan and Fengcheng sensed that their souls had been elevated under Lao Da Wei's aura.</p><p></p><p>The two of them gained a certain enlightenment: "From this moment on, I am no longer a mortal!"</p><p></p><p>This was domineering aura!</p><p></p><p>This was Lao Da Wei's domineering aura to rule the universe, it made their blood boil feverishly.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes towards Su Hao were already burning with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao continued: "What we need to do in these next few hundred years is very simple.</p><p></p><p>That is, to gain absolute powerful strength, powerful enough to withstand planetary impacts, and to summarize methods of using 'source' to transform into specific materials, ensuring we always have sufficient supplies no matter the circumstances."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked out into the depths of space, not knowing what kind of circumstances they would face after venturing into space.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be loneliness!</p><p></p><p>Even traveling at light speed for 5,000 years, against the vast backdrop of the universe, they might not even leave this galaxy cluster.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao still wanted to try, at the very least, to take this first step!</p>

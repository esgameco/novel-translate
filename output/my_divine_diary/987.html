        <h1>Chapter 987</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang suddenly appeared behind the old giant king.</p><p></p><p>The old giant king's pupils contracted: "Such fast speed."</p><p></p><p>"Ah hit hit hit~"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's fists rained down crazily on the old giant king, making the shield around him clang loudly. He then briefly gathered power...</p><p></p><p>'Impact Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>A blast of elemental impact cannon pinned the old giant king firmly to the ground. The powerful impact blasted a huge pit in the earth and kicked up a raging sandstorm.</p><p></p><p>'Giant Wheel Bullet'!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>After a muffled sound, Lyu Yijiang was flung away by a great force, a trickle of fresh blood oozing from the corner of his mouth. Even his martial arts robe, hardened from long battles, was slightly crumpled.</p><p></p><p>After a fierce exchange, the two sides took to the air again, squaring off at a distance.</p><p></p><p>The giant king and furry-tailed king's eyes revealed undisguised surprise: "These three guys are so physically powerful. Their integrated fusion means my attacks can't break through their defenses, only inflicting minor injuries.</p><p></p><p>And after fighting for so long, the three warriors don't seem winded at all. The Raging Three Warriors really have some skills. They're qualified to join our demon realm."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's trio also secretly marveled at the two young men before them: "These two are so strong, far stronger than those who called themselves racial kings before. The shields around them can't be broken, and even if breached, instantly regenerate. This feeling of being unable to attack is something we've only felt against Mr. Jia before.</p><p></p><p>Plus, these two have so many tricks up their sleeves, all kinds of strange abilities that make them impossible to guard against."</p><p></p><p>After one bout, both sides truly felt how formidable the other was.</p><p></p><p>The old giant king said softly to the old furry-tailed king: "With ordinary strength, we can't capture them, at most restrain them briefly. And we can't use vicious methods against them, since we're trying to recruit them, not kill. Once we use certain tactics, they'll become enemies, which is inconvenient since we'll be working together in the future! Why don't we withdraw for now?"</p><p></p><p>The old furry-tailed king shook his head: "Inadvisable. These three are indeed rare talents. If we don't absorb them into the demon realm now, other recruitment teams will target them in the future, depriving us of the credit."</p><p></p><p>The old giant king said: "You're right, then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment's thought, the old furry-tailed king said: "Why don't we get the Order Venerable directly? I'm sure he'll be interested."</p><p></p><p>The old giant king nodded: "Good idea."</p><p></p><p>They then used a special method to contact the Order God - Red Light, briefly explaining the current situation and emphasizing the three warriors' extraordinarily tough adamantine bodies.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a red-haired youth appeared beside the old giant king - it was the Order God Red Light himself.</p><p></p><p>The old giant and furry-tailed kings immediately paid respects: "Jugen, Maoxi, greetings Venerable Order."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, Red Light turned his gaze to Lyu Yijiang's trio, curiously asking: "Are these three the Raging Three Warriors you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>The old giant king nodded: "Correct."</p><p></p><p>Red Light didn't speak, instead entering the celestial soul realm to review the events involving Lyu Yijiang's trio, studying them carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? These three aren't in the Three Realms network, and there's no information about them before. Their first appearance was at the edge of the Infinite Lands. Tsk tsk, their physical strength really is formidable - perfect to recruit into my forces."</p><p></p><p>After viewing the trio's exploits in the Infinite Lands from the perspectives of those they encountered, Red Light took a keen interest in the three of them.</p><p></p><p>When Lyu Yijiang's trio saw the suddenly appearing Red Light, a chill ran down their spines.</p><p></p><p>From Red Light, they sensed an aura reminiscent of Mr. Jia - that unique scent emanating from his body that they could never forget.</p><p></p><p>After seeing a thousand identical Mr. Jias arrayed before them, they developed a special feeling towards this unique aura.</p><p></p><p>Fear?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, or perhaps not - they couldn't quite put their finger on it.</p><p></p><p>But they knew this person before them might not be someone they could handle.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly recalled words Cong Renfei had said before: In the Infinite Lands, there are many powerful beings that your strength cannot defy. If you provoke them, you won't even know how you die.</p><p></p><p>They thought to themselves: "Could this person be one of the powerful beings Cong Renfei warned us not to provoke? Looks like we're in trouble now."</p><p></p><p>But they didn't surrender immediately, instead taking defensive stances. They still had enough natural energy for one grueling battle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the trio's wary looks, Red Light smiled: "No need to be tense. How about becoming my subordinates?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi was on guard: "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light said: "I am the supreme Order Venerable of the demon realm, possessing power beyond your imagination. By joining my forces, you can have anything you desire - wealth, power, eternal life - I can satisfy all your demands. Even beautiful youthful maidens in any style you like, or even pretty young men if you prefer. You three are still so young and vigorous, surely you'd be very interested in that!"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng showed signs of being tempted: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Whack!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi slammed his palm onto Tai Cheng's head, urging him to stay calm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi refused: "We've said we're not interested in the demon realm. We only want to continue our journey through the Infinite Lands. Please don't force us."</p><p></p><p>Red Light chuckled: "No, you'll definitely be interested. Because now, what I say goes."</p><p></p><p>With that, Red Light waved his hand, and three spatial cages immediately imprisoned Lyu Yijiang's trio.</p><p></p><p>The three were aghast, frantically attacking the cages after being trapped. But no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't budge the spatial cages at all.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi's face fell: "Oh no, this is the same barrier Mr. Jia used before. We can't possibly break through..."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng: "What do we do? Are we going to become his subordinates? Beautiful youthful maidens...I'm not ready, I'm a bit nervous, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Not only did he show no panic at being imprisoned, his eyes betrayed barely concealed excitement. In all his years, he had never even touched a girl's hand, let alone a beautiful youthful maiden.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi: "......"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang was still frantically attacking the spatial cage, unleashing increasingly powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>Yet his attacks had no more effect than a pebble hitting the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said: "Yijiang, conserve some energy. Don't waste effort on this futile task."</p><p></p><p>Red Light was in no hurry, simply smiling as he watched the trio's antics.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the Raging Three Warriors were already his possessions.</p><p></p><p>The old giant and furry-tailed kings looked on enviously at Red Light's spatial abilities. Against other opponents, a celestial master of space was simply unstoppable - the outcome was a foregone conclusion!</p><p></p><p>Red Light said: "You can try all you want. If you can break my restraints, I'll let the three of you go, and I never go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>His words revealed supreme self-confidence in his overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi suddenly thought of something and immediately opened his learning machine to search how to break spatial restraints.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he actually found some solutions:</p><p></p><p>"Three optimal methods: One, use teleportation or blinking to leave. Two, use a 'Dual Space Suppression Glyph Array' to suppress the spatial module. Three, use a spatial disruptor to disturb and break the spatial structure."</p><p></p><p>After reading this, Gao Qi fell silent - there were indeed ways to break free, but he admitted he didn't know any of them...</p><p></p><p>Searching further yielded no relevant information.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi thought darkly: "Our knowledge is so impoverished that anyone randomly encountered in the Infinite Lands is likely more learned than us."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng said: "What should we do? Why don't we just surrender first? Cong Renfei will come rescue us."</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, a figure suddenly appeared beside Lyu Yijiang's trapped trio.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why did you three wander into this spatial rift?"</p><p></p><p>The three were overjoyed: "Cong Renfei?"</p>

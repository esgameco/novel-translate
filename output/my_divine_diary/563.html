        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After taking out a noble class prince, Su Hao's trio acted as if nothing had happened, doing whatever they needed to do on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao even took the time to fulfill his promise and asked President Gu Yin to have dinner. But President Gu Yin was obviously in a rage, so where was he in the mood to eat?</p><p></p><p>The mood could be described as very complicated.</p><p></p><p>Until an investigation team came to Huai Shui Town.</p><p></p><p>When Xing learned the news, he was shocked, "What? King Luo and the others are missing?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang shrugged his shoulders and suppressed his laughter, "That's right, it is said that after such a long time, King Luo and the others are not seen returning to Mingchuan City, and are currently completely out of contact. Now the investigation team is following the traces that Luo Wang and the others left to look outward, but ...... it is impossible to find them."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing then associated it with what Asama said, and immediately judged what exactly had happened. It was indeed impossible to find it, given the way Asan and Feng acted, they would certainly not leave a single trace.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he didn't expect that Su Hao and the others hadn't joked around and had really made a move!</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing's brain was a bit confused, his heartbeat gradually accelerated, and after a while, he said, "Ah Wang, let's go find President Gu Yin now."</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang was shocked, "Ah Xing you're crazy, are you going to snitch?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing reached out and hooked his hand around Ah Wang's neck, dragging him away, "Am I that kind of person? Luo Wang's disappearance will definitely be locked onto our squad eventually, we have to find President Gu Yin first to unify our voices, denying that we had a conflict with Luo Wang and the others, and on the contrary, 'talking happily', or else we won't be able to speak with any sense of reasoning at that time, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang's eyes lit up, giving Ah Xing a nod.</p><p></p><p>However, things went beyond Ah Xing's imagination, even though they had a good conversation with Luo Wang and the others, they were still asked by the investigation team to return to Mingchuan together to undergo an in-depth investigation in the capacity of a 'directly related person'.</p><p></p><p>After Asan and Kazunari found out about this, they buried that 'unreasonable' investigation team in passing.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were currently working on Boss Wei's experimental projects, namely the 'feasible solution for the transformation of a specific substance by a source' and the 'analysis of the products of the combination of a source and different mental states', so they didn't have the time to play any detective and torture games with these investigation teams.</p><p></p><p>If someone came to bother him again, he might directly run to Mingchuan City to blow up that what's-his-name's royal residence.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Xing Awan, who had watched the whole process of how Yashan and Feng Cheng buried the people, was completely stunned. The progress of things had gone out of their imagination.</p><p></p><p>It had never occurred to them that their own teammates, were so bold.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Ah Xing asked, "What should we do if the Luo royal family continues to send people?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, like a loyal and honest young man: "There are many places, just find a piece of land and bury it! If we really can't, we'll just turn against him, knock down Yixuan City, and be the royal family of Hengxuan District ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "This is not high technology, I think I can do this thing."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang: "......"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these two teenagers who were both less than eighteen years old with a serious look on their faces, what could they say, nothing to say okay.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After another month, Su Hao developed the 'secondary space' to maturity, and after determining that he was able to isolate himself from any attacks known to him, he decided to formally go out and learn about the true face of this world.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply: collect the treasures of knowledge in this world.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was history and literature, philosophical theories, or source energy technology and research results, all of them came and went, all of them were included in the pinball space, even if you don't read it at the moment, maybe you will read it in the future?</p><p></p><p>That night, he flew high in the sky, heading straight for Mingchuan City.</p><p></p><p>I heard that King Luo's residence is there, it is just right to go in and see if there are any good things in the collection.</p><p></p><p>His flying speed was extremely fast, and in a few hours, he arrived above Mingchuan City, overlooking this sizable city.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he directly flashed and appeared on the streets, blending into the crowd, and soon inquired about the location of the Luo Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the Luo King's Mansion with great anticipation and strolled around, and the sight he saw was out of his expectation.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the entire royal mansion was a noble and peaceful place, however, the basement of the backyard had its own version of human purgatory.</p><p></p><p>Here imprisoned a variety of women, expression numb, seems to be used for people to play to vent, of course, but also not only.</p><p></p><p>There is no precious treasure, on the contrary, it is a place where the ultimate darkness of the world is hidden.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing how to say it, every world can be seen, there will always be some people rely on their own hands of the right, unscrupulous soul of the darkness of human nature to release, to deprive others of the right to live freely.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed his form on the spot, "King Luo is dead, I can take you away, those willing to leave stand up on their own."</p><p></p><p>No one moved, instead they even backed up and shrunk into a ball, looking at Su Hao with fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sighed, reappeared invisibly and quietly left the Luo Wang's mansion, while sneaking into the auditorium of Mingchuan City Mage Association, looking for valuable information.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was rewarded and obtained some research reports on source weapons.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao did not have a trace of joy in his heart and appeared unusually calm.</p><p></p><p>After including the information, he flew into the night sky and ran to another city.</p><p></p><p>He thought that he should still be able to make some gains in the other city's mage association, and in the meantime, he would see if the other city was harboring some extreme darkness.</p><p></p><p>Cities on a large scale would generally serve as fiefdoms of the royal family, with corresponding royal residences built to carry out the responsibility of vicarious investigation, as well as enjoying the right to appoint and dismiss a small number of positions.</p><p></p><p>In a city, the king can not be said to cover the sky with one hand, but the power in his hands is not small, belonging to the existence of the general public to look up to, to a certain extent can indeed do whatever they want. Want to manage the people can not manage, manage to get the people lazy to manage, over time, formed a kind of equilibrium tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>It is also this tacit understanding, often able to release the dark side of human nature.</p><p></p><p>Soon Su Hao came to the second city, successively sneaked into the royal palace and the association auditorium, collected valuable information, and then ran to the third city without stopping.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for Su Hao to purposely check it out, under his intentional search, the face of the entire city was unobstructed. No matter how deep the dirt was hidden, it was all reflected in the divine concept.</p><p></p><p>"Such its wonderful world, a unique source energy civilization, should have been beautiful and attracted people's desire, but unfortunately ...... some flaws have ruined this beauty." Su Hao sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao approached the third city, his divine thoughts sensed an abnormality in the third city, "Huh, there's a battle?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when there were battles in the city, most of the cases were disasters breaking out, and the source mages stepped in to deal with the disasters.</p><p></p><p>There were also exceptions, such as the battle that occurred in this city called Chaonan, which was not a disaster, but a battle between source mages.</p><p></p><p>It was not uncommon for Source Mages to fight amongst themselves, and when they were competing for Source Pearls in the wilderness, each one of them would strike without mercy, but it was still quite rare for a fight to break out directly in a city.</p><p></p><p>Driven by curiosity, Su Hao's thoughts flashed to the sky above the battle and looked down.</p><p></p><p>The battle was taking place in the middle of a luxurious manor, this kind of building specification was more than familiar to him, wasn't it the king's residence?</p><p></p><p>That's right, a team of roughly ten source mages were frantically slaughtering the people in the king's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, there were still a few guards in the royal mansion resisting to the death, protecting in front of an obese man in pajamas, and by the looks of it, the battle would soon be over.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the roof of an attic building in the Dynasty King's Mansion stood three slender figures, on the right side a sharply dressed high ponytailed girl looked sideways at the man in the center and asked softly, "Brother Zhi Peng, the Dynasty King is already surrounded in the backyard, it won't be long before he is captured, do you want to kill him with your own hands?"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful ponytail girl's mouth Zhi Peng brother, looks like a scruffy Confucian scholar, face lean and withered, beard pulling, as if it has not been repaired for a long time, eyes full of bloodshot, in the far away dim light reflection, but appears to be gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was silent for a moment, slowly shook his head and said, "No, directly kill it!"</p><p></p><p>Ponytail girl no longer say more, look to set Peng's gaze, with a little heartache meaning.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng brother is too poor, originally and his beloved wife living a happy life of seclusion, did not expect suddenly one day, his wife was the king of the dynasty to see, and sent people secretly captured, after two days to release back, his wife can not withstand the heart of the repression, committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>Ponytail girl really can not imagine, how Zhi Peng brother can withstand this blow, his heart must be very painful at this time, right?</p><p></p><p>Ponytail girl secretly decided in her heart, must help set Peng brother revenge, and take good care of him, let him recover from the pain, this is her as a friend should do the responsibility.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a long-haired man on Zhi Peng's left side opened his eyes and said, "Brother Zhi Peng, the Mage Association already has a mage coming this way, and it is expected that he will be able to arrive in two minutes."</p><p></p><p>Just at this time, the battle not far away also entered the end, the defense of the Chao Wang guards, was broken positively, the metal thorns with strong electric current immediately penetrated through the breach, piercing several guards in mid-air, followed by a few air blades slicing off the heads of all the guards.</p><p></p><p>The obese Chao Wang was not spared, his fat head, accompanied by a high spray of blood, rolled to the side, his wide-eyed eyes all filled with horror.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng said in a low voice, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He was the first to leap off the roof of the building and ran outward, the ponytailed girl and the long-haired man followed closely behind, and those Source Mages who had killed Chaowang with a sense of relief on their faces also quickly made a few leaps in Chaowang's mansion, chased after the three of them, and together they ran towards the outside of Chaonan City.</p><p></p><p>Tonight's revenge mission was successfully completed.</p><p></p><p>After the crowd got rid of the Association Mage's pursuers, they stopped at an abandoned attic outside the city.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng yanked his fists tight and slammed his fist hard on top of the wall.</p><p></p><p>The great revenge had been avenged, but he wasn't happy at all, even if he killed Chao Wang, so what? His wife couldn't come back anymore.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to live a quiet and ordinary life, couldn't he fulfill even this small request? Why did the world treat him like this?</p><p></p><p>The anger in his heart had nowhere to be vented.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Zhi Peng put away his fists and relaxed his body.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to these Source Mages beside him who had helped him slaughter the entire Dynasty King's Mansion and said, "Thank you all! If it wasn't for you guys helping me, I'm afraid I would have never had the chance to take revenge."</p><p></p><p>The ponytailed girl immediately said, "What are you saying thank you for? We are all your friends!"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people also said, "That's right, Brother Zhi Peng is our friend, there's no need to say any thanks, it's only right."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was touched and said, "You are all my good friends, it's good to have you guys."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao, who was hidden in mid-air, was full of surprise, this scene, it always felt strange.</p><p></p><p>Not right not right!</p>

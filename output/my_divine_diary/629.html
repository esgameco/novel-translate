        <h1>Chapter 629</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Su Hao finished a small stage of the experiment, and then he saw this guy Feiyuan run over to him and said, You're an alien!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't think much of it and asked strangely, "What alien?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's expression, Feiyuan looked even more surprised than Su Hao: "Ah? You're not an alien?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan thought that after telling Mr. Jarvie about his discovery, Mr. Jarvie would faintly smile and then casually say, "I've hidden my identity so well, but I'm surprised that you've discovered it. That's right, I am an alien!"</p><p></p><p>However that was not the case!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't understand what strange things were going through Fei Yuan's mind and directly asked, "What did you think of? You can tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan said with slight embarrassment, "Mr. Javi, it's like this, two years ago I studied 'Immortal Cultivation' with Teacher Feng Cheng, and at this stage I have already reached the Foundation Establishment realm, and at the same time, I have a certain understanding of the nature of Immortal Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>I found out that the conditions required to cultivate Immortality are very complicated, and according to the theory of the evolution system, there is basically no possibility of the birth of 'Immortality Cultivation' as a method to extend life on this planet, because Immortality Cultivation belongs to a completely different system, and I can't tell you exactly how it is.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is only one of them, such as the base of a variety of books, inside the huge system of knowledge, as vast as a sea of smoke, simply not a person can summarize.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, I had looked through the various collections in the Mage Association, only part of the knowledge is overlapping, the rest of the knowledge, in addition to the base, in addition to the outside simply can not be found.</p><p></p><p>Another example is the astronomy group founded by Mr. Feng Cheng, not to mention the huge astronomy theory, but just the fact that the astronomy group has been observing the movements in outer space makes me wonder: did Mr. Javi escape here from another planet? There is an alien enemy chasing you in the depths of the stars ......"</p><p></p><p>As Fei Yuan spoke, he saw Su Hao's face was calm and there was no abnormality, so he couldn't help but feel relieved, thinking that he had indeed thought too much. Aliens and whatnot, it was outrageous to the core!</p><p></p><p>What Feiyuan didn't expect was that Su Hao actually nodded his head and said, "You guessed it right, theoretically speaking, I came from the depths of this universe and wasn't born on this planet, calling it an alien is fine."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Su Hao admit it so generously, Fei Yuan only felt his brain blank for a moment, his whole body involuntarily trembled, his back was cold for a piece of time, he opened his mouth, and couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, ''You can imagine us as travelers wandering aimlessly in the universe, and coming to this planet was just a coincidence. The three of us unintentionally strayed here more than thirty years ago, and became interested in the 'disasters' and 'sources' of this world, so we launched our research. As you can see, by and large, were informed about the nature of 'Source'."</p><p></p><p>Speaking here, Su Hao laughed out, "This is not some kind of undeclared secret, knowing and not knowing, there is no difference. Don't worry about it, we won't care about that."</p><p></p><p>Flying Regulus slowed down, representing the people of this planet to have a formal meeting with the aliens, "Mr. Jarvie, is the kind of talk story that colonizes planets and enslaves aliens ...... true?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "I don't know about that, I'm as ignorant as you are about this vast universe."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan was stunned, "Aren't you traveling in the universe? Must be the kind of person who has seen a lot, how could you not know?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "I'm not as knowledgeable as you think, on this planet, I might be able to say that I know more, but in the entire universe, what am I? There are too many unknown things."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan thought of his previous stay on the satellite lookout, observing the universe when the feeling of shock, could not help but say, "Indeed, this universe, so mysterious and unpredictable ...... and we humans, too small!"</p><p></p><p>Who does not aspire to the secrets hidden in the vastness of the universe?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "The answer you want, I may not be able to give it to you, but you can look for it yourself."</p><p></p><p>"I'll look for it myself?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "At most three hundred years, the three of us will leave this world in a spaceship and head towards the universe, if you are interested, you can come along."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan's heart shook, and an unspeakable emotion immediately surged in his heart. Excitement, surging, disbelief ......</p><p></p><p>"A ...... together? Being a cosmic traveler with Mr. Javi? Can I, can I?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Then Feiyuan snapped to mind a question, "Eh, Mr. Javi, you just said that you'll set off in three hundred years? Three hundred years ...... I might already be dead ......"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "You won't die that fast, with your current physical condition, if you successfully cultivate to the Transformation God realm, you should still be able to live for two thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan's mouth gradually grew, "Two thousand years ......"</p><p></p><p>When Feiyuan left Su Hao's laboratory, his entire body was dazed and disoriented, and his brain, which was originally incomparably clear, became confused.</p><p></p><p>Today's conversation with Su Hao, the shock he received was too great.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>To Feiyuan it was shocking, but to Su Hao, it was just a small episode.</p><p></p><p>Two or three hundred years later, when he left this planet, was not minding Feiyuan to come along with him, just so there were many things that could be given to Feiyuan to study, with Feiyuan's unique way of thinking, there might be many new discoveries.</p><p></p><p>However, it was just a matter of taking the ship with him, he hadn't thought of recording Feiyuan's consciousness into the pinball space for the time being, and taking him with him as he wandered through the worlds.</p><p></p><p>He was considering three things: his own safety, the necessity of this person, and for him or for me!</p><p></p><p>Before Su Hao was able to fully control his consciousness and its information, he would not leave too much hidden danger for himself.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, he who had mastered the secret of 'source' had already controlled unimaginable power, but the only point that hadn't changed essentially was spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>Essentially, his spiritual power wasn't much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Not even being able to perceive the trajectory of the energy of the Doom System, which he himself was the 'focal point' of, was such spiritual power called strong?</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that all along, he had not been reincarnated into the kind of world that specialized in spiritual power, leaving him with no way to learn, and the growth of his spiritual power was very slow.</p><p></p><p>As for that, will there be that kind of world that specializes in spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>With a deeper and deeper understanding of spiritual power, Su Hao had a guess: in this universe, there were not a few worlds that specialized in spiritual power, and perhaps in the hundreds of millions of years he had wandered along with the pinball space, he had gone to a world that specialized in spiritual power countless times, but regrettably, his consciousness could not be matched to any of the brains in that world, and he had directly missed it.</p><p></p><p>This possibility was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>As his understanding of spiritual power gradually deepened, he realized that the strength of spiritual power was related to the information of the consciousness and to the structure of the brain.</p><p></p><p>In his essence, he was an ordinary human. No matter how much knowledge he had mastered, his consciousness information structure was just that of an ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, no matter how many life worlds he went to, he would only end up reviving in planets that were also human.</p><p></p><p>In this way, there was a hopelessly deadly cycle for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He was an ordinary human - could only reincarnate as an ordinary human - ordinary human brain structure couldn't obtain stronger spiritual power - the worlds he could reincarnate in didn't have spiritual power specialization --He can't learn how to enhance his spiritual power - he's still an ordinary human - it's impossible for him to be reincarnated into a world that specializes in spiritual power - -Can't learn the way to enhance spiritual power ......</p><p></p><p>So, how to solve this kind of dead cycle?</p><p></p><p>Truthfully, Su Hao thought he couldn't do this for the time being, he admitted that his learning ability was okay, he could reach five stars, but his creative ability was crap, barely one star.</p><p></p><p>Such a cycle is like the limit of the natural logarithm e 2.7 .......</p><p></p><p>"Is this the limit of an ordinary human?"</p>

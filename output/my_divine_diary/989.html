        <h1>Chapter 989</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After learning spatial abilities like teleportation and flash steps, the eighteen deities' confidence inflated to an extreme degree. They believed that in the world, aside from Sir Jia Wei and two other sacred beings, there were no longer any opponents that could challenge them.</p><p></p><p>Even when sparring with the Three Disciples of Lord Feng Cheng, the Crimson Demon King, they could achieve a draw. Who else could rival them?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the deities did not know that in order to maintain stability in the new demon realm, the Crimson Demon King adopted a playful mindset full of slack when fighting them.</p><p></p><p>Now encountering another formidable opponent, Cong Renfei, the 'Will of the World' they had watched grow up, after some verbal exchanges their fighting spirit was provoked, and they eventually challenged Cong Renfei.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, once the battle started, their figures kept 'flashing' everywhere while spells flew about wildly, but no one could land a hit.</p><p></p><p>After probing, Cong Renfei's face darkened as he inwardly grumbled: "If I don't show them something impressive, these strange ancient deities will never stop. Since that's the case...suppression rune formation!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, with Cong Renfei as the center, a special fluctuation radiated outwards, instantly spreading to a 200 kilometer range and turning the area into a spatial lockdown zone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the eighteen deities immediately sensed the change in the spatial module. With their current spiritual feelers, it became difficult to pry open the spatial module for teleportation.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities: "??What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, not only were the eighteen deities' spatial abilities restricted, Cong Renfei himself was also affected, similarly unable to use spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not mind, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. He casually took out a basin-shaped device, aimed it at the bewildered eighteen deities, and rapidly infused it with spiritual power to activate it.</p><p></p><p>The 'Three Day Deity Confusion Formation Disk'!</p><p></p><p>It was said that when Master Wei used this in the past, he rampaged unrivaled across the lands...</p><p></p><p>In any case, Cong Renfei treasured it greatly.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, using it to subdue these eighteen strange ancient deities was perfect.</p><p></p><p>After activating, the formation disk suddenly emitted bright red and blue lights that flashed around the eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities felt the world spinning, instantly losing their sense of direction and up/down/left/right, unaware of their location, as if the entire world was bizarrely twisting.</p><p></p><p>They did not understand what was happening, only trying hard to maintain their balance.</p><p></p><p>"Bam bam bam--"</p><p></p><p>A series of thumping sounds rang out as the eighteen deities dropped from midair like dumplings, sprawling on the ground in all kinds of postures.</p><p></p><p>After falling, the deities' limbs flailed wildly, and due to their divine crystalline armor, shards flew everywhere in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire area was covered in a pink crystalline mess.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's trio and the two old giants watched this scene from afar, their eyes wide and mouths agape.</p><p></p><p>The battle between experts was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The legendary 'Jade Dragon Celestial' was indeed no match, too powerful!</p><p></p><p>After a while, the eighteen deities gradually recovered, but Cong Renfei wasted no words and activated the confusion formation again, bathing them all once more.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities fell back into dizziness and chaos, unable to see clearly or speak, their consciousness like clothes tossed into a washing machine, forgetting their own appearance.</p><p></p><p>As the deities recovered, Cong Renfei activated it again.</p><p></p><p>He remembered his master Lord Feng Cheng's words - to use the 'Three Day Deity Confusion Formation Disk' effectively required at least ten activations to completely break the enemy's will to fight. So he planned to activate it ten times first before evaluating.</p><p></p><p>As for the intervals when it seemed some deities tried to surrender...he ignored them directly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the deities gave up struggling. During a moment of recovery, the Golden Deity Bali opened a group chat with the Crimson Demon King and quickly sent a distress message:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Crimson, save us!"</p><p></p><p>Then he fell back into frenzied dizziness.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King was sculpting new demons in his castle when he saw Bali's cry for help. He was stunned: "Save them? Save from what..."</p><p></p><p>In his view, in the Boundless Lands and Demon Realm, aside from a few exceptional beings, there was nothing that could threaten the eighteen deities. Yet now they were calling for help?</p><p></p><p>His first reaction was that it must be a joke. But when he tried messaging the group to inquire, there was no reply for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King thought: "Could there really be some problem?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the Crimson Demon King put down his tools. His 3-meter towering figure stood up, then locked onto the location stone on Bali and teleported over.</p><p></p><p>Upon arrival, he saw the chaotic scene, the eighteen deities twisted into bizarre shapes, lying in a heap indistinguishable from each other...</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King was dumbfounded for a moment, then saw Cong Renfei nearby and asked in surprise: "Cong Renfei? Why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Then pointing at the eighteen deities: "What happened to them?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said: "These strange fellows came looking for a fight with me, so I took them down, that's all. Crimson, do you know them?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King glanced at the confusion formation disk in Cong Renfei's hand and immediately understood what happened, his mouth twitching: "Well, it might be a misunderstanding..."</p><p></p><p>The two old giants, seeing the Crimson Demon King appear, inwardly raged: "This is the Demon Lord Crimson Demon King! The Demon King has also arrived, what is going on today? A group of major figures from the Boundless Lands have gathered here!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old giants couldn't help but look towards Lyu Yijiang's trio, thinking: "Just who are these three? To draw out so many experts, their backgrounds must be terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Then they thought of the earth spirit who came to tell them the story of the 'Three Berserk Warriors', and their expressions turned ugly: "All of this must be that earth spirit's doing behind the scenes, using us as pawns. Hmph, when I get back I'll make them pay."</p><p></p><p>Old Furry Tail King came over and said: "Old Giant, let's go. Let's just pretend we didn't see anything today. Otherwise I'm afraid we'll be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Giant King was shocked, exchanged a look with Old Furry Tail, and they quietly slipped away.</p><p></p><p>In this short time, he had figured out the whole story.</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed the humiliating state of the demon realm's experts with their own eyes. Afterwards, they might receive special 'attention' from those experts, with unimaginable consequences. It was better to leave early and lower their presence...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to the demon realm with the Crimson Demon King, the eighteen deities fell into a brief silence. </p><p></p><p>Today's events had exceeded their expectations...</p><p></p><p>For so many years, they had never experienced such humiliation before.</p><p></p><p>Even when imprisoned by Sir Jia Wei back then, they could maintain a certain dignity. But now, just recalling the scene made them blush with shame.</p><p></p><p>Too disgraceful!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately not many witnessed their unsightly state, otherwise they could never show their faces again.</p><p></p><p>What the deities could not understand was, why couldn't they teleport or flash step out of the blue?</p><p></p><p>Was the gap between them and Cong Renfei really that enormous?</p><p></p><p>After today's battle, their arrogance was once again crushed to dust.</p><p></p><p>The last time they experienced such helpless defeat was when facing Sir Jia Wei years ago. Never did they expect that the 'Will of the World' Cong Renfei, whose growth they had witnessed, could also defeat them so easily.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities could not help but doubt themselves: "Are we really that pathetic?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Red Light angrily said: "We clearly agreed not to fight Cong Renfei earlier to avoid conflict. In the end, who was it that suggested fighting him? If we didn't fight, wouldn't we have avoided this whole mess?"</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, eventually all eyes turning to Nati.</p><p></p><p>Nati's eyes bulged as he furiously said: "Why are you all looking at me? Earlier I didn't say a single word, it was you guys who proposed fighting. I just went along with you, don't falsely accuse me."</p><p></p><p>And so this matter was dropped.</p>

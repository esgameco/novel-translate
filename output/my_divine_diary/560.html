        <h1>Chapter 560</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The team of five arrived at a secluded place outside the town. Axing found a large rock to sit on and said directly, "Over the past few years, we've been active all over the Hengxuan District, dealing with all kinds of complex disasters, including some intermediate and advanced strange disasters. Our reputation has gradually grown. Now, our 'Wind Mountain Yang Wangxing Team' is well-known throughout the entire Hengxuan District. Any team with some experience has heard of our team's name. We've even been called the 'Five Handsome Brothers Team'..."</p><p></p><p>When Awang heard this, he couldn't help brushing back his center-parted bangs, showing a bit of pride, but he quickly came back to his senses and quietly reminded, "Axing, you're getting off topic. It's the 'Lucky Star Team'."</p><p></p><p>Axing snapped back and gave a light cough, but still couldn't help laughing proudly. The feeling of being famous, he could probably laugh himself awake at night just thinking about it?</p><p></p><p>Just imagining how many beautiful girls were inquiring about his news and preferences every day...</p><p></p><p>Axing quickly composed himself and regained his outward calm, "We've become famous in the Hengxuan District, with a bit of a reputation. We're known as one of the rising new star teams in recent years, called the 'Lucky Star Team'. Although it's different from what I wanted, we at least have a name now."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I already know this. It's normal to become famous. So what's next?"</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed heartily, "So, yesterday the Prince Luo of the Hengxuan royal family personally led a team to our Huaishui Town and invited us to join the Prince Luo's palace in Mingchuan City of the Hengxuan District. Didn't expect that, did you? Our team's reputation is so great that it has even reached the ears of the royal family. Prince Luo came in person to invite us - this is an immense honor that we can boast about for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Through communicating with Axing, Suhao quickly understood the whole story.</p><p></p><p>In short, they coveted their abilities and wanted to bring them under their control and command. Of course, it's also possible that this was just the royal family showing off in their own way.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the most interesting game these idle royals could think of to amuse themselves.</p><p></p><p>Bringing in renowned local teams under their command, then showing them off everywhere, just like little kids bragging to each other about the new limited edition yo-yos they bought.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the vast economic power of the royal families, they could easily support many teams of source masters. Those teams wouldn't be any worse off than those constantly venturing into the wilderness to deal with disasters.</p><p></p><p>Many local teams strive to climb up precisely so that one day they can become famous enough for their team's name to reach the ears of the royal families. If they gain the favor of just one royal family, they can live a life of luxury without worry, and most importantly, no longer face the constant dangers of unknown disasters.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only a minority of teams actually gain enough renown to be recruited by the royal families.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not every team desperately wants to join a royal family and live a decadent life of luxury and ease. There are still many source masters who sincerely want to resolve disasters and protect ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>However, this group of devoted individuals has become fewer and fewer over time.</p><p></p><p>'Why should I be the one at the frontlines battling disasters, while some source masters can just stay in the rear, living in drunken debauchery with wine and beauties, enjoying those earthly pleasures?'</p><p></p><p>The more people see through the ways of the world, the fewer remain devoted to serving others. And those who still see through the world's facade yet remain filled with deep love and concern for all beings are truly admirable.</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang never imagined they could be noticed by the royal family, who would come in person to recruit them. When they heard this news from Sect Leader Guqin, they were overwhelmed with immense surprise.</p><p></p><p>They had actually caught the eye of the rulers of this world? It was almost unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>However, after much thought, Axing and Awang ultimately decided to decline the royal family's invitation.</p><p></p><p>Although they longed for the high-class noble lifestyle, they hoped even more to become powerful source masters, resolving strange disasters all over the world and eventually becoming renowned 'Strange Disaster Busters'.</p><p></p><p>So today they came to ask Suhao and the others for their opinions. If Suhao was willing to join the royal family, they naturally wouldn't object.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the three of them showed no interest at all in joining the royal family, which was beyond Axing's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand, "So that's the matter! I'm not interested in joining, but we could cooperate. Oh, by the way, the royal families should have a lot of confidential materials about sources, right?"</p><p></p><p>Axing was stunned for a moment, then asked in puzzlement, "Confidential materials? What confidential materials?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Things like secret files and confidential techniques that aren't made public to the world. Basically, information that can't be easily obtained in the public domain."</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed heartily, "I know Ayang likes to read books, but I didn't expect the books out there can no longer satisfy you, and you've set your sights on those unknown secret files. You really live up to your reputation, Ayang. Since those are called secret materials, naturally I wouldn't know about them. I don't know if Prince Luo's palace even has any.</p><p></p><p>But I guess they probably don't! After all, Prince Luo is just a minor prince. He may have some authority in his own little territory, but he probably doesn't have the status to know the real high-level stuff. I'm not sure about the details.</p><p></p><p>But Ayang, you might as well give up on those secret materials you want to read. Even if you become the president of the City Source Masters Association, you still might not have the qualifications to view them. Perhaps only those truly at the top of this world would know."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Awang suddenly spoke up, "The Prince Luo's palace is just a minor palace in the entire Hengxuan District, quite insignificant. They may hide some secret information, but definitely not much. The Hengxuan imperial palace, on the other hand, should contain those confidential materials."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked in puzzlement, "Imperial palace?"</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "Yes, in the main city of Yixuan in the east of the Hengxuan District. Supposedly it's where the Hengxuan imperial family resides, and it's the administrative center of the entire Hengxuan District. But I don't know the details since I've never been to Yixuan City."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes lit up, "The imperial family?"</p><p></p><p>Similar to a feudal structure, the imperial family is the direct lineage of the current Hengxuan king, while the royal families are branches related by blood to the imperial family. But whether imperial or royal, there is no essential difference - they are both the ruling class of the entire Hengxuan District, as far removed from ordinary people as heaven is from earth.</p><p></p><p>The imperial and royal families are the lofty spokespeople of the gods in this world, exercising divine authority in the name of protecting the world.</p><p></p><p>Everyone believes this, a truth rooted in the deepest layers of their minds, unquestionable. Axing and Awang are no exception.</p><p></p><p>As for what role the Source Masters Association plays in this world and what relationship it has with the imperial family, Suhao doesn't know yet. But he guesses it is an enormous entity that even the rulers of all eighteen districts cannot defy - the most professional organization studying "sources".</p><p></p><p>Axing widened his eyes in astonishment, "Awang, how did you know that?"</p><p></p><p>What surprised Axing was that Awang knew something he didn't - that shouldn't be possible.</p><p></p><p>Awang laughed sheepishly, "There are many secrets in this world. What we know is only a small part of what can be known. Much more is hidden away. I was just curious back then and would often let my thoughts run wild, wanting to uncover the secrets of this world. So I spent some effort on that and learned a bit about the history of the imperial family and the Association. But I only know a little, cough cough! Those were just naive things I did out of youthful ignorance long ago, no need to bring it up.</p><p></p><p>It seems Ayang is like me back then, extremely interested in the secrets of this world!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Of course, that's my current pursuit."</p><p></p><p>Awang shook his head, "But unfortunately, we may never know. I have to say, it's a pity, on par with the regret of passing by your first love interest without even realizing it."</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Suhao's lips, "I can't solve your problem with your past crush, but the secrets of this world are not necessarily unsolvable."</p><p></p><p>As long as there was valuable knowledge, nothing could escape Suhao's grasp.</p>

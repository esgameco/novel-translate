        <h1>Chapter 980</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Defeating the Anming King took three years of continuous effort.</p><p></p><p>After realizing he was outmatched, the Anming King started running and hiding.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two pursued him relentlessly, growing stronger with each battle. Eventually, the Anming King completely lost his fighting spirit. Sensing their presence, he would immediately flee.</p><p></p><p>On that day, the three finally cornered the Anming King.</p><p></p><p>Looking extremely unsightly, the Anming King said, "Lyu Yijiang, I've told you before that I'm no longer interested in ruling the world or dealing with ordinary people. The world is vast - let's go our separate ways. There's no need for a fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>Unmoved, Lyu Yijiang replied, "I won't let you off, Anming King. The dozens of cities you destroyed, the many lives you took - it can't be settled just by saying you've lost interest. You must pay for your actions."</p><p></p><p>The Anming King roared, "Ridiculous! Do you think you're the embodiment of justice? You've killed plenty too! Why don't you commit suicide?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang shook his head. "We don't represent justice, only ourselves. I believe you did wrong, and wrongs must be paid for. If Heaven hasn't punished you, then I will mete out that punishment myself. Of course, if someone believes I've done wrong in the future, they can come hold me to their ideals."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi also nodded. "I recently learned some things from the Learning Machine that made me unsure if killing you truly represents justice. But we want to do this. As long as I want it, for me, it should be right - perhaps like how you wanted to rule the world. I can't control how others think."</p><p></p><p>Tao Cheng scratched his explosive hairstyle, thinking privately, "That's a bit convoluted. If we defeat the Anming King to stop him from destroying the world, isn't that justice? Never mind, I'll just do whatever Yijiang and Cheng do - can't go wrong."</p><p></p><p>So Tao Cheng also said, "You're right, we have to defeat you."</p><p></p><p>The Anming King was furious. "You're an unreasonable bunch. Go die!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he unleashed a burst of energy blasts at the three.</p><p></p><p>But his attacks had long since become ineffective against them.</p><p></p><p>After an intense battle, the Anming King was again forced to flee in defeat.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two gathered their energy in midair, light glowing brighter in their palms.</p><p></p><p>"Aarrgghh!"</p><p></p><p>With maddened roars, they swiftly caught up to the Anming King. To his horror, each fired a blast that finished him off completely.</p><p></p><p>When everything settled, the three stood amidst the wreckage, dazedly surveying their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Anming King's presence had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi muttered in disbelief, "Is it over? This battle?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang nodded. "It's over."</p><p></p><p>After a silence, Tao Cheng asked, "Where do we go next?"</p><p></p><p>Having lost their formidable foe the Anming King, they suddenly felt aimless and a bit empty inside. But this feeling was quite pleasant, at least for now.</p><p></p><p>The weight that had been pressing on their hearts was finally lifted.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang looked into the distance. "Let's go back and see our master first. Report that we're safe, and bid him farewell."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang said, "I plan to travel the Infinite Lands and cultivate. Do you want to come along?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tao Cheng grinned. "Of course. Let's go explore these so-called Infinite Lands. Mr. Jia Wei mentioned there seem to be many interesting things there."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked, "Yijiang, do you know where the Infinite Lands are?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang shook his head. "No idea..."</p><p></p><p>"Then how do we get there?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang: "No idea..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tao Cheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, this is the feeling! Old man in the clouds, let's go again!"</p><p></p><p>Shirtless, Cong Renfei floated in midair, wildly trading blows with the Celestial King of the Clouds. With each punch, he battered the old man like a sandbag, leaving him powerless to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>After being sent flying by one of Cong Renfei's punches, the Celestial King flashed to the side, waving his hand. "No more, no more! I never imagined in just two short years you'd become such a formidable martial artist. It's unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei grinned. "Still think I'm a waste?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial King wondered, "Two years ago you really were a waste. But I don't know how you suddenly became a genius. Did you take some weird medicine?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Come on, old man, let's fight some more. I'm not done yet!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial King's beard bristled with anger. "Hey, you little punk, how dare you bully an old man like this? Why don't you fight my three disciples instead?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, both of them looked up, sensing something special in the distance. Soon, three figures appeared on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>It was Lyu Yijiang and the others.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial King smiled. "I just mentioned my three disciples, and here they come back."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was surprised. "Huh? Lyu Yijiang and them are your disciples?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial King was even more surprised. "Huh? You little punk know my three disciples?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the five sat together, marveling at their connection.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei grinned. "So you actually defeated the supremely powerful Anming King. Congratulations! You've saved the world and become heroes. Want me to help spread the word everywhere?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang immediately waved his hand. "No need, no need. No one knows us, and we don't need anyone's thanks."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi suddenly said, "I learned a principle from the Learning Machine. If we go out and announce defeating the evil Anming King now, most people probably won't thank us. They might even blame us for destroying their cities and lands, or blame us for having the ability but not defeating the Anming King sooner.</p><p></p><p>So it's better to quietly do what we think is right, without announcing it to others. What you think is right, others may not see that way. The Learning Machine is correct - the world is diverse, people's views differ. Looking at the same thing, they often have opposing perspectives."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "...What the heck is a Learning Machine? Don't tell me Master Wei implanted some system in you!"  </p><p></p><p>"What's a system?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Um...the Learning Machine."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei glanced at Gao Qi, thinking privately, "Another fine young man, lost in the profound world of philosophy. Soon he'll realize this world is meaningless. How tragic..."</p><p></p><p>Then Lyu Yijiang asked, "Cong Renfei, you said you're from the Infinite Lands?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei nodded. "That's right. To be precise, I'm from the Independent Central World, but it's about the same."</p><p></p><p>Including the Celestial King, they were all dumbfounded. "What Infinite Lands? What Independent Central World?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei explained, "The Infinite Lands can be understood as a super continent without end, immensely vast, inhabited by hundreds of different races across over two hundred regions.</p><p></p><p>The Independent Central World is a smaller world separate from the Infinite Lands - the people of each are unaware of the other's existence. Only Roamers like me can freely travel between them.</p><p></p><p>To explain, Roamers can roam the infinite cosmos, exploring new life-bearing planets across the universe."</p><p></p><p>Rather than clarifying, Cong Renfei's explanation only confused Lyu Yijiang and the others further.</p><p></p><p>Having never personally experienced the vastness of the cosmos, it was very difficult for them to comprehend the concept of the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>Though he didn't fully understand, Lyu Yijiang couldn't contain his interest in the Infinite Lands. Curiously, he asked, "Cong Renfei, so you can return to the Infinite Lands?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei replied, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang asked, "Can you take us there?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Sure, it's no problem. The World Passage Engineering Team is already building the World Passage. It won't be long before you can use it to travel to the Infinite Lands. With your strength, you should qualify."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei cautioned, "Don't get too excited. To go through the World Passage, you need to meet certain conditions."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked curiously, "What conditions?"</p><p></p><p>With a mysterious smile, Cong Renfei said, "Only those with a Travel Pass can go through the World Passage. Otherwise, you'll be blocked outside."</p><p></p><p>"Travel Pass? What's that?"</p><p></p><p>To Lyu Yijiang and the others, this "Travel Pass" sounded incredibly powerful and advanced.</p><p></p><p>With a 'ding' sound, Cong Renfei flicked his wrist, sending a small metal coin spinning through the air. It made a crisp ringing as it tumbled before landing in his palm. He opened his hand to show them. "This is it - the mystical item known as the 'Lost Coin of the Goddess of Fortune.'"</p>

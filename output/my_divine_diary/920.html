        <h1>Chapter 920</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In a closed warehouse, around ten young men and women in their twenties were lying scattered about, as if they had been knocked unconscious and discarded there like a pile of trash. Their clothes were filthy, and there were some wounds and bloodstains on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The ten men and women gradually woke up one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Where...is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"Why am I lying here, what happened..."</p><p></p><p>"Were we kidnapped?"</p><p></p><p>They stood up and pushed open the door, warily looking at each other and analyzing their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The first thought was that they had been kidnapped, but they were puzzled that they didn't see any kidnappers, nor did they find any marks of being tied up on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be someone's prank? That's really vicious. If I find out who did this, I'll definitely kick their ass hard."</p><p></p><p>While they were confused, suddenly a message appeared in everyone's mind.</p><p></p><p>"A serial killer, in order to satisfy his desire to kill, secretly drugged and knocked out ten young workers traveling together. He then used a handcart to disguise transporting them to an abandoned factory in the wilderness, preparing to carry out cruel killing and torture after nightfall.</p><p></p><p>Mission: Escape from the abandoned factory within half an hour.  </p><p></p><p>Success: Reward 10 points, activate the Primordial God.</p><p>Failure: Suffer cruel torture and killing by the serial killer."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the message, the ten people fell silent and looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly someone said, "I remember I was fishing before, and suddenly an option popped up in my mind. I chose 'yes', and then I came here. I don't know if it was the same for you."</p><p></p><p>"Same for me, I didn't think it through and just chose yes instinctively."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that, like in movies and novels, we've crossed over, or some playful deity captured us and threw us here to play some deadly game..."</p><p></p><p>"Very likely. Did you all receive the prompt in your mind?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the serial killer will come here in half an hour to cruelly kill us. We must escape within half an hour. So the prompt in our minds is probably real."</p><p></p><p>"What a terrible situation. What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, it must be someone's prank. I don't care, once I get out I'll report it to the police and sue them. They're dead for sure."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, how vicious. I suspect it's some TV station's prank, with countless cameras set up in the corners, and a bunch of audience members waiting to laugh at us."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's real or not, we must get out of here as soon as possible. And half an hour actually passes very quickly, so let's quickly look around and find a way out."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's split up and search. We'll regroup here in five minutes and report our respective situations, then work together to find a way out and escape."</p><p></p><p>"Let's do that!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ten people sprang into action, searching tensely and quickly...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 755</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Over these nearly forty years, not only have the Eight-Armed Race been frantically analyzing the related technologies on the human side, but humans have not stopped their forward progress for a moment either.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the technical ideas provided by Su Hao, they have also developed all kinds of technological applications.</p><p></p><p>The 'energy burst wave' device has been rapidly updated and iterated, becoming more far-reaching and powerful, and corresponding defensive measures have been found;</p><p></p><p>Based on the 'Starlight Breaker' originally used by Su Hao, they created a weapon called the 'ultra-long-range unmanned nuclear missile';</p><p></p><p>The transmission formations have also been built larger and larger, almost covering an area of 10,000 light-years, completely eliminating the Eight-Armed Race's signal nests in this region;</p><p></p><p>In summary, while the Eight-Armed Race was working hard on scientific research, the human side was also making progress.</p><p></p><p>It's just that compared to the Eight-Armed Race, the human foundation was really too weak.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, humans have exhausted all efforts to expand their sphere of influence in order to increase their strategic space, but they have only expanded to an area of less than 20,000 light-years.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the entire Cloud Ring System's diameter of 200,000 light-years, it is only a very small part.</p><p></p><p>When both sides have the same weapons and technologies, humans are simply no match for the Eight-Armed Race on the direct battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even so, currently humans already have the qualifications to compete with the Eight-Armed Race, no longer the weak humans from more than forty years ago.</p><p></p><p>Everyone believes that in the distant future, this beautiful galaxy system will belong to humans.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the human observer routinely reported the information collected from various planets of the Eight-Armed Race.</p><p></p><p>"At the recent annual meeting of the Eight-Armed Race, the 'Rear Rock King' presided and used the latest encrypted communication method, which has not yet been successfully decrypted."</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred hidden Eight-Armed Race research bases have been newly discovered. Their internal research projects are being identified, initially speculated to be 'new type of signal nests', and the corresponding technology is being analyzed."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, a total of 30 million research bases have been discovered, 20 million warship and weapon production bases..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading through, Xia Qingjun put down the materials.</p><p></p><p>These briefing materials are actually handled by dedicated personnel, and he doesn't need to review them personally. But every day before his official work, he habitually reads through them.</p><p></p><p>For him, reviewing the basic information of the Eight-Armed Race every day allows him to keep track of his enemy, and it also makes handling matters very smooth.</p><p></p><p>Today's briefing is no different from the last time he saw it, with no noteworthy news.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun tries to think from the other side's perspective. He can be 100% sure that when facing the human threat, the Eight-Armed Race will certainly concentrate their efforts on scientific research activities, cracking human weapons, and developing new weapons.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely for this reason that after humans gained their own reconnaissance means, he immediately ordered the search for the Eight-Armed Race's research bases on various colony planets to monitor their scientific research progress.</p><p></p><p>However, the entire Cloud Ring System is too vast, and the number of Eight-Armed Race research bases is too numerous.</p><p></p><p>Even though humans have the ability to enter the 'Star Observing World', making the Eight-Armed Race as if under human eyes, it is still very difficult to find all the research bases.</p><p></p><p>It's like having a vast desert area with a lot of gold sand - even if you enter it, you may not be able to find the gold sand.</p><p></p><p>For this situation, Xia Qingjun is helpless and can only continue to add more observer personnel.</p><p></p><p>What he is most worried about is the Eight-Armed Race secretly researching new weapons in some obscure corner and then catching humans off guard...</p><p></p><p>After all, in recent years, no matter how much he shouts the slogan of "steady progress, gradual encroachment", there are not many people who actually listen.</p><p></p><p>He can see very clearly that in these years, not only have humans' strength and sphere of influence expanded crazily, but their mentality has as well.</p><p></p><p>If they're not careful, they might just fall flat on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on him as a captain is quite high!</p><p></p><p>He is very clear that no matter how many difficulties are encountered in adversity, it's not scary. What's most frightening is falling flat on one's face when the situation is favorable...</p><p></p><p>If not handled properly, problems will arise.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "Hopefully the Eight-Armed Race will put up some resistance, so that humans don't develop a lax mentality."</p><p></p><p>Deep down, he actually doesn't panic about any problems, because humans still have Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about anything. If a big problem arises, just call Xu Shiqiang!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the person regarded by Xia Qingjun as the human deity capable of resolving any crisis, Su Hao, was currently strolling on a planet covered in green, steaming liquid.</p><p></p><p>He hoped this planet could provide inspiration for the new ability he was studying - 'Planetary Network Positioning Teleportation'.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao had expected, it was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>The principle of 'teleportation' is: Su Hao's spiritual power attaches to the positioning stone, allowing him to sense the space where the positioning stone is located. At this point, he can project the 'negative space module' to the location of the positioning stone, connecting the two spaces.</p><p></p><p>To achieve teleportation, Su Hao essentially needs to influence the space at the teleportation destination from the world perspective sensed by his spiritual tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao, who has accessed the 'Planetary Network', can see the appearances of various planets, in essence, what he sees is only the 'real-time projection' of the planets. He is fundamentally unable to affect the space and matter of the corresponding planet from the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>It's like Su Hao's 'spatial spiritual tentacles' simply cannot reach the corresponding location.</p><p></p><p>Seen this way, 'Planetary Network Positioning Teleportation' is fundamentally impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao really wants this ability...</p><p></p><p>What should he do?</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, perhaps he would come up with a solution, as he now has no shortage of brain power.</p><p></p><p>If one day he has no problems to think about, he would actually feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, just sitting and thinking doesn't lead to good ideas. He needs to walk around, thinking while seeking inspiration.</p><p></p><p>So in the time that followed, he just wandered around aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Strolling on the Blue Light Planet, ignoring the infatuated looks from people of all ages who saw him.</p><p></p><p>Wandering on the God Planet of the Compound Eye Race, on human colony planets, on various strange desolate planets...</p><p></p><p>His figure could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>He would even randomly run onto Eight-Armed Race warships, casually strolling among the stunned Eight-Armed beings as if it were his own backyard.</p><p></p><p>In the end, having gained no inspiration, Su Hao nonchalantly fired a 'Destruction Cannon' and blew up the ship.</p><p></p><p>Until today, Su Hao wandered to a liquid planet, constantly bubbling outward from inside, with fierce storms raging in the atmosphere, layers of dark green clouds accumulating in the high altitude, occasionally streaked by lightning, and acid rain pouring down...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but marvel: "There really are all kinds of strange planets! Different planets, over a long period of time, have different opportunities and will exhibit different qualities. Truly wondrous!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he gradually stopped, frozen in midair.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he suddenly exclaimed: "Different qualities...different qualities of planets, qualities..."</p><p></p><p>He realized: "That's right! Every planet has its own qualities, every object has its unique aspects. I can completely use these qualities to position spaces."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Planetary Network' is essentially the warping of space-time caused by the distortion of matter, resulting in information synchronization.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the gravitational waves produced by different matter clusters are not the same, but the traces of warping space-time will still be synchronized in the 'Planetary Network'...</p><p></p><p>I just need to start from the different 'warping traces' of different matter, and by analyzing the oscillation of space modules caused by curvature, I can locate the position in the real world..."</p><p></p><p>Simply put: After determining the teleportation location, observe the teleportation destination from the 'Planetary Network', then analyze the qualities of the specified location's matter cluster, calculate what kind of impact this matter cluster has on space, and then use spiritual tentacles to find the affected space modules in the 'Space World'...</p><p></p><p>In this way, he can find the specified location from the Space World!</p><p></p><p>The process is: 'Observe object' - 'Deduce impact' - 'Match data' - 'Confirm location'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but praise himself: "Damn, I'm such a genius!"</p><p></p><p>Although the universe is vast, the probability of having two identical planets can be ignored. Su Hao doesn't need to worry about finding the wrong location.</p><p></p><p>If there really are two identical planets and he happens to encounter them, then he admits he's unlucky.</p><p></p><p>But most importantly, the unlucky one is the [Eight-Armed God], not him.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the inspiration Su Hao has been looking for?</p><p></p><p>With a research direction in mind, Su Hao was immediately full of motivation!</p><p></p><p>Realizing the 'Planetary Network Positioning Teleportation' technology is just around the corner.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 944</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali was screening this year's outstanding graduates in his office, preparing to develop them into subordinates for the organization.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the winged king Quanfugui came in and said, "Senior brother, I noticed that the students Master brought today seemed dispirited and absent-minded after class. After some inquiries, I learned that Master demonstrated his abilities in class today, scaring the students quite a bit...</p><p></p><p>Should we send someone privately to console them?"</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali was stunned and asked in surprise, "What? Master directly revealed it in class, so bluntly?"</p><p></p><p>The winged king Quanfugui forced a smile, "Yes, normally we guide the students to explore and discover it themselves, letting them go through a process to accept it, unveiling the mysterious side, and screening out some people during this process. But I didn't expect Master to be so blunt and lay it all out. The key is the students were completely unprepared, and their worldviews were impacted."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali stroked his chin thoughtfully, "Perhaps the Grand Master had his considerations. When students are extremely shocked, they often reveal their true selves, allowing the Grand Master to identify his target students in this brief process and improve his disciple recruitment efficiency. After all, not everyone is as fortunate as us to study under Master for a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui said, "You're right, senior brother. With your explanation, I no longer have any doubts. Should we learn from Master and directly demonstrate to our own students?"</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali shook his head, "No need to overthink it. Let's proceed as before unless there are special circumstances. After all, you and I are not Master - what he can do, we fall far short of. Also, don't bother consoling them privately. If needed, Master will certainly let us know."</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui nodded, discussed some school matters, and then left.</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali pondered and sent Master Yashan a message: "Master, I've observed that some of your students seem emotionally unstable. I learned that you directly revealed supernatural matters in class. Do you need me to do anything?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied: "No need, this is a test from me. I have another class tomorrow, and you'll understand then. Just focus on your own tasks."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali thought to himself, 'As expected.'</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan said, "Vali, you and your junior brothers should prepare yourselves. After this semester ends, hand over the school affairs to other disciples. I have other tasks for you all to take charge of."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali immediately replied, "Understood, Master. I will make the arrangements."</p><p></p><p>He didn't inquire about the tasks.</p><p></p><p>After ending the communication, he began contemplating how to handle the handover.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Yashan saw the classroom full of students, no longer looking shocked but gazing at him with passion.</p><p></p><p>He smiled with satisfaction, "You are all such good students!"</p><p></p><p>He then asked another question, "Students, are you willing to give up your desired careers and lives in order to explore spiritual powers?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three months passed quickly. The school affairs of the two schools were successfully handed over to the later disciples.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng respectively gathered their own disciples, preparing to arrange special practice projects for them.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had over a hundred direct disciples, all highly accomplished cultivators, now sitting in the hall awaiting Yashan's arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone present, Yashan said, "Next, there is an extremely massive undertaking that requires everyone's cooperation to complete together. I call this task the 'Infinite Lands'."</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Lands?"</p><p></p><p>The disciples were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After Yashan briefly explained, the disciples were all dumbstruck, looking utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>They were all shocked to an unimaginable degree by this 'Infinite Lands' plan.</p><p></p><p>It was truly an unbelievable idea.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the shock turned into longing for the 'Infinite Lands' - they too wanted to know what these so-called Infinite Lands would be like.</p><p></p><p>After the disciples calmed down, Yashan continued, "It's not hard to imagine that this is an exceptionally massive undertaking impossible for an individual alone. This is also why I called you back from the schools.</p><p></p><p>However, among you present, no more than fifty can independently construct a complete world passage.  Even adding those fifty, it would just be a drop in the bucket for this undertaking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the future, we will continuously explore outwards and discover more and more life planets to be integrated into the Infinite Lands as part of the worlds.</p><p></p><p>Accomplishing such a thing requires more than just a few hundred people.</p><p></p><p>I need a professional team dedicated to constructing world passages, solely responsible for connecting different continents and maintenance."</p><p></p><p>Yashan paused and scanned the disciples below, "So, I need you all to first master the 'world passage' skill, then each lead a dedicated hundred-person team for constructing world passages, whether by taking in disciples or hiring paid workers. You have two hundred years, but the sooner the better."</p><p></p><p>The disciples immediately replied, "Yes, Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan then looked at the senior disciple, the elf king Vali, "Vali, you will be fully in charge of this task. Feel free to consult me if any issues arise."</p><p></p><p>Vali bowed, "This disciple accepts the command and will not let the Grand Master down."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yashan sent the 'world passage' construction method he had compiled to each disciple through the 'Infinite Imprint'.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he sent the locations of the world passages he and Fengcheng had constructed for the disciples to reference, "These are the rudimentary world passages I previously constructed. You can refer to them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>After assigning the disciples' tasks, Yashan and Fengcheng began searching the cosmos for stable planets to conduct splicing experiments.</p><p></p><p>After all, this wasn't just connecting two planets but countless planets, so the foundational structure was extremely crucial.</p><p></p><p>After multiple attempts, Yashan chose a hexagonal passage structure with one planet as the central point, stacking planets outward like a honeycomb.</p><p></p><p>Each planet had six world passages, each passage connecting to a world.</p><p></p><p>In other words, one planet connected to six other planets, stacked outward according to position and distance, forming an expanse.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many new planets were discovered in the future, they could all be integrated into this Infinite Lands system.</p><p></p><p>Now, what Yashan and Fengcheng had to deal with was just the stability of the 'world passages'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, ensuring the battles of supernatural beings didn't destroy the world passages was also an issue - whether through concealment, fortification, or countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>This problem could only be considered later for now.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by, and two hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>For mortals, these two hundred years saw earth-shattering changes - generations were born, grew up, aged, and died. The world rapidly updated, developing many more advanced technologies. People became happier compared to before!...?</p><p></p><p>If one had to give an example, it would be that the number of disciples from the two sects increased.</p><p></p><p>The total grew from less than a thousand originally to nearly a hundred thousand now.</p><p></p><p>This meant the disciples could see fellow martial uncles and brothers almost everywhere, as if the entire world was their own.</p><p></p><p>One day, after Yashan and Fengcheng completed splicing an uninhabited planet, they began testing the situation of the entire spliced continent.</p><p></p><p>A total of over fifty planets, with the harshest mountain ranges on each planet as boundaries, had six world passages laid high above the clouds connecting to each other.</p><p></p><p>Without using spatial abilities, the two traversed between the various planets through the world passages, and it truly felt like a seamless super-continent without any obstructions.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "Success, the technique has matured and can be put into full use."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng looked at their masterpiece and couldn't help but laugh heartily, then said, "I just don't know when the old Master Wei will emerge from seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Let's wait! We can research the new life planets I recently found in the meantime. I've discovered quite a few interesting things."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng waved his hand, "To be honest, compared to staying on an uninhabited life planet for research, I prefer delving into the cosmos to discover more hidden intelligent civilizations. It's just a pity that after all these years, we haven't found a third civilization."</p><p></p><p>Yashan shook his head, "Fengcheng, you still don't understand the thrill of discovering the unknown."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed, "What does it matter? I'll focus on searching for planets. If there are any new discoveries, I'll just learn from old Yashan again."</p>

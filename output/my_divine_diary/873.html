        <h1>Chapter 873</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, among the group of deities, the God of Order - Red Light raged furiously: "Damn it! My avatar just went out and was killed by a group of red-golden dragons. Nati, you explain to me what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Nati: "??? My avatar just set out too, what does it have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light sent the locations of the Demon Kings like Crimson to the group, and the deities immediately went to investigate what exactly happened.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Nati said in the group: "It has nothing to do with me, these are not my followers. If you want revenge, go find them yourself. I have no objection."</p><p></p><p>Red Light said angrily: "One avatar is worth a hundred points...I, a great deity, have suffered such humiliation. This cannot be let go, I must make those stupid and lowly red-golden dragons pay."</p><p></p><p>Nati immediately said: "You can go after those golden dragons, I have no objection. But you insult our noble dragon race by calling them stupid and lowly, I cannot agree to that. The stupid and lowly ones should be you humans, not only that, but also vile and shameless."</p><p></p><p>The two deities successfully started a war, and the deities immediately began flaming each other in the group.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the evil Demon King Crimson still did not understand that his newly formed army had accidentally offended the deities he was supposed to save.</p><p></p><p>Even if he succeeded in rescuing them, he might just get slapped to death.</p><p></p><p>Although the God of Order - Red Light called for making Crimson and the Demon Kings pay, he actually had no better way, because currently he could only operate through an ordinary human avatar to go out.</p><p></p><p>Unless...he violated the rules!</p><p></p><p>Red Light thought darkly: "Perhaps it's really possible? Compared to violating the rules, those hateful stupid dragons don't matter. And as long as I'm discreet, Lord Thunder shouldn't discover it. Hmm, I should plan it out carefully. I need to get other deities involved, even if discovered, where many offend there is no punishment. Lord Thunder shouldn't make it too difficult for me..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Red Light posted a bounty in the group: "Lords, help me deal with those red-golden dragons. A bounty of one thousand points, whoever takes them out gets the one thousand points."</p><p></p><p>The deities fell silent, greatly tempted.</p><p></p><p>Even the God of Heavenly Stability - Nati, who was of the red-golden dragon race, was considering the feasibility.</p><p></p><p>Just tribesmen after all, or were the points more enticing...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The generation of the 'Soul Auto-Bestowal System' was not only sensed by Crimson, who possessed pure soul power.</p><p></p><p>The powerful soul cultivators and soul guardians left over from the old world in various parts of the world also sensed the abnormality in the world.</p><p></p><p>They smelled the familiar soul aura from the anomaly - it was the aura of their deities.</p><p></p><p>For a time, they couldn't help but seethe with excitement, almost moved to tears: The deities had not abandoned them, the deities had returned!</p><p></p><p>However, as the soul cultivators waited and waited without seeing their deities return to the magnificent divine abodes, they became doubtful again: "Could our perception have been wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Then a few months later, nearly ten followers of the deities received a 'divine edict' that made them believe their perception was correct: We did not perceive wrongly, the great deity has indeed returned.</p><p></p><p>The 'divine edict' was written in the familiar tone of the great deity, instructing them to go to Dragon Continent to exterminate a group of evil dragons.</p><p></p><p>"Exterminate the evil dragons?"</p><p></p><p>The soul cultivators had many doubts, but did not question it, after all the deity's edict was absolute, there must be reasons for the deity to command this.</p><p></p><p>Thus, except for the highest ranking powers, many of the powerful remaining soul cultivators from the old era organized teams to exterminate the evil dragons, converging from various directions on the two sea routes leading to Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Xu Hao, whose divine consciousness blanketed the entire planet, saw it all, but he only smiled and did not interfere with the deities' actions.</p><p></p><p>An adult red-golden dragon without soul power only had strength equivalent to a human seventh-rank soul cultivator, not to mention Crimson who had pure soul power personally imparted by Xu Hao - the Demon King's soul power was no joke.  </p><p></p><p>Whether these remnant soul cultivators from the old era were a match for Crimson was questionable, the result of the extermination was bound to end in failure.</p><p></p><p>And this extermination campaign would conveniently spread Crimson Demon King's name across the world. For Crimson to become a qualified Demon King, simply shouting slogans was not enough, he needed to be tempered by bloodshed. Currently, Crimson Demon King was just a blundering dragon with power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were too many remaining soul cultivators from the old world, whose lifespans were relatively longer than ordinary people. This was a good opportunity to use Crimson's hand to clear out some of these soul cultivators, leaving more room for the new generation to grow.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Xu Hao would not interfere with these events happening, as long as the general direction did not change, the minor details did not matter.</p><p></p><p>"The struggle between the 'righteous order-upholding deities' and the 'evil dark ruler' Demon King is also quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the struggle between justice and evil, Xu Hao was more concerned about whether the 'Soul Auto-Bestowal System' he designed could complete bestowing new intelligent life with souls according to plan.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he slowly disappeared from a mountaintop, reappearing at a small village.</p><p></p><p>There was a woman in labor here, about to give birth to a baby.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao wanted to observe up close the process of this newborn being bestowed a soul.</p><p></p><p>He had done this many times since establishing the soul power system, with the aim of checking for loopholes in the operating process and patching them in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>As of today, the soul bestowal system had become quite refined, with few issues occurring.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, accompanied by a clear newborn's cry, Xu Hao revealed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after this baby was born, the 'Soul Auto-Bestowal System' automatically activated, bestowing a wisp of soul power on the baby and successfully integrating it into its brain.</p><p></p><p>This wisp of soul power would grow along with the baby's growth.</p><p></p><p>If this baby had strong enough spiritual power, it may be able to sense its own soul and awaken its power. If it did not have strong enough spiritual power, then this wisp of soul power would lie dormant in its brain until the end of its life, when the soul would be automatically collected by the system formed by the eighteen deities, to be reincarnated, or become part of the 'Soul Auto-Bestowal System' to improve its intelligence and functions, or be crushed into nutrients for the system, forming a positive cycle. Special individuals, the system's oversights, would just be considered ghosts of this world...</p><p></p><p>And such a process would only take a few hundred years, after which the entire world would become different.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's take a look at the situation with the Mountain Elf tribe and the Dragon race."</p><p></p><p>Compared to humans, the populations of these two races were at a disadvantage, so Xu Hao didn't mind giving them some attention to allow these two special races to be preserved on this planet, counting as a unique feature.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Elf tribe was a humanoid race, with individuals generally only a little over one meter tall, appearing very petite when standing next to humans. But every Mountain Elf had an exquisite and adorable appearance that could be described as 'big-eyed cuteness'.</p><p></p><p>Judged solely on cuteness value, they completely crushed humans and dragons.</p><p></p><p>The harmless appearance of the Mountain Elves was also why humans and dragons found it hard to see this race as an enemy. In this world, most of the time it was the dragons and humans fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>Another month later, Xu Hao slowly disappeared from the Mountain Elves' territory: "The system can basically ensure coverage of all newborns of intelligent races now. There's just one last place - the Cloud Valley Mountains, where I descended into this world."  </p><p></p><p>Of course, this wasn't because Xu Hao felt nostalgic and wanted to revisit the place. Rather, he planned to randomly sprinkle some soul power among newborn beasts in the mountains, so that some lucky newborn beasts could also gain soul power enhancements and gradually transform into this world's unique 'soul beasts'.</p><p></p><p>If an extremely fortunate soul beast was further blessed, it may even give birth to rudimentary intelligence under the effects of soul power, like the legendary 'demonic tribes'.</p><p></p><p>With time accumulating, perhaps in the future this paradise filled with all kinds of ferocious beasts could really form an entirely new race through soul power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Xu Hao's idea, he had no experience to accurately predict the outcome of how it would turn out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao's form slowly appeared in the Cloud Valley Mountains, strolling through the woods, his vast divine consciousness enveloping the entire mountain range, with nothing escaping his perception.</p><p></p><p>"Conveniently, there's a tiger cat giving birth to cubs, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao concealed his form, and the scene quietly shifted as he arrived by the tiger cat's side, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the tiger cat successfully gave birth to five cubs.</p><p></p><p>"Two of the cubs with more active brains were lucky and got locked onto by the system, bestowed with a wisp of soul power. Not bad..."</p>

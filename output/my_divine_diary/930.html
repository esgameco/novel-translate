        <h1>Chapter 930</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>To tell the truth, neither Yashan nor Fengcheng had ever imagined that Venerable Wei would have such a fanciful idea of connecting all life planets together.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought they would just follow Venerable Wei and roam the universe in the future...</p><p></p><p>Although drifting without a fixed abode, having no place to return to, it was not entirely unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>At least they had company and would not feel too lonely.</p><p></p><p>But linking all the planets together, what an enormous project that would be?</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng did not know.</p><p></p><p>They tried to imagine doing it themselves and found that in theory, with their current knowledge, it was possible to achieve this function. However, the scale of the engineering work was beyond imagination. Even with many avatars helping their third senior fellow cultivator carry it out, it was hard to say how long it would take to complete.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Suhao's laboratory, Yashan and Fengcheng were about to return to their respective palaces.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yashan called out to Fengcheng, "Wait a moment, Fengcheng."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked, "What is it, Senior Martial Brother Yashan?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I have carefully considered it, and I think Venerable Wei's idea is achievable. This is something we will inevitably have to do in the future. It's just that Venerable Wei is currently busy with other matters, so he only has the idea but hasn't thought it through in depth yet.</p><p></p><p>Since Venerable Wei has no time for it now, we still have time, so you and I should prepare for this task early. We cannot always rely on Venerable Wei to make detailed arrangements for us. Knowing one of Venerable Wei's ideas is enough for us to take action."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded in agreement and asked, "How should we prepare? To be honest, I'm still in a state of fantasy and can't think of which angle to start this plan from."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "One thing is certain - completing this project will inevitably require the joint assistance of a large number of talents from various fields, especially those proficient in spatial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Our current disciples add up to less than a thousand, which is certainly not enough. So, the first step we should take is to expand our student recruitment, whether teaching them personally or having our disciples take students themselves. The more, the better. We should aim to recruit at least 100,000 within 200 years."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was stunned. "Recruit 100,000 in 200 years? This..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Don't let your thinking become rigid. We can recruit disciples not only from the initial Primordial Gods and interstellar travelers who have undergone planet remodeling but also actively go to the Blue-Purple Planet to openly recruit."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked, "Openly recruit?"</p><p></p><p>This reminded him of the time when they recruited those fifty spirited youths, holding up advertisement boards and shouting through loudspeakers everywhere, taking in anyone they could...</p><p></p><p>However, while this could be done on the backward Cruciform Planet, it might not work on the highly advanced Blue-Purple Planet, where they would most likely be regarded as swindlers. Even if they managed to recruit people, they would probably just be a bunch of fools.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "We can establish two universities on the Blue-Purple Planet and set promotion conditions to screen suitable students from the universities. Don't we have many disciples? These disciples are rare talents and are more than qualified to be university professors.</p><p></p><p>This way, we can gain hundreds or thousands of qualified students every year. As our reputation gradually grows, we will attract even more outstanding students. In 200 years, we'll have far more than 100,000."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng gave Yashan a thumbs up and praised him, "As expected of Senior Martial Brother Yashan, you are truly brilliant. However, this doesn't seem to fit your usual style. In the past, you wouldn't bother with opening universities but would directly go and snatch people away. Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Venerable Wei previously told me that in doing anything, we should draw a bottom line. If we want to recruit them to help us work, we need their consent. It does seem quite appealing that they can learn more, but not everyone is willing.</p><p></p><p>We should at least have basic respect for life. Of course, I'll take this opportunity to pass on Venerable Wei's words to you as well, hoping that you won't lose your way amidst immense power in the future."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said nonchalantly, "Don't worry, Senior Martial Brother Yashan. I won't lose my way because of power. After all, Venerable Wei and you are ahead of me, waiting for me to chase hard. I have no time to play games of getting lost."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I hope so. Of course, recruiting students is just the first step. If you have time, you should also think about how to construct the 'infinite land' that Venerable Wei mentioned. The more preliminary plans we have, the better. We can select and summarize the best ones and present one or two initial plans for Venerable Wei's reference."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng replied, "Understood, Senior Martial Brother Yashan. Let me prepare first, and after some time, I'll go and establish a school called Double Sword University."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily, "Alright, then I'll call mine Infinity University."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After parting with Yashan, Fengcheng was about to return to his palace when he suddenly remembered that he had recently taken in five students.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time. I should take these five students away and announce the establishment of the university."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Fengcheng transmitted himself to Double Sword City and sent a message to his students through the 'Double Sword Imprint': "Gather at the 'Diligent Study Hall'."</p><p></p><p>All the students who received the message immediately put down what they were doing and hurried to the 'Diligent Study Hall' in Double Sword City.</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng and the other four interstellar travelers who had just emerged from the trials on the Cruciform Planet were curiously wandering around Double Sword City.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ren Wenlan appeared in front of them and said, "The Celestial Venerable has summoned you. Follow me immediately."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, she transformed into a stream of light and flew towards a distant mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng and the other four looked at each other and immediately used their techniques to turn into rays of light, closely following her.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the 'Diligent Study Hall', they found that several hundred people were already scattered on meditation mats, waiting.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, streams of light would fly in from afar and join the crowd.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Cong Shuling stood up, bowed, and said, "Master, all of Double Sword Sect's disciples, except for Junior Martial Brother Chi Pu, have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, an enormously large red-golden dragon flew rapidly from afar, shouting loudly, "I'm here, I'm here! Wait for me."</p><p></p><p>Ji Dingcheng and the others exchanged glances, inwardly startled. "Isn't this the Red-Golden Huge Dragon of the Demonic Dragon Race? How did it appear here? Is it also a disciple of the Double Sword Sect? And its head is ridiculously large... Its aura is extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chi Pu plunged into the study hall, shouting loudly, "Make way, make way! Don't let me step on you."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the entire hall was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Demon King Chi Pu squeezed in, the study hall suddenly felt a bit crowded...</p><p></p><p>The others looked at the Great Demon King Chi Pu, mostly with helplessness and fear on their faces. They couldn't beat him, nor could they say anything, as his seniority was intimidatingly high. Moreover, the Celestial Venerable cherished him greatly.</p><p></p><p>After settling down, the Great Demon King Chi Pu greeted Fengcheng with a smile, "Master! It's been a long time since I last saw you."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled and nodded. This mission had nothing to do with the Great Demon King Chi Pu, so he would probably be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everyone had arrived, Fengcheng directly stated the purpose of summoning them: "I plan to establish a high-end university on the Blue-Purple Planet, and you will become the professors at this university."</p><p></p><p>All the disciples were collectively dumbfounded. "???"</p><p></p><p>It was completely out of the blue for the Celestial Venerable to want to run a university. Moreover, using their talents to teach at a university would be a gross underutilization.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, none of the intelligent planets they currently knew of had reached a level that required the establishment of a 'university'.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling curiously asked, "Master, which planet is the Blue-Purple Planet?"</p><p></p><p>She had just searched but couldn't find any information about the Blue-Purple Planet in the system.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng revealed a smile and said, "Do you remember your origins? I'm referring to the place where you were born and grew up before transmigrating - your hometowns. That's what I call the Blue-Purple Planet."</p><p></p><p>All the interstellar travelers were shaken, and an incredulous emotion welled up from the depths of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Hometown?</p><p></p><p>For most of the people present, this word had become an extremely distant and unfamiliar term.</p><p></p><p>When they had just transmigrated, they did have some regretful feelings and wanted to return to their previous lives. But as the pressure from various trials mounted, they gradually let go of such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They all thought that perhaps they could never go back.</p><p></p><p>But today, they suddenly heard the Celestial Venerable say that they would return to their hometowns as professors to establish a university...</p><p></p><p>This left all the interstellar travelers stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Great Demon King Chi Pu curiously asked, "What are you all talking about? Why can't I understand?"</p>

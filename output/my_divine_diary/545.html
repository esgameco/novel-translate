        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Inspired by Su Hao, Axing realized that his combination with Awang was indeed invincible.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to confront people face-to-face!</p><p></p><p>Unless someone didn't need to breathe air, he had a way to take them down!</p><p></p><p>One day, two days, three days...</p><p></p><p>If it didn't work, he could gas them for a year!</p><p></p><p>With everything prepared, the three found a spot and hid in the woods, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Through Awang's shared sensory ability, Axing precisely located Duomao's squad, then silently blocked their path forward with a massive poisonous gas cloud.</p><p></p><p>Actively releasing it would easily be sensed by the enemy, but if they ran into it themselves, there would be no such worry.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the three members of Duomao's squad chatted and laughed, casually discussing how to have fun that night, as if the unpleasant experience of turning into pigs had vanished.</p><p></p><p>As they walked, the blacksmith frowned and said, "Why do I keep feeling something is off?"</p><p></p><p>One of his teammates also frowned and said, "Indeed, could we have fallen into some trap? Danzi, have you sensed anything amiss?"</p><p></p><p>Danzi was the perception and vigilance specialist sorcerer in Duomao's squad. After carefully sensing for a moment, he said, "It's those arrogant fools from before, they've been following us. It's probably their doing. Heh, two sorcerer rookies, it's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"I still feel something is off, why don't we go take them out? Leaving them be will only cause trouble."</p><p></p><p>"They can fly, but we can't, it's hard to take them out. Unless we catch them off guard and strike fiercely. Even the captain's sudden attack earlier was dodged. No need to rush, as long as they don't come to us, it'll be fine. I've memorized their aura, we can deal with them tonight!"</p><p></p><p>"Could they have released poisonous gas on us? Air sorcerers do like those underhanded tricks."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Don't worry! I'm the bane of air sorcerers' poisonous gas. The universal antidote pills in my chest have never failed to cure any poison!"</p><p></p><p>Then the blacksmith captain said, "Danzi, hurry up and take out the antidote pills, don't mess this up. This is exactly what being gassed by an air sorcerer feels like, no mistake! The bastards, I let them go once, but they dared to come back and cause trouble. Hmph, they'll get it tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Danzi nonchalantly poured out three round green beads from an iron box, one for each person to swallow. He confidently said, "Don't worry captain! We've been wandering for so many years, what haven't we seen? Just those two brats, heh!"</p><p></p><p>After taking the pills, the three felt reassured and their smiles returned.</p><p></p><p>After walking a bit further, Danzi's expression suddenly changed as he leaned against a tree trunk, "Oh no, I think I've been poisoned!"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the antidote pill supposed to be a cure-all?</p><p></p><p>Before they could ask, the blacksmith and the other teammate's faces also changed, feeling dizzy, with dry, itchy throats that made it hard to swallow.</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith immediately said, "Don't stop, leave this area first, start running! Danzi, hurry up, take out the antidote pills, we're really poisoned! Those two brats are dead for sure!"</p><p></p><p>The three immediately mustered their strength and ran quickly, instantly leaving Axing's poisonous gas range, then swallowed Danzi's antidote pills.</p><p></p><p>As they ran, one by one they collapsed to the ground. The blacksmith cursed hoarsely, "Damn you Danzi, do these crappy pills even work? Don't just talk big, hurry up and cure us!"</p><p></p><p>Danzi panicked too, rummaging through various chests and pouring out all kinds of pills, not caring if they worked, just stuffing them into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>But even after eating his fill, there was no sign of the poison subsiding, the three only grew weaker.</p><p></p><p>Finally, unable to swallow any more, Danzi said in despair, "Captain, I've never seen this kind of poison before, it might be incurable..."</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith struggled up leaning on his hammer and said, "Where are they? I'll go smash them to death!"</p><p></p><p>Danzi pointed in a direction and said, "Over there!"</p><p></p><p>Then the blacksmith carried his hammer, legs shaky but still determinedly stepping in that direction, hoarsely roaring, "What are you lying around for? Hurry up and get up, useless things."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said in amazement, "They're still not dead? What powerful physiques, it must be due to their source bodies."</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "They're coming this way, what should we do? Go finish them off?"</p><p></p><p>Axing also looked at Su Hao, seeking his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Why fight? Just keep gassing them!"</p><p></p><p>That made sense!</p><p></p><p>But doing so would be quite unscrupulous, making Duomao's squad utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>Now with shaky legs unable to run or catch up, an unknown poisonous gas tailing them relentlessly, they dared not stop either.</p><p></p><p>What is the meaning of despair?</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith could only roar helplessly, swinging his hammer wildly to turn the surroundings into a world of weapons, but it still couldn't change the fact that their bodies were gradually weakening and rotting.</p><p></p><p>The timid one said, "Captain, let's play dead! Lure them over, maybe there's a slim chance."</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other, struggled for a bit, then lay straight and motionless, inside and out expressing: I'm dead, come collect the corpse!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Awang said, "Looks like they're dead!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew they weren't actually dead, so he shook his head and said, "Even if they're dead, we can't let our guard down. Keep gassing them for a few more hours to be absolutely sure."</p><p></p><p>That made sense!</p><p></p><p>They waited left and right, but no one appeared. Duomao's squad couldn't keep lying there, trying to get up, only to find their bodies had gone numb and unresponsive, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>The three felt a chill, never imagining the renowned Duomao's squad would fall in such a place, in such a humiliating way.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even have the mood to say 'I have no regrets in this life.'</p><p></p><p>Until nightfall, the three never got back up, until their last breath couldn't be drawn in or expelled.</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "They must have really kicked the bucket..."</p><p></p><p>Then he gave Axing a thumbs up, "Axing, what a brilliant move, amazing! You're invincible now!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Indeed amazing! If Axing, you could develop the poisonous gas cloud to automatically lock onto and follow the target, they wouldn't be able to escape the range, then you'd truly be invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang gasped, this Ahang was truly a vicious one!</p><p></p><p>To be safe, Axing used an air blade to slice off the three heads first, before finally feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these three corpses, he could hardly believe this was his own doing!</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind, these three were high-level source sorcerers!</p><p></p><p>Axing walked over, picked up the pig's head that had reverted to normal, and let out a long breath, "Let's bury them, then go report the mission!"</p><p></p><p>Axing had an odd premonition that after today, he had changed.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Perhaps being an invisible assassin suits me better!"</p><p></p><p>Then he mocked himself: 'Never thought in the end, the one enjoying the glory most would have to turn and show his back.'</p><p></p><p>When the three returned to Huozhen Town, they found there were already quite a few people there, judging from their dirty appearances, likely the poor souls infected by the pig brain.</p><p></p><p>However, the news that 'Duomao's squad successfully resolved the bizarre disaster' had already spread far and wide!</p><p></p><p>Awang curiously asked, "Axing, what are you laughing at?"</p><p></p><p>"Laughing at this ridiculous world! A kind of indescribable feeling! I never felt it before, but now I just want to laugh out loud."</p><p></p><p>Awang also laughed.</p><p></p><p>Axing asked, "Then what are you laughing at?"</p><p></p><p>Awang shrugged, "I don't know, you laughed so I laughed along, otherwise I'd feel awkward for you."</p><p></p><p>Then the two looked at Su Hao, "Ahang, why aren't you laughing?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "..."</p><p></p><p>These two must have brain problems, they deserve to have pig heads stuffed into them!</p>

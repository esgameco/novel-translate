        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The same disaster, the same goal - few ask about those who died, while the survivors become heroes.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone tacitly understands this point.</p><p></p><p>As long as the heroes are elevated to a high enough position, there will always be people who ignore the danger and climb up one after another.</p><p></p><p>It seems this is the only way.</p><p></p><p>Almost every day, there are numerous disasters eroding this world. At every moment, brave source mages die resolving the sources of disasters, and more new generations awaken as new source mages, joining squads and beginning their epic heroic careers, until they die in some disaster.</p><p></p><p>Too many!</p><p></p><p>Everyone only remembers the victors. For those who died, they lay wreaths and mourn, then life goes on.</p><p></p><p>Even Axing, the center of the spotlight, didn't feel anything was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The victory he risked his life for should allow him to enjoy the glory belonging to him. And carrying this glory, he overcomes bizarre disasters time and time again, until he gains the title of "Bane of the Bizarre", until he dies in some disaster.</p><p></p><p>One night of revelry.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Suhao and others set out to return to Huaishui Town.</p><p></p><p>The one thousand high-quality source pearls they earned will be approved within a month after being reported and distributed by the Huaishui Town Association.</p><p></p><p>Their direct gain this time was eighty-three high-quality source pearls - twenty-five each for the three of them, with six left for Xiaotang. The remaining two pearls went to Suhao and Axing as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotang didn't want them at first, but Axing said they were for her to give as consolation money to the families of sacrificed teammates, so she accepted them.</p><p></p><p>Not much, but better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>Before disbanding, Axing announced that the squad would have a month of free rest with no mandatory mission conscription. They would not go out on missions for a month. The reason was to review this disaster and find their shortcomings, as he urgently wanted to improve himself.</p><p></p><p>After disbanding, Suhao returned home to freshen up, then transmitted to the temporary base outside of town.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, a black and yellow shadow pounced on him.</p><p></p><p>It was Big Dog!</p><p></p><p>Ayashan and Fengcheng were trying to make a crude "spirit medicine" synthesis apparatus. Seeing Suhao appear, they stopped what they were doing and ran over, curiously asking, "Grand Master Wei, you're back so soon? Did you figure out what a bizarre disaster is?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, this mission only took a few days from start to finish. To cultivators like Ayashan and Fengcheng who measured time almost in years, it was like he had just left for a bit before returning.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't say much, directly sending them the recording of resolving this bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>After watching, Ayashan and Fengcheng looked at each other, their backs chilled.</p><p></p><p>Ayashan muttered, "This...is too damn scary, just like watching a horror movie."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said in disbelief, "That's clearly a ghost...getting whipped once, even we cultivators would be done for, right? I didn't expect bizarre disasters to be so dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Ayashan laughed, "Look at you, forgetting who you are? You're an Applicant Human! Later you'll become a Life Human, hard to die even if you want to."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was shocked, "I saw brains running around, can Life Humans regrow brains?"</p><p></p><p>Ayashan: "I haven't tried that yet..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Now it seems this world is too bizarre and dangerous. Not only bizarre disasters possess this bizarre power, but also many bizarre source mages. If you're careless, you'll be struck down for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Without understanding the principles behind it, once struck, no matter how transcendent your power, you're helpless. To be honest, if I go out one day, sneeze for no reason and die just like that, I wouldn't even be surprised."</p><p></p><p>After watching the recording, Ayashan and Fengcheng deeply agreed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "So before we recover our peak power, it's better to keep a low profile. Ayashan, teach Fengcheng the transmission technique! Survival comes first. Next month I'll evolve you both into Prophet Humans first to improve your brains!"</p><p></p><p>Ayashan said, "Got it, Grand Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Prophet Human? Fengcheng heard another new term he didn't understand, but immediately opened his All-Purpose Assistant to search for it.</p><p></p><p>He had learned to ask the Assistant if he didn't understand something...</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Ayashan, how's your spirit medicine progressing? That's the most crucial part."</p><p></p><p>Ayashan scratched his head, "We're currently designing the synthesis production line machinery using a spirit power rune structure. But we're still at the blood qi refinement stage without powerful forces, so it's too difficult to make a lot of the apparatuses by hand! The key is we don't have the corresponding material reserves..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought about it and agreed - for a complete spirit medicine production line, the corresponding spirit grasses were the raw material base, the refining stations provided energy, the production plants made the spirit medicines...all these things had to be realized step-by-step, not as simple as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Even mastering cultivation techniques, they still couldn't cross the hurdle of spirit power conversion taking a long time.</p><p></p><p>After pondering, he said, "Ayashan, break down some of the machine designs into components. I'll spend money to have people make them as proxies. This world's source energy industry seems decent - as long as I have enough money, making these things shouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said in surprise, "But that won't be cheap. Grand Master Wei, do you have money?"</p><p></p><p>Ayashan couldn't help but smack Fengcheng's head, scolding, "Are your brains worse than mine? Back in school I already told you, money isn't that superficial. As long as the productive forces are sufficient and society has surplus value, Grand Master Wei just needs to take a stroll and he'll have it, as much as needed."</p><p></p><p>The reasoning was sound, but Suhao still said, "Ayashan, why are you making me out to be a robber? Am I that kind of person?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he casually took out two source pearls, gesturing, "I can earn them myself, no need to rob."</p><p></p><p>Ayashan and Fengcheng leaned in, "These source pearls are money?"</p><p></p><p>"Source pearls aren't money, but they're very valuable. At the association they can be exchanged for quite a lot. If I exchange all the source pearls on me, it should be enough, right...?"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was enough or not, Suhao wasn't sure either - he didn't understand much about this world's mechanical production capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Ayashan curiously asked, "Grand Master Wei, can you let me take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao put the source pearls away, "Not for now, this thing is extremely dangerous. Those who don't know how to use it might kill themselves just by touching it. To safely obtain sources, you still need to awaken at the Mage Association."</p><p></p><p>For example, when Suhao awakened, if he had a source pearl and directly awakened with it, he might have caused a huge explosion that leveled the whole town.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao say this, Ayashan could only put his curiosity aside for now.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao gave some other instructions, he turned and said, "Let's go, Big Dog, we're going back to town."</p><p></p><p>Big Dog shot out immediately.</p><p></p><p>It could stay at the base, but Huaishui Town's White Sand Lane No. 25 was its real home after all!</p><p></p><p>Back in town, Suhao went straight to the association's main hall.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many source mages in this small town, so generally the scene was quite desolate, with the receptionist Gulan dozing off as usual at the front desk.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao came in, Gulan immediately woke up, looking very excited, "Zihang, I heard your Sungazer Squad resolved a bizarre disaster in Willow Town and became mage heroes! You're famous now, your exploits are spreading everywhere! You're so awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored her and placed a small bag of source pearls on the counter, "Gulan, help me see how much money I can exchange these source pearls for."</p><p></p><p>Gulan was dazed, "What? You want to exchange so many source pearls for money?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>"It's allowed, but it's a huge loss. Usually people only exchange a few - source mages are always short on these, no matter how many. </p><p></p><p>Oh right! I almost forgot, you're the heroic squad that resolved the bizarre disaster! You've struck it rich! It's normal to exchange some for spending money...I'm so envious!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "So can you help me exchange them now? How much can I get? Be quick about it, and I might give you a tip."</p><p></p><p>Gulan's eyes lit up and she immediately said, "I'll get it exchanged right away for you, just a moment."</p>

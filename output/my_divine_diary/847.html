        <h1>Chapter 847</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Bursts of hearty laughter echoed from within the small world imprisoning the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>It was the wholehearted, boisterous laughter of the five dragon gods.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely happy, not having laughed so freely for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>The happiest was Nati, the God of Heavenly Dominance - because he was the first to arrive in this small world. Initially, he was utterly despondent, thinking he was the only unlucky one captured.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that not only him, but the other seventeen divine beings would also be comprehensively captured and brought to this wondrous place created by Ryan today.</p><p></p><p>Next was Gu, the God of Myriad Thunders - he was also overjoyed, almost dancing with excitement. His brilliant idea had trapped all these gods in this godforsaken place, filling him with immense pride.</p><p></p><p>Amidst his hahaha laughter, he gleefully recounted to the human gods and mountain spirit gods how he had ensnared them and boasted about his own wit, finally saying, "Didn't expect it, did you? Being trapped by me, we're now good prison buddies! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The other human gods were filled with fury in need of venting, but they found that the more they mocked the old dragons, the happier the old dragons became instead of getting angry.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were unbearably vexed, they could barely stand it any longer.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Zhuxia, the God of Resurrection, turned his ire towards their own Hongguang, the God of Order, angrily accusing, "Lord Hongguang, you bear the most direct responsibility for our collective capture. If not for your repeated urging for us to explore that damn aura, could we have ended up in this predicament?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Order, Hongguang, was displeased, "Don't think being the prime god allows you to accuse me randomly. It's clearly because you cowards were too afraid to take the lead, all wanting others to explore the path first. I merely pointed out your despicable behavior, how did it become me urging you in your mouth? If I had the ability to urge you, I would have urged you all to perish long ago."</p><p></p><p>The other gods, insulted together, were extremely displeased and joined in, hurling accusations at each other. Eventually, they even dredged up old grievances as evidence to prove who was the idiot, who was the fool...</p><p></p><p>It became an extraordinary commotion, with the five dragon gods needing only a table and melon seeds to fully enjoy the show.</p><p></p><p>As they quarreled, eventually almost all the gods' arrows pointed at Yongshi, the God of Night, and Bali, the God of Gold.</p><p></p><p>They all said that if not for those two mentioning the 'Secret God', they would not be in this predicament. Most shamefully, they had fled at the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of insults poured forth towards the two.</p><p></p><p>Bali, the God of Gold, was vexed and couldn't help but turn red-faced from arguing with the other gods. Finally, he turned to see Yongshi calmly sitting to the side, utterly unperturbed by all the verbal abuse.</p><p></p><p>Bali was full of admiration. After it quieted down somewhat, Yongshi seemed to awaken from a daze and asked in confusion, "Just now I used the 'Silence Technique' to block out all sound, what were you all saying? Everyone's red-faced, it seemed quite constructive."</p><p></p><p>Bali was instantly petrified: "That works too?"</p><p></p><p>After they could no longer argue, the group of gods fell silent, leaving only the lingering laughter of the five dragon gods in the small world.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how long passed before a pink-armored human suddenly appeared, glancing at the silent rainbow-colored plates, and lightly laughed, "Divine beings, do you all understand the rules now? Any doubts?"</p><p></p><p>The human and mountain spirit gods were startled, looking at Suhao's figure, thinking inwardly, "So this is the mysterious Ryan Oakes? The one who captured all of us gods."</p><p></p><p>They didn't understand how such a bigshot had appeared out of nowhere, their minds swirling with guesses, but none were foolish enough to be the first to speak up.</p><p></p><p>The five dragon gods were quite disappointed by this, having hoped to see the consequences for defying Ryan, to be forewarned.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared easily try it. This fell into an extremely awkward situation, as none of the human gods knew Suhao's depths.</p><p></p><p>The unknown bred fear, but at the same time, each harbored a glimmer of hope: "What if I could launch a sneak attack and kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very satisfied with this, "Rest assured, divine beings, unless necessary, I will not destroy your rainbow-colored plates, nor will I kill you. In this state, you are very valuable to me. Of course, the prerequisite is obediently cooperating with my work."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Suhao looked towards Yongshi, the God of Night, and released her spatial seal, then extended his right hand, saying, "Then, Lady Yongshi, you start! Bring your rainbow-colored plate body over."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi was extremely hesitant. She didn't understand the meaning behind Suhao extending his hand, filling her with resistance, especially seeing the schadenfreude on the old dragons' faces.</p><p></p><p>"Resist?"</p><p></p><p>The thought arose in her mind but was quickly suppressed. Her abilities were not much stronger than the dragon gods'. If the five dragon gods who arrived first had been subdued, then her resistance would be meaningless to Ryan.</p><p></p><p>She steadied herself, overcoming her great fear, and controlled her body to slowly float towards Ryan, that mysterious pink figure.</p><p></p><p>Only she couldn't understand why she was the first: "Could it be related to that missing avatar of mine before? Did my avatar offend this Ryan?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how she thought about it, she realized she could not resist Ryan in this place.</p><p></p><p>Since resistance was futile, she would naturally face her impending fate! The five dragon gods hadn't died, so there should be no mortal danger, she would observe slowly afterwards.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Yongshi sped up, and under the anxious yet curious gazes of the other gods, her rainbow-colored plate made contact with Suhao's outstretched hand.</p><p></p><p>However, nothing happened. After a moment, Suhao released his hand and motioned for Yongshi to return, then turned to Bali, saying, "Next is Lord Bali, come over!"</p><p></p><p>All the gods breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This was way too scary.</p><p></p><p>After successfully recording all the gods' consciousness information, Suhao said, "Your cooperation exceeded my expectations. Just now I was wondering, if anyone didn't cooperate, how should I handle it to set an example? Should I directly and violently dismantle their rainbow-colored plates, or find a way to flush out their will and release the original White Galor's will..."</p><p></p><p>But the result was unexpectedly cooperative, saving me from the dilemma of not knowing which to choose. Then, let's begin the first experiment!"</p><p></p><p>The gods felt their rainbow-colored plate bodies slightly tingle upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, Suhao summoned a pirate captured from the Heaven's Road, casually asking, "Whose believer is this?"</p><p></p><p>The pirate, seeing the surrounding rainbow-colored plates, was dumbstruck. Upon noticing Suhao, he immediately knelt and said, "Greetings, divine lord."</p><p></p><p>After careful examination, Zhuxia, the God of Resurrection, cleared his throat and said, "This should be one of my believers."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then released Zhuxia.</p><p></p><p>The pirate stared dazedly at the emerging rainbow-colored plate, terrified, stammering incoherently as his hands and feet went limp, "G-Greetings to the great God of Resurrection, Lord Zhuxia."</p><p></p><p>With another casual wave, Suhao transmitted Zhuxia and the pirate to his laboratory, directly asking, "Can you completely extract his will?"  </p><p></p><p>"Very simple." A beam of light shone on Zhuxia, drilling into the pirate's mind. Then, with a beckoning gesture, a pale green light cluster emerged from the pirate's mind and came before Zhuxia.</p><p></p><p>Zhuxia explained, "This is his will. If it doesn't find a new body to enter within five days, then his will will inevitably collapse along with the disintegration of his soul force."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Suhao entered the Pinball Space to observe the pirate's consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>He discovered an interesting phenomenon: the consciousness information originally recorded in the Pinball Space had separated from that body along with Zhuxia's soul force.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Suhao could no longer use this pirate's consciousness information to observe his body.</p><p></p><p>"Then what if I record this body now?"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, he stepped forward and pressed his hand against the pirate's head, recording the body's consciousness information into the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao found that he only obtained a cluster of chaotic information, devoid of any value, but he could collect the body's data through this chaotic information.</p><p></p><p>"This body no longer has any consciousness, it's an empty shell. So now, if I return the pirate's will to it, what will happen?"</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Suhao told Zhuxia, "Now try returning his will to the body."</p><p></p><p>Following his words, Zhuxia infused that pale green light cluster into the pirate's brain, explaining, "It needs some time to fuse, probably about four hours before it's complete, then he'll awaken."</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't mind waiting, simultaneously focusing in the Pinball Space to observe the process of the will fusing with the brain.</p><p></p><p>His idea was simple - if he could transfer wills as easily as the gods, he could package his own consciousness information with soul force, then transfer and release it into the spirit brain, making so-called immortality perhaps attainable.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao had a vague premonition that using soul force to package consciousness information might not be so simple, undoubtedly involving many limitations.</p>

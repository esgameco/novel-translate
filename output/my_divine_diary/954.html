        <h1>Chapter 954</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The great demon king Chipu had not felt sadness for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But today, he felt inexplicably sad for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he gathered a bunch of good wine and directly messaged the eighteen deities: "Where are my friends? Come out and drink with me."</p><p></p><p>Over these past decades, the great demon king Chipu and the eighteen deities had become familiar with each other, addressing each other as brothers. They even created a new group chat, often gathering together to brag, drink, and barbecue.</p><p></p><p>Nati replied: "Haha, Lord Chipu, we recently obtained a 'flash' skill and are practicing it. You came at the perfect time, come take a look at our technique, I guarantee you'll be shocked."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he sent Chipu the location of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Chipu took a look, it was the Crossstar mountain range, the old spot.</p><p></p><p>The next moment he teleported there, saying a bit glumly: "My mood is not good today, come keep me company drinking."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chipu appear, Nati showed off his flash skill, flashing right in front of Chipu and asking: "How's my flash? Pretty awesome, right?"</p><p></p><p>The other deities also flashed in front of Chipu one after another, each showing off.</p><p></p><p>Chipu said: "Your flashes are too slow, with that lag. By the time you flash away, someone could hit you several times."</p><p></p><p>They had wanted praise but not only did they not get it, they were actually criticized instead. The deities' self-esteem took a huge hit and their faces turned black.</p><p></p><p>Chipu said: "Flashing is not that difficult, is the core rune of your skills not adjusted properly? To make the flash smooth and natural, adjusting the core rune is key."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he demonstrated his own operation for the deities.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge body, his series of flashes made the deities' scalps go numb.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Chipu is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu snorted: "This was taught directly by my master, how could it be bad? If you want to learn it's easy. Come, keep me company drinking, and after drinking I'll teach you how to adjust it so you can pull off all kinds of tricks."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, what a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's drink and eat!"</p><p></p><p>After drinking several jars of premium wine, their bodies felt warm and their words flowed more freely.</p><p></p><p>The golden deity Bali, leaning against Chipu's feet, patted him and said: "Say, Lord Chipu, you mentioned earlier encountering something that made you unhappy. What was it that saddened you?"</p><p></p><p>The great demon king Chipu said with some regret: "I wanted to participate with the other disciples in building the Infinite Lands and do a great undertaking. But unfortunately I never had the chance, and I feel saddened that for such a magnificent project, I did not contribute any effort."</p><p></p><p>The deity of order, Redlight, casually said: "That's easy, just go find your master to learn some techniques. Then you can create another land yourself, no need to mix with them."</p><p></p><p>Chipu shook his head: "It's not that simple. Creating world passages is my specialty, but I can sense that these Infinite Lands are different. Like Crosstar, there is some inexplicable soul force enveloping them, truly connecting the entire Infinite Lands together. It's not just about linking worlds."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, seeing the surprise in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Redlight said: "Isn't that the soul force network? We know how to do that!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu was astonished: "Huh? Soul force network?"</p><p></p><p>Redlight explained: "Yes, the soul force network, it's something Lord Jiawei personally instructed us to complete. It's extremely complex and took us quite some time."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, seeing the contemplation in each other's eyes: it seems there are great possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Chipu suddenly stood up, exclaiming happily: "So you mean, if I can complete the land assembly, you can use that 'soul force network' to connect it all together?"</p><p></p><p>The deities thought back and realized the previous soul force structure diagrams were still there - they could completely use the remaining soul force to make another soul force apparatus!</p><p></p><p>Redlight said: "Of course, all the soul force networks in these Infinite Lands were made by us. How could there be any fakes?"</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he continued: "Why don't we create our own Infinite Lands? Sounds quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Chipu downed a jar of fine wine and boomed: "What's there to hesitate about? Let's create our own Infinite Lands! I've already thought of a name - the Demonic Realm, and we'll all be the great demon kings of that land. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The deities thought about it and also felt it made sense. When facing disciples of the Twin Swords and Infinite Swords, they always felt smaller, a feeling they hated.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the future when the Infinite Lands were completed, their status there would be neither high nor low, which was quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, they might as well create their own lands and become the kings of a realm, able to live freely.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's all Infinite Lands, no need to compete with others...</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the one before them was Lord Jiawei's own brother! With him leading the way, what couldn't they accomplish?</p><p></p><p>After much discussion, in a heated moment, everyone raised their wine cups, clinked them together, drained them, and laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities normally didn't see eye-to-eye, but at critical moments they were still very united.</p><p></p><p>Because each deity was clear that their interests were actually bound together.</p><p></p><p>Little Cao weakly asked: "What about me...?"</p><p></p><p>The deity of bathing light, Yi, laughed: "Being the Demonic Realm's spokesperson isn't bad."</p><p></p><p>After the wine, Chipu found Fengcheng again and stated his intention: "Master, I no longer have a chance to participate in the great undertaking of the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>But I have not become discouraged because of this. After hearing about the Infinite Lands, they became my new pursuit. I dream about personally helping build the Infinite Lands with everyone, every moment.</p><p></p><p>So I have decided to search the universe for suitable planets and create a brand new Infinite Lands myself, to achieve my dream and follow in your footsteps exploring the unknown universe.</p><p></p><p>Master, do you approve of my dream? Will you support my actions?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fengcheng laughed heartily: "Chipu, I am very gratified that you have such lofty ambitions. As your master, I will naturally support your decision. Boldly go and create your own world!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu showed a delighted expression: "Master, I want the design plans for the world passages."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Fengcheng sent the design plans to Chipu via his Twin Swords Imprint: "Can you understand it? If there's anything unclear, feel free to ask me."</p><p></p><p>Chipu was overjoyed: "Thank you for your guidance, Master. Don't worry, I specialize in space, I can understand it."</p><p></p><p>He then bid farewell to Fengcheng and left in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Then he messaged the group of eighteen deities: "Friends, my master has agreed to our idea. Our Demonic Realm project is officially launching. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked: "What's the plan next?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu energetically said: "Of course to search the universe for our Demonic Realm. Ahem! We can't set our sights on existing worlds, those belong to my master and the others. We need to find our own."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know where his Demonic Realm would be yet, Chipu was still overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He had never felt as passionate about exploring the universe as he did now.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Chipu left, Fengcheng found it quite interesting, so he said in the group: "Old Suhai, Old Yashan, Chipu just came to me saying he wants to go search the universe for new life-bearing planets, then learn from us to create a different kind of Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>Haha, I didn't expect he would have such a lofty ideal. He was previously unwilling to go out and explore the universe, but this time it seems to have sparked his motivation to act."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "That huge red-golden dragon? Heh, I'd like to see what kind of Infinite Lands he ends up creating."</p><p></p><p>Suhai said: "His idea is not bad. If he really succeeds, we can play with all kinds of variations on the Infinite Lands."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he thought of another issue - the 'hidden coins' used to avoid calamities.</p><p></p><p>If Chipu didn't know about hiding from the trajectory lock of cosmic forces, the life-bearing planets he found might end up getting completely destroyed by him unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Suhai thought: "The scope of future outward exploration will gradually expand, and the number of people walking around on the lands will increase. The number of hidden coins needed is an astronomical figure.</p><p></p><p>But the difficulty of producing hidden coins is too high. Currently, besides me, no one can manufacture them, not even Yashan and Fengcheng for now.</p><p></p><p>So to solve this problem, besides deploying large numbers of 'travel permits' in every world, the best solution is to use soul force to create a martial art specifically for concealing oneself and avoiding the trajectory lock of cosmic forces..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, a ball of pure soul force appeared in Suhai's hand as he began experimenting.</p>

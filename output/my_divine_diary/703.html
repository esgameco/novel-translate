        <h1>Chapter 703</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The human leader was named Xia Qingjun, a middle-aged man full of vigor and spirit. His sword-like eyebrows were raised, his eyes were not large but very spirited, and his face was naturally commanding.</p><p></p><p>Just sitting there, he gave people a very reliable feeling.</p><p></p><p>What is meant by "remaining unmoved even if Mount Tai crumbles before you"? It could be used to describe him, as if he could solve and handle any situation that arose.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the flushed captain drunkenly bringing Su Hao to him, he did not show any surprise, only smiling faintly and saying: "Colonel Gong, hero Xu Shiqiang, you just came back yesterday, and are so eager to find me, surely not just for tea. What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The captain recounted his experience, then imagined a wonderful future: "Leader, just think, if we humans truly possessed 'teleportation technology', the situation of humanity in the universe would greatly improve! And even the blue light would no longer be our fatal weakness. We would have more possibilities and choices, defeating the Eight-Armed Race would no longer be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Leader Xia Qingjun roared with laughter, but the captain and Su Hao could sense that his laughter was full of hearing a joke.</p><p></p><p>Obviously he didn't take the captain's words seriously, probably thinking: Have these two been drifting in space too long and developed mental issues? We should have the psychological department check them out, can't have any major problems.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao didn't say much more. After getting the leader's consent, he put a protective shield on him, and took him and the captain to teleport again to that distant yellow supply planet, to demonstrate all kinds of abilities...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao took the leader away, the guards around the leader were dumbfounded: Where was the leader they were protecting?</p><p></p><p>Soon the human absolute administrative center 'Hope Auditorium' went into lockdown.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to mobilize troops to seal off and search, they found the leader had returned, his face full of shock - the first time the guards had seen the leader with such an expression.</p><p></p><p>The guard captain glared menacingly at Su Hao and the captain, demanding to know what had happened, but was stopped by the leader: "Just treat what happened earlier as if it didn't occur, lift the alert immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>A long time later.</p><p></p><p>Leader Xia Qingjun recovered his composure and asked Su Hao seriously: "Let me ask you this, can 'teleportation technology' really be achieved mechanically?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Whether it can be achieved or not is worth trying. As long as you fully cooperate with my work, it can be realized within ten years at most. Just like the 'superpowers' I summarized before."</p><p></p><p>Leader Xia Qingjun said: "What kind of cooperation is needed?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "My current knowledge is far from enough. What I need most is to study while researching. The initial focus is to learn all kinds of knowledge, such as curvature engine technology, ultra-long-distance communication technology, various mechanical manufacturing technologies, etc..."</p><p></p><p>Leader Xia Qingjun pondered for a long time, fiddling with the cup in his hand.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he stood up and said: "This can be done, but there's no need to join the research institute. We'll set up a new research project!</p><p></p><p>Let me think, let me think."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "It's simple, I have an ability called 'Small World' that can completely seal off a space. Any research done inside won't leak out, even the Compound Eye Race can't probe it. How about carrying out the 'Teleportation Research Project' inside it?"</p><p></p><p>The leader and captain were dumbstruck again: Just how many abilities did this Xu Shiqiang have...</p><p></p><p>The leader frowned: "Small World? Where is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Anywhere, you can even put the Small World right here."</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao created a Small World in his palm, stuffing a huge nearby statue into it before the two's astonished eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In just one day, Su Hao successfully persuaded the human authority figure, initially reaching cooperation.</p><p></p><p>The leader fully supported Su Hao's learning and research, while Su Hao would deliver 'teleportation technology' in ten years.</p><p></p><p>As for using force to coerce both sides into cooperating, that method wasn't used. For rational people, force is not for destruction, but for achieving political goals. When there is no absolute political conflict between the two sides, the use of force to achieve goals is generally not considered.</p><p></p><p>The leader acted quickly.</p><p></p><p>The originally year-end commendation ceremony was grandly held 15 days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's military rank reward was changed from lieutenant to captain, said to be the largest promotion span in history for a naval officer.</p><p></p><p>Another 15 days later, various top-secret human data was secretly delivered into the Small World via a transit planet for Su Hao to browse.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the design drawings for various machinery Su Hao needed were handed over by the captain to different manufacturers to produce and then delivered into the Small World via transit planets.</p><p></p><p>To the leader and captain, this was a top-secret human project known to less than ten people directly involved.</p><p></p><p>And the captain became the communication hub between Su Hao and various departments, responsible for meeting all of Su Hao's needs. The captain's status and authority were correspondingly elevated.</p><p></p><p>During this period before the Small World's lab and workshop were fully set up, Su Hao stayed inside browsing all kinds of human data, including history, culture, military, society, science and technology, and the four Cloud Ring races.</p><p></p><p>At Su Hao's request, the captain almost moved the entire electronic library recorded by the Commonwealth organization into the Small World, including various top-secret data from the research institute, all opened for Su Hao to browse freely.</p><p></p><p>That day, the captain rushed into the Small World: "Great One, can you manage alone? Or should I help you select some assistants from the research institute to aid your research?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "Not needed for now, I'm in the learning phase. If needed, I'll let you know. Oh, do you have any death row inmates around 20 years old? If convenient, send two in for me, I have great use for them."</p><p></p><p>The captain wondered: "Death row inmates?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "I'll use them for some modification experiments. If the modifications succeed, my assistants may appear."</p><p></p><p>"Human body modifications? Okay, I'll pick some for you."</p><p></p><p>As far as the captain was concerned, as long as Su Hao could produce results, he was willing to meet Su Hao's requests that didn't harm his own interests.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "Oh, there are many special symbols in the data without corresponding annotations, making it very inefficient for me to read. So I need researchers to help explain them to me."</p><p></p><p>After browsing a large amount of scientific research data, he discovered a problem - the data was complete, but he didn't necessarily understand it all.</p><p></p><p>The main difficulty wasn't the logic, but the many formulas and symbols whose meanings were unknown.</p><p></p><p>The captain said: "I've already arranged that. Whenever you have time, you can immediately join the research institute as an intern researcher to learn and research. I've already notified them, there will be dedicated mentors to guide you."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "If that's the case, then next month! I'll spend this time thoroughly reading through all the data I can understand first."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later, the captain delivered two unconscious young men around 20 years old, with shaved heads and prisoner uniforms.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't care what crimes they had committed, only knowing that now he could awaken Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>He first recorded their consciousness information into the Bouncing Ball space, then erased it, successively implanting Yashan and Fengcheng's consciousness information into the two bodies using himself as a bridge.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he withdrew his hand and entered the Bouncing Ball space to observe.</p><p></p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief and exited, quietly waiting for the two to awaken.</p><p></p><p>After a while with no signs of them waking up, he couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>After checking, he found the two bodies were affected by anesthetics and wouldn't wake up for a while.</p><p></p><p>He extended a finger and two golden beams shot out, entering their bodies and purging all residual drugs.</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, Yashan and Fengcheng suddenly opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng sprang up, laughing loudly: "Haha! My hand is so hot this time, I'll definitely win! I'll be the landlord!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "You're even grabbing Old Master Wei's landlord?"</p><p></p><p>Then the two looked at each other, seeing unfamiliar ugly bald faces in prisoner uniforms.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p>"Shit!"</p><p></p><p>Every day I think about adding more chapters for you all, but I have my own work and simply can't put in more effort! Maintaining three updates a day is already my limit! Waaah!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 912</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Fifty years later.</p><p></p><p>Suhao received a message from Xiaokuang, so he put down his work and teleported to the transformed planets to investigate the situation of the first batch of dimensional travelers he had sent there originally.</p><p></p><p>Originally there were two hundred dimensional travelers. Fifty years ago when Suhao went to count them, there were eighty left. Now when he went to check again, only fifty remained.</p><p></p><p>However, these dimensional travelers were much tougher than Suhao had expected. He originally thought that having twenty left would already be very good.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "Since you all have persisted for fifty years, then I will follow my original idea and have Yashan take you as disciples. Of course, whether you can catch Yashan's eye is up to you."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he found Yashan and said directly: "Yashan, when I originally sent the first batch of two hundred dimensional travelers to the transformed planets, after nearly a hundred years, there are still fifty survivors. These people who have managed to survive until now must have some unique qualities - perhaps they are some rare talents. You should go tour those transformed planets. If you think these fifty people are promising enough to catch your eye as potential disciples, then take them under your wing and impart some knowledge to guide them onto the true path of cultivation to supplement our limited manpower."</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Yashan replied: "Leave it to me, Old Master. At most it will take a hundred years, and you will gain a few dozen reliable and capable talents!"</p><p></p><p>Afraid that Yashan might indiscriminately recruit just to increase numbers and cause internal conflicts, Suhao coughed and said: "Yashan, I'm just making a suggestion. You need to carefully consider whether to accept those people or not. Natural talent is not the most important factor - their character is key. After all, we can't cultivate people who are greedy for small gains and lack gratitude, causing us troubles. What I fear most are those who smile at you like buddies when they benefit, but immediately turn against you if their small interests are harmed.</p><p></p><p>There is never a shortage of talents. What we lack are people who will brave any danger to follow us."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "I understand, Old Master. I will be careful in my selection and not let undesirable people slip through."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Suhao say: "Okay, you can go!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yashan arrived in outer space of the first elf transformed planet and observed with his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Actually, even without Suhao's reminder, he knew he had to examine their characters before accepting disciples. For him, he would rather have fewer people and work harder himself than allow those with unclear intentions to get close to the Old Master. The future was too distant, the time too long - if anything happened, the consequences would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>The best time to observe a person's character is when they are still very weak. Once they grow stronger, it becomes much harder to judge.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying scenario is having people with ill intentions follow you for millions or billions of years...the longer they follow, the more horrific the consequences if something goes wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Accepting disciples, especially the first official batch, requires great caution!"</p><p></p><p>As for future second or third generation disciples, Yashan did not dwell on it too much.</p><p></p><p>After finalizing his plan, he flashed onto the planet's surface and walked openly through the forest city towards the dimensional traveler.</p><p></p><p>This was the elf world, and the dimensional traveler elf king was meditating.</p><p></p><p>Over the decades, he had evolved into a Level 7 Abnormal "Silkworm" based on the local environment.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he had also cultivated the "Immortal Cultivation" and "Soul Power" systems he exchanged from the System, reaching the Yuan Ying Immortal level. His strength made him the most powerful being on the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>He was hailed as the greatest elf king by the elf race.</p><p></p><p>The elf king sensed something and abruptly opened his eyes, looking towards Yashan with pupils contracted to needle points, utterly shaken.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had been so shaken since arriving in this world, because he saw a human.</p><p></p><p>Were there humans in this world?</p><p></p><p>The answer was no - he had searched for decades across the entire world and only found the elf race, no humans.</p><p></p><p>But what did he see?</p><p></p><p>Was it a dream?</p><p></p><p>There really was a human walking towards him, and that person seemed to be smiling at him.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? Who could it be?</p><p></p><p>The elf king had a premonition that his life would undergo a huge change today.</p><p></p><p>What should he do? What should he do? What should he do...</p><p></p><p>Those three words kept repeating in the elf king's mind. His brilliant brain that had trained for nearly a century had become so dull that it could not even formulate a simple plan.</p><p></p><p>The power he had cultivated for nearly a century was of no help to his current situation.</p><p></p><p>The human kept getting closer, but the elf king was like a dazed fool...</p><p></p><p>Finally, the three repeating words in his mind changed, and various thoughts flashed through: "Friend or foe? Should I unleash my full power and charge recklessly? No, I may be unmatched, but I'm not invincible. So I'll be timid. A real man can be flexible. Moreover, I'm just a tiny elf."</p><p></p><p>The moment his eyes met Yashan's, the elf king suddenly ran forward, kneeled down sliding, and deeply kowtowed: "This little one, the elf Wali, greets the great immortal. Wishing the great immortal an eternally blessed life full of heavenly fortune!"</p><p></p><p>With that single kowtow, the noble elf king aura he had cultivated for nearly a century vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "......"</p><p></p><p>It seemed the words he had prepared were completely useless now.</p><p></p><p>That's right, what was he going to say earlier?</p><p></p><p>Yashan couldn't help but laugh: "Wali, how did you know I'm an immortal? What if you misidentified me? Or what if I came to kill you?"</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali saw the great immortal was in a good mood, so he laughed and said: "Great Immortal, you jest. With your bearing and appearance, emanating immortal aura pervading the heavens and earth, if I still misidentified you, then these eyes of mine should be gouged out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I'm just a tiny elf. How could I catch the great immortal's divine attention to personally come kill me? If the great immortal wishes to kill me, please do so. I won't even blink an eye."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "My name is Jia Yashan. You have lived in this world for nearly a century and passed the basic test. Now I'll ask you a question - are you willing to leave this world?"</p><p></p><p>This didn't even require a choice - the opportunity was right in front of him!</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali kowtowed deeply again: "This little one Wali is willing. Please take me away, great immortal! This world is good, but no longer needs me. I wish to follow the great immortal and leave, to find a new place that needs me."</p><p></p><p>As Yashan observed the elf king, the more he looked, the more he liked what he saw. He thought: "Not bad for a talent born from the simulated Zhuhuo Human Planet I created. He has some good qualities."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "Since that's the case, you can call me Master and follow me to learn for a period of time!"</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali was overjoyed, tears of happiness welling in his eyes: "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan gave Wali the label: "Intellect: Excellent."</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked: "In this world, is there anything else you need to do? I can give you some time."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali immediately replied: "Please allow your student to bid farewell to my wives."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali left for a while and soon returned: "Master, I still have lingering attachments to this world, but no regrets."</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded and casually cast a spell on the elf king Wali.</p><p></p><p>"Teleport!"</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali's eyes widened in shock. This...was not the planet of the elf race.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to the Yuan Ying realm, he had flown into space and looked down on his elf planet, which he recognized.</p><p></p><p>So this must be another world.</p><p></p><p>Yashan did not explain anything and only observed the dimensional traveler beast king on this planet with his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Although the elf king Wali was full of confusion, he did not say anything and waited quietly on the side. He believed that his master would tell him - as long as he followed his master and studied diligently, he would come to understand everything.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Yashan flashed and arrived on the planet's surface, heading straight for the beast king of this world.</p><p></p><p>The elf king Wali excitedly followed behind step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, beast roars could be heard: "Roar - Attack me with your full power, did you not drink milk as babies?"</p><p></p><p>"Come at me together, all of you, the so-called strongest warriors of the Great David Dynasty. Is this the extent of your strength?"</p><p></p><p>"Useless, all useless trash. You can't even let me have some fun!"</p><p></p><p>"This world is so weak and boring, so boring!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the beast king sensed Yashan and the elf king's presence and turned his bloodshot eyes towards them, filled with ferocious brutality.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Who's there? Can you let me have some fun?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed: "Wali, go meet him!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom -"</p><p>"Pow pow pow -" </p><p>"Ahhhh -"</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the redness left the beast king's eyes as he knelt before Yashan with an awkward smile, kowtowing: "This little beast greets the great immortal. You made me wait so painfully!"</p>

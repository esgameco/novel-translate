        <h1>Chapter 861</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very satisfied with the gods' frenzied pursuit of points.</p><p></p><p>This gave him confidence in the various games he had designed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it spawned more ideas, such as launching various cool "divine avatars" in the points mall, making various special "source devices" for the gods to redeem, and even designing a "storage space" that could be bound to the Ten-Colored Plates for those who had nowhere to store their belongings, allowing them to keep their beloved items...</p><p></p><p>"It seems very interesting. With my knowledge and these virtual 'points', I can guide many people to work for me spontaneously, to explore more of the unknown for me. I can continue to optimize this points mall system and launch more products until it is all-encompassing..."</p><p></p><p>The ideal state is that if any dog wants to redeem a piping hot something with points, the system can exchange a source for it.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Suhao would not have dared to play like this. In order to ensure absolute safety within the pinball space, he could not have recorded too much consciousness information there.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different. The secret of soulforce is about to be cracked, and he will soon gain eternal life, freeing himself from the long sleep state and ensuring the pinball space is always under his surveillance.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, as long as he watches over it, he can quickly deal with any accident that occurs in the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, recording some consciousness information in the pinball space is no longer as objectionable as before.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to send the gods to explore the newborn red giant star..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao took some time to check the current status of the gods and found that they were all squatting on the red dwarf star, waiting for the mission to begin.</p><p></p><p>So he directly transported himself to the gods' side and said, "Gods, long time no see, you're still in great shape. Without further ado, I'll send you to the mission location now. I wish you a successful mission."</p><p></p><p>With that, he sent each of the gods through the "Galactic Network" to their designated locations.</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Suhao controlled his avatar to return to the small world.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but frown again, pondering a problem: "The issue of transportation...now that I have to transport eighteen gods to different places, it's very troublesome for me to transport them one by one. According to my plan, in the future I'll need to simultaneously transport hundreds or thousands of people from different places to different locations. Won't I need multiple avatars running back and forth?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to bring the scattered gods back together after they complete their missions, I'll have to make another trip myself...</p><p></p><p>This method of transportation is too troublesome, and it looks very low-class. So, is there a way for me to stay in the small world without going out and complete all the transportations remotely?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, he could come and go freely without needing to dispatch "professional staff". Only now did he realize that his transportation skills were still limited and he could not remotely transport specific people and objects within the "Galactic Network".</p><p></p><p>"I'll take advantage of these gods exploring to study how to complete transportation tasks without appearing in person."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Suhao took out two positioning stones and placed them at opposite ends of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a source bead. With a thought, the source bead disappeared from his hand and appeared next to one positioning stone. With another blink, the source bead suddenly vanished and reappeared next to the other positioning stone.</p><p></p><p>"I can transport objects to places with positioning stones. I can also transport objects next to one positioning stone to the location of another positioning stone. In other words, it's not difficult to remotely transport people or objects without appearing in person.</p><p></p><p>There are just three conditions:</p><p></p><p>First, I need to be able to see the current location and state of the object being transported. This is simple - I just need to arrange a mini-me to control a 'divine' avatar that is always connected to the 'Galactic Network' to observe everything.</p><p></p><p>Second...oh wait, there is no second condition.</p><p></p><p>Third, there needs to be a positioning stone at the destination. For example, if I want to transport a god to a red giant star in another galaxy, I need to pre-bury a positioning stone near the red giant star. But in reality, I can't pre-bury positioning stones everywhere. This is easy to solve - for transporting to areas without positioning stones, I can use the 'Galactic Network' transportation.</p><p></p><p>So it seems there's no problem transporting people or objects outward.</p><p></p><p>But how can I recall the transported people or objects at any time? Their activity range may not have corresponding positioning stones..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered, and his eyes lit up: "If I make the people or objects that need to be transported into 'positioning stones', wouldn't this problem be solved?</p><p></p><p>If I make a person into a positioning stone, I wouldn't even need a designated 'transmission point' - I could transport and recall them at will.</p><p></p><p>For example, if I create an exclusive 'gods' small world' for the gods, and make the gods into positioning stones, then no matter where the gods go, with just a thought I could recall them back to the small world.</p><p></p><p>And with another thought, I could transport them through the 'Galactic Network' to any observable location."</p><p></p><p>After figuring out all the key points, Suhao couldn't help but get a little excited. This meant he had developed new skills on top of his existing knowledge system.</p><p></p><p>"So, the question is, how do I make a person, or a god, into a positioning stone?"</p><p></p><p>A positioning stone sounds grand, but essentially it's just an object containing a wisp of Suhao's spatial spiritual feelers.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely this wisp of spiritual feelers that allows Suhao to accurately find the designated location in the 'Infinite Spatial Vision' and achieve instant transmission.</p><p></p><p>To make a person into a positioning stone is essentially to plant a wisp of his spiritual feelers into that person's body and keep it there permanently.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't tried making a living being into a positioning stone yet, so let me give it a try."</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, a former pirate appeared before Suhao, staring at him blankly, clearly bewildered by the sudden situation. The pirate quickly reacted and knelt down: "Greetings to the great divine majesty."</p><p></p><p>This was a pirate that Suhao had recorded on the Celestial Highway...</p><p></p><p>Suhao's various experiments sometimes required using them, so he had not released the pirates. Instead, he built a complete "game paradise" for them in the small world, allowing them to indulge themselves so they wouldn't go insane from boredom.</p><p></p><p>Now they seemed to be in good spirits.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the pirate was extremely flustered at the moment. In the "Divine Paradise", there was always a legend circulating: every so often, a "lucky star" would be summoned to meet the true god. After a brief bewilderment, he would understand that today he had become the "lucky star" summoned by the true god.</p><p></p><p>Of course, everyone surviving in the "Divine Paradise" hoped to become a "lucky star" in their lifetime, but being a lucky star was not always a good thing. Some lucky stars described the true god they met as terribly frightening after returning to the "Divine Paradise", or said they had been assigned bizarre tasks by the true god.</p><p></p><p>Some "lucky stars" even disappeared after meeting the true god. Whether they had escaped their cage to true freedom or something else had happened, the others did not know.</p><p></p><p>Now this "lucky star" pirate was trembling in fear, accepting his fate.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stroked his chin, contemplating for a moment, then placed his hand on the pirate's forehead. A spiritual feeler was separated and inserted into the pirate's skull, sealed in place with a special technique.</p><p></p><p>Then he closed his eyes, carefully sensing, and after a moment frowned: "Bone is not a good medium for spiritual feelers and cannot preserve them for hundreds of years like special positioning stones. And there is no part of the human body suitable for carrying spiritual feelers."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Suhao's eyes suddenly lit up: "I remember there is a fluid form of 'positioning stone'. I can make this fluid form into a special mark and implant it directly into the human body."</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened his palm and quickly transformed a small blob of purple fluid substance using source energy.</p><p></p><p>This was a special substance he had accidentally discovered while exploring the universe in his previous life. It had excellent spiritual feeler carrying capacity, on par with positioning stones. It was just in fluid form, which he hadn't used much, but now it came in handy.</p><p></p><p>Another spiritual feeler was separated and merged into the purple fluid, temporarily residing within it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao sensed for a moment, revealing a slight smile, murmuring: "It works, very stable!"</p><p></p><p>He turned to examine the pirate before him: "So where should I implant it?"</p><p></p><p>The pirate indicated he was terrified and couldn't bear Suhao's burning gaze, but he dared not move: "The rumors were true, the true god is too frightening. When can I return to the Divine Paradise? I want to go home!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao eventually fixed his gaze on the pirate's brow: "That bare forehead looks too plain. I'll engrave it in this spot!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, the purple fluid in his palm transformed into a small snake that, to the pirate's horrified gaze, burrowed into his brow, permeating into his celestial spirit gate. Two concentric purple circles then appeared in the center of his brow, like a "hui" character tattoo.</p><p></p><p>"That looks better. Let's call this ring-shaped mark the 'Double Halo Imprint'."</p>

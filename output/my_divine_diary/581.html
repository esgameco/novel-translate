        <h1>Chapter 581</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The boisterous laughter of Grand Master Lada echoed far from the headquarters building, causing those who heard it to turn their heads involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>To him, it was indeed laughable that a bunch of youngsters whose hair had barely grown in would run up to him and shamelessly claim to have found the location of the thieves who stole from the artifact repository, pointing to a small island and saying that's where they were hiding.</p><p></p><p>How could that not be laughable?</p><p></p><p>Think about how many professional teams of source mages he had dispatched to investigate this case? Yet they had found not a single clue. But these few fresh-faced lads had silently discovered the location of the artifacts.</p><p></p><p>However, let him laugh for a little while longer.</p><p></p><p>Feiyu frowned and said, "Does the Grand Master not believe us?"</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada laughed, "Believe? How could I not believe? I'm very interested to know how you obtained this information. Tell me, and if you're going to say something like 'I had a feeling', then don't bother, just jump out the window yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu said, "First, the reason we believe the thief is the 'Scraping Earth Armor': Two years ago, our squad took over the investigation into the Sage of No Origin. By chance, we found the previous hiding place of the Scraping Earth Armor..."</p><p></p><p>He opened up a map and pointed to a small island, "It was here, but now this island has disappeared, an entire island has been moved!"</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada's brow twitched, his face full of an 'I'll humor you' expression, but he didn't interrupt Feiyu's explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Originally we didn't connect the disappearance of the island to the Scraping Earth Armor, but soon after, the artifact repository at headquarters was emptied out, which made me think of the case of the disappearance of the Evergreen Factory in Huchang City seven years ago. These three incidents share a common characteristic - the ability to silently move massive objects.</p><p></p><p>That Scraping Earth Armor, I suspect, is a sinister source mage who has mastered the ability of spatial transference. To verify this, I obtained authorization from the Association and spent half a year thoroughly searching through nearly all the archived materials collected by the Association.</p><p></p><p>In the end, I found that there were only three who could do this: one was the Scraping Earth Armor, one was the 'Arbitrary Door' artifact numbered first row, thirty-seventh in the Association's collection.</p><p></p><p>The last was the bizarre disaster three years ago named the 'Labyrinth World', which was eventually resolved by the Lucky Star squad, but the artifact was lost - reportedly displaced to an unknown location by its own spatial properties after resolving the disaster.</p><p></p><p>Considering all three, the Scraping Earth Armor has the highest probability of being the active thief."</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada's casual smile faded, "Interesting, go on!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu continued, "Second, my reasoning for the Scraping Earth Armor being a member of the Radiant Society: The most obvious is the Radiant Society's extremely powerful mobility, appearing and disappearing without a trace! In my view, this clearly isn't just them running fast, but using spatial transference abilities.</p><p></p><p>As I mentioned before, among the information I know, the only ones capable of this are the Arbitrary Door and the Scraping Earth Armor, and the Arbitrary Door is in the Scraping Earth Armor's possession.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, while browsing many classified materials about the royal families, I happened to see a record from a woman imprisoned in the Duke of Luo's manor, describing seeing a tall crystalline armored giant enter the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those women were 'suicided' to silence them, but based on the description, it matches the Scraping Earth Armor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, over three years ago, it wasn't just the Crown Prince who was killed - another overlooked figure was the Duke of Luo, who vanished after leaving a place called Huaishui Town. This is another matter, so I won't go into it here.</p><p></p><p>But from this, we can see that the Scraping Earth Armor has an extremely deep conflict with the royal family, and acts with the same goals as the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>In summary, there is over a 50% chance that the Scraping Earth Armor is a member of the Radiant Society!"</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada frowned, "How did you get access to view those materials?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu calmly replied, "It's simple, you are the most powerful person in the Horizontal Province. I claimed to be your illegitimate son and forged a lot of 'evidence', so I was granted viewing access."</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!" Grand Master Lada suddenly spat out in shock. Out of nowhere he had an illegitimate son, he almost couldn't catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>Now that Feiyu mentioned it, he did notice they both had curly hair...</p><p></p><p>Feiyu said, "This was just a means to an end. I checked the code of conduct for source mages and the laws of the United Association beforehand - this counts as an improper operation but not illegal, so you don't need to worry.</p><p></p><p>But that's not the main point. The point is, I found sufficient grounds to infer that the Scraping Earth Armor is a member of the Radiant Society."</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada's expression stiffened as he watched this curly-haired lad speak so confidently. He forcibly suppressed the urge to punch him away, taking a long drag from his pipe and exhaling slowly. Through gritted teeth he said, "Anything else? How do you know the artifact is on this island?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu showed no signs of backing down from Lada's increasingly ugly expression. Instead, he smiled confidently, "The last part, about the artifact's location and the Scraping Earth Armor's hiding place, is what took me the longest to confirm.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master, in the ceremonial hall of every municipal mage association, there is a machine that can locate all kinds of disasters, called the 'Disaster Equilibrium Device', correct?</p><p></p><p>After operating that machine, I discovered its true function..."</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada cut him off, "Let me guess, by borrowing it under the guise of being my son?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu nodded, "Of course, you're as perceptive as the Grand Master should be. As soon as I said I was your son, they believed me!"</p><p></p><p>Lada almost bit through his pipe, his teeth making a grating sound.</p><p></p><p>Feiyu continued, "But that's not the main point. The point is, I was able to use the Disaster Equilibrium Device's operation to calculate the location of that pile of artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Lada said skeptically, "I'm more familiar with that thing than you are. It's just for determining the location of disasters, not much use. How did you calculate the location from it?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu explained, "It's simple! From the materials, I learned that the machine also reacts to artifacts. I guessed that over two thousand artifacts concentrated together would definitely interfere with the Disaster Equilibrium Device's operation, and my subsequent tests proved this.</p><p></p><p>So I excluded all the disaster interference effects on the equilibrium device and found that one subtle disturbance. Then I went to every city with an equilibrium device, recording the corresponding disturbance data, and used trilateration to identify 105 possible locations.</p><p></p><p>After eliminating them one by one, I locked onto this island. So I'm certain that pile of artifacts is here."</p><p></p><p>Lada slammed his hand down, smashing the table, "You little bastard! Even if you were my son, you can't just run wild like this!"</p><p></p><p>Xianli and the other teammates jumped in fright, almost huddling together.</p><p></p><p>But Feiyu calmly took out a piece of paper, "This is the 'proof' I forged of being your son. If the Grand Master doesn't want to use it, then I won't use it again in the future."</p><p></p><p>Lada snatched the crumpled paper and tore it up without looking at it.</p><p></p><p>Feiyu thought to himself, "I can just forge another one."</p><p></p><p>But instead, Lada bellowed, "What's the need to forge it? Tomorrow I'll publicly announce that you're my godson, then you can do whatever you want!"</p><p></p><p>Xianli, Feiyu and the others were dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>What the heck? Something he had just made up for convenience had somehow become real, with Lada randomly acknowledging him as his son?</p><p></p><p>Lada had no children, but the more he looked at this kid Feiyu, the more he liked him. Since the "father" rumor had already spread everywhere, he might as well acknowledge him! It was just a godson anyway, no big deal!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Lada stood up, tightening his windbreaker as he stared at Feiyu, "Godson! What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyu's face reddened in rare embarrassment as he stammered, "I...I'm called Feiyu!"</p><p></p><p>Xianli and the other teammates' jaws dropped in astonishment. What was this move? What was this speed? What was this development?</p><p></p><p>This son acknowledgment was way too rash!</p><p></p><p>Feiyu's reddened face betrayed the uncharacteristic flustered state of the normally composed young man. He had envisioned many possibilities before coming here, but never imagined getting acknowledged as a godson.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't forget his purpose for coming, "What do you plan to do next? Go directly to that island and take back the artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>Lada revealed a vicious grin, "Of course we'll take them back, and do it in broad daylight! I'll personally make the Radiant Society crumble, force them to obediently deliver the artifacts back to me. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Lada laughed wildly, slowly clenching his fists with cracking sounds, "No matter who it is, anyone who dares steal from me is dead for sure! I originally planned to let the Radiant Society torment those royal remnants for a few more years, to shut them up for a while. But now they've provoked me, so I'll go kill them all right now!"</p><p></p><p>Xianli and the others huddled together, cowed by Lada's imposing aura yet never doubting his ability to make good on his words.</p><p></p><p>Because in their legends, Grand Master Lada was almost the strongest man alive!</p><p></p><p>Even that most outrageous 'Scraping Earth Armor'!</p>

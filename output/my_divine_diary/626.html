        <h1>Chapter 626</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A period of casual conversation with the Wabi Mage made Su Hao feel a lot of emotions.</p><p></p><p>In reality, there were many people who liked knowledge, and there were many people who liked to explore the unknown, but limited by their lifespan and energy, not everyone could pursue knowledge as they wished.</p><p></p><p>Just as with the mage, in this world, he was counted as one of the most learned people, and also had a strong enough desire for knowledge.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the new things that Su Hao had revealed, the desire to explore infinitely welled up in his heart, but unfortunately, he was already old, and his strong curiosity couldn't withstand the erosion of the years, and he completely lost the battle.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the helplessness of intelligent life!</p><p></p><p>Although he now has a few thousand years of life, but the time scale will be stretched, it does not necessarily have much longevity, time one minute by one second, will eventually usher in the end of the moment.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao walked out of Fort He, Feng Cheng also happened to finish today's lesson, he obviously also sensed that Su Hao was in Xinji City, and couldn't help but send a message to Su Hao, "Boss Wei, you also came to Xinji City?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao directly teleported to Feng Cheng's side, and without avoiding the students around him, he directly asked, "I just finished a new research, so I came out to take a walk, and by the way, I came to see how your astronomy team is progressing."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng heatedly laughed, "This is already the third batch of students, the first two batches of students have already entered into monitoring the starry sky, however, the current conditions of the facilities and equipment limit the mass production of astronomical monitoring equipment. In another five years, we will know every move in this star system like the back of our hand."</p><p></p><p>This task was arranged for Feng Cheng five years ago, in another five years, that is, ten years, ten years to build an astronomical team from scratch was actually not a slow speed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Can we start monitoring the operation of the star system now?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Already started monitoring, I have built teleportation arrays and 'watchtowers' on those hundreds of satellites, I have arranged for students to go up to the watchtowers every month to observe the dynamics of the stellar system, for example, now that kid Feiyuan is now collecting data on the 107th satellite.</p><p></p><p>Only just started, only measured the orbit of the orbiting planets and larger asteroids, more asteroids have not yet been included in the monitoring system.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no anomalies have been detected on any of the planets currently being monitored."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Feng Cheng handed over the corresponding data to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao roughly checked it and did a comparison before and after, and indeed, as Feng Cheng said, he did not find any abnormalities, he handed the data back to Feng Cheng and said, "You guys continue to monitor it! Once there are any abnormal movements, notify me at the first time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Okay Boss Wei, don't worry and leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao left New Era City and personally flew into space, standing on top of a satellite, locking onto the individual planets with the far-seeing rune and building a model of a star system in pinball space based on Feng Cheng's data, observing for another full day.</p><p></p><p>The results showed no anomalies.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and secretly calculated the time, "Perhaps the 'Doom System' on his body hasn't been activated yet. I came to this world nearly twenty years ago, and based on the calculation of one hundred years, there is still eighty years before the asteroid arrives! In other words, it's highly likely that it hasn't been activated yet, or it's only in the early stages of activation! I, on the other hand, don't have to rush.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that my perception ability is too weak to perceive the operation of the various energies in the majestic universe, and although I guessed the logic of the 'Doom System's' operation, I have no way to intervene."</p><p></p><p>As long as he found the trajectory of the universe's energy operation, Su Hao believed that there must be a way to transfer this 'Focus of Doom' of his own to other places, such as a certain meteorite in the universe.</p><p></p><p>It was also often referred to as 'avoiding the calamity', or 'substitution'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, "We have to think of a way to accurately calculate the method of energy operation in a situation where spiritual power cannot be perceived."</p><p></p><p>To say that it's not difficult, it mainly depends on how the idea is, just like forecasting the weather forecast in general ......</p><p></p><p>However, there was no hurry for a while, there were still eighty years, relatively generous in time.</p><p></p><p>There is one thing that Su Hao is very worried about: if this disaster is not a meteorite impact?</p><p></p><p>Would the calamity in this life be the same as the last?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao himself was not sure.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't a meteorite impact, then what would it be?</p><p></p><p>When he had asked Feng Cheng earlier, he had hoped that Feng Cheng would answer that there was an anomaly!</p><p></p><p>One day, when all kinds of calamities saw him, they would have to obediently kneel down and shout 'Boss Wei'!</p><p></p><p>Again, he entered into the measurement and attempted experimentation of the various data of the source-turned 'compounds'.</p><p></p><p>"Finish the research on the compounds and mixtures as soon as possible, freeing up time to try and find a way to destroy the planet! Once that's done, find a way to gather the laws of the universe's energy operation with myself as the focal point ......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ten years pass in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The outside world had changed drastically, and the small world of the base was the same as it always was, except that the big dog that had been lying on the No. 1 laboratory, accompanying Su Hao, had died of old age.</p><p></p><p>At the end of his life, the big dog unleashed its skills on Su Hao, and Su Hao couldn't help but reach out and put his foot on top of the big dog's head, which was the last moment of its life, the interaction between it and its master.</p><p></p><p>After the big dog died, Su Hao burned its body into ashes and casually floated it above the sea to return to nature.</p><p></p><p>And suddenly one day, Feng Cheng sent a message in the group, "Two bosses, and mage that old man left, I heard that before he left, he kept muttering that he wanted to worship Boss Wei as his master! Tomorrow mage association to give that old man send off, two bosses go?"</p><p></p><p>A while later, Su Hao returned, "People die and lights go out, everything turns into nothingness, I won't go!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan also replied back, "Feng Cheng, you're always on the go, represent us to go on the flowers!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The next day, Feng Cheng appeared in Shinki City, walked into Master Kazuma's spiritual hall, sent three flowers, and then left silently.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, life, old age, sickness and death, Feng Cheng had also seen a lot, and did not have too much profound experience in his heart, these three flowers were purely for the sake of friendship with Venerable Master Wo for so many years, and to give him a ride.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feng Cheng has not yet experienced the feeling of aging, the last life to death are maintained at the peak of the state.</p><p></p><p>He was incapable of understanding the kind of despair and helplessness a person would feel about growing old, and then dying.</p><p></p><p>The position of 'Wo Mage' of the Mage Association was designated by the previous Wo Mage, and was held by the General President of Radha!</p><p></p><p>Of course, many speculated that it had something to do with Javi.</p><p></p><p>Because it was said that General President Radha had been amongst Javi's base, furthering his education for two years, and had gained guidance from Mr. Javi, and was bound to be able to lead the Mage Association farther ......</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was no one who openly stood out against it, after all, there was also no one who dared to say the word 'no' in front of Radha!</p><p></p><p>After Mr. Wo's departure, there were not many mages who could beat Radha!</p><p></p><p>It could be said that other than Su Hao's three, he could be called the strongest person on the surface.</p><p></p><p>As for those emperors who were locked up and had been beaten up by Radha a few times back then, they had gotten approval to leave the base small world eight years ago, and returned to live in New Era City as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>After coming back, they realized that this world had long since ceased to be what it used to be, and too many changes had taken place that they could no longer see.</p><p></p><p>However, for the emperors, as long as the Zuo Le Immortal Palace was still open for business, they would be able to integrate into the world at their best, and there was no such thing as a world apart.</p><p></p><p>The emperors didn't think of getting into trouble either, they already understood that the era that belonged to them had already passed, and to be alive was already the greatest gift from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>For them, there was nothing wrong with just lying flat and enjoying life to the fullest!</p>

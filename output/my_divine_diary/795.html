        <h1>Chapter 795</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Should I go out now? Or stay in the eggshell for a few more days and take the opportunity to refine my blood essence?"</p><p></p><p>However, after some thought, Suhao quickly rejected this idea.</p><p></p><p>In the face of all these unknowns, it would be more advantageous to act according to the instincts of his species, at least he wouldn't encounter other unforeseen dangers.</p><p></p><p>When it was time to hatch from the egg, he should just hatch. If he delayed, there might be no meat left to eat.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two days, Suhao had carefully listened to the sounds around him and discovered that this was not the only dragon egg here, but one of three. The other two dragon eggs had already hatched successively in the past few days.</p><p></p><p>And there was only one adult dragon taking care of the dragon eggs.</p><p></p><p>In other words, being the last to hatch, he had become the youngest dragon sibling.</p><p></p><p>If he developed too slowly, he might be abandoned due to survival pressures.</p><p></p><p>After all, such things were not uncommon in nature.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao followed his instincts, using the small horns that had just emerged on his head to knock on the eggshell.</p><p></p><p>"Knock knock knock~"</p><p></p><p>One knock after another, he opened a long crack in the eggshell, then stretched his body forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The eggshell split apart along the long crack Suhao had made, eventually shattering completely into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>A huge gush of fresh air rushed into Suhao's lungs, making him feel invigorated, and he couldn't help but let out a soft cry.</p><p></p><p>"Woo--"</p><p></p><p>After the cry, Suhao evaluated his own voice: "Sounds a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>Suhao jumped out of the eggshell, his hind legs landing on the ground, his forelegs raised, his tail and neck arched high, his two fleshy wings spreading outwards forcefully, fanning...</p><p></p><p>A feeling of exceptional comfort spread through his whole body, just like stretching out after a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Thump--thump--"</p><p></p><p>Footsteps sounded.</p><p></p><p>A huge shadow enveloped Suhao. Suhao's golden vertical pupils looked up to see an enormous dragon lowering its head to gaze at him.</p><p></p><p>This giant dragon was about thirty meters long. Compared to Suhao, who was only a little over one meter long, it appeared immense.</p><p></p><p>Its body was covered in dense, thick scales that reflected a dim luster, as if forged from fine steel.</p><p></p><p>Its belly was a mix of gold and white, very dull, gradually turning redder towards the sides, the color deepening into a dark red, and finally becoming reddish-black on its back.</p><p></p><p>An enormous head loomed about seven or eight meters above, gazing down at Suhao. In addition to a pair of huge, sharp dragon horns on its head, there were also many bony spikes. Its huge mouth was slightly open, revealing rows of ferocious fangs, making it look extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>Yet Suhao could sense a feeling of joy from that huge, ferocious head.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this giant dragon was delighted by Suhao's birth.</p><p></p><p>This giant dragon was the mother dragon who had been incubating the dragon eggs all along.</p><p></p><p>"This giant dragon should be the parent of this body. Not only does it have no hostility towards me, but it will love and nurture me very much. While fulfilling its duty of raising me, it will also provide powerful protection.</p><p></p><p>With such a giant dragon protecting me, I shouldn't be in too much danger for a while, so I can focus on refining my blood essence and quickly recover my strength."</p><p></p><p>These were Suhao's thoughts upon seeing the giant dragon for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The hatchling instinctively placed complete trust in this giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Woo-la-ga-ji~"</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon slightly opened its mouth, making a series of rhythmic sounds from its throat, as if saying something to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't understand, so he pretended not to hear and just blinked his eyes, secretly observing the giant dragon and the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>This was a cave, with the floor and walls polished very neatly. The walls were inlaid with many gems that gave off a faint white glow, illuminating the stone chamber where Suhao was.</p><p></p><p>Under Suhao's feet was a soft bed made of cotton and animal fur, with some eggshell fragments still scattered on it.</p><p></p><p>One wall was hung with various ornaments - ferocious animal skulls, oddly shaped minerals, majestic dragon statues, shining swords and weapons, glittering armor...</p><p></p><p>Suhao's pupils contracted: "Wait, swords, armor? Aren't those human weapons? Why are there human weapons here?"</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo--"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two 'hatchling roars' came from the side. Suhao turned to see two hatchlings running in from outside the hatching chamber. They stopped in front of Suhao, eyes wide, curiously observing him.</p><p></p><p>These were the 'elder dragon brothers' Suhao had already sensed.</p><p></p><p>One hatchling was larger, with a strong, fresh red body and a white belly. A black streak like an airplane ran across its forehead, making it look small yet domineering - this must be Suhao's eldest dragon brother.</p><p></p><p>The other hatchling was slightly shorter, with a paler color and more slender build, though still more robust than Suhao. A small teardrop-shaped black mark was on its forehead, giving it a refined, youthful look - this was Suhao's second eldest dragon sibling, or rather, second eldest dragon sister.</p><p></p><p>These two hatchlings had emerged from their eggs just a few days earlier than Suhao, yet they were already a dragon head or two taller.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how rapidly dragon hatchlings grew.</p><p></p><p>However, both of these hatchlings seemed to have some marks of fighting on their bodies...</p><p></p><p>As Suhao tilted his head to observe the two hatchlings, the eldest brother suddenly opened his mouth and tried to bite him.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "???"</p><p></p><p>Was the eldest brother trying to assert his position in this family?</p><p></p><p>But that was too shameless - Suhao had just hatched and hadn't even had a chance to get used to his body yet!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of the giant dragon, this was just some roughhousing between the hatchling siblings to increase their affection for each other.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the eldest brother's ferocious open jaws, Suhao didn't think this was just playing.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao narrowed his eyes, anticipating the path of the eldest brother's bite. He tilted his head to the side, twisted his body, and lashed his tail up to whip the eldest brother hard on the back of the neck.</p><p></p><p>"Smack!"</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother's bite missed, and before he could steady himself to attack again, he felt a powerful blow to the back of his neck. His body lurched forward uncontrollably, and he barely managed to stabilize himself using all four paws and wings...</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother was utterly dumbfounded: "Who am I, what just happened?"</p><p></p><p>As for Suhao, after whipping the eldest brother with his tail, he felt a searing pain along its entire length.</p><p></p><p>He raised his tail to glance at it and saw it was covered in thick scales, with no abnormalities, putting his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>He had instinctively forgotten that he was a newborn and used a bit too much force.</p><p></p><p>After whipping the eldest brother aside with his tail, Suhao turned towards the second eldest sister, on guard against any surprise attacks from her.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to Suhao's expectations, the second sister did not attack him, but instead opened her eyes wide, looking at Suhao with a sparkling gaze.</p><p></p><p>She seemed very surprised that Suhao had knocked the eldest brother away.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the eldest brother shook his head and turned back towards Suhao, charging at him again.</p><p></p><p>His hide was tough and scaly, the scales on his body already quite hard. Suhao's whipping had merely thrown him off balance, without causing any significant injury or even pain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what had happened with that previous blow and didn't bother thinking too much about it.</p><p></p><p>His goal was simply to knock down this smaller hatchling in front of him and make it submit to his dominance. He didn't understand why, but instinctively felt that by defeating it, he would be able to get more food in the future.</p><p></p><p>He had already knocked down the other smaller one, and he believed defeating this even smaller hatchling would be easy.</p><p></p><p>"Howl--"</p><p></p><p>He let out a light howl, focusing even more intently as he charged at Suhao, opening his jaws to bite!</p><p></p><p>His teeth missed again - that small hatchling who had clearly been right in front of him had suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, something swept his feet out from under him, completely throwing him off balance. He tumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Thump!"</p><p></p><p>His belly and chin slammed into the floor, and he slid forward about a meter.</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother: "???"</p><p></p><p>Before he could get back up, a tender paw stepped onto his back.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 838</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After in-depth communication with Nati, the God of Heavenly Pillars, Suhao finally completely understood what the so-called 'deities' in this world were all about.</p><p></p><p>Simply put: A kind and benevolent alien life form accidentally came to the Crosstar and had its body seized and will imprisoned by the first person who discovered the great secret of the Baigal. Over the long years that followed, the Baigal family sent themselves one by one to the Crosstar, until the Baigal family members could no longer sense each other's pain.</p><p></p><p>Such a bizarre story could only happen in the summoner game that Yashan used to play, right?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the extremely kind-natured Baigal was destined to receive such unfair treatment.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "Can you locate the Baigal's home planet? Such an amazing planet, after so many years, you have no reason not to explore it."</p><p></p><p>Nati shook his head and said, "That's something only the Baigal can do, we deities cannot. We only occupy the outer shell of the Baigal's body, the core is still the Baigal itself. If we could find the location of the Baigal planet, we would have gone to find it long ago. You should know that every Baigal is a treasure that no one can refuse."</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Suhao temporarily gave up the idea of finding the Baigal's home planet, thinking to himself: "Going alone to search, it would take at least five or six years to search the entire galaxy, and the Baigal's planet may be different from ordinary life-bearing planets. If I just glanced over it the way I usually search for life-bearing planets, I could easily miss it.</p><p></p><p>So I'd better wait until Yashan and Fengcheng recover their strength, then have them carefully search for it! With my help setting up their external brains in advance, they should basically recover their strength in about a month and be able to enter the 'galactic network' to search for a special planet without much problem.</p><p></p><p>As for me, I'll first study this Ten-Colored Plate in my hands and preliminarily find out their characteristics."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao stretched out his hand and pressed it on Nati's main Ten-Colored Plate body, madly pouring his blood energy into the Ten-Colored Plate, trying to record it into his Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>Nati looked a bit panicked and said, "Lord Rean Oakes, what are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>He thought Suhao knew the Ten-Colored Plate's longevity ability and was trying to seize his Ten-Colored Plate.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Don't move, I'm just checking your body, I won't damage you, rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Nati felt the special energy gushing into his body, and suddenly remembered that when his dragon avatar was brought to this bizarre world, a similar force had invaded his body.</p><p></p><p>He guessed inwardly: "What kind of power is this? It has an extremely strong vitality...Could this be the life force of a flesh and blood being? Is this the force that gives Rean all kinds of bizarre and powerful abilities?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how violently Nati's thoughts were churning, soon Suhao not only recorded Nati's main Ten-Colored Plate body into his Pinball Space, but also successfully recorded Nati's consciousness information into the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>Suhao withdrew his blood energy and released his hand.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he said to Nati with some pleasure: "Nati, from now on act according to my instructions. Whatever I tell you to do, you do it, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Nati was very regretful that Suhao's blood energy did not linger longer, so he could better observe and analyze the characteristics of this energy. Hearing this, he nodded to indicate he understood, thinking inwardly: "Fully cooperate with his demands, lull him, then analyze him..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao began instructing Nati: "First, split off a sub-consciousness into your dragon avatar to control its movements."</p><p></p><p>Nati followed his words, splitting off a golden snake of light from the Ten-Colored Plate that burrowed into the dragon avatar's brain.</p><p></p><p>The dragon avatar stood up and said to Suhao: "What do you want me to do next?"</p><p></p><p>"Release two of your signature soul arts."</p><p></p><p>The dragon opened its mouth and spewed out a bright golden energy cannon.</p><p></p><p>It then flew high, flapping its wings while showering down a massive golden rain that pockmarked the ground with countless craters. It boasted proudly: "I can't fully demonstrate here, but with that golden rain I can cover a 20 kilometer radius, leaving nothing alive in its path."</p><p></p><p>While Nati was acting, Suhao's main attention was observing inside the Pinball Space. Hearing this, he casually responded: "Yeah, impressive. Nati, come, repeat that process again."  </p><p></p><p>Nati first recalled his sub-consciousness, then repeated the process described above.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Good, do it one more time."</p><p></p><p>Nati: "???"</p><p></p><p>He felt Suhao was just toying with him, but had no evidence or way to do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Xiya, the dragon messenger sent by Wanlei, the God of Thunderous Lightning to contact Nati, the God of Heavenly Pillars, returned.</p><p></p><p>Her expression was extremely ugly, her whole body lightly trembling in fear as she prostrated herself before Wanlei and said: "Respected Lord Wanlei, please forgive Xiya's failure. I was unable to complete the task you assigned me."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei said curiously: "Xiya, my beloved consort, there's no need to panic like this. Tell me, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Xiya said truthfully: "I searched the entire territory of the Golden Dragons north of the Dragon Continent, but could not find Lord Nati anywhere. Not only that, all of Nati's divine messengers have also disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>Normally, divine messengers or dragon messengers are the spokespersons for deities. As long as a messenger enters another deity's territory, the deity will immediately sense the messenger's aura and surely send out a messenger to receive and guide them.</p><p></p><p>It is extremely rare for a corresponding deity to be unable to be found, unless the two deities mutually detest each other to the point of refusing to meet.</p><p></p><p>But clearly, the relationship between the Black Dragons and Golden Dragons had not reached such a strained level where they would refuse to meet.</p><p></p><p>Wanlei thought: "Could that foolish Golden Dragon not be present? But no matter what, he should at least have an avatar constantly stationed in his own territory."</p><p></p><p>He then asked: "What about the Goddess of Beauty Fuler? Did you see her?"</p><p></p><p>Xiya nodded: "I saw her, but in our communication, the Goddess Fuler said she also did not know Lord Nati's whereabouts. Apparently he was still at the Golden Dragon Temple previously, holding an awakening ceremony for newborn Golden Dragons, but then disappeared without a trace afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei's brow gradually furrowed: "Just what is that foolish Golden Dragon up to? Could he be trying to collude with humans to play some new deity game? Hmph, the senseless fool doesn't know the stakes."</p><p></p><p>He slowly stood up, shaking off the surrounding female dragons, and headed outside.  </p><p></p><p>The female dragons cried out in surprise: "My lord, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Wanlei casually said: "I'm going to find that Golden Dragon myself and get to the bottom of this."</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he disappeared into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The originally harmonious female dragons instantly changed their expressions, coldly snorting at each other before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>Wanlei flew extremely fast, circling the entire Golden Dragon territory in just a few days' time. However, he could not find any trace of Nati, the God of Heavenly Pillars.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the petite Golden Dragon Goddess of Beauty Fuler flew up to Wanlei and curiously asked: "Lord Wanlei, why are you lingering in my Golden Dragon territory?"</p><p></p><p>Wanlei directly asked: "Fuler, where is your chief deity Nati? Why hasn't he come to greet me?"</p><p></p><p>Fuler shook her head: "I don't know about that, and it's none of my business."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei frowned and asked: "Have you heard about a new deity being born into the Golden Dragon clan? Supposedly this new deity has already returned to the Dragon Continent. Have you made any discoveries? Rest assured, if a new dragon deity is truly born, you and I belong to the same dragon race, so we must wholeheartedly protect him. Just tell me truthfully."</p><p></p><p>Fuler shook her head: "I did hear from human divine messengers about some 'Secret Deity', saying a female Golden Dragon brought three dragon hatchlings back to the Dragon Continent, and the Secret Deity is the husband of that female dragon, accompanying them back for protection.</p><p></p><p>I specifically looked into it, and there is indeed a female Golden Dragon named Shaduo Oakes who brought three hatchlings back. But her husband Muti Sak did not accompany them, instead mating with other female dragons to produce two more eggs. Though those two eggs were taken away by the enraged Shaduo Oakes.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called Secret Deity mentioned by humans, it may not actually exist."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Wanlei requested: "Fuler, take me to find that female dragon Shaduo Oakes who returned some time ago."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Goddess of Beauty Fuler hesitate, he added: "Rest assured, I won't do anything to them, after all they are of my dragon race. I'm just puzzled and want to ask Nati to clarify, as he must know something."</p><p></p><p>Fuler nodded: "Lord Wanlei, remember your words, do not harm my Golden Dragon kin in my territory."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei: "Of course, you know my credibility."</p><p></p><p>In a secluded cliff nest in the ancestral lands, the female dragon Shaduo saw the two giant dragons suddenly appear before her, her heart trembling slightly as she was dazed and instinctively prostrated herself, saying: "Greetings to the great Goddess of Beauty Fuler. Greetings to the great Lord Wanlei."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei asked: "Who accompanied and protected you when you returned?"</p><p></p><p>The female dragon Shaduo told the truth: "Respected Lord Wanlei, no one accompanied or protected me. I brought my three children back alone."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei knew Shaduo was not lying. Casually glancing around, he asked: "Weren't there three children? Why do I only see two?"</p><p></p><p>Shaduo said: "My youngest child Rean Oakes was noticed by Lord Nati during the awakening ceremony and taken under his wing to learn."</p><p></p><p>Wanlei's eyes slowly narrowed. He realized the situation was becoming more and more complicated and interesting.</p><p></p><p>He also realized that the "Secret Deity" mentioned by humans and Nati's disappearance were somewhat related to this female dragon before him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could find a breakthrough in this female dragon's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, he stepped forward and stretched out his hand, releasing a blue light to probe into Shaduo's mind.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, his blue light was blocked.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Fuler had blocked his soul art, frowning as she said: "Lord Wanlei, what are you trying to do? Have you forgotten what you said? You are not allowed to harm my Golden Dragon kin in my territory."</p>

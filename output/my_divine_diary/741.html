        <h1>Chapter 741</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Su Hao walked out of the laboratory, looking at these trembling bug-eyed creatures cowering in the corner, he couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been conducting comprehensive research on these bug-eyed creatures, not sparing any organ inside their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But he had not found the 'compound eyes' he wanted.</p><p></p><p>He did not give up, and successively carried out detailed analysis on the 'buds' and cells of the mushroom people, also recording their brain structures and consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he found nothing!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Could the bug-eyed race have evolutionary levels? Awakening compound eyes after evolving, the higher the level the stronger, seeing farther and clearer distances...</p><p></p><p>While the bug-eyed creatures I've captured are just the lowest existence among the bug-eyed race...</p><p></p><p>It's possible! It seems I need to go to the major cities of the bug-eyed race and capture some higher-level looking mushroom people."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it, he did it. Su Hao's massive tyrannosaurus body slowly disappeared from the spot, going out to search for the major cities of the bug-eyed race.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the ninety bug-eyed creatures imprisoned in the second-level world all breathed a sigh of relief together.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while and not seeing the monster return, they couldn't help but start chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster was that? The cosmic monster from the legends?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said the cosmic monster has eight tentacles, how could it be as terrifying as that monster?"</p><p></p><p>"Will we still be able to go back? I was only halfway through my shower, at least let me go back and finish it!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too, the sunflowers I was raising won't have me to take care of them, they'll probably wither."</p><p></p><p>"Do you all have holes in your brains? It's this kind of time and you're still thinking about those things? Not having studied is really terrible."</p><p></p><p>"You should be thinking about how we can survive here, otherwise in at most a year, we'll all starve to death."</p><p></p><p>"Starve to death? How terrifying~"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred bug-eyed creatures disappearing from a village soon caught the attention of the local palace leader of the bug-eyed race, who dispatched a team of mushroom people to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Soon the investigation results were reported to the palace leader.</p><p></p><p>The palace leader was an elderly looking mushroom person, sitting in a relatively modern office, browsing the report materials and pictures on a computer.</p><p></p><p>The doubts in his eyes grew heavier.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but murmur: "What's going on? All the items in the village were neatly arranged, not the slightest bit of disorder.</p><p></p><p>The lights were still on, the TV still playing, the bathwater not drained, the clothes left to the side untouched...</p><p></p><p>It's as if everyone just vanished into thin air. I've searched all global records and never encountered a similar case..."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he raised his head and asked: "Did the celestial palace's monitoring staff observe the situation in this village?"</p><p></p><p>A mushroom person dressed like a human in a small suit standing beside him replied: "We happened to miss observing that area at that time, there are no event records."</p><p></p><p>The palace leader sighed: "Record the incident, strengthen monitoring. Also notify the other palace districts, remind them to be vigilant and take protective measures."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, palace leader."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly found what looked like a very prosperous metropolis, located a strange pigeon building, extended his divine consciousness, and instantly ten small mushroom people vanished from their spots, captured by Su Hao and brought into the second-level world.</p><p></p><p>He changed locations, capturing another ten.</p><p></p><p>In the second-level world, the original ninety mushroom people were heatedly discussing their current predicament and escape plans when they suddenly noticed twenty more mushroom people appear on the side, scaring them into jumping.</p><p></p><p>The second-level world became chaotic again.</p><p></p><p>They had just calmed down when they saw that terrifying giant beast slowly manifest its form, grabbing those twenty new mushroom people and taking them into the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>To these mushroom people, this scene was extremely horrifying, and they also understood how they ended up here: the same as those twenty mushroom people, suddenly appearing out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, Su Hao released those twenty mushroom people.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the group of short blue little mushroom people strangely, thinking to himself: "These twenty mushroom people are the relatively well-off individuals I found in the city, but essentially the same as the other mushroom people.</p><p></p><p>In other words, my previous guess about 'evolving compound eyes' doesn't hold up either.</p><p></p><p>Then how are these mushroom people able to see events happening in the distant cosmos?"</p><p></p><p>Something even his immense power couldn't achieve, yet these small mushroom people who didn't seem to have anything special could do it...</p><p></p><p>It's not that Su Hao was arrogant and looking down on the bug-eyed race, but if an ordinary person saw that the so-called tremendously powerful bug-eyed race looked like this, they would probably be puzzled too.</p><p></p><p>He listened to the 'lili lili' chatter of these little mushroom people, but couldn't understand what they were saying, so he made a decision: "It seems the bug-eyed race's ability to see the distant cosmos is not solely due to their physical bodies, there must be something else.</p><p></p><p>Trying to obtain the corresponding technology by just researching their bodies is unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>So I still need to first learn the bug-eyed race's language, then control multiple bug-eyed creatures' bodies to infiltrate their society, before having a chance to uncover the root cause."</p><p></p><p>To uncover the secrets of the 'compound eyes', there was no way around communicating through language. Once he mastered the language, it would become much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao left the second-level world imprisoning the mushroom people, using the 'Mimic Human' sequence ability from the Eight-Armed God, transforming into a small mushroom person and secretly blending into the mushroom people's town.</p><p></p><p>He quickly adapted to the mushroom people's behavior patterns, wandering aimlessly through the town while comparing with the language materials collected by the Nebula Troops, rapidly learning the mushroom people's language and writing.</p><p></p><p>He believed it wouldn't be long before fully mastering the 'lili lili' language.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of a total of twenty people from the metropolis was soon discovered by the bug-eyed race.</p><p></p><p>To the bug-eyed race, this was no small matter.</p><p></p><p>The bug-eyed race's population was already not large, and including the ninety mushroom people who had previously vanished from the village, a total of 110 had now disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, no mushroom person could say for sure whether similar situations would occur again in the future.</p><p></p><p>The major cities of the bug-eyed race were generally under constant observation, any issues that occurred could have the corresponding historical records retrieved.</p><p></p><p>And the scene of Su Hao teleporting the bug-eyed creatures away was also retrieved.</p><p></p><p>After watching the video, this middle-aged palace leader mushroom head was deep in thought, suddenly seeming to realize something and abruptly standing up.</p><p></p><p>"This is just spatial teleportation ability, isn't it? Humans already possess such technology!"</p><p></p><p>All the mushroom people were startled upon hearing this, quickly associating it with the mysterious teleportation abilities of humans.</p><p></p><p>Making this connection, the reason for their bug-eyed race members' inexplicable disappearances seemed inseparable from the humans.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, such a thing had never happened before, but not long after the humans visited the bug-eyed race's planet, it occurred!</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it this way, it really does seem like the humans' mysterious teleportation abilities. Perhaps it was the humans who captured our tribesmen!"</p><p></p><p>"But what would the humans want with capturing our tribesmen?"</p><p></p><p>"What else could it be for? It must be to do some evil things."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what it's for, the fact is we've lost over a hundred tribesmen."</p><p></p><p>"I said from the start we absolutely couldn't reveal the location of our mother planet to the humans no matter what, and now look? The humans finally couldn't resist acting against us."</p><p></p><p>"Let's immediately demand the humans return our tribesmen, if they don't comply, then to hell with it, we'll ally with the Eight-Armed race and wipe out the humans together. We'll all go down together."</p><p></p><p>"That's right! As allies, they actually turned on us, it's outrageous."  </p><p></p><p>"Support that, demand an explanation from the humans. We must get our tribesmen back!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A bunch of mushroom people started squabbling noisily.</p><p></p><p>They had no evidence proving this incident was the humans' doing, but it seemed they had already determined the humans must be involved.</p><p></p><p>The bug-eyed race considered their comprehension abilities inferior to humans and the Eight-Armed race, their intelligence being of the mediocre to lower tier.</p><p></p><p>Those things involving evidence, deduction and investigation, they couldn't do and weren't interested in.</p><p></p><p>To them, as long as there was any reason pointing to the humans, then it must have been done by the humans...</p><p></p><p>No matter how the cunning humans tried to argue, it was useless.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't listen!</p><p></p><p>Unless the 110 bug-eyed race members were returned and they promised never to set foot on the bug-eyed race's mother planet again.</p><p></p><p>The palace leader mushroom immediately decided: "Good! I'll contact all the other palace leaders right away, we'll unite together and demand the humans return our tribesmen. Otherwise don't blame the bug-eyed race for being impolite."</p><p></p><p>The little mushroom people could have big ambitions too!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hadn't expected this kind of situation to occur, he had only captured over a hundred bug-eyed creatures, yet it was like kicking a hornet's nest.</p><p></p><p>In human or Eight-Armed society, this was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred people? Dead is dead, who cares!</p>

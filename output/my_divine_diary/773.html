        <h1>Chapter 773</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this time, most of the dragon species on all the battlefields had already turned their eyes and seen the three crystal stones floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>That's right, in their eyes, Suhao and the other two people were just like seeing stones on the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>Except these were translucent pink crystal stones that seemed to have some collection value.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they might even be used to court a female dragon they fancied.</p><p></p><p>So, here's the question now - how could these three stones float in the air?</p><p></p><p>They looked carefully and confirmed that the pink stones had no wings, so how could they fly without wings?</p><p></p><p>These were minor details though. Their main focus was on the key point: were they and all the dragon species on the battlefield immobilized because of those three stones above?</p><p></p><p>More importantly, these three uniquely shaped stones were making some inexplicable sounds, as if...they were saying something?</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord of the Wing Clan emanated a rich purple glow all over his body and struggled hard, actually managing to break free from the wind's restraints. He threw back his head and let out a long cry. </p><p></p><p>Then, raising the hammer in his hand, he leapt up and charged towards Suhao's trio.</p><p></p><p>The entire battlefield was restrained, which greatly shocked the Sacred Lord. Glancing up at the sky, he immediately sensed an overwhelming oppressive force from those three red crystals. He thought to himself, "The strange situation must be related to these three stones."</p><p></p><p>But he remained fearless.</p><p></p><p>Who was he?</p><p></p><p>He controlled this world's most mysterious 'Mother Pool' and possessed endless, unmatched power!</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord roared inwardly, "I am invincible! Everything, including these three crystal stones, will be shattered under my mighty hammer."</p><p></p><p>Full of fighting spirit, the Sacred Lord flapped his wings violently and charged upwards.</p><p></p><p>All the dragon species followed his figure with their eyes, inwardly admiring, "As expected of the strongest 'god' in the Sacred Land!"</p><p></p><p>Then their eyes flickered as they suddenly saw one of the crystal stones appear abruptly above the Sacred Lord's head, raise its fist, and punch the Sacred Lord's massive dragon head.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>They could even see a powerful shockwave radiating outwards from the point of impact between the fist and head.</p><p></p><p>And the Sacred Lord, like a cannonball, was blasted down from the sky into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The earth shook, billowing dust clouds rose, shattered rocks flew outwards, striking the stunned dragon species in the face.</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>Just comparing the sizes, they felt this visual effect was highly illogical.</p><p></p><p>Hey, they even saw a severed horn flying off - that broken horn must belong to the Sacred Lord, right?</p><p></p><p>Even Demon God Yuantan, the leader of the Three Tribe Alliance, was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Despite claiming to have an extraordinarily intelligent brain, he couldn't make sense of the current situation. But he instinctively felt this might not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Abnormalities must have demonic causes.</p><p></p><p>Not that he could do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—"</p><p></p><p>Despite taking such a heavy blow, the Sacred Lord had not completely fallen. He staggered up, tilted his head back and let out a long roar filled with unspeakable tragedy.</p><p></p><p>His wings were broken and hung limp at his side. His armor was shattered and scattered. Blood seeped from wounds all over his body, and his mouth bled profusely.</p><p></p><p>But he did not submit, for he was the Sacred Lord of the Wing Clan, the 'god' of this world!</p><p></p><p>Yashan retracted his fist and looked at the stubborn winged dragon below, remarking in surprise, "Huh? I didn't use quite enough force just now, so I didn't knock it out with one punch."</p><p></p><p>He didn't plan to punch it again though, as it seemed this largest of the winged dragons couldn't withstand his second punch.</p><p></p><p>Yashan flickered and landed on the ground, standing before the Sacred Lord.</p><p></p><p>Without a thought, the Sacred Lord instinctively opened his bloody maw towards Yashan, his fangs flickering with purple light.</p><p></p><p>Yashan flicked a finger.</p><p></p><p>"Bang—"</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord's massive head whipped back violently, blood spurting in an upward arc.</p><p></p><p>His body was flung back by the tremendous force, tumbling 360 degrees.</p><p></p><p>And the Sacred Lord was also dazed by that flick, temporarily unable to tell directions or get back up.</p><p></p><p>Yashan withdrew his finger, thinking, "No need for fists, a finger should do the trick."</p><p></p><p>This finger flick looked ordinary, but it almost made the surrounding dragon species' eyes pop out.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene severely shook their worldview.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Fengcheng also flickered over to stand beside the Sacred Lord's massive winged dragon body.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng marveled, "Truly a perfect life form! Possessing both wisdom and strength, that's quite rare."</p><p></p><p>Suhao also praised, "Indeed relatively perfect. I just don't know what a dragon civilization would evolve into at its peak."</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and patted the Sacred Lord's smooth scales, saying, "Let's take all these dragon species away first!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Yashan and Fengcheng were about to ask which small world to transport them to, Suhao had already started acting.</p><p></p><p>Pink crystal armor rapidly spread out from under his feet, enveloping the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, he raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The ground shook violently as the dozens of kilometers of crystal land they stood on slowly rose up, the surrounding mountains sinking relatively.</p><p></p><p>Suhao then hastily constructed a small world and forcibly stuffed the uplifted land into it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he said, "It's better to build a new small world using the land and air from this world.</p><p></p><p>I'm worried they might not take well to being sent to one of our existing small worlds."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng nodded, "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>The dragon species: "......"</p><p></p><p>Their minds went completely blank, as if their brains had crashed and lost the ability to think.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>During the battle between the Wing Clan and Three Tribe Alliance, they experienced things so inconceivable that words could not describe them.</p><p></p><p>They felt these events were even more absurd than fantasy stories.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that while everyone was fighting fiercely, three inexplicable crystal stones would suddenly appear...</p><p></p><p>Not only did crystal stones appear, but these stones could actually make strange calls and immobilize all the dragons on the spot...</p><p></p><p>Being immobilized was one thing, but the Sacred Lord, the strongest in the Sacred Land, was easily defeated by the crystal stones without any ability to fight back...</p><p></p><p>Most absurdly, the crystal people actually lifted an entire mountain-like land mass from underground, then took the land and all the dragon species on it to some unknown place.</p><p></p><p>The dragon species had initially harbored some thoughts of resistance, but after seeing Suhao move the mountain, that idea was completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>If the Sacred Lord was considered an undefeatable god in the Sacred Land, then these three crystal stones were the rulers of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>They had heard of god-slayers before, but never of those who could defy the rulers of the world.</p><p></p><p>What else could they do? Fighting was futile, so they could only resign themselves to fate...</p><p></p><p>This incident also completely disrupted the plans of both the Wing Clan and Three Tribe Alliance.  </p><p></p><p>How things would change afterwards was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>The future of the Sacred Land was now full of uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Because in this war, neither the Wing Clan nor the Three Tribe Alliance had achieved victory.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, both sides had failed.</p><p></p><p>They were captured by the absurd crystal stones.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small world, the Wing Clan stood on one side led by the Sacred Lord, while the Three Tribe Alliance stood on the other side led by Demon God Yuantan and the three great generals.</p><p></p><p>Although the fighting had stopped, the two sides still glared fiercely at each other in confrontation, as if they might break out into battle again at the slightest provocation.</p><p></p><p>However, their weapons had been taken away by Fengcheng, so they could only restrain themselves for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, killing with just claws and fangs was too inefficient.</p><p></p><p>After some time recovering, the Sacred Lord regained some strength. His cold vertical pupils fixed on Demon God Yuantan as he buzzed, "Despicable traitor Yuantan. Do you know that if not for this accident, you would now be kneeling before our ancestors in repentance?"</p><p></p><p>Yuantan met the Sacred Lord's gaze fearlessly and chuckled, "What's the point of 'what ifs' in this world? What happened is fact. Before the crystal stones, we are both failures."</p><p></p><p>He proposed, "Sacred Lord, since we are both failures, let us cease fighting for now and jointly confront the crystal stones to find a way out.</p><p></p><p>To decide whether the Mother Pool ultimately belongs to the Wing Clan or to the world."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord turned his head to look at Yuantan silently for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his massive body straightened up as he smiled for the first time - a cruel smile. He said coldly, "Then let's cease fighting for now."</p><p></p><p>Before Yuantan could speak, he added, "But I can find a way out myself, without deigning to join forces with a despicable traitor like you."</p><p></p><p>Yuantan chuckled lightly, "Suit yourself."</p>

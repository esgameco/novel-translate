        <h1>Chapter 727</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the third fleet appeared and according to regulations, first contacted the two fleets that had arrived earlier.</p><p></p><p>But there was no response.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the third fleet was puzzled, but didn't think too much of it, probably thinking the other two fleets had already charged towards the Blue Light planet to kill, loot and pillage. He directly waved his tentacles, ordering the entire fleet to advance towards the Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Then the third fleet surged forward imposingly towards the Blue Light, fully displaying the might of the Octopus race's fleet.</p><p></p><p>In its view, their every move must have been seen by the humans.</p><p></p><p>Tremble, tiny insects of the universe! Be afraid!</p><p></p><p>It was already impatient to see the panicked and flustered look on the humans.</p><p></p><p>Midway through the advance, the third fleet suddenly received a message from headquarters saying the previous two fleets had mysteriously lost contact, and they needed to wait for subsequent fleets to arrive before taking joint action.</p><p></p><p>What nonsense? The commander ignored it and continued advancing!</p><p></p><p>He had said it before - humans were just tiny insects, one of his fleets would be enough to easily take over this planet, there was no need for such trouble.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if he had offended someone at headquarters? Were they worried he would get the first credit? Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>Then, the third fleet was destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The fourth fleet had already received the message while in warp travel that the previous three fleets had seemingly been affected by signal interference after arriving at the Blue Light galaxy, losing all contact, and they were told to wait for subsequent fleets.</p><p></p><p>After the fourth fleet arrived at the Blue Light galaxy, they found they could not contact the previous three fleets no matter what, leaving them completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The fourth fleet commander thought: "Perhaps the human signal interference has blocked us!"</p><p></p><p>In the universe, signal blocking and temporary loss of contact was extremely common, no one would think the previous three fleets had been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, the fourth commander felt an ominous chill looking at the Blue Light galaxy.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on his mind was quite heavy!</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare act rashly, so he just waited outside the galaxy, waiting for a whole month.</p><p></p><p>At the human command center on the Blue Light planet:</p><p></p><p>Everyone frowned as they watched the Octopus fleet stop outside the galaxy with no intention of entering.</p><p></p><p>Someone asked doubtfully: "Could our actions have been discovered by the Octopus fleet?"</p><p></p><p>"In theory that's impossible, because we attacked their energy sources. We tested it - once the energy is cut off, nothing can be done on the ships, including communications. They wouldn't have noticed any clues."</p><p></p><p>"Losing contact with three fleets in a row, they must be suspicious. It's normal. Looks like they plan to wait for subsequent fleets to arrive before advancing together."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, let them come, however many! We'll destroy however many!"</p><p></p><p>"They can wait, and we can wait too. It's best if they all arrive, then we can wipe them all out at once!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just worried they'll arrive at different times, sending part of the fleet in while leaving part outside on standby. And the probability of them doing that is very high."</p><p></p><p>The galaxy was too vast, and the location of the Octopus fleet's arrival couldn't be determined, so comprehensive defense was impossible. They could only wait for the enemy to enter the galaxy, then use the 'energy burst waves' pre-planted on various asteroids to attack.</p><p></p><p>Someone suggested: "Should we dispatch a fleet to take the offensive?"</p><p></p><p>"My suggestion is to adopt Plan 18. Wait for the Octopus fleets to assemble, then try to eliminate them all at once, sealing off information about our attack methods as much as possible so the Octopus is kept in the dark.</p><p></p><p>If they send an advance force into the galaxy to attack the Blue Planet, then we can use the transmission array to send in warships, bypassing their advance force to go straight for the fleets waiting outside the galaxy. Once we get within an appropriate range, we can launch attacks simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Our goal is to destroy all their fleets at once, not giving the Octopus a chance to transmit information back!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun pondered briefly before nodding: "Do it! Immediately implement Plan 18 and run simulations. Be prepared at all times."</p><p></p><p>To deal with this war, humanity had simulated thousands of possible scenarios and countermeasures, extremely ruthlessly.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that all of the Octopus' actions were within the human side's predictions.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Octopus' planet-destroying cannons couldn't be used, humanity was sure to win this battle!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as the human leadership predicted, the Octopus assembled five large fleets into a massive 625-ship armada, sending half the ships to advance on the Blue Light from various directions.</p><p></p><p>The other half remained outside the galaxy on standby, just in case.</p><p></p><p>The human side also took action according to plan, using transmission arrays to deploy numerous warships that bypassed the advance force, traveling at a calculated speed towards the Octopus ships waiting outside the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus soon detected these human ships that suddenly appeared, but were unconcerned, continuing to execute their original plan.</p><p></p><p>These extremely weak human ships could just be dealt with by the half of their forces waiting outside the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Ten days into the journey, the human fleet arrived at the predetermined location as planned.</p><p></p><p>The overall Octopus commander waiting outside confidently said: "Let the human ships approach, then all our warships will open fire simultaneously, utterly destroying them!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the humans issued the attack order:</p><p></p><p>"Three!"</p><p>"Two!" </p><p>"One!"</p><p>"Launch!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the prepared 'energy burst waves' activated simultaneously, sending out a special shockwave at nearly the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>Five seconds later, all the Octopus warships exploded almost simultaneously, becoming drifting debris in space that quickly scattered in all directions, eventually becoming unremarkable cosmic dust in the vast emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p>"Well done!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the human command center erupted in cheers.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast, a group of Octopus at headquarters stared at each other, dumbfounded by the suddenly vanished fleets on screen.</p><p></p><p>All their fleets had simultaneously lost contact again, so abruptly that they didn't know what had happened.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time headquarters had encountered such a bizarre situation, and they didn't know how to command anymore...</p><p></p><p>A massive Octopus tentacle slowly undulated rhythmically as its eyes narrowed, seeming deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it opened its eyes and said: "Retrieve the final video footage from all warships and play it back slowed down a thousand times."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Supreme Commander!"</p><p></p><p>Then all the Octopus stared intently at the video footage.</p><p></p><p>Soon, one noticed something different: "Come look at this video, I saw a flash of light at the moment the image disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Here too!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Commander's eyes lit up: "Project it on the main screen for us all to analyze!"</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly watching and analyzing, headquarters reached a conclusion: "The fleets weren't just losing signal and unable to communicate - they were all destroyed simultaneously!"</p><p></p><p>After this conclusion, the Octopus looked at each other: "Impossible, right?"</p><p></p><p>But with so many eyes watching, there was no way they could be mistaken!</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying the eight fleets that reached the Blue Light galaxy, a total of one thousand warships, were all taken out by the humans?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed unbelievable - was this really the same fragile 'human' race they had always looked down on?</p><p></p><p>Just what had happened?</p><p></p><p>None of the Octopus at headquarters could figure it out.</p><p></p><p>After pondering, the Supreme Commander said gravely: "Orders: One, report to 'Rear Rock' that we will use the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon.'</p><p></p><p>Two, send orders to all subsequent fleets to halt warp travel and regroup, do not approach Blue Light. If human ships approach, immediately retreat and prevent them from getting close.  </p><p></p><p>Three, activate the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' program on the mothership, continuously firing at extreme range to destroy Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Four, request support from all galactic fleets, adding 100 large reinforcement fleets to attack Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Five, apply to elevate the human threat level to Level 6!"</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Soon, from the Octopus fleet movements, humanity deduced that the Octopus planned to use the extreme long-range 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' next.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as soon as the Octopus' fifth fleet arrived, that massive mothership began charging up and activating the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon.'</p><p></p><p>Humans estimated that in four hours, the Octopus' first 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' shot would be fired, striking Blue Light within six hours to cause localized catastrophic damage.</p><p></p><p>The captain hurriedly found Feng Cheng and informed him of the analysis.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "I thought it was something else! But the shot hasn't been fired yet? I understand, go wait for updates!"</p><p></p><p>The captain: "???"</p><p></p><p>Though anxious, he could only trust that Feng Cheng, Xu Shiqiang and the others really did have a way to deal with the Planet Destroyer Cannon.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng sent a message to the group: "Old Su, the Octopus have activated the Planet Destroyer Cannon and plan to gather multiple fleets to fire on Blue Light from multiple angles at extreme range."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the message, Su Hao opened his eyes and casually tossed the half-formed new-born larva into another small world.</p><p></p><p>"I've completed the 'similar particle aggregation entanglement' biological experiments and found a way to obtain a large amount of stable entangled particles. Next, I just need to build the 'synchronized neural network' and I'll gain a brand new ability...</p><p></p><p>However, building the neural network isn't something that can be done overnight. I'll pause this research for now!"</p><p></p><p>He flashed onto Blue Light and messaged Ya Shan: "Ya Shan, put your work on hold for now, let's go clear out some pests together."</p>

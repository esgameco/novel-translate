        <h1>Chapter 858</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao realized that assigning tasks for others to explore the unknown and dangerous areas, while he hid in the pinball space enjoying the fruits of their labor, was quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Many things he had dared not do before, he could now freely carry out after gaining eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Like this time, the eighteen deities brought him a pure surprise.</p><p></p><p>He even mocked himself: "Having others do things for me, will it make me become evil and lazy, gradually losing the spirit of exploration?"</p><p></p><p>The future is always full of mist, but he would not refuse to act out of worry. At worst, if things developed in a direction he didn't want, he could straighten it out again.</p><p></p><p>If one could possess eternal life, what was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>In this universe, nothing could escape being eroded by time, even including himself.</p><p></p><p>After assigning the third exploration task to the deities, Suhao observed the deities' exploration progress while beginning to use the designed rune array to simulate the raging energy environment on the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>All simulations were completed in the small world, including simulations of 'pressure', 'temperature', 'gas density', 'material category', 'light intensity', 'various rays'...</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the environment could be explored on the red giant star, Suhao could manifest it one by one in the small world for simulation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly, three years later.</p><p></p><p>Suhao returned to his young dragon body, wandering in the second-level world to relieve the pressure from the high-intensity experiments, and exercise his body.</p><p></p><p>In those three years in the small world, he had done a massive amount of simulation experiments, simulating the harsh environment on the red giant star as much as possible. He constantly added new conditions and tried to use 'divine light' and 'information' as supplements to obtain true soul power, but all failed. In his simulated environment, there was not the slightest trace of the birth of soul power.</p><p></p><p>This made Suhao quite puzzled: "What else is missing? In the distant past, countless 'accidents' occurred on this red giant star, giving birth to the White Dwarfs. That means, as long as I create the same coincidence, I should also be able to obtain soul power..."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities who entered the 'birthplace' of the White Dwarfs had sent back a lot of information, but there was no information about the newborn White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>"No clues, and the experiments have also reached an impasse where they can hardly continue. I need to change my exploration strategy."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Suhao turned his attention to the White Dwarf body.</p><p></p><p>Since his own exploration had reached an impasse, he might as well seek new information from the White Dwarf body.</p><p></p><p>"First, it can be confirmed that the White Dwarf is an intelligent life form, while the numerous small White Dwarfs on the red giant star look confused and unintelligent, which should be the result of their thinking lacking sufficient rich and useful information.</p><p></p><p>As long as I inject 'rich' and 'logically sound' information into the White Dwarf body, I can activate one White Dwarf to the point where it can engage in simple communication.</p><p></p><p>In this way, I can obtain more information about this red giant star through communication with the White Dwarf."</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't try to awaken the consciousness of the White Dwarfs within the eighteen deities, Suhao had actually tried before. But he found that the consciousness of those eighteen White Dwarfs had been constantly sealed and eroded by the deities over the years. The information originally belonging to the White Dwarfs had gradually been replaced by the information perceived by the deities, leaving little practical value.</p><p></p><p>Even if he completely awakened the consciousness of the deities' White Dwarfs to the point of normal communication, Suhao estimated that he would not obtain the information about the red giant star that he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of it, he did it. Suhao immediately returned to the pinball space and assigned a side quest to the eighteen deities: "Temporary personal side quest: Capture one White Dwarf and send it to the first planet outside the red giant star. Reward: Unlock game exchange mall."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities exploring received the side quest and were stunned for a moment before quickly reacting and flying out of the 'birthplace', pouncing on the surrounding drifting White Dwarfs like hungry wolves.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their group chat became lively.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I knew Lord Leian would make a move on these native White Dwarfs, as expected. I've been looking forward to this day!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, when I first heard that Lord Leian found the homeland of the White Dwarfs, I was overjoyed."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, with so many White Dwarfs for Lord Leian to experiment on, he wouldn't bother us anymore, right? We've developed some rapport with Lord Leian, so as long as we don't intentionally cause trouble, Lord Leian shouldn't lay a hand on us, right? Haha, we're safe!"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like regaining freedom is not far away. To be honest, I miss the Tenth Star! I miss those charming beauties!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and get the White Dwarfs to Lord Leian. That's the real deal."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The deities were concerned about their own safety. Even if Suhao's quest had no reward, they would complete it as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>Just two days later, Suhao received a notification that the eighteen deities had completed the quest.</p><p></p><p>When he transmitted to that small planet, he found that the eighteen deities had already used their powers to restrain a White Dwarf, waiting for him to accept it.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao collected the White Dwarf into the small world, he happily announced that the eighteen deities had completed the quest, and then transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>The deities didn't rush back to the red giant star to continue exploring. Instead, they stayed and eagerly opened the assistant to check what the unlocked 'game exchange mall' was.</p><p></p><p>"'Deities Must Die', exchange points: 1000 points."</p><p>"'God-Slaying Warriors', exchange points: 1000 points." </p><p>"'Reborn Deity', exchange points: 800 points."</p><p>"'Ten-Color Board Dismantler', exchange points: 500 points."</p><p>"'Escape from the Divine Temple', exchange points: 500 points." </p><p>"'Happy Deity Brawl', exchange points: 300 points."</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After seeing the various games on the panel, the deities were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand why these games seemed to treat deities as the ultimate villains that must be defeated...</p><p></p><p>Would they really have a good experience playing these games?</p><p></p><p>"No, these games seem to be just for viewing... not very useful."</p><p></p><p>The Light Bathing Deity - Yi pointed out: "Pay attention to the point annotations behind them. We can complete quests assigned by the assistant to earn points, and then use the points to exchange for the games we want. It's like mortals working to earn money and then buying things. These points are our money."</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The deities were instantly petrified: "You mean we're working for money now?"</p><p></p><p>They had never been so shocked.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to believe that they, mighty deities, had fallen to the point of working for someone to earn money. Go back ten thousand years, and every one of them could have whatever they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Before, they were willing to cooperate with anything to stay alive, never imagining they would randomly become working stiffs. Now that the Light Bathing Deity - Yi had bluntly pointed it out, they could no longer keep up appearances.</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity - Red Light angrily said, "Fellow deities, I feel I have been insulted. If we don't resist now, when will we?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you've been insulted, so go resist. If you're prepared, I can help summon Lord Leian for you to duel with."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also strongly supported him: "We all support you. If you fail, it doesn't matter. We will always remember your bravery."</p><p></p><p>"Right, if you have any unfulfilled wishes or unfinished business, tell us. We'll have the chance to help you achieve them later."</p><p></p><p>Red Light: "Never mind, insult is just insult. I believe in Lord Leian's character - he wouldn't insult us. Besides, how is earning points through our own abilities an insult? I'll look at it from another angle, I think it's quite good..."</p><p></p><p>"Tch~"</p>

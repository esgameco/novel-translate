        <h1>Chapter 588</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Life under the golden radiant beams appeared so fragile, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao slowly lowered his hand, all the people locked inside the imperial palace lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>The servants in the palace panicked and fled in disarray, quickly escaping from the palace grounds. </p><p></p><p>Suhao descended expressionlessly, his feet touching the ground, then unleashed his Vajra armor which surged forth, spreading throughout the entire palace, transforming it all into glistening crystal.</p><p></p><p>The crystal churned, carrying countless corpses, and the whole palace slowly sank underground.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the surging crystal gradually calmed down, becoming a flat expanse of land.</p><p></p><p>The Vajra armor receded, revealing moist soil dug up from deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Suhao surveyed the area, seeing no trace left behind, then flashed to the other princes' residences, burying them underground in the same manner.</p><p></p><p>He then deactivated the suppression function of the inhibitors and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>After Suhao left, the entire Yixuan City erupted in exclamations, discussing the extremely beautiful golden rain they had just witnessed. People described the rare, magnificent, beautiful golden rain they saw, yet few knew of the murderous intent hidden within that golden downpour.</p><p></p><p>"What was that just now? A meteor shower?"</p><p></p><p>"I swear on this fruit in my hand, that was no meteor shower! Maybe it was fireworks set off by a master mage proposing to his beloved!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow! That's so romantic, I really hope when I grow up, there will be a tall, sunny, handsome, rich, talented super source mage who proposes to me in the same way. I would definitely say yes without hesitation!"</p><p></p><p>"The landing point seemed to be in the direction of the imperial palace, it must have been the prince's proposal ceremony! Should we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the palace doesn't allow people to get close at night!"</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, during such an exciting event, no one will stop us. And we'll just watch from afar!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The citizens didn't understand what had happened, but the source mages had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly lost their abilities, then a golden radiance rained down from the sky, converging into the imperial palace. After a while, the golden curtain disappeared and they quickly regained their abilities.</p><p></p><p>This gave them a 90% certainty: the loss of their abilities was related to the golden rain.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sudden upheaval, Feixiang and Xiangli's squads quickly gathered to discuss the recent events.</p><p></p><p>Xiangli spoke first: "Do you know what happened just now? A golden radiance rained down from the sky. More importantly, for a short while, my abilities disappeared. I couldn't use my source powers, just like an ordinary person holding source but unable to channel its force."</p><p></p><p>Her squadmate was astonished: "I thought I was the only one whose abilities suddenly failed. I didn't expect yours did too, Xiangli."</p><p></p><p>They soon started discussing animatedly, realizing all of their abilities had ceased functioning at the same time.</p><p></p><p>They turned to Feixiang: "Feixiang, what about your abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiang, a gold source mage, frowned and nodded: "My abilities were also lost for a short period."</p><p></p><p>"This...what exactly happened? Why did everyone's abilities temporarily disappear? It's unknown if other mages experienced the same thing."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang gravely said: "The five of us live far apart, yet we all lost our abilities simultaneously. It's not hard to guess that other mages likely experienced the same thing. This is...not good!"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli asked: "What's not good?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiang explained: "It's clear the golden rain just now was targeting the imperial palace. I suspect it was a retaliatory action by the Radiant Society. But that's not the key issue. The key issue is that the Radiant Society likely possesses a means to temporarily deprive mages of their abilities.</p><p></p><p>If true, that's troubling. Mages without abilities are only slightly stronger than ordinary people. Even against a novice mage who just grasped their source powers, we would be powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, judging from the golden rain, the Radiant Society's abilities were completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if we directly confronted the Radiant Society, no matter how many mages from our association joined forces, it would be useless - tantamount to walking to our deaths. And moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli urgently asked: "And moreover what?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiang sighed: "Grand Master Lada led a squad to Pingkong City. Initially there were frequent reports of success, but now it's been over half a month with no word at all.</p><p></p><p>I suspect, nine out of ten...they were either killed or captured. This recent Radiant Society action may have been retaliation for Grand Master Lada's rampage in Pingkong City."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli and the others gasped in shock.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada being killed or captured was simply unthinkable!</p><p></p><p>Feixiang said solemnly: "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>This world's powers all came from the source, yet someone had mastered the means to suppress source mages' abilities. What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Feixiang gazed towards the imperial palace and took the lead: "Let's go, we'll check out what happened outside the palace. I need to confirm some things."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Not just Xiangli and Feixiang's squad headed towards the palace, but many other source squads that had gathered and shared information also made their way there. Soon, a large number of daring source squads congregated around the palace, and they all witnessed a jaw-dropping scene.</p><p></p><p>It was a vast, flat expanse of land.</p><p></p><p>The once brightly lit imperial palace had vanished without a trace!</p><p></p><p>Where was the magnificent, luxurious and solemn imperial palace?</p><p></p><p>And the imperial clan who had lived there?</p><p></p><p>They were now trembling uncontrollably, their eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>"The...the golden beams raining down from the sky killed everyone around!"</p><p></p><p>"Their whole heads exploded, blood and gore splattered everywhere..."</p><p></p><p>"I was so scared I ran for my life, not realizing I had fled the palace. When I looked back, oh my god, the palace was gone!"</p><p></p><p>Another said: "That's right! It was terrifying! But I did see the palace turn into crystal and sink underground!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At first the servants were extremely frightened, worried someone would blame and silence them, or force them to commit burial suicide. But gradually they became less afraid, babbling excitedly with each retelling.</p><p></p><p>A strange feeling arose - fear mixed with twisted pleasure.</p><p></p><p>What was it like seeing those who had always looked down on them from their lofty positions killed?</p><p></p><p>Not just the servants felt this dark glee. Even many of the source mage squads who heard the servants' accounts couldn't help feeling a sense of schadenfreude, though they hid it well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some didn't hide it so well.</p><p></p><p>Xiangli wore a smile, but her tone was full of sadness: "What? All the imperial nobles in the palace died? Oh, how tragic."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang glanced at her but said nothing, his brow furrowed in thought.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a rumor quietly spread through the crowd, reaching their ears: "Many cities have sent communications to the Mage Headquarters reporting attacks by unknown assailants. The princes' residences were massacred, with no survivors.</p><p></p><p>As of now, at least seventy more cities have sent communications, and the number is still rising. Headquarters' communication equipment is nearly overloaded."</p><p></p><p>Those who heard this immediately realized what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Not only Yixuan City was attacked - perhaps all the major cities in the entire Hengxuan region had their princes' residences attacked.</p><p></p><p>A single strike to kill!</p><p></p><p>The scene erupted in exclamations.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Society, once looked down upon, had become grand and mysterious after tonight's events.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang gazed at the flat expanse before him and murmured: "A change is coming!"</p>

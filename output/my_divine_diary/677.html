        <h1>Chapter 677</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Eight Hands Clan's combat ship was large compared to Su Hao's fighter, but it wasn't big compared to his radar perception range of over two thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>The battleship looked very large, but it was only 800 meters long and only about 300 meters wide, and Su Hao could easily include all the lifeforms on the battleship in his radar perception as long as he drove his fighter close.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that he could easily shoot all the lifeforms on the battleship with precision as long as he kept dropping space modules and then activated them.</p><p></p><p>What seemed to be a very complicated job was very simple for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only the ability that Su Hao had exerted without obtaining a 'source', if he had a source in his hand, it would be even simpler, he didn't even need to drop space modules, and the creatures within the range of his senses could be easily cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>For example, the 'Locked Fist' that could transfer the impact, a few punches would be enough to break the octopus monsters, even if they had a lot of brains they couldn't top it.</p><p></p><p>After a round of 'Surge', Su Hao also purposely circled around the Eight Handed Clan's battleships, and when he saw those that still had signs of life, he would fire a few more cannons until he confirmed that all the signs of life on the battleships had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This way, there should be no more threats!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned the fighter around and flew back.</p><p></p><p>There were still many Octopi roaming around, they didn't understand what was happening for a moment and didn't dare to approach Su Hao, they could only fire cannonballs from afar.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of shells were not a threat to Su Hao at all.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the fighter's energy grid and realized that not much energy was left after he had squandered it so much, so he no longer cared about the surrounding Octopus planes that were like hounds looking around, and went straight to the Remote Star.</p><p></p><p>After blowing up a few Octopi that were unwilling to let him go back, he directly passed through the group of human fighters and headed for the Remote Star.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, going back like this seemed too abrupt, so he turned on his communication device and reported to his captain, "Reporting to the captain, have completed the mission of piloting a fighter to fuck him up, completely wiped out all the octopi of the enemy's combat ship, and are now returning."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan cooperated with Xiao Chang, and only came back to his senses after cunting an Octopus, "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao repeated it again and emphasized, "I've already shot all the Octopods inside that guerrilla-type battleship, so the next thing to do is just to clear the Octopods wandering around outside, and then we'll be able to end this battle once and for all. Before the night grows long, the speed of the cleanup will have to be accelerated."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan was confused, his volume gradually increasing as he said, "You shot all the Octopi inside the combat ship? A combat ship and not a fighter? Are you kidding me? Don't joke about this!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Do I look like I'm teasing you? It's a combat ship, it's that big guy over there, for real."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan: "......"</p><p></p><p>However, Captain Yan still felt that Su Hao was teasing him, but he couldn't confirm it, and couldn't he still rush inside the enemy battleship to check out the acceptance?</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he directly dialed his superior's communication and said, "Reporting to Sir Jiang, this is Squad 405, the 'fuck him' mission you gave to Xu Shiqiang, Xu Shiqiang reported completion. The degree of completion is as follows: all of the Eight-Handed Race within the enemy battleships have been shot to death. Over!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he heard Officer Jiang roar, "Yan Xiang, is there something wrong with the orders you're giving? A group of people here are listening, what do you mean 'fuck the mission'? I'll settle the score for you later! If you can contact that kid, hurry up and tell him to get his ass back here, what's wrong with running to the opposite side to turn around!"</p><p></p><p>"Roger that!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Officer Jiang's voice came out again, "Wait, what did you just say? You've shot all of the Eight Hands in the fighters?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan corrected, "Report, it's not fighters, it's combat ships, guerrilla-type combat ships! Xu Shiqiang reported that other than the roaming fighters, the rest of the Eight Hands have been annihilated."</p><p></p><p>Officer Jiang heard clearly this time and immediately sprayed, "Fuck you! I'm at the command center now, Yan Xiang, can you think before you speak? You're a disgrace to me!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan expressed his innocence, it wasn't him who said it, it was that kid Da Qiang who said it, he was just reporting it ......</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, he returned, "Roger, Sir Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>Officer Jiang hung up the communication fiercely, and as soon as he looked up, he realized that everyone in the command headquarters was looking at him with smiles on their faces, and he couldn't help but dryly cough as if he had just farted.</p><p></p><p>Not being thick-skinned enough to stay in this place.</p><p></p><p>But this battle, overall it was a long face.</p><p></p><p>As for Captain Yan's words, no one believed them is all.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an observer suddenly said, "Huh? Report, the enemy combat ship has detected an anomaly! The spatial interference curvature is no longer changing, and the forward direction continues to veer to the left, approaching towards us."</p><p></p><p>The spatial interference curvature was something that needed to be changed at all times to avoid being locked into a precise position by the enemy battleships, and generally only after the combat state was lifted would it stop changing the spatial curvature constantly, or just turn it off.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, this state was something they had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, originally, the Eight Handed Clan's battleships were constantly approaching and moving away in a curved line, always maintaining a certain distance from the Remote Star.</p><p></p><p>The current situation seemed to be that after the battleship had deflected a small angle in their direction, it suddenly stopped changing its orientation.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of everyone at the command headquarters tightened as they secretly said, "Could it be that the enemy ship is planning to make a surprise attack and launch a strong offense?"</p><p></p><p>The captain made an immediate decision, "Maintain the current state of march. All main cannons immediately fire continuously."</p><p></p><p>"Roger!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Remote Star's large and small main cannons lit up, and a pillar of light spanned the distant distance at an extremely fast speed, accurately hitting the Eight Hands Race's combat ships, erupting with dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"Hit?" This time, giving the captain and the others a whole wouldn't do.</p><p></p><p>The captain frowned, "Continue the attack!"</p><p></p><p>Then the shots continued to hit, even as the main cannon blasted a large hole in the rear of the enemy ship and fire erupted.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Could it be that the Eight Hands are playing tricks?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't look like it! There's no such thing as cheating with your own flagship?"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the enemy ship is out of control!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I think I heard someone say just now that ...... had shot all the Hachiman inside the enemy ship, right?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd went silent.</p><p></p><p>In unison, they turned their heads to look at Officer Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Old Jiang, will you repeat what you just said?"</p><p></p><p>The corners of Old Jiang's mouth twitched as he directly said, "Otherwise, it's better to connect directly to Yan Xiang!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Captain Yan connected to the voice, "Reporting to Sir Jiang, this is Squad 405, please instruct."</p><p></p><p>Officer Jiang said, "What did you say just now? Shoot all of the enemy ship's eight-handed clans or something, say it again, loudly!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan hesitated, "Reporting to Officer Jiang, do I have to go through my head for this report?"</p><p></p><p>Officer Jiang sprayed, "Motherfucker! I'll allow you to speak without thinking, speak up!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan immediately blurted out, "Report, Xu Shiqiang's feedback is that he has completed the 'fuck him' mission. All Eight-Handed Clan members in the enemy battleship have been shot to death. Over!"</p><p></p><p>This time everyone heard it loud and clear without any doubts.</p><p></p><p>Then a sense of absurdity rose in their hearts, "Could it be that Xu Shiqiang really finished off all of the enemy ship's Eight-Handed Race?"</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>The captain stared at the Octopus combat ships with a frown on his face, and finally decided to test the waters, ordering, "Fighter groups press on all fronts, eliminate the remaining Octopi as soon as possible, and at the same time, check the status of the enemy combat ships."</p><p></p><p>"Roger!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The wait was torturous, they couldn't restrain the ridiculous thoughts that kept popping up in their minds, always wanting to know the answer as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>And the fighter piloted by Su Hao wobbled to catch up with the Remote Star, and after sending a request to log in signal, it was approved and sailed through the open hatch into the fighter warehouse.</p><p></p><p>After stopping and stabilizing, the first time a staff rushed up, unloading the old energy blocks, filling them with new ones, and quickly giving the fighter an inspection and maintenance.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened the hatch and jumped out, and everyone immediately gave him a military salute to show their respect for him.</p><p></p><p>In less than a minute, the fighter's energy blocks were filled in, and the staff waited for Su Hao to continue to fly the fighter out to fight, when they saw Su Hao walking away like a grandfather!</p><p></p><p>Staff member: "???"</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao returned to the Remote Star, the captain and the others got the news, and passed the word for Su Hao to immediately go to the command headquarters to stand by.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't think much about it and headed for the command headquarters.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the other party must have a lot of questions, and this time, going over was considered a post-war debriefing, and with a good debriefing, he could gain the appropriate reputation, making his future actions, more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao came to the door of the command headquarters, the door opened automatically, after he walked in, everyone inside stared at him furiously in unison.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wore a smile and performed a military salute, "Hello, all officers."</p><p></p><p>The crowd returned the military salute.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Shipmate Xu Shiqiang?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "It's me!"</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Ship's trooper Xu Shiqiang, give a short report on this combat mission."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 976</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had many divine avatars, so many that many divine avatars deteriorated and became defunct without ever being used by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Even so, every once in a while, his laboratory would produce a new batch of divine avatars, storing them in a warehouse, ready to be used at any time.</p><p></p><p>In other words, no matter what the situation, Su Hao would never lack divine avatars to use.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't have any particular sense of cherishing the current body he was controlling.</p><p></p><p>Weren't these inexhaustible divine avatars meant to be used for all kinds of dangerous experiments?</p><p></p><p>It was also a good opportunity to test what kind of power could destroy a divine avatar, so he could collect some new data.</p><p></p><p>So there was no need to hesitate about directly stuffing a concentrated natural primordial energy into his body. If it was ruined, he could just switch to a new body, and try again with a lower standard.</p><p></p><p>As for taking it little by little in an exploratory way?</p><p></p><p>That was a method used by ordinary people. For him, there was no need, the quicker the better.</p><p></p><p>Stuffing a ball of natural primordial energy into his body, then locking it inside his physical form, wouldn't it be faster to observe the process of it fusing with his body?</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't need to worry about his physical form being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao's approach was completely baffling to Lv Yijiang and the others...</p><p></p><p>In their view, it was tantamount to suicide.</p><p></p><p>After running far away, the three of them couldn't help but look back at Su Hao, but the expected explosion didn't happen. Mr. Jia Wei just closed his eyes, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>On the surface he appeared very calm, but they could feel an abnormally huge force contained within that calm shell, chaotic and ferocious - a power that had not been tamed by any martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said in a low voice, "Previously I had some doubts about the miraculous arts Mr. Jia Wei mentioned, but now I'm starting to believe them. What he said may well be true. Such a mysterious and powerful person has no need to deceive us."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang nodded, "I've always believed what he said is true. I can sense it."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng tugged at the extraordinarily tough martial arts robe on his body, "I still can't understand why this robe suddenly appeared on me."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi smiled, "There are many things about Mr. Jia Wei that you can't understand."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng suddenly said, "Can we ask Mr. Jia Wei to help us get rid of An Mingwang?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang immediately refused, "No!"</p><p></p><p>"Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang said, "I want to defeat An Mingwang myself. I want to tell him that the power used to rule the world pales in comparison to the power of pursuing self-transcendence. Believe me, I will definitely be able to defeat An Mingwang."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the self-confidence emanating from Lv Yijiang made even Gao Qi and Tai Cheng's hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>Previously he had been beaten so badly.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng said, "Lv Yijiang, if it wasn't for Cong Renfei helping you back then, you would have been killed by An Mingwang already."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang remained unmoved, and even laughed, "So what if I die? As long as I never surrender, a true martial artist will never lose. This is also the reason why the spirit of martial arts has been passed down until today, and I want to carry on that legacy."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng were shaken in their spirits, and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao flashed over, "Let's end today's test here. Let's go back first!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them stepped back in unison, feeling the ferocious power from Su Hao's body. Gao Qi couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Jia Wei, aren't you going to clear the energy in your body first?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I've already sealed that energy inside my physical form. As long as I don't release the restriction, there won't be any problems. Now I'm just waiting for it to fuse with my flesh. Any part that can't fuse, I'll clear it out in a few days. It's fine."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, without caring about their expressions, he transported them back to the experimental base.</p><p></p><p>When they returned to the experimental base, they found An Mingwang staring at the huge sphere of light floating in mid-air, sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>He retreated far to the side, taking a defensive stance, warily watching the giant light sphere, as if it might explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"A giant light sphere? Ah!! It's a natural primordial energy sphere!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two were shocked, reacting even more intensely than An Mingwang.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that the energy sphere that had disappeared earlier would reappear here.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Don't be nervous, it's very stable."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the others, including An Mingwang, looked at the ferocious primordial energy floating in mid-air and thought to themselves, "This is called very stable?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "First let me impart a cultivation technique to you. Cultivate it for a while until you can sense an omnipresent force field here."</p><p></p><p>The three were puzzled, "Force field?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it would be a bit difficult teaching the illiterate, as they didn't understand many basic concepts.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment, then directly activated a learning machine to help them understand this world.</p><p></p><p>With that thought, a small light immediately planted a learning program in the three's small black rooms.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a genderless voice sounded in their minds, "Ding! The Martial Artist Learning Machine has been activated. I am your assistant, Little Wu. If you have any questions, you can ask me."</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang was completely baffled, "Did you guys hear some voice talking about a learning machine?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard it."</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao said, "While cultivating the technique, spend four hours a day following the learning machine to study for a while. You'll quickly be able to understand some basic knowledge."</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang suddenly shouted loudly, "You there! What's the meaning of keeping me here? If you want to fight or kill, just come at me. I, An Mingwang, have never been afraid."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at Lv Yijiang and the other two, "I forgot to tell you, I need these three to teach me how to cultivate as a martial artist. But they said they were worried you would cause trouble in the outside world, so they couldn't stay here with peace of mind. So I brought you here temporarily, to put their minds at ease.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's better to focus when doing things. When these three leave, I'll take you out too, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang: "......"</p><p></p><p>That made sense, he couldn't refute it.</p><p></p><p>.....</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the Bounce Space, pulled up the body data of the divine avatar, and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>This body, with the natural primordial energy sealed inside, was undergoing dramatic changes, like the turbulent interior of a raging star, except it was tightly sealed by a thin humanoid shell, without a single leak.</p><p></p><p>And the cells within the body were being destroyed every moment, only to regenerate under the powerful life force, then destroyed again, over and over.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao keenly sensed that in this process, the natural primordial energy was fusing with the matter that made up the body in a unique way, becoming part of that matter.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much it was destroyed, shattered, or cycled, it never separated.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the primordial energy itself existed within that matter, as part of the matter itself.</p><p></p><p>Under the high pressure conditions, some of the matter that made up the divine avatar underwent a fundamental change, becoming like the matter on the martial artists' planet, imbued with the primordial energies of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"However, this avatar probably won't last more than a month. Its life force will be exhausted and it will die. Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then exited the Bounce Space and summoned a thousand avatars at once, all taking his appearance and densely arranged on the open grounds of the experimental base. He then proceeded to stuff each one with a 'natural primordial energy sphere', sealing it within the divine avatar's body to let it naturally transform.</p><p></p><p>From most to least, the amount of 'natural primordial energy' stuffed into each divine avatar varied, forming a relatively comprehensive experimental control group to observe the divine avatars' tolerance and rate of change with different quantities of 'natural primordial energy'.</p><p></p><p>This way, in less than a month, Su Hao would be able to obtain a large amount of useful data.</p><p></p><p>"Next, try converting 'primordial energy' directly from the source."</p><p></p><p>Only the power that could be directly converted from the source could truly be used by Su Hao. Otherwise, it wouldn't be of much value to him.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't just run back to this planet to replenish primordial energy after using it up out there.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao finished all this, he temporarily entered the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>As for Lv Yijiang and the others, they stared blankly at the rows of 'Mr. Jia Weis'.</p><p></p><p>"This is... completely mind-blowing!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 968</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "This bald Anming King looks quite sunny, didn't expect him to be so evil. Anyway, do you need help?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi sized up Cong Renfei's physique and firmly refused, "No need, you joining would just make me feel encumbered. We don't have the bandwidth to protect you while fighting."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng also laughed, "I believe Lv Yijiang will definitely be able to defeat Anming King. He always manages to overcome all opponents at the last moment. He won't fail."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei waved his hand, "You guys enjoy yourselves. I'll just watch your fight, seems quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling messaged Cong Renfei, "Little Fei, you just said we're no threat to them, and now you want to contradict yourself so soon?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Sis, don't mind the details. I'm just being polite. If someone invites you to eat, you're not really going to stay and eat, are you!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling couldn't be bothered with him.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked, "Sis, watching them fight hand-to-hand, it won't end anytime soon. Why don't we go back and report to the master first?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "What's the rush? I've already noted the coordinates and sent them. I'm recording a video now, and it will automatically send to the master when done. Plus we've only searched one-third of this star system, what if there are other life-bearing planets? Wouldn't that be awkward?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's just wait. We've been out for years already, a couple more days won't hurt."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "You're the elder sister, what you say goes. Let's watch then."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei knew his elder sister wanted to grasp the language and general information of this world first, then compile a summary report for their master. At the same time, leave a good impression on this world, to facilitate the master's communication with the humans here when he arrives.</p><p></p><p>This kind of pioneering work, surely their master shouldn't have to do it himself!</p><p></p><p>That would make his disciples seem rather useless.</p><p></p><p>A "cosmic civilization detector" and a "cosmic civilization development tool" are completely different concepts. The development tool is obviously more advanced and useful.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling never saw herself as just a detector used by the master to find life-bearing planets. She wanted to become an even more capable assistant to the master.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>Anming King was frantically attacking Lv Yijiang all over, while Lv Yijiang merely guarded his face defensively, enduring the storm of attacks and waiting for a chance to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>His muscular body was as flexible as tempered steel, impervious to the relentless pounding.</p><p></p><p>But judging from Lv Yijiang's pained expression, withstanding Anming King's attacks was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Anming King seized an opportunity, his right fist suddenly flashing a blinding white light, and viciously struck Lv Yijiang's chest while he was distracted.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>A powerful shockwave swept across the arena, enveloping Lv Yijiang in white light.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Like a laser cannon firing from above, it blasted Lv Yijiang into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Where the light engulfed, it seemed to muffle all sound, only the layered crumbling of earth triggered a wave of soil.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng cried out watching, "Yijiang!!!"</p><p></p><p>The force of that attack was beyond what they could withstand. Sensing that Yijiang's aura had vanished, their faces turned grim.</p><p></p><p>If Lv Yijiang failed, they couldn't fathom any way to defeat an enemy as powerful as Anming King.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Lv Yijiang, is that all the strength you have?"</p><p></p><p>Having blasted Lv Yijiang away with one strike, Anming King gloated loudly, "With that kind of power, you have no way to protect those puny insects."</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, as if sensing something, his expression changed, "Behind me! When did..."</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>A muscular figure suddenly flashed behind Anming King, his hands brimming with ferocious power, golden light flickering brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng's faces lit up with delight, "Yijiang's not dead!!! This is his Impact Cannon."</p><p></p><p>"Haaah--"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang thrust out his palms, this time it was Anming King's turn to be violently slammed into the ground by the energy blast.</p><p></p><p>The world seemed to lose color as the earth shattered.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, as the smoke cleared, an enormous crater had appeared on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Bald Anming King lay right in the center.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone thought he was defeated, Anming King suddenly opened his eyes and chuckled, "Lv Yijiang, I underestimated you!"</p><p></p><p>He slowly climbed up, standing in the crater with fists clenched.</p><p></p><p>"Thump thump thump!"</p><p></p><p>A drumming sound seemed to emanate from his body, pounding everyone's eardrums.</p><p></p><p>"Grrrr~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Anming King's muscles bulged out tremendously, veins protruding all over.</p><p></p><p>"Aaaargh~"</p><p></p><p>With Anming King's manic roars, his body abruptly grew taller, his aura intensifying several times over. The surrounding rubble and soil were pushed outwards by the outpouring of his energy.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi was utterly dumbstruck, "Wh...what? This power, too terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>The explosive-headed Tai Cheng clenched his fists tightly, his own aura surging as if about to charge in for a fight. He gritted through his teeth, "Even if I can't win, I must have the courage to face him."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang watched the increasingly powerful Anming King, slightly startled inwardly but unflinching as he took a stance, "Come on! I will definitely defeat you, Anming King."</p><p></p><p>Anming King laughed loudly, but his face quickly darkened, "Facing my full power, you still dare utter such childish words. Today's game ends here. Let me quickly send you all to hell."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he twisted his body, bones cracking loudly as his aura grew even more oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang stared fixedly at Anming King, adjusting his breathing to reach his peak state, utterly serious and focused.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even after fighting for so long and enduring countless attacks, he remained at full power.</p><p></p><p>Even Cong Renfei found it strange watching.</p><p></p><p>These people were like tireless combat machines, perpetual human dynamos.</p><p></p><p>As if unless struck down completely, they would soon get back up fighting fit...</p><p></p><p>Anming King stomped his foot.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The force he unleashed downwards exceeded his descending strikes.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly flashed in front of Lv Yijiang, a hand chop slashing down from above.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang raised both arms to block.</p><p></p><p>"Bang--"</p><p></p><p>The shockwave expanded as Lv Yijiang was blasted into the ground like a cannonball. But before he could land, Anming King's figure appeared below to meet him.</p><p></p><p>Kicking upwards fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Like a powerfully struck football, he launched Lv Yijiang high into the air in an arcing trajectory.</p><p></p><p>Yet Anming King's body had sunk two meters into the ground, rubble violently spraying all around.</p><p></p><p>But the next instant, his figure appeared beside the airborne Lv Yijiang, fists together to hammer down from above.</p><p></p><p>"Thud--"</p><p></p><p>The tremendously powerful Lv Yijiang was rendered utterly defenseless against Anming King's blows.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi gasped, "Never imagined Anming King was hiding such immense power."</p><p></p><p>The explosive-headed Tai Cheng said, "Anming King must be using some martial art to temporarily increase his explosive power. Such eruption of power must come at a huge cost. If Lv Yijiang can endure this period, he still has a chance."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi whipped his head around, "Tai Cheng, what are you planning to do?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng said resolutely, "I'm going to help Yijiang buy some time."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi: "You'll die."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng: "If we don't defeat Anming King, we'll die eventually."</p><p></p><p>With that, Tai Cheng's aura erupted violently, his martial arts robe fluttering intensely. </p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>He stomped the ground and charged towards Anming King.</p><p></p><p>The next moment he was blasted back, crashing beside Gao Qi and spitting out a mouthful of blood, "So...strong!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi's face hardened as thoughts whirled in his mind, "Should I sacrifice myself to create a brief respite for Yijiang? But even if Yijiang gets a moment to catch his breath, it's not certain he can defeat Anming King. If I die, it may not make any difference...I'd be better off retreating to train harder, then coming back stronger to defeat Anming King!"</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, his fists clenched tightly, muscles bulging as an explosive aura billowed out his robe.</p><p></p><p>Then he too charged towards Anming King, shouting, "Lv Yijiang, you must defeat Anming King!!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Soon Gao Qi was also blasted back like Tai Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them was a match for Anming King, but they only suffered injuries, not death. They quickly got back up, about to charge again.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei couldn't help asking, "Hey Gao Qi, are you really sure you don't need our help? You seem to want to buy some breathing room, I can help with that."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi grasped at the straw like a desperate man, "How can you help?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei showed a slight smile, "Like this."</p><p></p><p>Then he reached out and grabbed towards the wildly laughing Anming King.</p><p></p><p>Anming King instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked, "How long do you need to rest? Let me know when you're ready, I'll release him to fight you again."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng: "???"</p>

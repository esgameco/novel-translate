        <h1>Chapter 865</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The progress of soul power research was even smoother than Suhao had imagined.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the young men one by one broke through to the 'Yuanshen Realm', reaching the level of astral projection.</p><p></p><p>Suhao gave each of them a new body.</p><p></p><p>The second person to break through to the Yuanshen Realm had his body swapped for Aze's original body, but with the brain replaced by Suhao with a spiritual brain.</p><p></p><p>The third person to break through to the Yuanshen Realm had his body swapped for the second person's body...</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when the members of the 'Starry Sky Exploration Team' gathered together, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Aze, the people were the same, with familiar faces, but everyone had swapped bodies...</p><p></p><p>You were me, I was him!</p><p></p><p>"Damn, why am I in your body? It's so ugly, not even one-tenth as handsome as my original self. Why don't we swap? I'll give your body back to you."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, this body isn't yours, why would I swap with you?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh man, the body I swapped into is amazing, but it has a herniated disc, cervical spondylosis, and knee joint pain. I wonder if praying to the gods would help cure it."</p><p></p><p>"Mine is even more extreme, I have hemorrhoids on my butt, I can't even sit down properly."</p><p></p><p>"But don't you have soul power? Use your soul power to heal yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Can soul power really cure illnesses? I don't think so. Who wants to volunteer for me to try it out?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm pretty satisfied with this body overall, except the little brother is a bit small, no other flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that a flaw itself?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group of grown spiritual young men outwardly complained about their swapped bodies, but in reality their hearts were blooming with joy, except for those particularly unlucky ones, but overall it was good.</p><p></p><p>These young men were mostly unsatisfied with their own bodies, some even had self-esteem issues. After swapping bodies, although there were still flaws, they got rid of the root of their insecurities, and most were very happy. More importantly, after body swapping, everyone gained an invincibly powerful brain, directly elevating their level of existence by countless realms.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly someone asked, "By the way, do you guys know the divine title of the God Lord? From now on I will worship the God Lord, until my life is extinguished."</p><p></p><p>Everyone shook their heads, "No idea."</p><p></p><p>Then someone pointed to the twin sword mark on their foreheads and said, "I heard from Mr. Feng Cheng that this is an mark unique to the God Lord. And I've seen someone with a twin ring mark, maybe the God Lord's mark is the twin ring, do you think the God Lord's title could be 'Reincarnation'?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Aze suddenly said, "We cannot blindly guess the honorific of the God Lord. If he wants us to know, he will certainly tell us. Let's drop this topic."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After swapping bodies for all the young men, Suhao constantly observed their condition.</p><p></p><p>A total of sixty people, each successfully swapped bodies, undergoing a qualitative metamorphosis, with no one failing and no abnormalities found.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was extremely smooth and natural, as if the lives born by nature were meant to be this way.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao remained calm: "No rush, no rush, let's wait some more. Many flaws can only be exposed over time. As long as they are exposed, I can solve them!"</p><p></p><p>Did Suhao lack observation time?</p><p></p><p>Three years later, Suhao finally discovered a non-defective flaw in the young men: the spiritual brains lacked the replenishment and renewal of spiritual power, and were gradually 'aging'.</p><p></p><p>This aging process was very slow. Based on the current usage of the young men, it was estimated that the spiritual brains would completely collapse and lose function in about five hundred years. But such a flaw was nothing to Suhao, he only needed a thought to update his own spiritual brain.</p><p></p><p>As for other aspects, there were no abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Even the 'thought extension' problem inherent to soul power was solved by the 'Xiu Hun Lu' heavenly soul power method.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Suhao gathered all the young men and said, "Our experiment ends here. Now, return to your world and embark on your brilliant life! As long as you live the way you want, that is success!"</p><p></p><p>The young men kowtowed in unison, "We obey the will of the God Lord."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Feng Cheng sent all of them away.</p><p></p><p>The experimental base returned to its former tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Master Wei, how is your experiment progressing?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Still quite smoothly, but it still needs a period of observation. How is your planet remodeling going?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Also quite smoothly, we've already deployed the 'Remodeling Cubes', and are now waiting for the drastic environmental changes to stabilize and reach a new balance. It will probably take a hundred years. Master Ya Shan and I are designing plans for the future development directions based on the different situations of each planet.</p><p></p><p>For example, 'Magic World', 'Technology World', 'Cultivation World', 'Prop World', 'Game World', 'Martial Arts World', 'Physical Development World', 'Rune World', 'Ghost World', 'Zhu Huan Human World', 'Elf World', 'Beast Tribe World'...these are just broad categories, they can be further subdivided to ensure that every civilization on each planet is different.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the races on the Cruciform Stars are quite different from what we've encountered before, so we're trying to modify various races at the genetic level to adapt to the new environments..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng and Ya Shan were afraid Suhao wouldn't ask about their work progress, but as soon as he did, they couldn't help but pour out all their achievements and plans.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily, "Not bad, not bad, you two really are very reliable in getting things done."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a wait of a hundred years, even if it took thousands of years, it wouldn't mean much to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>The next thing he had to do would span an extremely long period of time, preliminarily estimated to be on the scale of tens of thousands of years as the basic unit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, having obtained soul power in this life, he had absolute confidence that he could live for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Feng Cheng, if you encounter any difficulties, you can come find me at any time."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Suhao knew that creating an ecological civilization sounded simple, but in reality it wouldn't be that easy. Not to mention the enthusiastic 'world settings' Feng Cheng and the others were making - it would already be very impressive if they could successfully complete even one or two.</p><p></p><p>Although the three of them appeared extremely powerful, the knowledge they grasped was still very limited, far from reaching the level of 'omnipotence'.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "This world-building can be regarded as a refinement of my own knowledge, fusing all these disjointed and scattered bits of knowledge into one cohesive system, elevating it to a new level. In the process of world-building, many deficiencies will inevitably be exposed, which I can then solve one by one. In this way, my knowledge system will be continuously deepened through 'application and correction'. It's killing multiple birds with one stone."</p><p></p><p>His consciousness returned to his young dragon body, and he opened his eyes and started pacing around.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it could no longer be considered a young dragon, but rather an adolescent giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>This was a formidable beast fifteen meters long. Its belly had turned golden, the red on its sides had deepened, and its back was a dark blackish-red color. Orderly arranged scales glistened with a metallic luster. Two long, sharp horns protruded from its forehead towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>A ferocious aura emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>Although Suhao had inhabited this giant dragon body for over twenty years, he still didn't feel quite accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>It was too huge, too cumbersome. The agile human form was much more handy to use.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his claw and touched his chin, muttering to himself, "Why don't I take this opportunity to have a good rest, and transform this dragon body into a human form while I'm at it?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to act, he suddenly thought of the mother dragon Shadu and the two young dragons, and mused, "It's been a long time since I've seen Mother Dragon Shadu. I wonder how they're doing now? Why don't I go visit them first, then come back and change my dragon body?"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Suhao closed his eyes and controlled a divine clone, transforming into the appearance of an adolescent dragon and searching for the locator stone left with the mother dragon.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport!'</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his divine sense, he immediately saw the sleeping Mother Dragon Shadu lying nearby.</p><p></p><p>The other two young dragons were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shadu woke up from the movement, turned her head towards Suhao with an alert look on her face, and immediately stood up warily.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Mother Shadu, it's me, Lei'an. Long time no see."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shadu's eyes widened in disbelief, "You are...Lei'an, my child Lei'an?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "It's me."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shadu flew over, circling around Suhao and scrutinizing him carefully. Then she hugged Suhao tightly, with tears welling up in the corners of her eyes, though she held them back from falling.</p><p></p><p>Suhao curiously asked, "Mother Shadu, where are Chipu and Moli? I haven't seen them at all."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shadu was both excited and saddened, "Chipu and Moli left a long time ago. After they learned to fly, they left and never came back. Chipu said he wanted to go out and experience the world, to learn more skills. He also said he wanted to find the God you captured - your brother Chipu thinks you, the great demon king Lei'an, have captured a God. He aspires to defeat you and rescue the God..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao, "......"</p>

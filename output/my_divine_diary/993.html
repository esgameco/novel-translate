        <h1>Chapter 993</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Yashan Fengcheng talked for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They discussed some interesting things that happened in the past, the people they had encountered before, what they might encounter in the future, and how to always maintain their current positive mindset...</p><p></p><p>It was mostly Suhao speaking, while Yashan and Fengcheng listened, like an elder passing on experience to his juniors.</p><p></p><p>Yashan hadn't experienced a scene like this for a long time. At this moment, sitting casually on the ground, listening to Lao Da's aimless chatter, Yashan felt extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely reminiscent of when he had first met Lao Da, when he was still completely clueless, just an ordinary Zhuhuo person.</p><p></p><p>Later, for some inexplicable reason, he became the leader of the Silin Society. Whenever he encountered a problem, he would run to ask Lao Da what to do. At that time, just like now, Lao Da would patiently and meticulously teach him, analyze for him why he should do it that way, what results to expect, what issues to pay attention to in the process...</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought to himself: "Compared to Fengcheng whose luck in finding planets has been explosively good, perhaps I am the luckiest one in the infinite universe. I can't imagine that I would actually receive such patient guidance from Lao Da, going from a completely ignorant Zhuhuo person to what I am now. What merit do I, Yashan, have..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fengcheng was also quietly listening to Suhao speak, his eyes full of spirit as he looked into the distant sea level, his whole body extremely relaxed. He thought that actually, it wouldn't be bad if things stayed like this forever.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't know what they were thinking, he just continued along his train of thought: "Even we have the risk of getting lost in the distant future, not to mention your disciples.</p><p></p><p>The time is still short now, so it's not apparent yet. But as time goes on, there will inevitably be some psychological problems that even the most strong-willed person cannot avoid.</p><p></p><p>For example, one day they might suddenly become weary of the endless journey of exploration and no longer want to carry out exploration missions. Or some disciples might feel they have no regrets in life and want to find a place in the universe to live a pastoral life away from our organization. Or one day, a disciple might start to doubt the meaning of what we're doing...</p><p></p><p>These things are bound to happen, and there will be even more complicated problems that we cannot foresee.</p><p></p><p>After all, these are people that we have led onto this path. Whether this is what they really want, we actually don't know. Only they themselves know their true ideals clearly.</p><p></p><p>So I think, in the future, we may need to give these disciples a dignified way to exit and leave when they become weary, so that after they figure out their own pursuits, they can pursue the meaning of their lives without any misgivings.</p><p></p><p>Our team exploring the universe should naturally be as large as possible. But for those whose goals ultimately do not align with ours, we should not and do not need to forcefully keep them.</p><p></p><p>Now that you have built your own trial paradise, you will have an influx of fresh blood joining at regular intervals, so you don't need to worry about manpower issues if disciples leave..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Suhao's considerations, Yashan couldn't help but nod in agreement.</p><p></p><p>According to Yashan's previous thinking, once someone joined his Wuqiong Gate, there was no need to even think about leaving. As long as they properly completed the exploration missions, the "dignified exit" that Lao Da mentioned was not even worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Yashan's view, the skills and long lifespan that the Wuqiong Gate disciples possessed were all given by Lao Da. Without Lao Da, they would have turned to dust over 8,000 years ago without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Since they had taken Lao Da's knowledge and enjoyed a long life, they had to exchange something of equal value.</p><p></p><p>However, Yashan felt that what he thought didn't matter. Everything would follow Lao Da's will. Since Lao Da said that in the future there would be a dignified way for disciples to exit, then he would think carefully about how to do it when he returned.</p><p></p><p>It was Fengcheng who didn't understand: "The disciples would want to leave our organization? Where could they go if they left us?"</p><p></p><p>Without the teleportation device, the disciples would be immobile in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Even something as simple as crossing galaxies seemed extremely difficult, because each long-distance "network transmission" required Suhao's conversion program.</p><p></p><p>In other words, without the teleportation device, the disciples would lose their identity as "wanderers."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled: "After there are more disciples and time has passed, there are bound to be some people whose thoughts differ from ours. Moreover, after leaving us, they can still live freely and rule over the Infinite Land. This is arguably an ideal life."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "In that case, these disciples who have left us would be invincible on the Infinite Land. The damage to the balance of the Infinite Land would be too severe, especially with their spatial abilities - to ordinary beings, they would be an invincible existence without any solution."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Fengcheng suddenly said: "Lao Da, Lao Da Yashan, do you still remember the 'spatial interference device' that the Eight-Handed Tribe used to suppress the curvature flight of spaceships in the previous life?"</p><p></p><p>Of course Suhao and Yashan remembered, and they had mastered the technology.</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "What are you thinking of doing, Fengcheng?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed: "Back then, I lost quite a few [God] avatars under the Eight-Handed Tribe's 'spatial interference device', so I remember it very clearly.</p><p></p><p>If you install a spatial interference device on a planet, it can cause the space around that star domain to become chaotic, making it difficult to use spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>So, two Lao Das, do you think it's necessary to install a high-powered spatial interference device on each planet in the Infinite Land?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the spatial interference device would need to avoid the world passages and transmission arrays, but solving this technical problem shouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed: "I didn't expect you to be so ruthless towards your own disciples, Fengcheng, that you'd actually want to restrict their spatial abilities."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's eyes lit up: "This idea is not bad! If the Infinite Land restricts the disciples' spatial abilities, then the disciples will definitely not want to stay in the Infinite Land, but will venture out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for those disciples who leave gracefully and return to the Infinite Land, there will also be some restrictions to prevent them from causing trouble."</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "You two don't need to go through so much trouble to guard against your own disciples..."</p><p></p><p>To Suhao, it was fine to just let things happen naturally. Any future occurrence, except for the destruction of the Ping-Pong Space that would lead to his complete demise, he could accept and even look forward to.</p><p></p><p>If everything proceeded perfectly according to expectations, then there would be less fun in the unknown.</p><p></p><p>As for Yashan and Fengcheng's idea of establishing a 'spatial restriction zone' in the Infinite Land, Suhao didn't explicitly object either.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yashan and Fengcheng subconsciously considered problems from Suhao's perspective, safeguarding his interests, so he had no reason to object.</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed: "It is still necessary to put in some effort to prevent the disciples from disrupting the Infinite Land, after all, this is the 'root' that we three have built."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "As long as it doesn't affect the free exchange within the Infinite Land, you two can go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked at each other and smiled. A plan for a spatial restriction zone was gradually taking shape in their minds.</p><p></p><p>They decided to personally set this up themselves, hiding the spatial interference devices so that no one could find them.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they didn't know what kind of expression the disciples of the Wuqiong Gate and Double Sword Gate would have when they suddenly discovered that their spatial abilities didn't work in the Infinite Land...</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also didn't know if the Great Demon King Chipu would be dumbfounded when he found he couldn't use the locator stone to return from the demon realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Yashan and Fengcheng left, Suhao found a quiet place again and silently pondered some issues.</p><p></p><p>He keenly noticed some changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>"Since there are no more external threats, my heart has completely calmed down, and I am also more willing to consider the thoughts of others."</p><p></p><p>In the past, he would never have considered issues like the disciples' "dignified exit."</p><p></p><p>Now that he had attained eternal life, he began to ponder issues related to the mind, such as "independent life" and "independent will." He believed that everyone's thoughts and desires should be respected, and the development of the universe should be allowed to happen naturally...</p><p></p><p>As for the power he possessed, it should be used to satisfy his own thoughts and ideals. Apart from that, he should not use his power to do unnecessary things, such as using force to make others change their beliefs, using force to coerce others' behavior, or using force to control others' love and hatred...</p><p></p><p>Simply put, when everything slowed down, Suhao found that his mind had become more open, like the legendary supreme spiritual state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The next step might be for Suhao to explore the meaning of life, then the meaning of matter, and then the meaning of the universe...</p><p></p><p>In theory, there would be no end.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took a deep breath, feeling the warm evening breeze enter his lungs, and then exhaled slowly.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a smile: "This feeling of breathing is the pulse of life."</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Land had been built for a long time, but he had not yet "walked the land" himself. Taking the rare opportunity to relax today, he started to wander aimlessly to various places.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, Suhao returned to the experimental base and began preparing for his next plan - the exile of avatars.</p><p></p><p>This was a plan he had made a long time ago - to produce a large number of rudimentary avatars that could carry fragments of his consciousness, and randomly exile them to the unknown regions of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't know where these avatars would be sent - perhaps to a vast empty space devoid of matter, perhaps directly into the interior of a star. The lucky ones might even be sent straight into a black hole...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of possibilities existed. What Suhao needed to do was produce enough avatars and continuously send them out.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if every place was the same monotonous starry universe.</p><p></p><p>What if he discovered somewhere different?</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll research new knowledge while producing and randomly sending out exile avatars. Then, I'll quietly wait for the Ping-Pong Space to reincarnate the consciousness package I've prepared into another world."</p><p></p><p>In all matters of the world, there is always a need to "wait."</p>

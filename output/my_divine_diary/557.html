        <h1>Chapter 557</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>That year, Su Hao encountered quite a few bizarre disasters. While resolving these bizarre disasters, he harvested many corresponding source artifacts. After some basic research, he gained a certain understanding of how to trigger these special abilities.</p><p></p><p>First, he had confirmed one thing: 'Source' is neither matter nor energy, but rather the critical point of transformation between matter and energy, simultaneously satisfying the mass-energy equivalence equation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as one masters the corresponding methods, one can obtain sufficient energy by expending matter.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, one can also convert energy into corresponding matter.</p><p></p><p>However, converting energy into matter would be more complex, because 'energy' itself is intangible - it is merely a 'state of motion' that can be observed but not held in one's hands. Moreover, this state of motion still requires some entity to serve as a carrier.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the best approach is to convert matter into 'source', and then convert the source into desired specific substances like blood energy, spiritual power, special elements, etc.</p><p></p><p>If needed, one could first convert matter into source, and then convert the source into pure energy to be released.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as there is matter, one could theoretically achieve anything through source, including the creation of the world described in mythology.</p><p></p><p>The deeper Su Hao's understanding of source became, the more excited he felt. If he could unravel the mysteries of source, he would achieve another qualitative leap, completely freeing himself from dependence on any environment and boldly venturing into the vast depths of space without any constraints.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was matter, he would be omnipotent, even gaining an extremely long lifespan, never falling into slumber again!</p><p></p><p>He slowly clenched his fist: "I must decipher it!"</p><p></p><p>"But I can't do it alone. Although I've guessed the essence of source, my understanding of it is still very superficial. I need to conduct more experiments to master its properties. I need to understand the developmental history of this world. I need to study the treasures left behind by the predecessors of this world. I need to go into space and understand the special nature of this universe..."</p><p></p><p>And for now, these source artifacts have become his best experimental materials.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that the secret of source transformation lies hidden within these source artifacts.</p><p></p><p>So the question is, how are these bizarre disasters generated and realized?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the image of Feng Cheng popped into Su Hao's mind: "Hey! Isn't Feng Cheng an illusionist source mage? It's time to call him back to do experiments with me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The small town of Huai Shui only had two main streets running horizontally and vertically, with all other paths being small alleys. As always, it remained tranquil. The sturdy brick houses were scattered about, exuding a unique rural charm. No matter how many disasters struck and caused destruction, as long as people were still alive, they would swiftly rebuild and restore their peaceful lives.</p><p></p><p>The big dog lay calmly on its belly by the second floor window, its spiritual eyes gazing into the distance as if able to see through the small town, through the mountains and rivers, and all the way to where its master was far away.</p><p></p><p>How it wished to run out into the world with its young master and frolic. But the young master had instructed it before that its duty was to guard the house and wait for their return. It remembered this well!</p><p></p><p>It saw the young master's figure!</p><p></p><p>The dog suddenly pushed off with its front legs, retreating from the window. It scampered downstairs halfway, but then became unsure and turned back, once again sticking its head out the window to look carefully.</p><p></p><p>No mistake, that was indeed the young master!</p><p></p><p>It raced downstairs at top speed, out the door, tongue lolling as it charged towards the young master.</p><p></p><p>As it got closer, it slammed on the brakes, then lowered its head, waiting for the young master to place his small foot on its forehead.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily and didn't disappoint it, placing his foot on the dog's forehead affectionately.</p><p></p><p>This big dog, well-fed daily by Feng Cheng, had grown quite plump and full of vigor. The only thing lacking was a beautiful female dog companion - a major regret in a dog's life.</p><p></p><p>This dog was great in every way, except for being too honest and unwilling to go out and flirt with the lady dogs. Otherwise, with its formidable appearance, it could surely have sired many offspring.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao's daily routine, he was either busy with tasks running all over the world, or staying at the island base researching. Whenever he felt sleepy and wanted to rest, he would teleport back to the small building in Huai Shui Town to sleep. He had grown accustomed to this.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this big dog had gradually learned to handle some manageable miscellaneous tasks, allowing Su Hao to live quite comfortably.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had returned a bit early, intending to wait for the 'Feng Shan Yang Wang Xing Squad' to complete their mission, after which A-Xing would treat them to a meal. This would serve as a period at the end of his year of roaming and data collection. He also wanted to inquire about the recent situations of the four squad members.</p><p></p><p>The timing was perfect, as his radar had already detected traces of the squad.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao beckoned to the dog: "Come, let's go mooch a meal!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Huai En Small Tavern, soothing music flowed melodiously. There weren't many people, mostly regular old customers gathered in small groups, secretly savoring their leisure time.</p><p></p><p>The five squad members sat in a quiet corner, discussing the process of their recent mission in low voices, occasionally letting out proud laughter.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the proudest was A-Xing, constantly emphasizing how brilliant his leadership was. But as he laughed, his laughter gradually faded, his entire face crumpling as he mournfully said: "Brothers, I suddenly feel a bit lost and directionless. What should I do..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was puzzled: "Isn't everything going well? Aren't you progressing along the path of your dream? It won't be long before you become a world-renowned 'Bizarre Disaster Buster'. Even now, our squad's reputation has spread to various source mage associations, and many beautiful girls are trying to find ways to get information about your sleeping arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>A-Xing nodded but remained dejected: "That's true, it seems so perfect. But...it's completely different from what I imagined."</p><p></p><p>He pointed at Ya Shan and Feng Cheng: "Originally I thought there was probably only one peerless genius like A-Yang in this world. Being on the same squad as such a genius to carry out missions was an honor for me, and I was very happy. But what's going on with A-Shan and A-Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>A-Xing continued: "A-Yang, they're just as monstrous as you! Do you know how A-Wang and I spent this past year? We completely turned into spectators, watching them perform while applauding from the sidelines.</p><p></p><p>A-Wang and I haven't used our source abilities for almost a year!</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of disaster we encountered, just as we were about to show our stuff, A-Shan would say, 'I have a way to deal with this disaster, I can take care of it in ten seconds by making a guided missile to send it into the sky'.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes A-Cheng would also jump in and say, 'This is simple, I don't even need to take action, I can handle it perfectly in ten seconds'...</p><p></p><p>I used to always hear you say, 'I sense the aura of a source beast tens of thousands of meters away', 'I can sense the aura of source'. But A-Shan and A-Cheng went even further, directly saying, 'Target spotted, it's 150,000 meters away'...</p><p></p><p>What the heck, why can't I sense anything!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, he concluded: "If there was only you, A-Yang, as the peerless genius, I could still accept it and maintain some optimism and confidence. But suddenly realizing that these overwhelming geniuses are everywhere, I've completely lost confidence. Please come and console me, otherwise I have no motivation to move forward!"</p><p></p><p>A-Wang nodded in acknowledgment, his face full of sorrow, clearly having suffered a major blow over these years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao created a group chat and messaged: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, you two have gone too far! At least give them some opportunities to perform. Look at what you've done, you've crushed them!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately @Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, look at the mess you've made. Didn't I tell you to stop showing off your 'Mind's Eye' all the time? See, you've completely demoralized A-Xing and A-Wang."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked bewildered and sent a shocked emoji.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly Ya Shan who first flaunted his skills. Feng Cheng only couldn't resist jumping in after that.</p><p></p><p>But who made Ya Shan the leader?</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng sincerely said to A-Xing and A-Wang: "A-Xing, A-Wang, I deeply apologize for my genius."</p><p></p><p>A-Xing and A-Wang: "..."</p><p></p><p>Was an apology what they wanted? They wanted consolation!</p>

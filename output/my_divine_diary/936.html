        <h1>Chapter 936</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong thought to himself: "The meaning is 'don't come if you're afraid'...Afraid? I'm just afraid of not having a chance to be a hero and rescue the beauty."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he casually drove his motorcycle behind her, highly focused and ready to deal with anything that might happen.</p><p></p><p>He had full confidence in his driving skills.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Zhu Changdong noticed the fog ahead was even thicker, to the point he could barely see the ground. Listening to the engine sounds, they seemed deeper and more distant.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, it might be a cliff with a huge drop-off." Zhu Changdong's thoughts raced, his pupils constricting as he realized the danger.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly turned his head and yelled at the girl: "Be careful, there's a cliff ahead, stop quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The girl also sensed the danger and slammed on the brakes.</p><p></p><p>But the speed was too fast, it was already too late...</p><p></p><p>"Whoooshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The two motorcycles went flying off the cliff one after the other.</p><p></p><p>Then came the feeling of weightlessness as they fell.</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture, one thought flashed through Zhu Changdong's mind: "Protect her!"</p><p></p><p>Then his body reacted instinctively. Gripping the handlebars, he curled up his body, planted his feet on the seat, and adjusted his position to push off with his legs.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly launched himself towards the terrified girl, pulling her into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>Only at this moment did Zhu Changdong's mind clear up a bit, feeling the warmth in his arms, he couldn't help but think: "Damn, I regret this!"</p><p></p><p>But he had no intention of letting go. His mind raced, thinking about how to land in a way that would increase their chances of survival.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he felt his body slam into something.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!" Zhu Changdong sighed hopelessly, looks like the old man will have to come collect our corpses.</p><p></p><p>However, the intense pain and impact he was expecting never came. Instead, he found himself seemingly crashing into a soft, cottony surface before finally coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>An immense joy welled up in his heart, and his thoughts quickly turned: "Not dead, the school must have put protective measures under the cliff...No wonder it's Double Sword University, the highest academy, a gathering place for elites..."</p><p></p><p>"Hey! How long are you two planning to hug each other?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a slightly teasing male voice came from beside them. Zhu Changdong's eyes flew open.</p><p></p><p>He saw they were in a square room with grayish-white walls that gleamed with a metallic luster under the milky white light. A tall, handsome man stood beside them, smiling at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Let...let go~"</p><p></p><p>A faint, mosquito-like voice came from the girl in his arms.</p><p></p><p>It was the motorcycle girl, and the two of them were now embracing in a rather inappropriate position.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong wanted to imitate the male leads he'd seen on TV and flatly refuse to 'let go'. After all, he had embraced this girl through his own ability, why should he let go just because she said so?</p><p></p><p>But the girl hesitated only briefly before grabbing Zhu Changdong's hand and getting up.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong took off his helmet, then looked around the surroundings in amazement and said, "Where's the cotton? I clearly felt like I crashed into cotton just now, but now it's gone. What is this place?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed and said, "What cotton? I don't understand what you mean. This is the school ship, and it will be returning to campus soon. You two should go wait in the main hall outside. This is a place only professors can enter."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong was instantly confused. He scratched his head, looked around, then asked, "Are you a professor at Double Sword University? Did you save us? My name is Zhu Changdong, hello Professor."</p><p></p><p>"I am indeed a professor at Double Sword University, my name is Cong Renfei. You'll learn more later. For now, you should go outside." Cong Renfei shrugged, seeming not to understand what Zhu Changdong was talking about.</p><p></p><p>As they were about to leave, he suddenly pointed to the side and said, "Aren't those your motorcycles? Let's push them out together."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he opened the door and left.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and the motorcycle girl were left looking at each other in silence, glancing at each other and the motorcycles, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what had happened, feeling an inexplicable strangeness about everything.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "Let's go outside first!"</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl nodded, "Mm."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong first helped prop up the girl's motorcycle, then pushed his own motorcycle behind her as they exited, observing the condition of his ride.</p><p></p><p>There were no collision marks, but the wheels had mud, gravel, and some fresh leaves...</p><p></p><p>This showed that they had indeed been riding through the fog earlier. More importantly...</p><p></p><p>He looked again at the two footprints on the seat, undoubtedly left when he had launched himself out earlier.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly...happened?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spacecraft took off slowly, flying towards the school.</p><p></p><p>Inside the ship was an extremely large and spacious main hall, with some benches scattered about. The entire surrounding wall was made of glass, allowing a view of the scenery outside. Most of the students who had boarded had gathered at the floor-to-ceiling windows, excitedly looking out. It was very lively.</p><p></p><p>There were also beautiful robot maids serving various snacks for the students to take freely.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and the girl came to the main hall and parked their motorcycles before finding a spot to sit down.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Gong Jia'er," the motorcycle girl suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong looked at her breathtakingly beautiful face, every slight expression piercing straight into his heart. He couldn't help but break into a radiant smile, revealing a row of bright, even teeth.</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er looked at Zhu Changdong with bright eyes and said seriously, "Sorry."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong nodded and replied, "Yeah, I accept your apology, although I don't know why you're apologizing since I followed you of my own accord."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er nodded and gave a slight smile, then said, "Hey, Zhu Changdong, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "I won't accept your thanks unless..."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er asked curiously, "Unless what?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless you treat me to a skewer of octopus balls."</p><p></p><p>"Deal."</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, they somehow became good friends who would accompany each other everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The two went to the window and gazed out at the distant scenery. Zhu Changdong suddenly said, "Jia'er, we really did drive off that cliff earlier, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er carefully recalled and nodded, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>She inexplicably thought back to when Zhu Changdong had embraced her, and her face couldn't help but flush slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time a boy had held her like that, but in that moment of extreme danger, that embrace had given her an immense sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Now recalling it, she felt no dislike at all towards this dark-skinned young man Zhu Changdong.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong didn't notice Gong Jia'er's abnormality, instead whispering his analysis: "The traces on the motorcycles show that it wasn't a dream - we really were riding fast through the fog, then accidentally fell off the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when we fell, I felt like I crashed into cotton and came to a stable stop without getting hurt at all. But as soon as I opened my eyes, I saw that empty room.</p><p></p><p>Then Professor Cong said we had arrived on the spacecraft, which is simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>I think there's something not normal about this Double Sword University, it must be hiding some other secret."</p><p></p><p>After the earlier fright, Gong Jia'er had lost her initial swagger, but upon hearing Zhu Changdong bring it up, her curiosity that couldn't be suppressed welled up from the depths of her heart, and her bright eyes regained their luster.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "Jia'er, you came to stir up trouble, right? I'm interested now too, let's cooperate and uncover the secret this school is hiding, then stir up trouble together."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er extended her hand for a high-five: "Okay, let's work together to stir up trouble."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong high-fived her in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and snickered.</p><p></p><p>To them, the life-threatening danger from earlier didn't seem like that big of a deal.</p><p></p><p>The curiosity and desire for adventure in their hearts overshadowed everything else.</p><p></p><p>For people like them, they wouldn't stop their reckless behavior until they were truly dead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, then turned to Feng Cheng beside him and said, "Feng Cheng, someone is claiming they'll stir up trouble for you. Don't you want to respond?"</p><p></p><p>After visiting Infinite University and Double Sword University, both Yashan and Feng Cheng had been utterly exasperated by the antics of their own disciples.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that the universities their disciples had created would be so 'low-key', even deploying large-scale formations surrounding the schools and 3D virtual projections enveloping the entire campus area for publicity.</p><p></p><p>Even more over-the-top was using spaceships to transport new students...</p><p></p><p>This level of extravagance, are they trying to ruin this world?</p><p></p><p>But hearing the amused laughter of the Venerable One, any dissatisfaction in their hearts immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled and said, "If those two are willing, I could teach them how to stir up trouble for me. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "The new students this year are not bad overall, full of vitality. That desire to explore the unknown is practically overflowing from their youthful faces. I can't help but want to personally guide some students myself."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Why don't we each open an elective course at the school this year? I've also taken a liking to a few students. To be honest, these newly admitted ones are far superior in quality compared to our group of disciples."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and nodded, "It's just not clear if their ideals align with ours."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Double Sword Sect's meeting hall.</p><p></p><p>After listening to the other disciples' reports, Cong Shuling couldn't help but laugh happily, "Our ships are bigger than Infinite University's. Hahaha, we won and made our master proud."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked at his sister, feeling something wasn't quite right. Didn't they agree to run the school low-profile? If the master saw this spectacle, who knows what he would think.</p><p></p><p>But seeing his sister's look of delight, he didn't have the heart to say anything. What's done is done, let it be.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples cheered loudly, "The great senior brother is wise!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Wang Yuanshu sat to the side expressionless, thinking to himself, "I should keep my distance from this bunch in the future..."</p>

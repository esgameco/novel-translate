        <h1>Chapter 633</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>What preparations are needed to land on other planets?</p><p></p><p>Does even the top-notch spacesuit have an indestructible armor as sturdy and flexible as his? For radiation protection, he also has a 'fragile shell defense' that can provide all-around, seamless shielding. Extreme heat or cold cannot affect him in the slightest. Any necessary materials can be converted from other substances or sources.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't figure out what dangers he might encounter!</p><p></p><p>Suhao retrieved the planetary motion data recorded by Feng Cheng and found that in five days, a planet called 'Keystar' would be relatively close to the source planet he was on, only 70 million kilometers away. So he decided to depart in five days, using the 'positioning teleportation technology' he had researched in his previous life to teleport near that planet.</p><p></p><p>"This counts as the first ultra-long-distance space journey, doesn't it? Not a bad start."</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Suhao transformed into [Destiny Child], donned a full set of defensive formations, and used the 'positioning teleportation auxiliary device' at the experimental base to teleport about 100,000 kilometers from Keystar, observing the seemingly truck-sized reddish planet not far ahead.</p><p></p><p>This planet was slightly smaller than the source planet in volume, with a smaller orbital radius. Red and yellow were the main colors of the entire planet, interspersed with some white, drifting quietly in the vast emptiness of space, extremely beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The sun-facing side was brightly lit, with all kinds of ridges, mountains, and canyons visible.</p><p></p><p>The dark side was pitch black, with only a dull yellow glow at the boundary between night and day, like a mysterious, fantasy world.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many years this planet has been revolving around the massive star, lonely yet active. Now, perhaps it was welcoming the first visit from an intelligent life form, observing it from afar, feeling its incomparable beauty!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps a planet is a special kind of life, it's just that I have no way to communicate with it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao revealed a smile: "I wonder what it would think if it knew I was going to punch it next."</p><p></p><p>If the planet knew Suhao's thoughts, perhaps it would say disdainfully: "Come on, punch me, let me hear you call out that I've lost!"</p><p></p><p>From Suhao's perspective, Keystar didn't seem far, but it was actually extremely distant. The saying "running a horse to death to reach the mountain" would be considered a very close comparison to the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Not just running a horse to death - at this distance, even a stallion would be run to death. And if the stallion died, its offspring would continue running until the entire breed went extinct, probably still without reaching the destination.</p><p></p><p>Even if Suhao flew at full speed, constantly accelerating, from the cosmic perspective he would appear motionless...</p><p></p><p>The vast expanse of cosmic space makes one feel so powerless!</p><p></p><p>He could flash-teleport 200,000 meters, or 200 kilometers at a time. Continuously flashing for about two hours would get him there!</p><p></p><p>Suhao floated in space, observing the surroundings. The empty void had nothing worth noting, so without further thought, he began deploying negative space modules to flash-teleport towards Keystar.</p><p></p><p>Each flash covered 200 kilometers - this time, from the cosmic perspective, Suhao was finally moving...</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao expected, two hours later he arrived at this reddish-yellow planet.</p><p></p><p>But observing it up close felt different from viewing it from afar.</p><p></p><p>From a human aesthetic perspective, this planet could only be appreciated from a distance. As the saying goes, distance creates beauty, and it was indeed true.</p><p></p><p>Because up close, one would discover that this planet was covered in desolate yellow sand and monotonous rocks - an utterly hopeless place where no ordinary life could survive even a day.</p><p></p><p>On the sun-facing surface, temperatures were extremely high, initially measured at nearly 100 degrees Celsius. Fierce winds constantly swept across, kicking up parched dust in a raging howl.</p><p></p><p>The white patches observed from space earlier were not clouds, but smoke from volcanic eruptions, spreading across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Pah!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao's feet landed on this planet, leaving two human footprints - a moment worth recording in history, a moment of great human glory and pride...</p><p></p><p>Ahem, got carried away there!</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't rush to punch the planet beneath his feet. Instead, he flew around, recording the various terrain and landforms, using his divine consciousness to sense the flow of energy on the planet, searching for any potential disasters.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of 'disasters', from a human perspective, the surface of this planet was already experiencing 'minor disasters', with some localized 'disasters' even more severe than those on the source planet.</p><p></p><p>However, these disasters were different from those on the source planet - Suhao couldn't find any corresponding 'focal system' for the disasters here.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, as I thought, the special nature of the source planet is a coincidence in the universe's birth, unrelated to this part of cosmic space."</p><p></p><p>In just one day, Suhao had basically explored the entire planet, leaving many positioning stones to facilitate travel between the source planet and this one.</p><p></p><p>He hovered in mid-air, ready to begin his planet-punching experiment.</p><p></p><p>"Step one, test whether I can obtain sources by utilizing the focal system with materials from Keystar."</p><p></p><p>If only materials from the source planet could be converted to sources, then he would have to drag the entire source planet with him.</p><p></p><p>The test results came back quickly - without exception, materials from Keystar could also be converted into sources. This put his mind at ease: "Steady now!"</p><p></p><p>"Step two, test the explosive power of directly converting sources into energy."</p><p></p><p>Suhao took out a high-quality source pearl and, using his vast spiritual power, mobilized all the sources within in an extremely short time, completely draining the high-quality source pearl.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, an extremely dazzling 'sun' floated above Suhao's palm, its light engulfing his entire body.</p><p></p><p>This was a semi-activated state of sources converted by Suhao using most of his spiritual power. With just a thought from this 'explosion source mage', the 'sun' would fully erupt, releasing all its energy in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Suhao didn't dare throw it down directly, instead flying higher to maintain a safe distance before tossing the 'sun' down.</p><p></p><p>"Swish--"</p><p></p><p>The 'sun' transformed into a thick beam of light, drilling deep into the ground. When the trail of light disappeared along its path, Suhao activated a thought, fully igniting that 'sun'.</p><p></p><p>Keystar's reddish-yellow ground suddenly shook violently, then rose up high like a geography teacher demonstrating the collision of two continents in a classroom PPT - as if a continuous mountain range burst forth from the ground in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But just as the mountain range formed, it immediately shattered and bloomed in the next moment. Countless rays of light pierced through the mountains, shining outwards, until the newly risen mountains and land were completely engulfed by the dazzling radiance.</p><p></p><p>The light formed a spherical shape, expanding enormously until it was half-embedded in the reddish-yellow ground.</p><p></p><p>It was like the sun had fallen to the ground, blasting out a crater.</p><p></p><p>"Wooong--"</p><p></p><p>Suhao immediately sensed an intense shockwave sweeping past, blocked by his 'fragile shell defense' as he steadily hovered in the air. In that instant when the shockwave passed, it was as if the world had lost its voice, utterly silent - even the raging winds from before had quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Extreme motion - extreme stillness, then back to extreme motion!</p><p></p><p>The transition from motion to stillness happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The intense radiance dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The world-shattering shockwave spread outwards, the ground cracking layer by layer. Countless rocks instantly turned to powder, swept away to unknown places, becoming mere specks of dust on this planet.</p><p></p><p>The previously lingering smoke was cleared out by the explosion in an instant, only to be refilled with even more smoke in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao waited calmly in the air until the smoke was once again blown away by the increasingly ferocious winds, surveying the massive crater below.</p><p></p><p>The explosive power was far greater than his ten-thousand explosions, comparable to a large meteor strike that blasted out a huge crater. If the power was any stronger, the planet's molten core might have erupted.</p><p></p><p>However, such power was still far too insignificant against an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>It was like using a fingernail clipper to snip off the tip of a giant's body hair.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but swear: "Damn it, an explosion that seemed so powerful only blasted out this tiny crater! Thinking I could destroy a planet with this, I was dreaming too big!"</p><p></p><p>If some planet had consciousness, it would surely scoff at this moment: "That's it? Come on, keep up your performance, just let me hear you admit defeat!"</p>

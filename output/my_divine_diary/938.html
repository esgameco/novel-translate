        <h1>Chapter 938</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The start of the new semester passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>After the proactive reports from Fairy King Vali and others, not only did Yashan not blame them further, but he actually got closer to his disciples.</p><p></p><p>When communicating about the three systems with Feng Cheng, he would even seek out his own disciples to jointly discuss some of the details that were difficult to clearly define boundaries for. This made the disciples feel unexpectedly favored.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other disciples looked at Sea King Yuan Shu, who proposed this plan, with even more respect.</p><p></p><p>After officially starting the semester, Yashan opened a course at the Infinite University called 'Exploring the Power of the Human Spiritual World', with the goal of finding ultimate human happiness as the course objective. He specially recruited students interested in spirit and will, in order to cultivate talents and deeply excavate more functions of the 'Source Mage' of the Illusion System.</p><p></p><p>What Yashan wanted deep down was a spell called the 'Word Spirit Art' or 'Words Become Reality' from the 'Illusion System Spells'.</p><p></p><p>This was his ultimate goal in researching the 'Source Power of the Illusion System'. He also firmly believed that he could achieve such an effect using the Source.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng, on the other hand, opened a course called 'Evolution of Life and Genetic Engineering' at the Twin Sword University, seeking out students interested in genetics to cultivate them and jointly explore more secrets contained within genes.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he spent thousands of years researching genetic technology, reaching the level of directly cultivating the [Egg God] from giant bird eggs. But precisely because he researched so deeply, he realized the secrets contained within genes were far beyond what he knew, with many more unknown secrets waiting for him to discover. This required a professional team.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, after some thought, he didn't directly open a course, but instead built a special game space called the 'Balance Game' in a corner of the two universities.</p><p></p><p>He simulated the principle of orbital feedback existing in the galaxy and designed a game of walking across a tightrope bridge. Various messy obstacles were placed around the tightrope, which could not be avoided when crossing.</p><p></p><p>Then he set detailed rules and instructions. Simply put, if you hit an obstacle, it would trigger the balance mechanism connected to that obstacle, causing attacks from other obstacles. The deeper you went on the tightrope bridge, the stronger the attacks. Being knocked off the bridge was considered a failure, while successfully crossing was a challenge completed.</p><p></p><p>The game seemed simple, but it was Su Hao's careful design, highly similar to the Misfortune System - you couldn't avoid collisions, so you couldn't avoid attacks or successfully cross the bridge.</p><p></p><p>One could say this was a simplified version of the Misfortune System. Solving this game might solve Su Hao's orbital problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hoped to observe the ideas of other talents through this game, in anticipation of gaining some inspiration from them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, any gameplay that broke the rules was not up for discussion, just like if we agreed to a 1v1 match but you barged into my house with a greatsword, smashed my computer, and then went back to defeat me.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's 'Balance Game' was quickly set up. After multiple tests without issues, he hung a 'Surprise Grand Prize for Successful Challenges' banner and opened it to the public.</p><p></p><p>Although the game was located in a corner of Twin Sword University, it was soon discovered by a group of students keen on campus adventures.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it attracted many curious students to try, but without exception, they all failed miserably, exclaiming that it was impossible for anyone to succeed unless they could teleport.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the game's popularity waned, with fewer and fewer people coming to challenge it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After class that day, Zhu Changdong drove up on his Sun King motorcycle, making a drifting stop in front of Gong Jia'er and handing her a helmet, saying: "Jia'er, hop on, I'll take you to a fun place."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er flashed a smile, took the helmet without hesitation, and skillfully hopped onto Zhu Changdong's bike.</p><p></p><p>"Vroom vroomâ€”"</p><p></p><p>With a low engine roar, they sped off.</p><p></p><p>Other students who saw this looked on enviously.</p><p></p><p>"Such a pretty girl, yet she's with that piece of crap. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"I can't see what's so great about that guy. Plus his face is dark and ugly. Nowadays a flower really is paired with cow dung."</p><p></p><p>"Jealousy is distorting my face. I don't understand where I lost out."</p><p></p><p>"A Sun King motorcycle! I finally understand what people mean when they say 'having a car helps you pick up girls' in college. It's really true."</p><p></p><p>"Seems like they're the only two in the whole school with motorcycles? I can't figure out how they got them onto campus."</p><p></p><p>"I reported it before, but it was no use, so you can think about it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"I can't take it anymore, I'm extremely angry now. I need to go to the library and read some books to calm my frustration."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the motorcycle stopped, they took off their helmets. Gong Jia'er looked at the huge building in front of them and asked doubtfully: "This is...the 'Balance Game' that became really popular recently? I've only heard about it, but never been."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong smiled: "This is my first time too. Let's go in and play? Apparently this game is very difficult, and no one has been able to solve it yet. Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er also became interested: "Okay, let's go check it out."</p><p></p><p>This building, as huge as a gymnasium, didn't have any locks on the doors, allowing free entry and exit. There was a large sign next to the entrance with the game principles and rules written on it.</p><p></p><p>"No one else is here? Meaning we can move freely."</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading through, Zhu Changdong grinned: "Crossing a tightrope bridge? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The two came to a platform and looked at the scene before them, their eyes widening in amazement: "Wow, this is so grand! I can't imagine the school would spend so much money creating a game like this. What's the point?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the building was a vast space, with countless steel wires hanging down from the domed ceiling. Attached to the ends of the wires were balls of various sizes and colors, densely packed and nearly filling the entire view.</p><p></p><p>From this end of the platform, a tightrope bridge as thick as a thigh extended inwards, disappearing into the hanging ball cluster.</p><p></p><p>They guessed the other end of the tightrope led to a platform similar to this one. If they crossed the bridge to the other side, they would be considered to have completed the challenge successfully.</p><p></p><p>Below was a shallow pool filled with small balls the size of fists, similar to those found in children's playgrounds, to prevent injury from falls.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong: "Jia'er, shall we go onto the bridge and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er: "Who goes first?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong extended his hand: "What do you mean who goes first? Of course together, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er always felt there was something not so simple about this guy, but she didn't refuse, directly grabbing his dark and thick hand to follow him onto the tightrope bridge.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they stepped onto it, they inevitably bumped into the hanging balls, causing them to sway.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong chuckled: "My balance is really strong, these little balls can't stop me."</p><p></p><p>He slowly took a few more steps forward, pushing aside the hanging balls blocking his way.</p><p></p><p>Then the two of them felt like all the hanging balls in the entire space started moving.</p><p></p><p>As they went deeper, the surrounding balls began hitting their bodies. At first it didn't feel like much, but the further they went, the stronger the impact force became. Gradually they felt immense pressure and started swaying, losing their balance.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A few balls struck them together, knocking them off the tightrope bridge.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong instinctively hugged Gong Jia'er as they fell into the pool below.</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er: "Changdong, are you taking advantage of me? The pool bottom is just cotton balls, yet you're hugging me so tightly..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong helped Gong Jia'er up: "No, it was just an instinctive reaction, a habit!"</p><p></p><p>After climbing back onto the platform, they looked at the hanging balls and tightrope bridge in amazement. The balls had returned to a stationary state, and they finally understood the meaning of the rules.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we walk across the tightrope bridge and bump into these balls, it will trigger a chain reaction with all the balls, becoming more and more intense, eventually knocking us off the bridge. How is this achieved? It's so incredible."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er also became interested: "You stay here and don't move. I'll go try it myself."</p><p></p><p>Then she carefully tried to go inwards while avoiding the hanging balls as much as possible. Although petite, she still inevitably bumped into many balls and was quickly pushed into the pool by the force of the other balls.</p><p></p><p>After a while, all the balls returned to a stationary state once more.</p><p></p><p>The two of them tried multiple more times after that, but they couldn't go very far before being knocked off the tightrope bridge by the balls.</p><p></p><p>As they climbed out of the pool again, Zhu Changdong looked at the scene before him, his eyes gradually lighting up: "Jia'er, I think I understand why it can knock us off now."</p>

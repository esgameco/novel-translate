        <h1>Chapter 712</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After various attempts, Su Hao could not maintain the stability of the spatial bubble, which lost balance and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The collapse produced a huge chaotic energy burst, instantly shredding the avatar of the "Eight-Armed God" within the small world.</p><p></p><p>In that moment of spatial instability, space-time fell into extreme suppression and distortion, causing him to lose control over the rhythms of the spatial module. Neither the "second-level space" nor the "counter-spatial barrier" functioned anymore.</p><p></p><p>The greater the curvature of the Starlight Roaming, the more devastating the instability would be after losing balance. Even Su Hao did not know how powerful a body would be required to remain intact under such twisted forces.</p><p></p><p>However, having the body of an "Eight-Armed God" allowed Su Hao to test all possible scenarios Starlight Roaming could encounter, ensuring future travel safety - which was extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>After this "Eight-Armed God" was destroyed, Su Hao did not plan to stop experimenting with Starlight Roaming. He controlled another "Eight-Armed God" from the warehouse to come out. Under the dazed gazes of Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, it began warming up, then teleported to the supply planet again.</p><p></p><p>This time, there were no Eight-Armed clan warships in sight. Perhaps the few inexplicable deaths made the clan give up on this planet. Or maybe they planned to send stronger and more warships?</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao returned to space, testing the various uses of Starlight Roaming.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this skill had to reach the level where a thought could traverse millions of miles in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Not yet. He had to follow the steps, gradually building up Starlight Roaming, taking about thirty seconds from preparation to activation.</p><p></p><p>However, with more uses, his understanding of Starlight Roaming would deepen, and the activation speed would get faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Activating Starlight Roaming to freely roam the universe with a flick of the hand was not a dream.</p><p></p><p>After fully mastering this skill, his level of existence would no longer be a planetary being, but a galactic being.</p><p></p><p>The entire vast galaxy would be open for him to come and go freely.</p><p></p><p>As for when he could traverse galaxies...</p><p></p><p>Ahem! We'll talk about that later! Even if he mastered faster-than-light travel, the distances between major galaxies would still be impassable.</p><p></p><p>The average distance between galaxies in the universe is about 2-4 million light-years, meaning Su Hao would need to travel via Starlight Roaming for thousands of years to reach another galaxy...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made one's head spin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was wandering alone in the Cloud Ring system, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were muttering about how to dismantle the Eight-Armed clan's warship.</p><p></p><p>After much effort, they realized their own knowledge was too limited to figure out how to start.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked puzzled at the huge spacecraft in front of him and muttered, "Big bro Ya Shan, why don't we just use brute force to take it apart? Give me a moment and I can reduce it to pieces."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Nonsense, if we reduce it to pieces, why would we need you to do it?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng patted the ship's hull and said helplessly, "Then what should we do? We can't just stare at it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan flew a circle around the massive spacecraft, pondered for a moment and said, "No choice, we'll have to start learning the manufacturing technology for spaceships from scratch. There's a lot of very advanced technology inside worth studying. We'll learn while dismantling it!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Big bro Ya Shan, that's too slow! By the time the Venerable One returns, we may not have made any progress. Why don't...we go into space ourselves and collect more spaceships? We can dismantle them one by one, and use brute force without holding back. The Venerable One said there are plenty of spaceships."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes lit up, "That makes sense! Feng Cheng, you'll be responsible for collecting the spaceships, and I'll study while dismantling them!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "It's settled then. But my speed in space is too slow, I may not be able to catch up."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "That's simple, the Venerable One is currently testing the 'Starlight Roaming' skill, right? Give him your location stone and have him help find some planets with spaceships and drop you off there..."</p><p></p><p>So the two of them came up with this great idea.</p><p></p><p>Then when Feng Cheng told Su Hao he wanted to collect spaceships, Su Hao casually helped scatter a bunch of location stones towards the Eight-Armed clan's various colony planets...</p><p></p><p>Over the next period, Ya Shan returned to the research base to study all kinds of spacecraft technology materials, while Feng Cheng crammed knowledge about the Eight-Armed clan's space presence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, Yong Hua came to the experimental base. Upon seeing Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, her eyes quickly turned red, but she held back from saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked puzzled, was she overwhelmed after not seeing them for a year? It didn't seem like it!</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua circled around Su Hao's lab, finding no activity, and turned to leave with a dejected look.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Yong Hua, the Venerable One is away."</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan suddenly asked, "Yong Hua, what's wrong with you? Are you unhappy?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua shook her head, but as her mouth twitched, tears welled up and streamed down her face.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at each other, then walked up to Yong Hua.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan asked directly, "Tell us, who bullied you? Your uncle may not be here, but telling us is the same."</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua cried "wuwu", and after calming down, she explained what happened.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, Yong Hua entered her dream university, Victory University, to study.</p><p></p><p>After adapting to the new environment, the relatively outgoing Yong Hua made friends quickly. Unfortunately, her grades were not good - despite her best efforts, she failed some courses...</p><p></p><p>Failing was fine! She just thought she didn't work hard enough. She didn't get discouraged and decided to double her efforts next semester.</p><p></p><p>At the start of the second semester, somehow news spread that she was the niece of the hero Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>Then a lot of snarky voices emerged:</p><p></p><p>"Hua Yong Hua? Pfft, just a failure who only got in by riding on Xu Shiqiang's coattails. With her level, she has no right to be at this school."</p><p></p><p>"Right? I heard she failed courses. Compared to her diligent hardworking appearance, it's just laughable!"</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of saying this? She clearly lacks self-awareness, relying on her family connections. She thinks getting into a good university means she's amazing and smart, not realizing how many people are laughing at her. Just a clown."</p><p></p><p>"Saying this is useless. The gap in awareness is obvious - she simply can't comprehend the difference between us and her. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed pitiful. People are not born equal, there is no such thing as fairness. No matter how hard she tries, what can she do? An ordinary person is just ordinary, destined to never change that!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These voices grew louder until they reached Yong Hua through her roommate.</p><p></p><p>When she heard it, she was stunned. She never knew that in others' eyes, she was so pathetic. The blow was devastating beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>After that, she became dazed, unable to focus on studying.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if by chance, she overheard people slandering Su Hao in her name, saying things like:</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, what on the internet can you even trust? Such an obvious fake video, yet so many people believe it, simply unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Calling him a research-type, all-capable super genius, then what about the people at our Victory University?"</p><p></p><p>"The world is so vast, and there are so many humans, yet there are few truly sober ones. How lonely! What has happened to this world?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua could endure insults to herself, but not this kind of slander against her great-uncle. She couldn't stand for it and argued with that snarky roommate...</p><p></p><p>But obviously she couldn't win, because even she didn't know how to explain the many unbelievable things happening to her great-uncle. The more she said, the more muddled it became, until she cried from the frustration.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>What a melodramatic plot!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately understood what was going on after hearing it.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly some interest group that saw Su Hao's high status but didn't form an interest-sharing alliance with them, so they felt resentful and tried every means to defame and undermine his reputation!</p><p></p><p>If it were another time, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng wouldn't have cared - as long as they didn't come looking for trouble, let others say what they want while they did their own thing. If anyone blocked their way, they'd just swat them dead.</p><p></p><p>However, this situation was different!</p><p></p><p>They actually dared to bully the Venerable One's own niece Yong Hua, who often brought them delicious food!</p><p></p><p>This was unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan pulled Yong Hua and said, "Come, I'll take you to find them and see whose mouth is more formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua shrank her hand back and shook her head, "No need..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan understood this little girl's mindset - she was just worried about causing trouble.</p><p></p><p>So he said, "No problem, we'll mainly go clarify to everyone that our strength is real, that we're truly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also fanned the flames from the side, "Right, it's a small matter. You don't want them slandering your great-uncle anymore, do you?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua nodded.</p><p></p><p>So Ya Shan and Feng Cheng took Yong Hua out.</p><p></p><p>This was their first time leaving the small world.</p><p></p><p>What happened next was very simple. Yong Hua brought Ya Shan and Feng Cheng to find those roommates she had argued with.</p><p></p><p>Just as she expected Ya Shan and Feng Cheng to persuade her roommates, she was shocked to find the situation had escalated beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>Her roommates were beaten up!</p><p></p><p>She was stunned - she never imagined this seemingly ordinary slander incident actually had hidden backers...</p><p></p><p>Soon, the student council members were also beaten! They cried apologies to her, then sold out the professors behind the student council.</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua's eyes widened, "The professors..."</p><p></p><p>Then her professors were beaten too! They cried pitifully, apologized, and in turn sold out the vice chancellor.  </p><p></p><p>Next was the chancellor, then the high officials from the city organization, more and more people were dragged out, not a single one was missed...</p><p></p><p>In the end, over a thousand people were beaten into a sorry state, kneeling in front of Yong Hua, crying in unison: "Sorry!"</p><p></p><p>"We've caused trouble for Miss Yong Hua!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll never dare again!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Happy Children's Day to the little friends!</p><p></p><p>Although only three chapters...the word count is nearly 9,000!</p><p></p><p>Praise me quickly~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 721</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao seemed to think of something and said to the two of them: "By the way, before you go to destroy the highly developed colonial planets and the Eight-Armed race's home planet, take a detour first and see if there are any technologies worth learning. Get those technologies first before doing anything else. If you can't get them, let me know and I'll take a detour myself."</p><p></p><p>The two said in unison: "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the captain glanced at each other, speechless: "......"</p><p></p><p>This world is not right!</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao communicated with Xia Qingjun and the captain for a long time and demonstrated his absolute powerful strength, he finally convinced the two.</p><p></p><p>After they both agreed with his opinion, he solemnly said: "Also, don't see the Eight-Armed race as too powerful. In my view, they are just ordinary, with more numbers, more warships, and more advanced technology. Their value is still not as high as the Compound Eye race's. I have many ways to destroy them easily. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the captain no longer thought Su Hao was just "talking big", but instead described him with the adjective: "Truly domineering!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao concluded: "So, I hope that in the future, you won't be too surprised by the suggestions and solutions I propose. Just because you can't do something doesn't mean I can't do it. The world is much vaster than you can imagine. Too much doubt will inadvertently waste a lot of time, especially my research time. If there are any problems or difficulties, since I said I can solve them, I will definitely be able to solve them. I would never joke with you. Just do as I say!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at Xia Qingjun and the captain coldly. If these two dared to say a word of disagreement...</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun frowned deeply. </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he let out a long breath and said seriously: "Okay, I'll do whatever you say! I'll solve all the other difficulties!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled faintly: "Very good! Then first, let that scout ship in so they can see what this planet looks like.</p><p></p><p>Second, fully resume production, do whatever needs to be done, and focus on manufacturing the 'Energy Burst-Degradation Wave' devices. Install them wherever possible, including but not limited to all human bases in the Cloud Ring system.</p><p></p><p>Third, get the locations of all the Eight-Armed race's colonial planets from the Compound Eye race, then dispatch warships near those colonial star domains to secretly establish teleportation arrays.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, work with me to produce a large number of 'Star Shard Cubes', so Ya Shan and Feng Cheng can go through the teleportation arrays to directly attack the Eight-Armed colonial planets and wipe them all out in one go.</p><p></p><p>Fifth...destroy any Eight-Armed warships you encounter.</p><p></p><p>It's that simple!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun steadied himself, then stood up resolutely and said loudly: "Okay, let's do it!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Things proceeded as Su Hao had arranged.</p><p></p><p>However, progress was not smooth at first, because almost all the high-ranking officials thought Xia Qingjun had gone mad and was joking about humanity's future.</p><p></p><p>Some even said that as the leader of humanity, Xia Qingjun had actively given up resistance...</p><p></p><p>After Xia Qingjun's continuous efforts over three days, he finally gained the trust of a few key figures, then forcibly suppressed the opposing voices and executed the orders one by one.</p><p></p><p>If this operation succeeded, Xia Qingjun's reputation among humanity would reach an unparalleled level. If it failed...perhaps the Cloud Ring system would no longer have the human race.</p><p></p><p>Under Xia Qingjun's urging, humanity's massive machine quickly and efficiently started up.</p><p></p><p>There were three core tasks:</p><p></p><p>1) Producing large quantities of the "Energy Burst-Degradation Wave" devices;</p><p></p><p>2) Communicating with the Compound Eye race about the Eight-Armed colonial planets to obtain intelligence, while mass producing teleportation array materials;</p><p></p><p>3) Dispatching all ships to establish various types of teleportation arrays in different locations.</p><p></p><p>Supporting these three main objectives, every task was organized into a massive plan by professional teams and assigned to every executing agency.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, two Eight-Armed scout warships, one visible and one cloaked, infiltrated the star system where Blue Light was located...</p><p></p><p>As soon as the captain received the news, he immediately found Su Hao in the small world: "Great One, the Eight-Armed scouts have been let in!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao responded: "Mm, how are the other preparations going?"</p><p></p><p>The captain excitedly said: "We've mass produced the 'Energy Burst-Degradation Wave' devices, and tests have confirmed they work.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation arrays have also been set up in various places in the star system, greatly increasing our mobility.</p><p></p><p>As time goes on, the range we can set up teleportation arrays will keep expanding.</p><p></p><p>At most it will take five years to cover a large swathe of star domains. By then, the activity range of humanity will be unimaginably vast."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked: "How long until the Eight-Armed fleet arrives at Blue Light?"</p><p></p><p>The captain said: "At most five years, the Eight-Armed fleet will reach here!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Okay, we'll talk about it again in five years then. No need to rush now!"</p><p></p><p>The captain turned to leave, but stopped, hesitating for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Finally he said: "Great One, humanity's energy cube reserves have been depleted rapidly recently. Perhaps in five years we won't be able to sustain the enormous energy consumption of such a massive teleportation array network. I just wanted to ask if you have any suggestions..."</p><p></p><p>The captain originally subconsciously thought Su Hao probably wouldn't have a solution to this problem either, but a glimmer of hope arose in his heart: "What if...the Great One can solve this problem?"</p><p></p><p>At least he had never seen Su Hao fail to solve a problem before.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was only a one in a billion chance, the captain still wanted to try.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Su Hao directly replied: "This is simple, just go find Ya Shan! He'll help you solve it!"</p><p></p><p>The captain was dazed: "Sim...simple?"</p><p></p><p>Energy cubes were the lifeline of all races, how did it become so simple when it reached the Great One?</p><p></p><p>The captain: "???"</p><p></p><p>"He's not going to tell me to go find someone else after I find Feng Cheng, is he?"</p><p></p><p>He went to find Feng Cheng with doubts, not knowing why, but he felt this kind of passing the buck was strangely familiar, just like...cough!</p><p></p><p>Contrary to his expectations, after learning this was a task assigned by the Old Master, Feng Cheng readily agreed: "I thought it was something else, it's very simple, I'll go borrow some from the Eight-Armed race for you. Just wait!"</p><p></p><p>The captain walked out of the small world with a dazed look: "Borrow from the Eight-Armed race? Will they lend them? Impossible, right? Why does it seem like such a simple thing in the eyes of the three of them?"</p><p></p><p>Incomprehensible!</p><p></p><p>After receiving the task, Feng Cheng temporarily stopped hunting the mother bugs and used the small world to teleport near an Eight-Armed colonial planet.</p><p></p><p>He concealed his presence and secretly infiltrated...</p><p></p><p>The rest was simple, he just leisurely wandered around the entire planet, looking for energy cube warehouses and moving everything into the small world.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng moved from one warehouse to another, and the Eight-Armed race's unique city alarms rang out across the entire planet, but he remained undisturbed and focused on his task.</p><p></p><p>In the vast expanse of space, he was indeed restricted when facing the Eight-Armed fleet's numerous warships and couldn't fully unleash his abilities. But on land, calling him a land deity would not be an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, he met no match. Feng Cheng didn't hold back at all, killing all the Eight-Armed he encountered, then easily collecting the energy cubes into the small world!</p><p></p><p>Easy and carefree!</p><p></p><p>Just when he thought he had completed the task effortlessly, he suddenly found the surrounding space was being disrupted and he could no longer open the path to the small world.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Another spatial interference, the octopus freaks reacted so quickly. Looks like the data from when I seized their warships before was shared.</p><p></p><p>Can't go back for now..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng gradually transformed, reverting to his original "Eight-Armed God" appearance, opening his ferocious large mouth and pointing a finger to blast apart the sturdy warehouse. He then slowly walked out: "Since I can't go back for now, might as well cause a big ruckus! As long as I destroy the spatial interference device, there won't be a problem, right?"</p><p></p><p>In his perception, more and more Eight-Armed small aircraft were approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a torrential barrage of energy blasts were fired at him.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng let out an annoyed "troublesome", then his figure gradually blurred as he started moving at high speed, weaving through the Eight-Armed race's half-embedded, gourd-shaped buildings, eventually exceeding the speed the naked eye could track.</p><p></p><p>These energy blasts couldn't penetrate the crystal armor's protective barrier, but if there were too many, they would greatly drain his spiritual power and stamina. Plus, he had no interest in being a target.</p><p></p><p>If he still had his spatial abilities, it wouldn't be so troublesome. He could just use the 'Counter Spatial Barrier' and these energy blasts would pose no threat.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the 'spatial interference technology' developed by the Eight-Armed race to restrict 'curvature navigation' had disabled his spatial abilities...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng swiftly approached the aircraft, narrowed his eyes, raised his fist and smashed it violently into the ground.</p><p></p><p>'Locking Fist'!</p><p></p><p>But the out-of-control aircraft were just a small part. More aircraft began erratic movements while attacking him simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Energy blasts of various calibers chased and attacked him madly.</p><p></p><p>He dodged the vast majority, but a few stray blasts hit his body, erupting in ferocious explosive impacts.</p><p></p><p>While moving at high speed, Feng Cheng loosened his fist and said: "If the Old Master came, he could probably kill all the octopus freaks in range with a single punch! But I'm not adept at such precise operations. Since that's the case, let's get a bit more rough!"</p><p></p><p>'Mind's Eye'!</p><p></p><p>'Golden Light Downpour'!</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——"</p><p></p><p>Intense explosions rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>Under the powerful penetrating and explosive force of the golden light attack, just this one wave destroyed all the aircraft on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled proudly: "Not bad! Next, I'll destroy everything in sight! I'm bound to find the location of the spatial interference device!"</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't use the newly developed 'Energy Burst Wave'...</p><p></p><p>After all, his mission was to borrow energy cubes, so there was no need to go overboard with the energy cubes!</p>

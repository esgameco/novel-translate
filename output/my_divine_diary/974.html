        <h1>Chapter 974</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the novelty wore off, Yashan and Fengchengdu left this martial arts planet, each going their separate ways to take care of their own matters.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Yashan became obsessed with remodeling all kinds of bizarre planetary systems. He tinkered with and developed many inexplicable superpowers, slowly inching towards his envisioned "Word Actualization Art."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the future he could truly create a magic art of "words becoming reality upon utterance."</p><p></p><p>As for his "Divine Demonic Trial Tower Plan", it had been perfected many years ago. It could continuously screen and test candidates to automatically produce qualified individuals, who would then be accepted into his sect by his disciples. After years of further training, they would join the great army exploring the universe.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there wasn't much left for him to worry about. After completing the tasks from the Great Elder Wei, he gradually began searching for his own interests, doing whatever he enjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Complete freedom.</p><p></p><p>As for Fengcheng, he returned to the new demonic realm of the Crimson Demon Lord to continue his unfinished research on demon insect physiology.</p><p></p><p>As his research deepened, he conceived of an idea - to create a special human race by integrating the physical characteristics of demon insects into this race, thoroughly transforming the innately frail human bodily constitution and allowing humans to become a powerful cosmic race with unlimited potential.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the Great Elder Wei once said to let the various races on the Infinite Lands compete with each other, to decide the ultimate victor who would become the protagonist of the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt humans would definitely be the final winners, compared to other races, humans were at an obvious disadvantage and often at an absolute disadvantage in their struggles against other races.</p><p></p><p>One misstep could lead to extinction.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't go extinct but ultimately won, it was unimaginable the suffering humans would endure in the process.</p><p></p><p>So Fengcheng had always been searching for ways to strengthen humans.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to start from the genes, enhancing human foundations and hiding power within their genes, but had made little progress.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had found this planet with demon insects, he saw hope for realizing his goal.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng gazed at the starry sky: "The universe has everything I want."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei found Congshuling and said, "Ahem, sis, I want to discuss something with you."</p><p></p><p>Congshuling: "What? Got a new girlfriend?"</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei said, "No, it's that I've become interested in the power of the martial artists, and I want to temporarily stay on this planet to learn a bit. We haven't finished searching this star system yet, right? You go on ahead and search first, and I'll join you again after I finish learning. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Before Congshuling could refuse, Congrenfei immediately said, "One thousand points."</p><p></p><p>They had made a huge profit finding this martial arts planet, so he was being very generous.</p><p></p><p>Congshuling: "Two thousand!"</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei's face darkened, and after hesitating, he could only say, "Alright then, deal, you're such a blackmailer!"</p><p></p><p>Ever since watching the battle between Lv Yijiang and An Mingwang, he realized he might prefer the feeling of using brute force to smash through all obstacles.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to be like the martial artists, bare-chested and wildly exchanging blows with others.</p><p></p><p>After all, instantly killing enemies with advanced spells, although leading to victory, seemed to lack some of the fun of fighting.</p><p></p><p>After discussing it with his sister, Congrenfei began traveling around searching for powerful martial artists to learn martial arts from.</p><p></p><p>He finally found an old martial artist who called himself the "Heavenly King of the Clouds" and successfully persuaded him to teach martial arts using various high-definition adult videos.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, Congrenfei suffered a huge blow.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is born with innate spiritual energy. The first step to becoming a martial artist is to dig out this innate energy within your body through extreme training, perceive it, and then control it."</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me see what kind of talent you have..."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why don't you have any innate spiritual energy in your body? That shouldn't be possible, every person should have innate spiritual energy! This is the first time I've encountered such a strange situation."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Congrenfei with suspicion and pointed at the computer: "Kid, did you watch too much of this stuff and waste away all your innate spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>Before Congrenfei could answer, he shook his head: "No, no, the two aren't necessarily related."</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei was astonished: "I don't have spiritual energy? But why could my martial artist friend before sense my 'energy' and find my location?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King of the Clouds stroked his beard: "Energy and spiritual energy are different. Powerful martial artists have many ways to sense their opponents - after all, there are quite a few who can conceal their spiritual energy.  However, it's true that I can't sense any martial artist 'spiritual energy' from you.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...you're one of those rare, once-in-a-millennium martial arts wastrels, a hopeless case. Just give up, be content as an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>The corner of Congrenfei's mouth twitched: "No way, becoming a martial artist is my dream. Think of some solutions, look more carefully."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King of the Clouds: "How could I be mistaken? A wastrel is a wastrel. Isn't having your dreams shattered a normal thing? People have their dreams shattered all the time, you're just one of them. So be more open-minded, you can still live a very happy life as an ordinary person. Watching these beautiful girls every day is great too, haha!"</p><p></p><p>Of course Congrenfei didn't believe it. He stood up to take the computer loaded with massive resources: "I suspect you're a fraud, unwilling to teach me. I'll find someone else..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King of the Clouds immediately panicked and blocked Congrenfei: "How could the great Heavenly King of the Clouds be a fraud?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he extended his hand, his muscles bulging, and shouted loudly. A white energy ball formed in his palm: "Look, this is spiritual energy, present in all things in nature, except you."</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei used his divine consciousness to carefully observe this spiritual energy and found it was indeed a type of material he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his divine consciousness observation, this special spiritual energy permeated the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>So the Heavenly King of the Clouds wasn't lying.</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei thought to himself: "This is probably like my master said - every living planet has its unique aspects. Spiritual energy must be unique to this planet, and since I was born on the Infinite Lands, it's normal for me to lack this spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>He asked, "If I don't have innate spiritual energy, can I still become a martial artist? Since all things in nature have spiritual energy, can't I just directly use the spiritual energy of nature?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King of the Clouds laughed heartily: "That's impossible. Although martial artists preach unity of self and nature, the emphasis is more on the self. Everything begins from the innate spiritual energy within one's body. You don't have a shred of spiritual energy in your body, so you can't take the first step. How can you cultivate as a martial artist? Going from one to two, two to three, three to myriad things is not difficult. The hard part is going from zero to one!"</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei scratched his head: "What should I do then?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he directly said, "Never mind me, just teach normally. Whether I can learn is my problem, whether you teach is your problem. Just teach."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King of the Clouds: "Hey! Alright, if you're willing to taste the bitterness of failure, how can I not agree?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, after completing the "Cultivation of the Mind", Suhao also discovered the difficulty in cultivation faced by these outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Although he could sense "spiritual energy", his true body was not born on this planet, so he lacked the "innate spiritual energy" needed to take the first step of martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought: "Martial arts cultivation emphasizes 'mastering oneself and integrating with nature'. Since I lack innate energy, I'll skip the step of controlling my own innate energy and directly integrate with nature."</p><p></p><p>So he brought Lv Yijiang and the others back to the martial arts planet to try martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Watch me and see if I'm doing it correctly, and point out any problems right away."</p><p></p><p>Suhao closed his eyes and thought: "My spiritual consciousness has been adjusted to the perception mode of martial artists. Even without using 'divine consciousness', I can still sense the existence of spiritual energy in nature, just as they said - this planet is permeated with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists to 'integrate with nature', they actually build a powerful absorptive spiritual energy structure with their innate spiritual energy to absorb and augment the spiritual energy of nature.</p><p></p><p>But I don't have innate spiritual energy, so I can't use the martial artists' method to 'integrate with nature'.</p><p></p><p>However, I can use my own method to forcibly draw the spiritual energy of nature into my body..."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Suhao extended his divine consciousness and used his "Mind's Desire" to construct a filter specifically for "spiritual energy", locking onto all non-living matter within a thousand-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the filter suddenly contracted violently.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The entire world began to shake, everything in sight gently swaying, as if a world-ending cataclysm of mountains crumbling, lands splitting, and skies falling was occurring in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the others' expressions changed drastically: "What's happening?"</p>

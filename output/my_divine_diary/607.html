        <h1>Chapter 607</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Thinking of just doing it, Zhi Peng knocked on the door of Su Hao's laboratory and walked in nervously. He found Su Hao tinkering with a spherical metal mechanical device.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had named this device the 'Disaster Locator', which he planned to use as a fixed station to collect disaster data after reaching a cooperation with the Wizards' Association.</p><p></p><p>It was only in its preliminary form now, and still needed corresponding debugging before being completely finished.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhi Peng approach, Su Hao casually asked, "Zhi Peng! What's up?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng took a deep breath and mustered his courage, "Mr. Jia Wei, the Glorious Society has now successfully overthrown the rule of the Royal Family, but it's at this moment that I suddenly lost my goal and have no confidence in being able to properly govern this world. What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>This was Zhi Peng's deepest doubt hidden in his heart. If it was about destroying the Royal Family, he felt he could still follow through, but if it was about governing a country, he admitted he was completely incapable of doing so.</p><p></p><p>Being incapable meant Mr. Jia Wei would be unhappy...</p><p></p><p>His shallow understanding made him appear lost and helpless when facing something beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's gaze shifted from the 'Disaster Locator' to Zhi Peng.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing him for a long time, Zhi Peng looked haggard and a bit older, it seemed he had been worrying a lot about the Glorious Society's affairs recently.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Relax, I never expected you to be able to govern this world well all by yourself, because I know you definitely can't do it."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng let out a big sigh of relief, but also felt a sense of indescribable loss.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Do you know what your biggest advantage is?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng shook his head, "I don't know, maybe it's justice..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's only one part of it, your biggest advantage is having many friends!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "This is also the reason why I chose to cooperate with you instead of others, because with my help, your Source ability is destined to make you the emperor of this world."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm not good at governing the world."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Everyone has their own strengths, it just so happens that you're not born to be a ruler by nature.</p><p></p><p>But it's okay, there are always people born talented at doing this. You just need to find the person skilled at governing a country and the world, and become friends with them. The problem of governing can then be left to your friend.</p><p></p><p>You don't need to think about it yourself, the only thing you need to do is tell everyone what kind of world you want, what your dream world looks like."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was greatly shaken, but thinking carefully, it made sense just like Mr. Jia Wei said - as long as his friends were capable, then he would be capable too!</p><p></p><p>"What I mean is, we can't always rely on friends to govern the country."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You don't need to worry about that either. When you pass away, your current batch of old friends will also have aged. The new generation will gradually grow up, and they will be fully capable of governing this vast world well. Your current friends can help you get through the most difficult initial period, but in twenty or thirty years, you won't need them anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, if you want the Glorious Society to last even longer, then go establish schools, start cultivating from children, help children build a complete and positive cognitive system, and establish sound management systems at all levels, talent selection systems...</p><p></p><p>Doing this can appropriately extend the lifespan of the Glorious Society."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng's eyes gradually lit up, he muttered, "Schools, cognition, systems..."</p><p></p><p>He returned to his chairman's office, pondered for a long time, and finally decided to establish a strict code of conduct for Glorious Society members, absolutely not allowing anyone in a high position to inhumanely oppress ordinary people like the Royal Family did.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was full of fighting spirit!</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng took out the thick book 'Politics and Philosophy' and studied it carefully: "To formulate sound rules, one must comprehend the operating rules of this world, including human nature, morality, nature..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under Yashan's arrangements, Glorious Society members were dispatched to gradually take over administrative work in various regions in the crudest manner.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely challenging task for the understaffed Glorious Society, as they had taken too big a step.</p><p></p><p>However, the method adopted by Yashan was also very effective. At the location of the former royal palace, he temporarily set up an office, then summoned all the large and small officials from cities across the region to gather there. Zhi Peng would then hold an 'Official Mobilization Rally'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, officials could choose not to come, and Yashan issued a 'joint implication' policy. If any officials from a region did not attend the mobilization rally for any reason, Source teams would be immediately dispatched to slaughter all officials, large and small, in that city, and then select a new batch of people from the civilians to temporarily govern.</p><p></p><p>Some people didn't believe this, like in a place called Yinhe City, where a quarter of the officials were absent from the rally for various reasons such as being severely ill and unable to travel far, or having a broken leg and being inconvenient to walk.</p><p></p><p>Yashan didn't listen to any of it.</p><p></p><p>He perfectly inherited Su Hao's 'one-size-fits-all' way of doing things. If he said to kill them all, then he really killed them all - not a single official was left in that city!</p><p></p><p>After this precedent, the Glorious Society's mobilization orders were extremely effective, and no one dared to be absent from Zhi Peng's summons again.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone wanted to be absent, others would not agree. If someone was truly severely ill or had a broken leg, they would arrange vehicles or planes to send the person to Zhi Peng.</p><p></p><p>If that was really not possible, they could carry the person, right? Bringing a doctor along was also an option!</p><p></p><p>As long as they came before Zhi Peng, no matter what they had thought before, it didn't matter anymore - in the end they would all become Zhi Peng's best friends, shining brightly for his cause.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of Yashan's cruel methods that in just two months, the Glorious Society successfully took over administrative work in all regions.</p><p></p><p>Social production order was also gradually restored.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were inevitably some people who tried to make trouble during this process.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with troublemakers was simple - make the troublemaker a friend, then follow the trail to uproot all the forces behind them, and after uprooting them, find a place to bury them.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the pace of restoring order was faster than anyone had imagined.</p><p></p><p>No matter how huge the vested interest group, no matter what methods they used, in the end they would find that it was all useless.</p><p></p><p>They despaired to find that apart from causing some insignificant trouble for the Glorious Society, they were powerless to do anything else.</p><p></p><p>The reason for their powerlessness: they couldn't defeat the Glorious Society!</p><p></p><p>Those people then turned their sights to the Wizards' Association, hoping the Wizards' Association would step up and uphold justice.</p><p></p><p>In everyone's view, the Wizards' Association commanded the most powerful force in this world, so if they were willing to take action, they would certainly be able to destroy the Glorious Society!</p><p></p><p>But soon they realized the Wizards' Association remained completely indifferent, seemingly turning a blind eye to all the atrocities committed by the Glorious Society!</p><p></p><p>In the end, they received an official response from the Wizards' Association: "The Wizards' Association focuses on combating natural disasters, Source Beast disasters, and anomalous disasters to protect the lands where humans live.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, we have no intention of becoming enemies with the Glorious Society, and hope to reach cooperation with the Glorious Society in the future to build a better world!"</p><p></p><p>The implication conveyed was very clear: the Wizards' Association couldn't defeat the Glorious Society, so they wouldn't become enemies.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a message of despair.</p><p></p><p>What could they do? Just watch helplessly as the Glorious Society ran rampant all over the world?</p><p></p><p>They had no other choice but to believe in their hearts that justice would eventually triumph over evil in this world!</p><p></p><p>...</p>

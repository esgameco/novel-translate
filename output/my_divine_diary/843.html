        <h1>Chapter 843</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After returning to the small world's nest, Mother Dragon Shaduo appeared very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>The powerful human soul masters' army, led by the divine envoy, was advancing towards Dragon Island through two channels. The dragon race was in imminent danger and urgently needed the divine beings to intervene and save the dragon people from the fire and water...</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical juncture, her own young son had captured all the divine beings of the dragon race in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>As a mother, she felt very difficult about what to do.</p><p></p><p>Until now, she was agonizing over how formidable her child was...</p><p></p><p>"How did I give birth to such an outstanding child? That scumbag dragon Muxu doesn't seem like he could produce such an excellent child either...If my young son was as foolish as the other two idiotic dragons, that would be so much better."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the silly Dragon First Brother and Dragon Second Sister now, she suddenly found them incredibly adorable no matter how she looked at them.</p><p></p><p>She took out the positioning stone and held it in her hand, deeply hesitating whether to activate it or not.</p><p></p><p>From the previous incident, she knew this positioning stone could 'summon' her young son over. She wondered if she should discuss with her child about releasing the divine beings first, letting them deal with the human army, and then recapturing the divine beings...</p><p></p><p>As for letting her child face the human army alone?</p><p></p><p>That was impossible! Her child was still so young, only half a year old. How could she let him do something so dangerous?</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo thought it over and realized it was impossible to release the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>She put away the positioning stone: "Perhaps the other great dragons have a way to drive back the enemy. Let's wait for now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A month passed quietly.</p><p></p><p>When they were two months old, Yashan and Fengcheng successfully recovered their Yuan Ying realm strength, constructing a complete spiritual power system within their bodies. All they needed was to install an external brain to instantly cross over to the Parting Soul realm and gain extremely powerful mental abilities.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Suhao had installed the 'Composite Core Rune', 'Bone Demon', 'Prophet' and other basic plugins for them over two sessions.</p><p></p><p>Now in the third month, Suhao planned to evolve them to the 'Fate Child' level all at once, and after installing the remaining plugins, he would help the two install external brains to fully restore their peak power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, his two extremely powerful assistants in studying this world were back.</p><p></p><p>After announcing he would give the five great dragon divine beings a few days off, Suhao's main body in the second-level world awoke and walked steadily to find Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>"You two have grown quite a bit!"</p><p></p><p>The two plump young dragons immediately jumped up, showing Suhao their current cultivation achievements.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the formidable physical qualities of the Crimson Gold Great Dragons, their cultivation speed in this life was much faster than before. Who could have imagined that in just two months, they went from zero to the incredibly powerful Yuan Ying realm?</p><p></p><p>Awesome!</p><p></p><p>Suhao stroked his chin and said, "It seems too big. If you don't like it, I can modify you to be smaller this time."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was almost in tears. As a Yuan Ying cultivator, he could completely control his own body, but the genetic aspects were different. He hoped his body would be more natural...</p><p></p><p>Of course, after dedicated research in his previous life, he had in-depth knowledge of genetic modification techniques and could design a complete set of genes himself. However, he lacked Suhao's ability to produce genetic modification liquid from his own body, otherwise he wouldn't need Suhao's help.</p><p></p><p>Yashan curiously asked, "Fengcheng, why do you care about this? You've become a great dragon. What do you need it for? Don't tell me you want to try the feeling of being a mother dragon! That's too extreme, Fengcheng!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately denied it: "Elder Brother Yashan, having it and using it are two different things. I have no interest in being a mother dragon..."</p><p></p><p>After checking their physical conditions, Suhao redesigned their gene sequences, then said, "After completing the final genetic modification, I'll connect you to the external brains. You should prepare yourselves first! If the genetic modification and external brain installation go smoothly in the next few days, you'll be able to control your 'Divine' avatars.</p><p></p><p>You can also find some large bird eggs to make 'Egg Deities' as backups."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were excited to hear that external brains were ready for them, unable to calm down for a while.</p><p></p><p>After being reborn with the minds of young dragons, they deeply experienced how weak their brains were without external brains, and they desperately wanted to return to their former peak state.</p><p></p><p>Getting stronger was natural, but getting weaker was unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Yashan and Fengcheng successfully completed the preset plan, not only using genes to supplement the basic plugins but also successfully installing external brains, regaining their powerful spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng closed his eyes, savoring the expanding perception and thoughts, waves of intense pleasure crashing into his soul as he couldn't help but sigh, "So wonderful, this feeling of omnipotence."</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "My thoughts are like suppressed gunpowder encountering a spark, completely breaking through all surrounding restraints, expanding and venting outwards. I'm almost immersed in this process of rapidly growing stronger, hoping it doesn't end too soon."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two tested their abilities in the second-level world.</p><p></p><p>As their power recovered, their former abilities were awakened one by one, used without any delay, as if the proficiency of all abilities was imprinted deep in their consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Also, just like the previous life, your main bodies must stay in the second-level world at all times, using your 'Divine' avatars to go out and be active, in case your main bodies encounter any accidents.</p><p></p><p>For now, I've only made five 'Divine' avatars. One was damaged, I'm using one myself, so there are only three for you two to use. So be careful, there are no replacements if they get damaged."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was eager to try, saying, "Got it, Old Master Su. Since that's the case, Fengcheng and I will first restore the 'Divine' production line and make thousands or tens of thousands of 'Divines'. Then it won't matter how many get damaged!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also wanted to make a big effort: "I'm an expert at this. I can turn anything into an 'Egg Deity'."</p><p></p><p>Suhao poured cold water: "I forgot to tell you, the technology in this world is almost primitive. The equipment you need, you'll have to manufacture and upgrade piece by piece yourselves. You can't get it customized outside."</p><p></p><p>Suhao could produce 'Egg Deities', but cultivating them with his vital energy was too troublesome. He didn't want to personally make thousands or tens of thousands of 'Egg Deities'. It was better to let Yashan and Fengcheng set up the production line themselves and let them deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, setting up a complete production line was very secondary. Without the corresponding equipment, it would be extremely difficult to manufacture many high-precision items.</p><p></p><p>For example, his planet micro-cubes, the "Mind's Eye" used to observe the universe, and many particle experimental machines...</p><p></p><p>No matter what, a comprehensive high-precision laboratory had to be established.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were shocked: "What, start from scratch? You can't be serious!"</p><p></p><p>Even with the ability to transform specific materials with source energy, the difficulty of building a set of high-precision production line equipment from zero, just like their previous life, was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>No matter how capable the two were, just thinking about it made their scalps go numb.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "How to do it specifically, you can go out and control your avatars to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan and Fengcheng activated their avatar controls and went out to the Cruciform Star to begin their exploration journey in this other world.</p><p></p><p>After coming out, Fengcheng looked around at the environment and marveled, "It's so desolate, doesn't look like a life-bearing planet."</p><p></p><p>Yashan swept with his divine sense and laughed, "This is just the transmission point set up by Old Master Su. It doesn't represent the entire planet. Old Master Su did say this world has divine beings and is a rich, pleasure-filled place as the main theme."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also developed a keen interest in the divine beings: "According to the assistant's information, divine beings are a unique conceptual lifeform. I really want to find one or two and see what they look like."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "It seems Old Master Su captured a few. We can take a look when we get the chance, but Old Master Su said those divine beings are very special. It's easy to get in trouble if we're not careful dealing with them, so we should focus on building the production line and making more avatars first!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked, "Elder Brother Yashan, what should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought for a moment and said, "First, let's look around the planet and see the current state of society, find various minerals, then capture some able-bodied laborers to help us with mining and refining work.</p><p></p><p>According to the assistant's information, this world has something called Soul Guardians that seem very capable. They might save us a lot of effort. The great dragons too, with those huge bodies, they should be simple to get for mining and hard labor."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng agreed: "If these Soul Guardians are really that capable, we'll be able to build a complete set of equipment much faster, maybe in just a year or two."</p><p></p><p>One or two years seemed long, but to them it was just the blink of an eye. Getting a complete set of equipment like their previous life in just one or two years would be the speed of gods.</p><p></p><p>Yashan took the lead flying far away: "Let's go, we'll split up and explore everywhere."</p>

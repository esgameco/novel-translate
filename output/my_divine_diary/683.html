        <h1>Chapter 683</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>During the journey on the spaceship, being inside, one could not perceive any abnormalities. Only when the curvature engine was activated and shut down would there be a spatial compression force acting on the body, similar to 'teleportation'. An ordinary human body would be unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Only soldiers who had undergone special technical enhancement with reinforcement agents, aided by 'adaptation chambers', could endure such pressure.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao realize that although the technology of this world seemed very advanced, it still lacked many techniques. For example, the 'balancer' to resist spatial compression, the 'teleportation' technology for instant transmission, and the development and application of bodily energy from blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>However, it was understandable. Take the 'balancer' that resists spatial compression for instance - Su Hao had learned it in the Summoner's World, a manifestation of cosmic coincidence, an evolutionary result. Perhaps only in the extremely special environment of the Summoner's World could such a thing emerge!</p><p></p><p>This world lacked the corresponding special environment, so creating a 'balancer' would not be easy.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "It's quite suitable actually. I can use the 'balancer', blood energy, teleportation and other techniques to exchange for this world's 'curvature engine technology', spacecraft manufacturing, long-range communication, concentrated energy blocks and more. At the same time, I can absorb some top scientific researchers to help me complete research on other projects!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to outright plundering, Su Hao preferred trading. Of course, if the other party was unwilling to trade with him, then he would have to plunder.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that before long, he would be able to completely master the initiative in this world. By then, whether it was the Eight-Handed Race, the Compound Eye Race, the Star-Eaters, or even humans themselves, they would all be willing to open the door of convenience for him.</p><p></p><p>The curvature engine of the Exploratory Star gradually shut down. When the broadcast sounded again, Su Hao's 'radar perception' returned.</p><p></p><p>Through his perception, he also discovered that the huge ring-shaped machine, suspected to be the curvature engine, had also stopped operating and no longer emitted a special humming sound.</p><p></p><p>This confirmed for him that the ring-shaped machine was indeed the curvature engine he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find an opportunity to try recording the machine's information into the cannon space."</p><p></p><p>If successful, it would be Su Hao's first gain in this world. Even if he died on the spot, it would not be a loss.</p><p></p><p>He urgently wanted to obtain the curvature engine technology, but there were only trained maintenance personnel on this ship, no specialized technicians to learn from.</p><p></p><p>To obtain the complete theory and technology, he would need to return to the mother planet Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>The current problem was that the captain of the Exploratory Star did not seem to plan on returning to Blue Light anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>If it dragged on for decades with Su Hao aboard this wandering spacecraft, he would be unwilling to waste so much time.</p><p></p><p>As for why the captain did not plan to return to Blue Light, Su Hao had inadvertently heard the reason through his 'divine sense'.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight-Handed Race's signal nest has locked on? Even traveling at superluminal speed with the curvature engine for a year can't break the lock? I need to find a way to help the Exploratory Star break free of the lock..."</p><p></p><p>"The Eight-Handed Race's technology seems quite good. In the future, I may need to find an opportunity to enter their nest and package up their technology into the cannon space."</p><p></p><p>The day after the curvature engine shut down, Captain Yan and Xiao Chang found Su Hao and said, "Big Strong, Commander Jiang has a special mission for our Squad 405."</p><p></p><p>"Special mission? What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan shook his head. "Unknown, but it should be related to combat."</p><p></p><p>Since the last raid on the supply station, Squad 405 was down to just three members, yet it was recognized as the strongest squad by all the officers and soldiers. Any special mission assigned to them would certainly not be simple.</p><p></p><p>After the three members of Squad 405 arrived at the command center, they found only the captain and Commander Jiang present.</p><p></p><p>After Captain Yan saluted, the captain smiled and said, "You three look to be in good spirits! The moment I saw you, I knew this mission would be completed smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang kept a smile on his face, but thought to himself, "As expected of the captain, able to say that to anyone while keeping a straight face. Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Captain Yan was shaken. This was the highest commander of the Exploratory Star acknowledging them! He immediately replied loudly, "Understood, captain. The mission will be completed."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked at Su Hao and said, "For this mission, the key lies with Xu Shiqiang."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang's faces fell. So it wasn't acknowledging them, but rather Su Hao...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked curiously, "What mission?"</p><p></p><p>The captain became solemn. "The Exploratory Star has been traveling for a year at warp 5, reaching 200 light-years away. During this year, the engine consumed an enormous amount of energy. The remaining energy on the ship has now reached the warning line and needs to be replenished urgently.</p><p></p><p>So next, we need to find a way to obtain more energy. After consulting with the other commanders, we've decided to raid the Eight-Handed Race's supply stations again.</p><p></p><p>And not just one, but multiple stations, taking advantage of the window before we draw enough of their attention. We need to fill the ship's energy chambers!"</p><p></p><p>Pausing here, the captain turned to Su Hao. "The defensive weapons at the Eight-Handed Race's supply stations pose a major threat to our ships and fighters. One mistake and we could be shot down. Usually we can only capture them with small squads of individual soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Normally, unless absolutely necessary, we wouldn't raid the supply stations, as it not only means huge casualties for the Exploratory Star crew, but also risks exposing the ship.</p><p></p><p>However, the current situation is different from before.</p><p></p><p>First, the Exploratory Star has already been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, with Xu Shiqiang's 'hundred shots, hundred hits', completing the supply station raids won't be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Considering all factors, this is the plan."</p><p></p><p>The captain finally asked, "But whether the mission is ultimately executed depends on you, Xu Shiqiang. So, can you lead a squad of soldiers to successfully raid and capture the Eight-Handed Race's supply bases while ensuring your own safety?"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Su Hao would recklessly agree without considering the risks, so he added, "What I mean is, from thousands of meters outside the supply base, can you use 'hundred shots, hundred hits' to directly annihilate the Eight-Handed inside?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the energy, the captain was more concerned about Su Hao's safety. If there were better options, he would never let this precious troublemaker take such risks.</p><p></p><p>However, he also understood that the word 'plunder' itself implied risk. There was no absolutely safe plundering in the cosmos - it was unavoidable if one wanted to take risks.</p><p></p><p>Even plundering a three-year-old's candy would carry some risk, right?</p><p></p><p>To avoid shocking everyone too much, instead of saying 200,000 meters, Su Hao conservatively gave a vague number.</p><p></p><p>"Whew--"</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt goosebumps rise involuntarily upon hearing this. Was this something a human could do?</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang looked doubtful. "Really? Such a magic trick isn't easy to perform."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "If you have doubts, you can launch a cup outside the ship to test it out."</p><p></p><p>To be absolutely sure, a test was necessary. But the captain didn't want to waste Su Hao's new cup, so under Commander Jiang's reluctant gaze, he sent Jiang's cup to the launch chamber and soon ejected it outside the ship.</p><p></p><p>Everyone watched the monitor, and when the cup flew out 50,000 meters, the captain handed Su Hao the rifle, saying, "Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took it, raised his arm toward the doorway and fired a single smooth shot.</p><p></p><p>'Zhi!'</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a white flash appeared on the monitor, and the cup turned into fragments before everyone's disbelieving eyes.</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang muttered, "Truly godly!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Su Hao like he was a freak of nature, feeling that from start to finish, Xu Shiqiang defied everything they knew about 'science' - what people commonly call 'counterintuitive'.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment, they had no more doubts about Su Hao's prowess.</p><p></p><p>The captain marveled, "Xu Shiqiang, in just a short year, you've grown to this level?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Thanks to the captain approving my leave, I didn't dare slack off for a moment this year in training, which led to these results."</p><p></p><p>The captain waved his hand grandly. "I can promise you that from now on aboard the Exploratory Star, your leave can be extended indefinitely! Others won't disturb you unless there's something important."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan couldn't help asking, "Big Strong, what kind of weird ability is this? Can we learn it too?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head. "You probably can't learn this ability of mine, but a simplified version of 'superpowers', you should be able to learn."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was shaken again, their eyes widening in disbelief as they stared at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Then a surge of wild joy rose in their hearts.</p>

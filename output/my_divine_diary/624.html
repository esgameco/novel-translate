        <h1>Chapter 624</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao remained focused on his research in his own small base world, step-by-step completing the plans he had previously set. </p><p></p><p>Although slow, there were indeed new discoveries and progress made every day, which was the source of Su Hao's happiness and the reason he could stay in the sunless laboratory for years on end without getting tired of it.</p><p></p><p>As long as one is human, progress will always bring happiness.</p><p></p><p>As for what major events were happening in the outside world, Su Hao rarely paid attention, because at this stage, others without a certain level of knowledge could hardly provide him with corresponding help.</p><p></p><p>That day, Ya Shan posted a message in the group: "Master Wei, those two brats A Xing and A Wang are getting married and have invited us to attend their wedding. They also request that you serve as the witness."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was stunned: "A Xing and A Wang are getting married? To that little girl Xiao Tang they were both involved with? Don't tell me the two of them are marrying her at the same time..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "What? Is the Celestial Music Palace not fun enough that they unexpectedly want to get married!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan sent a laughing emoji: "Of course not, they're not marrying Xiao Tang. They're marrying two beauties from a source team they hooked up with two years ago on an mission. Apparently A Xing got the team leader pregnant and A Wang got one of the team members pregnant, so they had no choice but to get married!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "And so two playboys leave the secular world behind, how tragic!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked: "When is the wedding?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Pretty rushed, in a month. But A Xing and A Wang have invited us to a gathering tomorrow to invite us in person."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Okay, I'll go see them tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, at the Huai'en Small Tavern in Huaishui Town, eight people were seated, plus one big dog.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's group of three, A Xing and A Wang with their two fiancées making four, and the two fiancées' remaining single teammate.</p><p></p><p>A Xing first introduced everyone. His fiancée was called Xiao Kong, looking bold and heroic like a woman warrior.</p><p></p><p>A Wang's fiancée was called Qing Qing, with a gentle and mild appearance.</p><p></p><p>The single remaining teammate looked very cute, called Xiao Di.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Di seemed resentful, never expecting that a previous chance encounter would lead to those two scoundrels A Xing and A Wang seducing away her two teammates!</p><p></p><p>The key was, why did they seduce her two teammates but not her?</p><p></p><p>If one of A Xing or A Wang had tried to seduce her, she would have agreed too, right???</p><p></p><p>Two scumbags!</p><p></p><p>However, while feeling resentful, she also eyed Su Hao's group with shining eyes!</p><p></p><p>So these were the legendary three mysterious teammates of the Lucky Star Team? Indeed called the Five Handsome Ones, A Xing and A Wang's three teammates looked even more handsome!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng, already an old hand with women, immediately guessed Xiao Di's thoughts from her gaze and sent a message in the group: "Two bosses, the cute Xiao Di sitting next to us seems interested in all three of us! This young lady looks innocent, but who knew she had such a big appetite!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan: "..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "If you like her, you can just marry her!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately sent a scared emoji: "Marry??? Scary!"</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, A Xing and A Wang candidly explained their reasons for getting married: "The whole world has changed so much these past two years, mages are basically useless now, abandoned by the times. We don't really have jobs, so we ended up getting into trouble out of boredom..."</p><p></p><p>Then A Xing's lower back was viciously pinched, making him wince in pain.</p><p></p><p>A Wang said: "But I'm actually glad about the disappearance of disasters in this world. At least people don't have to live every day in fear that a disaster could strike at any moment. To be honest, ever since major disasters disappeared, I've felt a sense of peace I've never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>It's a sense of security I've never felt, stronger even than when I wielded the source pearl.  </p><p></p><p>That's precisely why I decided to marry Qing Qing and have children."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded in agreement, though A Xing joked: "I thought you were going to have the child first, then get married! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed: "Seems like everyone prefers a safe and peaceful life! The disappearance of disasters might be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Unlike others, Ya Shan simply liked whatever Master Wei liked.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng stated matter-of-factly: "Of course, doesn't everyone want to do what they enjoy in peace and quiet?"</p><p></p><p>A Wang shrugged: "It's a good thing I don't enjoy dealing with disasters, otherwise A Xing might be the one suffering."</p><p></p><p>A Xing shook his head: "I'm not suffering at all. My child will be able to grow up in a stable environment without worrying about their mage parents never coming home. I can't be happier about that."</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang's parents died in disasters when they were very young, so they felt this deeply.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the few who wielded power and enjoyed the thrills of adventure and battle, perhaps most people preferred a safe life!</p><p></p><p>A month later, A Xing and A Wang held a joint wedding ceremony, with Su Hao serving as the witness to bless the two new couples.</p><p></p><p>This was A Xing and A Wang's new stage of life.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xiao Di did not succeed in seducing any of Su Hao's group.</p><p></p><p>Even Feng Cheng avoided her, because she was aiming for marriage, while Feng Cheng's life was dedicated to serving Master Wei - he could not have a family and would inevitably fail to give her what she wanted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two more years passed in a blur. The 'source' in the air increased, and after simplifying Ya Shan's 'Meditation Method' into multiple versions, the Mage Association began gradually promoting it among some mage teams.</p><p></p><p>This sparked a raging trend of cultivation, as source mages transformed into magic cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association also established special 'Mage Academies' in major cities around the world to train their future forces.</p><p></p><p>New and old mages gradually replaced each other.</p><p></p><p>Many things happened during this period, such as mages who did not qualify to learn the Meditation Method breaking away to form a so-called 'Regain the Light Society', even organizing people to steal the source pearls collected by the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>They engaged in all sorts of thievery until being jointly suppressed by the Mage Association and the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as time passed, the Meditation Method used internally by the Mage Association also gradually spread and became known to more people.</p><p></p><p>By this point, the world had changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, with the Radiant Society establishing schools, electrical technology also began to emerge, gradually integrating with the original source technology to form a whole new world.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, he abided by the agreement signed with the Mage Association earlier, sharing his research findings and materials on the source over the years after removing the core parts and simplifying the language, as he was concerned the Mage Association people wouldn't understand it otherwise!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Su Hao was hiding the secrets of the source, but simply that he didn't want to interfere with others' behaviors and thoughts as long as it didn't affect his own research.</p><p></p><p>As he experienced more people and events, his desire to change others' minds and perceptions gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Why force his own ideas onto others? One man's honey dates could be another's poison.</p><p></p><p>What he considered right, others might not care about or like at all.</p><p></p><p>He no longer insisted on anything, making friends with those who shared his ideals while keeping his distance from those who didn't.</p><p></p><p>With more experience, Su Hao realized there were fewer and fewer things he truly cared about.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After reading through the materials Su Hao provided, the Mage Association leader spent two days in contemplation in his study before finally accepting such a vast amount of information with his increasingly aged face full of shock: "So this is what the world is really like!"</p><p></p><p>"Jia Wei..."</p><p></p><p>He simply could not evaluate such a person!</p><p></p><p>"I'm already old! Why didn't I meet him when I was younger? This is the regret of life! If it had been twenty years earlier, I would have definitely requested to be Jia Wei's master and studied alongside him to explore the secrets of this world together!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"Magic cultivators...let it be! Isn't a world without disasters exactly what our 'Peace' has always pursued? There's just one more thing - I still need to ask Jia Wei to pass on the method for maintaining the satellites' operation."</p><p></p><p>"For millions of years to come, the Mage Association's purpose for existing: maintaining the operation of the disaster seals!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 679</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Such a rapid pace of upgrading was one of Suhao's pursuits in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>He devoted all his efforts to researching the method of transforming the source into material substances, with the sole aim of conveniently and quickly obtaining energy substances like blood and spiritual power, while simultaneously freeing himself from the body's dependence on specific nutrients, allowing him to survive even in extremely harsh environments.</p><p></p><p>Now, he became more convinced that the path he had taken was correct: knowledge is everything!</p><p></p><p>Only after thoroughly understanding the combination of phenomena and principles, and being able to apply them, would Suhao acknowledge that he had learned that knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This was different from most people's perception of 'phenomena-laws'. In Suhao's view, many laws could not be considered knowledge, but merely tools for him to study the principles behind the phenomena.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, what took others hundreds or thousands of years to cultivate into immortality, he could easily achieve in just a few days, as long as he understood the intrinsic principles.</p><p></p><p>And a few days was not the limit - this was related to the other knowledge he had mastered. The more knowledge he grasped horizontally, the deeper his understanding of this world would be, and the less time it would take for him to 'cultivate immortality'.</p><p></p><p>The reason it still took three days for him to reach the Yuanying realm was that the knowledge he possessed was insufficient for him to take it a step further.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine that when Suhao accumulates enough knowledge and unravels the mysteries of life, being able to directly use the 'source' to transform and sculpt a body imbued with powerful vitality...</p><p></p><p>At that time, it's not difficult to deduce that he might even be able to use the source to sculpt a 'Huashen realm' body in just a few seconds!</p><p></p><p>This is the power of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Many people feel that the knowledge they have learned is useless...</p><p></p><p>It's not useless, but rather that they haven't mastered the complementary related knowledge. Simply put, they have learned, but not learned everything, and their knowledge system is incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Many people think Suhao's operations are unreasonable...</p><p></p><p>For this, Suhao can understand their thinking. But he believes that it's not unreasonable, but rather that different people have different understandings of the world, and this is something that cannot be forced, nor is it necessary for everyone to think the same way.</p><p></p><p>Just as the captain and others saw him as invincible while piloting a fighter jet, is that scientific in their view? Unscientific!</p><p></p><p>It's just a predetermined fact, they lack the corresponding knowledge to support their brains in thinking and drawing conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if the captain and others think it's unscientific, Suhao wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao has experienced such a strong contrast along the way, reminding himself: "When facing the unknown or something that goes against my cognition, don't rush to deny it, try to open your heart and consider more possibilities!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the subtleties and gradually deepening his self-awareness - this is the growth of Suhao's wisdom!</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Suhao emerged from the small world, stretching his body to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>"Crack! Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Clear sounds rang out from his entire body.</p><p></p><p>He slowly clenched his fists, feeling the exceptionally vast spiritual power within his body, and wanted to let out a hearty laugh, but he held it in.</p><p></p><p>If he were to laugh out loud, he might scare the officers and soldiers on the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>In three days, he had successfully used the 'source' to transform into spiritual power, building a complete 'spiritual power system' within his body, and regaining the powerful 'spiritual sense', causing his radar sensing range to surge again, reaching an eight-kilometer radius.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, this range continued to grow.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao successfully built the 'Identification Platform' and broke through to the Huashen realm, he would quickly recover the extreme sensing range of his previous world - two hundred kilometers!</p><p></p><p>But for him, it wasn't a big problem, it was usable!</p><p></p><p>And now, with abilities such as 'perception', 'transmission', 'flash', 'second-level space', 'small world', 'source ability', 'cultivation techniques', and 'focus system' returning to Suhao, he once again felt a sense of ubiquitous peace.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and entered the pinball space, sitting at the desk and taking out paper and pen to make subsequent plans:</p><p></p><p>"Now that safety has been initially guaranteed, but there is still a long way to go before reaching the peak state, and the subsequent enhancements cannot be achieved overnight. I need more time.</p><p></p><p>As it stands now, the spaceship is temporarily safe, but it's hard to say what will happen next. The octopus monster will certainly not give up and will send more warships to intercept the Yuoxing.</p><p></p><p>For this, I can only passively accept it for now, as I am powerless to change anything.</p><p></p><p>So the focus for the time being is as follows:</p><p></p><p>One, evolve the fourth-level [Bone Demon] as soon as possible to obtain the regeneration ability, and then gradually evolve to [Life Child];</p><p></p><p>Two, build the 'Identification Platform' and break through to the Huashen realm to obtain greater power;</p><p></p><p>In space, two hundred kilometers is just a very short distance. The enemy's energy cannons can launch attacks from tens of kilometers away, so obtaining the extreme sensing range is a must for me.</p><p></p><p>Three, find an opportunity as soon as possible to evolve into a [God], using the [God]'s body to walk outside, and then hide the main body in the second-level space, thus evading the 'Yun Wave' tracking;</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful I become, only by evading the 'Yun Wave' tracking can I be relatively safe.</p><p></p><p>From another perspective, if the [God]'s body appears, even in the most adverse situation, at most the [God] will die, while the me hiding in the second-level space will not have any problems at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I can even evolve hundreds or thousands of [Gods] to act simultaneously...</p><p></p><p>At that time, I will be able to indulge in absorbing the knowledge of this world.</p><p></p><p>Four, find a way to return to the mother planet 'Blue Light';</p><p></p><p>Five, those octopus monsters seem quite interesting, this is the first time I've encountered a non-human intelligent life form, so I should study them;</p><p></p><p>Suhao considered many things and gradually had a clear plan for his next actions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Suhao's confidence grew to an unprecedented level: "In this life, I will not die so easily. I will surely find the trail of the 'Yun Wave', and then, master it!"</p><p></p><p>As for whether this world would become chaotic because of him...</p><p></p><p>Suhao had an open mind!</p><p></p><p>The universe is so vast and enormous, a little turmoil is hardly worth mentioning. It's like peeing in the ocean - will the ocean turn yellow? Who would feel guilty for doing such a thing to the ocean?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there are orderly ways of living, and there are chaotic ways of living.</p><p></p><p>No problem!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Yuoxing stayed at the original battlefield for ten days, stripping all usable resources and facilities from the Eight-Armed Clan's guerrilla warships and directly destroying the useless shells.</p><p></p><p>If they were not destroyed, these things would certainly be taken back and reused by the Eight-Armed Clan, which was something humanity did not want to see.</p><p></p><p>In the Yuoxing command center.</p><p></p><p>After the captain analyzed the current situation to everyone, he directly issued orders: "First, the research team will focus on decoding the data from all the equipment on the Eight-Armed Clan's warships and transmit it back to Blue Light in its entirety;</p><p></p><p>Second, continue towards the predetermined Star Worm Star Domain, and confirm that we have completely escaped the Eight-Armed Clan's signal hive lock."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, the captain suddenly pulled aside Chief Officer Jiang and said, "There's a soldier under your command named Xu Shiqiang, right? The one who piloted the fighter jet and annihilated all the Eight-Armed Clan soldiers inside the warship. Call him here now, I have some questions to ask him."</p><p></p><p>Chief Officer Jiang saluted: "Received, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>Then he laughed and said, "Coincidentally, I also have questions for him. Together?"</p><p></p><p>The captain laughed heartily: "Together! That kid has a very stable mentality. Last time we summoned him to the command room, with so many officers staring at him, he didn't even change his expression. Let's give him a good shake."</p><p></p><p>Chief Officer Jiang: "That's exactly what I intended!"</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, it remained to be seen who would shake whom.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 766</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao woke up from the second-level world, speechless: "This is ridiculous, can't even get close? How can we explore the secrets of the so-called energy block formation then?"</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't see the process of the energy block forming, he could only blindly guess.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao did not trust his ability to blindly guess.</p><p></p><p>He sneered: "I have so many Baxian Spirits, I'm sure I can find a way to get close. It's impossible to be so unlucky as to get blown up every time! Let's try again."</p><p></p><p>This time, Su Hao did not just control one Baxian Spirit to explore the center of the Yunhuan system, but simultaneously controlled a thousand Baxian Spirits, swarming from around the black hole towards it.</p><p></p><p>It had the momentum of lifting the red cover off the black hole to reveal its true face.</p><p></p><p>Eight years later, the thousand Baxian Spirits controlled by Su Hao were completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Even with all his efforts, they could only fly one more year before their energy was exhausted and they exploded one by one.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Su Hao could not even get too close to the black hole, let alone lift its red cover.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could do nothing about this.</p><p></p><p>He could only sigh: "The gap is really too big! I'm not qualified to discover the secrets of the black hole now."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stopped wasting time stubbornly trying, believing that as long as he kept growing, he would eventually understand the mysterious black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Keep learning!"</p><p></p><p>He thought: "If only I could find a way to connect to other galaxies through the 'Planet Network'! My starlight speed is still too slow. From the start until now, it's been a thousand years, and I still haven't flown from the Yunhuan system to the Pangshe system...</p><p></p><p>What method can connect two galaxies?  </p><p>And the essence of the 'Planet Network' is formed by the mutual influence of gravitational fields..."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Su Hao suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"Gravitational field..."</p><p></p><p>"Hey? Doesn't a black hole form a powerful gravitational field?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can rely on the black hole's powerful gravitational field to connect the 'Planet Networks' of surrounding galaxies..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed.</p><p></p><p>All these years, he had tried various methods, but never thought of going to the edge of the black hole to try connecting the 'Planet Networks' of adjacent stars.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao again controlled a few Baxian Spirits to 'network transport' near the black hole, then activated starlight travel to fly rapidly towards it.</p><p></p><p>He had already figured out the Baxian Spirits' safe range outside the black hole.</p><p></p><p>After flying for six years, Su Hao stopped in a space greatly curved by the black hole's gravitational influence, gazing at the magnificent yet terrifying scene before him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it here!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to actively activate the 'gravitational array' on his body to easily access the special 'Planet Network'.</p><p></p><p>He thought: "Indeed, it's easier to access this special 'Planet Network' in a place with such strong gravity."</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Su Hao's mini-selves entered the 'Planet Network', quickly dispersing towards the edge of the Yunhuan system, trying to break through the previous 'empty zone' they couldn't, and observing whether they could see other galaxies.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Su Hao exclaimed excitedly: "Indeed, the range I can explore outwards is farther than before.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, I can see the Pangshe system more clearly from the edge than before.</p><p></p><p>Which means, as long as the gravity is strong enough, I may be able to directly communicate with other adjacent galaxies!"</p><p></p><p>This was great news for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he tried before, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>But now he had gotten positive feedback, which basically solved the problem for Su Hao. All that was left was a matter of time...</p><p></p><p>"If I combine the black hole's gravity with my maximum power 'gravitational array', could I connect the networks of the two galaxies?"</p><p></p><p>Think and try.</p><p></p><p>The Baxian Spirit's crystal armor quickly transformed, forming a complex array in the blink of an eye that radiated dazzling golden light, making Su Hao look like a shining golden Buddha statue.</p><p></p><p>After activating the 'gravitational array' at maximum power, Su Hao's mini-selves explored even farther into the 'Planet Network'.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Pangshe system became clearer, as if right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, when Su Hao tried to directly leap to the Pangshe system, it didn't work.</p><p></p><p>It was still a bit short.</p><p></p><p>"If I fly a bit closer to the black hole, I should be able to completely connect to the Pangshe system."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao forcibly activated 'starlight travel' again, flying rapidly towards the black hole...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the Baxian Spirits were completely annihilated again.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao woke up from the second-level world, not discouraged but rather excited: "Just a little more and I would have succeeded. It's a pity the Baxian Spirits are too unreliable and couldn't get any closer.</p><p></p><p>I can sense the Baxian Spirits' limit - no matter how hard they struggle, they can't get any closer.</p><p></p><p>Which means, if I want an even stronger space-time curvature, I can't rely on the black hole, only my own 'gravitational array'."</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, his tone firm: "Next, I'll do a major update to the gravitational array to unleash even greater power!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao withdrew his thoughts again, immersing himself in researching and improving the array.</p><p></p><p>He tried one solution - although excellent, it didn't reach the level he wanted, so he decisively changed to try a second solution...</p><p></p><p>As he kept switching, Su Hao's understanding of the gravitational array deepened, and the gravitational force it could exert grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Until thirty years later, Su Hao completed the 45th generation 'gravitational array', finally reaching the level he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try again, this time I have a feeling I'll definitely be able to connect to the Pangshe system. This time, I'll definitely be able to go to the Pangshe system. Galaxy crossing is right before my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao again mobilized a few Baxian Spirits, heading straight for the black hole at the center of the Yunhuan system.</p><p></p><p>Six years later, Su Hao stopped in a patch of space.</p><p></p><p>"This should work! With such a massive double gravitational force stacked, there's no way it could fail!"</p><p></p><p>The array outside the Baxian Spirit's crystal armor suddenly flashed brilliant golden light, the whole figure turning into a golden sphere, like a small floating sun.</p><p></p><p>However, the bright light didn't last long, flashing and fading, revealing the pink armor again, but now covered in countless dark golden patterns.</p><p></p><p>Magnificent and noble.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the space-time around Su Hao that had been warped by the black hole became further warped.</p><p></p><p>As if in a giant vortex, a small whirlpool appeared.</p><p></p><p>The two forces stacked, resulting in an extremely powerful level of warping.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Su Hao's numerous mini-selves spread out, quickly converging on the empty zone.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead now, it was no longer a vast emptiness, but filled with dense floating spheres.</p><p></p><p>That was the Pangshe system!</p><p></p><p>Between the Pangshe and Yunhuan systems was an obvious empty zone, like a river separating the two banks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao felt the Pangshe system was within reach.</p><p></p><p>Crossing galaxies no longer meant flying for thousands of years with 'starlight travel'!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, hundreds of mini-selves charged forward.</p><p></p><p>"Shua--"</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound rang in Su Hao's mind, as if something had shattered, or perhaps just a psychological effect he created for himself...</p><p></p><p>His mini-selves broke through this empty zone, arriving before a star.</p><p></p><p>This was a planet in the Pangshe system.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suppressed his excitement, steadied his new body, and activated the 'network transport' program.</p><p></p><p>'Transport'!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Baxian Spirit controlled by Su Hao suddenly disappeared from its original spot.</p><p></p><p>When it reappeared, it was on a planet in the outer reaches of the Pangshe system.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Damn, it really worked!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 579</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After suddenly discovering the secret of how matter transforms into source, Suhao's mind was like a long-clogged pipe that was suddenly unblocked, his thoughts deeply advancing to a new level. Many of his previous doubts also found answers.</p><p></p><p>Verifying the principle of 'understanding one leads to understanding all', at this moment, a feeling of exhilaration flowed through every cell of his body. This exhilaration could last for a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>This was the happiness that Suhao had always pursued! For him, the happiness that erupted from the depths of the soul and permeated the flesh far surpassed the happiness from the flesh to the soul.</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not slack off at all from feeling immense happiness. His brain was not conquered by this feeling of happiness, but instead kept operating incessantly, reorganizing all the issues related to source, entering the bouncing space to write and draw:</p><p></p><p>"Matter - extreme high temperature - source - cooling - matter or energy.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental principle of matter transforming into source is that matter is heated to an extreme temperature that is unimaginable to humans. This temperature cannot actually be represented by a specific numerical value. To reach this kind of temperature is almost impossible to imagine, it is simply too inconceivable...</p><p></p><p>But in this world, this phenomenon is seen everywhere! Which means this world is special, there must exist some force that heats up matter at all times.</p><p></p><p>How does it heat up? This is unknown for now. It's only known that to heat matter to the extreme is very difficult, and is definitely not something a single source device can achieve - it must be related to the enormous system behind the source device.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this heating can only target extremely small particles. In an instant, a tiny particle is heated to the extreme, reaching a certain balance and maintaining it, transforming into source.</p><p></p><p>As more and more particles transform into source and aggregate together, they eventually transform into a 'source pearl' that can be observed by humans.</p><p></p><p>To instantly heat an entire piece of wood to the extreme and transform it into source is impossible, even the 'system' cannot do it!</p><p></p><p>In summary, to transform matter into source requires accumulating small transformations into a larger one, a gradual process."</p><p></p><p>Suhao paused his pen, furrowing his brow in thought: "So the current question is, how to heat a single particle to the extreme and transform it into source?"</p><p></p><p>The answer may lie in motion.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few years, he has observed the transformations of source devices and source beasts countless times, knowing that the transformation of matter into source is related to motion. But now thinking about it, he realized there was something off.</p><p></p><p>Can motion really heat up particles? What kind of motion can heat particles to that degree?</p><p></p><p>He just sat quietly at his desk, staring at his various notes, his eyes seeming unfocused, not knowing what he was thinking about.</p><p></p><p>What exactly is this system? How does it heat objects through source devices? Why does it appear randomly? Is this a special property of this planet or of this universe?</p><p></p><p>"Almost there! I'll soon know everything!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao packed away his jumbled thoughts and left the lab: "My thinking has been constrained. Simply researching source devices and source beasts can no longer yield anything more. I need to expand, obtain more data, broaden my perspective!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything to Yashan or Fengcheng, directly flying out of the base miniworld and into the high altitude, wandering in 'silent flight mode' in the upper atmosphere of this world.</p><p></p><p>With his spiritual perception fully extended to a 200,000 meter radius, he collected any data that seemed useful.</p><p></p><p>He intended to roam around this planet, observing the appearance of this world from a macro perspective, perhaps making some discoveries.</p><p></p><p>He had researched the microscopic world for too long. After this new breakthrough, falling into a new bottleneck, he decided to consider the problem from a different angle.</p><p></p><p>Another half year passed.</p><p></p><p>Within this half year, Suhao had wandered through almost all the continents and oceans of this planet, and he did discover one useful piece of information.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, not information, but a doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Are disasters truly randomly occurring?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, over this half year of wandering, he had witnessed the outbreak of countless disasters, which were then resolved by source masters, with stardust scattered across the world, appearing as random occurrences.</p><p></p><p>But the more he saw, the deeper his doubts grew. He had previously assumed disasters were random, but now he was questioning this again.</p><p></p><p>It's like how many people believe that when rolling dice, the final number shown is random. But thinking deeper, is the final number when rolling dice truly random?</p><p></p><p>If it is truly random, then the dice is innocent - it is the hand rolling the dice that is random.</p><p></p><p>In theory, a person can control the number they roll...</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my previous guess was mistaken. The occurrence of disasters is not random, but follows a certain pattern. If I grasp this pattern, then that mysterious system will also surface!"</p><p></p><p>If this is true, Suhao had an intuition that this system must be extremely concise.</p><p></p><p>So concise that it is simply a basic mathematical principle he had learned countless years ago.</p><p></p><p>What could it be?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Suhao stopped wandering further and transmitted back to the base miniworld: "To find the pattern, aimless flying won't work! My spiritual perception only has a 200,000 meter range, too small. By the time I collect enough data, the so-called pattern will have long disappeared.</p><p></p><p>So to obtain more comprehensive and precise data, I still need the help of a massive organization. I wonder how Zhuipeng's Glorious is doing."</p><p></p><p>It had been about three years since Glorious occupied Pingkong City. They should have stabilized their foothold by now!</p><p></p><p>After returning to the base miniworld, Suhao sent messages to Fengcheng and Yashan, asking them to gather at his lab.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Yashan arrived looking energetic yet with bloodshot eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei!" His voice was a bit hoarse and off-pitch from lack of interaction.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Yashan, from your appearance, it seems you've had a research breakthrough recently?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan excitedly replied, "Yes, I've successfully simulated the spiritual frequencies of both the energy-type and matter-type source masters. I even made it into software that can model their abilities through spiritual simulation. For example..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Yashan raised his hand with fingers slightly spread.</p><p></p><p>"Crackle!"</p><p></p><p>Brilliant electric arcs danced between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"This is my simulation of the Lightning Source Master, no weaker than an actual one. And the Fire Source Master..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan tapped his foot, and the ground burst into raging flames that spread outwards into molten lava.</p><p></p><p>"And the Explosive Source Master..."</p><p></p><p>He displayed it like a treasure, showcasing various abilities one by one in his hands, the resulting destruction repaired by his Transformative Adamantine Armor.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I've uploaded all this data to the 'Source - Spiritual Frequency Simulation' folder in the assistant."</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened the small app Yashan made with interest. He retrieved the Fire Source Master data, followed the instructions to adjust his spiritual frequency, channeled a trace of 'source' for transformation, and flames gushed out along the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh - BOOM!"</p><p></p><p>Intense flames suddenly erupted around them, in the blink of an eye becoming an ocean of fire.</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand to extinguish the flames, laughing heartily, "Yashan, not bad at all! Your progress is remarkably fast!"</p>

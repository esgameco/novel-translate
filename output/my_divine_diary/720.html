        <h1>Chapter 720</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After listening to Su Hao's words, Xia Qingjun's first reaction was 'Has this Xu Shiqiang gone crazy? Isn't this just seeking death?'</p><p></p><p>He frowned deeply: "Xu Shiqiang, this is a critical moment, I have no mind to joke with you."</p><p></p><p>For this, Su Hao could understand, it was human nature.</p><p></p><p>For things beyond their comprehension, humans had an incredibly low acceptance.</p><p></p><p>Faced with unfamiliar things, their common cognition was 'I am right, he is wrong!'</p><p></p><p>His will could not be easily changed by a few words.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the leader of humanity, he could not afford to be careless at all, because humanity could not afford to gamble.</p><p></p><p>To make Xia Qingjun change his cognition, the method was simple: use the most brutal way to overturn his perception of the world, shatter all his confidence and will, and then rebuild a new cognition.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao, who knew this well, did not explain much.</p><p></p><p>He directly took Xia Qingjun and the captain to a desolate planet, waved his hand to summon a large piece of energy blocks, and gestured in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>Then he threw them far away.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he said: "A few years ago, I did research on energy blocks. There is a special trumpet vortex structure in the energy blocks, which is the reason why it can produce enormous energy.</p><p></p><p>I accidentally found a way to destroy the structure of the energy block, which can make the energy block suddenly explode. I call it the 'energy burst wave', or make the energy block suddenly fail, which I call the 'energy degradation wave'.</p><p></p><p>Like this!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he stretched out his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack!"</p><p></p><p>Pink crystal vines spread out, forming a rune array.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was afraid the two couldn't understand, so he casually explained: "This is a supernatural power I developed, which can use energy to generate a special pink crystal.</p><p></p><p>I used this crystal to temporarily create an 'energy wave generator', which can release a special frequency wave, which is the 'burst wave' and 'degradation wave' I mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of wave can also be achieved by machines!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, ignoring the two's increasingly numb expressions, he activated the rune in front of his palm.</p><p></p><p>'Energy burst wave'!</p><p></p><p>All the energy blocks in front were disturbed by the wave and instantly released all their energy.</p><p></p><p>Like a nuclear explosion, forming a dazzling sun.</p><p></p><p>A powerful shockwave swept past, hitting the protective barrier in front of the three, making them squint instinctively and want to retreat and hide.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>Followed by a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>When everything calmed down, Su Hao looked at the two completely dazed people and patiently explained: "This is the effect of the 'energy burst wave', releasing the energy of the energy blocks. Of course, it can also directly disable the energy blocks."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he casually scattered another pile of energy blocks, rebuilt a rune array, and activated the rune.</p><p></p><p>'Energy degradation wave'!</p><p></p><p>The originally shiny energy blocks instantly lost their color, becoming dull and dark, like withered persimmons, shriveling up. At a glance, it was obvious that the energy blocks were scrapped!</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Su Hao took the two people with strange expressions back to Bluelight after confirming they had received the information.</p><p></p><p>He put the two back in their original positions, and then said: "I have investigated and found that the Octopus Clan's ships and technology are all built on energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as we control the energy blocks, we can control the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many warships they send, it doesn't matter. As long as we set up machines specifically attacking energy blocks, the Octopus Clan's ships cannot approach Bluelight.</p><p></p><p>To directly destroy the Octopus Clan's warships, use the 'energy burst wave' machine to shine on them, and all the warships will instantly shatter into pieces;</p><p></p><p>To paralyze them, use the 'energy degradation wave' machine to shine on them, and all the warships will lose their weapons and power.</p><p></p><p>It's that simple. The era of ultra-long-range warship combat is over. Before the Octopus Clan develops a way to shield the 'energy wave', you are invincible."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the captain opened their mouths: "......"</p><p></p><p>As if they had lost their ability to think.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Rest assured, this wave can be set in a specific direction, so you don't have to worry about harming yourselves, feel free to use it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you have enough warships, you can also install these machines on the warships and take the opportunity to launch a counterattack against the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, the efficiency is too low, I don't recommend you do that.</p><p></p><p>As long as you have enough high-precision workshops and corresponding researchers, I have a way to mass-produce 'Star Shard Cubes'. I can provide you with enough quantities. You can send out a large number of warships carrying the small cubes to directly destroy the Octopus Clan's colony planets.</p><p></p><p>If not in ten years, then twenty years or a hundred years. The Octopus Clan may have many colony planets, but they haven't reached an uncountable number yet!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to Su Hao's words, Xia Qingjun and the captain's mouths gradually widened, their eyes full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The crisis of human survival and extinction...</p><p></p><p>Was just solved by Xu Shiqiang's few words?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was not just a simple matter of resolving the crisis. If handled well, it was not impossible for humanity to reverse the situation.</p><p></p><p>This was a weapon against energy blocks, which was absolutely the core of the Octopus Clan. If the energy blocks were scrapped, then the Octopus Clan's huge fleet and powerful technology would be like decorations, posing no threat to humanity.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but there was also the extremely terrifying 'Star Shard Cube', a weapon that made one shudder just thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>If every Octopus Clan colony planet was hit by one...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xia Qingjun and the captain felt an electric current run through their bodies, their hair instantly standing on end.</p><p></p><p>"Such a reversal is simply......"</p><p></p><p>They could not find the right idiom to express their inner emotions.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun imagined a little and envisioned the future scene. He couldn't help but murmur: "If it's really as you say, the upcoming battle will no longer be about who has more warships..."</p><p></p><p>The tremendous sense of shock left Xia Qingjun and the captain unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the captain saw the crux of the problem with his professional eye and frowned: "How far is the effective range of the energy burst wave? The Octopus Clan's most powerful mothership is equipped with a 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' that can directly attack Bluelight from any angle outside the star system.</p><p></p><p>We can't possibly arrange that many ships to monitor and guard at all times..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "The propagation speed of the energy wave is close to the speed of light, and it can propagate very far in space. But I haven't tested it myself, so I don't know the specific propagation range. However, according to the calculations of energy wave diffusion and attenuation, the effective range in space can reach ten billion kilometers."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao pointed to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng and said: "These two are my assistants, called Jia Ya Shan and Jia Feng Cheng. With the two of them, Bluelight will be worry-free.</p><p></p><p>Even if a mothership arrives outside Bluelight, don't panic. As long as the mothership cannot instantly activate the Planet Destroyer Cannon to attack Bluelight, the two of them can quickly deal with the mothership."</p><p></p><p>"Assistants???" Xia Qingjun and the captain couldn't help but look at Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were full of questions, unable to understand how these two people could guarantee the safety of the planet.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan's colony planets had extremely strong defenses in their star domains. Our ships could not get close at all. This time, the 'Changnge' managed to slip through a gap and drop the Star Shard Cube.</p><p></p><p>But after this incident, the Octopus Clan will certainly strengthen their defenses. Our opportunity to destroy the Octopus Clan's colony planets will become extremely slim.</p><p></p><p>In other words, taking the opportunity to counterattack the Octopus Clan's colony planets is probably not possible.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought about it and understood the captain's predicament: it was like having a super weapon but being unable to throw it to the designated location.</p><p></p><p>So he pointed to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng and said: "No problem, as long as humanity cooperates well, the two of them can complete this task."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the captain widened their eyes again, looking at Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Just who were these two young men with cool expressions?</p><p></p><p>What skills did they possess to be able to accomplish what human warships and troops could not?</p><p></p><p>They liked the kind of thing the Old Master arranged.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was nice to have some other fun outside of the monotonous research life.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, if they died, it would just be the [Octopus God] dying.</p><p></p><p>Any problem?</p><p></p><p>No problem!</p>

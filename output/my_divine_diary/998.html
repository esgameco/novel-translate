        <h1>Chapter 998</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao collected a large amount of different materials through Yashan and Fengcheng, organized and categorized them, analyzed their characteristics, and planned to test them one by one in the future to see if the bouncing ball space could take them away.</p><p></p><p>According to his conjecture, there must be some kind of material that could be taken to the non-material world by the bouncing ball space.</p><p></p><p>Likening the material world to seawater and the non-material world to the atmosphere, although they seem distinct, there are always some bubbles in the seawater and moisture in the air - nothing is absolute.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the part of the 'seawater' that is in direct contact with the air at the sea surface, after changing its state, has a chance to come to the 'atmosphere' of the non-material world."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that the type of material closest to the non-material world might be able to be taken away by the bouncing ball space.</p><p></p><p>"So, what material would be closest to the non-material world? Is it source?"</p><p></p><p>This point had not been tested, and it was difficult to draw conclusions from pure reasoning.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen years later, the bouncing ball space arrived at a planet, and Su Hao's preset program immediately started, absorbing a large amount of material, and then arranging and combining them in a specific order to form the 'focus system' to obtain a small amount of source as quickly as possible, and absorbed it around the bouncing ball space.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for this opportunity in more than ten years, Su Hao only needed to complete one task, which was to test whether the bouncing ball space could take the source away.</p><p></p><p>If it worked, everything would become very simple. If not, he would wait for the next opportunity and try transforming the source into various materials.</p><p></p><p>As long as he kept trying, there would eventually be a surprise.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's bouncing ball vision, under the effect of the 'focus system', within just two seconds, the source was successfully transformed and transferred inward, absorbed onto the 'surface' of the bouncing ball space theory, maintaining contact with a specific signal.</p><p></p><p>"Can the source be taken away by the bouncing ball space?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waited quietly for the result. After a short while, he would know the answer.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the bouncing ball space abruptly disappeared from this planet and went to another unknown place.</p><p></p><p>"Failed. Although the source is very special, it cannot successfully follow the bouncing ball space to leave. I can only carry out the preset plan and try out the materials I know one by one."</p><p></p><p>Failure was expected by Su Hao, and he was not discouraged by it.</p><p></p><p>If it works, it works. If not, so be it. There's no need to be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few years later, the bouncing ball space arrived at another planet. Su Hao obtained the source at the fastest speed and then transformed it into elemental energy, attempting to have the bouncing ball space take it away.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this kind of parasitic material also failed. They could not parasitize on the surface of the bouncing ball space.</p><p></p><p>The source and elemental energy were what Su Hao thought were most likely to be taken away by the bouncing ball space, but they both failed.</p><p></p><p>This showed that Su Hao's 'feeling' about what the bouncing ball space could take was not very reliable.</p><p></p><p>"What is closest to the non-material world?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered for a moment, then shook his head and continued preparing for the next experiment.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later, after another failed experiment, Su Hao put down the experiment, thought for a moment, and decided to leave the laboratory and walk around the infinite land to relax his mind and change his perspective. Perhaps after a walk, he would have a new idea.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Su Hao was going out, Yashan and Fengcheng also put down what they were doing and followed Su Hao for a leisurely stroll.</p><p></p><p>It felt really nice for the three of them to get together every once in a while.</p><p></p><p>It was just like a few old friends getting together for a barbecue and drinks during their work breaks.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Old Master Wei, have you made any progress in your research?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Yashan and Fengcheng did not know what Su Hao's research project was, only that Su Hao was collecting various special materials for research.</p><p></p><p>However, they knew that when Su Hao came out for a stroll, it was either because he had completed a stage of the task or needed to come out and find inspiration.</p><p></p><p>If he had completed a stage, they could celebrate. If he came out to find inspiration, they could think about it together.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled faintly and said, "There has been some progress, but now I'm stuck at one point. Solving this problem doesn't need time, but it also needs time. Take it slowly, and it will eventually be solved.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I've prepared to spend billions of years solving this problem. Overall, there's no rush."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>To spend billions of years researching a project was difficult for them to understand, especially when the one researching was Old Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>What kind of problem would require Old Master Wei to prepare to spend billions of years to tackle?</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng laughed, "Some gains."</p><p></p><p>However, there was one point that was different from what Su Hao thought.</p><p></p><p>The light in their eyes was not because their own projects had made progress, but because they rarely had the chance to take a walk and chat with Old Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>At first, they could see each other every few days. Later, it became every few months. Now, it was basically calculated in years - a few years, a few decades, or even a few centuries.</p><p></p><p>This made each of their small gatherings very precious...</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was very precious for Yashan and Fengcheng, but ordinary for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he wanted to see them, it was just a matter of saying so.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Tell me, I'm also very interested in the progress of your research over the years."</p><p></p><p>Yashan spoke first, "My research on 'Speech Art' has basically taken shape. Using source as the energy core and matching language with the corresponding spiritual frequency in a specific way, I can achieve 'speech becoming reality.'</p><p></p><p>Not only that, based on Speech Art, I have done more in-depth research on spiritual power and found that the power of the spirit is no less than the elemental power we have mastered. If there is a major breakthrough in the future, it may even reach the level of reversing yin and yang and reversing 'life and death.'"</p><p></p><p>He had many planetary experimental fields, and the vast number of creatures created for his experiments were shining and burning for him, allowing his experiments to progress very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Yashan smiled again, "The reason I was able to succeed so smoothly is also thanks to the mature and well-established 'Point Breaking Surface Spiritual Method.'</p><p></p><p>For mortals, this spiritual method can be called a stairway to heaven, a shortcut to transcendence for mortals to become immortal.</p><p></p><p>There are still many aspects that can be explored. I plan to create more planetary experimental fields in the future to study the various changes of spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "According to your research, you may be able to create a world with a single thought in the future."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "That's indeed possible. I believe that our spiritual power, like this universe, is infinite."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yashan had his own clear pursuit, Su Hao expressed great gratification and turned to Fengcheng, asking, "Fengcheng, have you figured out the characteristics of the demon insect genes and cells?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng could hardly conceal the excitement in his eyes, "I figured it out fifty years ago. Now I have successfully implanted the protective mechanism of demon insect cells into human cells. So far, no abnormalities have been found. On the contrary, they have shown extremely strong physical adaptability, even stronger than that of demon insects. This means that humans with this cellular mechanism will have even greater physical potential.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have also implanted elemental energy into these new humans, and it is still in the observation stage. But based on the current situation, these human individuals are much stronger than ordinary humans."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was astonished, "What, you want to create a new human race?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded, "That's right. After the elemental energy implantation test is completed, I plan to create an entirely new human race, embedding great power into their genes so that they can gain enough self-preservation power as they grow up. Then I will release them into the infinite land and observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, I can observe how far this tribe can push the power of their genes in the future.</p><p></p><p>Just as Old Master Yashan said, the spiritual power of humans is as infinite as the universe. Moreover, I also believe that the physical power of humans has no limit."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Perhaps you can throw the modified humans onto a planet with an extremely harsh environment devoid of life and see if they can survive. If they can survive, over time they will inevitably evolve into something we don't know."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's eyes lit up, "Oh? Old Master Wei, your suggestion is feasible. With multiple samples progressing step by step, we may indeed evolve life forms that can adapt to various harsh environments."</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao and the others seemed to be casually chatting, after their chat, they really planned to do what they discussed.</p>

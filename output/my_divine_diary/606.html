        <h1>Chapter 606</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The monk smiled lightly and said, "Qishou! I've come to realize something - in this world, no one is indispensable. No matter who dies, the world will not change at all.</p><p></p><p>Even the royal families were not indispensable. Previously they seemed so important and essential, but now that things have happened, looking back, it was nothing more than that.</p><p></p><p>Except for those whose interests were directly harmed and raged about it, the vast majority of people only cared about their own food, clothing, shelter and transportation. Whether the royal families lived or died had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>Do you understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>Qishou pondered for a moment and honestly answered, "No, I don't understand."</p><p></p><p>The monk said helplessly, "What I mean is, even our Monk Association is not as important and indispensable as we imagined. Essentially, we are the same as the royal families - we could be eliminated at any time, and then another organization would continue our work.</p><p></p><p>After our Monk Association is eliminated, the world would still remain the same. People would still live their lives on the original track, with no difference before and after. </p><p></p><p>If there had to be a difference, it would probably just be that many monks in the association died, including you and me. We are not as important as we imagined."</p><p></p><p>Qishou blankly said, "Impossible...who could destroy the Monk Association? No one can do that. After all, the association is different from the royal families!"</p><p></p><p>The monk sighed, "I originally thought the same as you, that the Monk Association represented the last bottom line of the world, an eternal organization. But now I think that was too presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Before the royal families were destroyed, no one would have imagined that they would be nearly annihilated in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>This world is much more complicated than we thought."</p><p></p><p>The monk seemed to be explaining to Qishou, but also convincing himself, "Why should we intervene? What is the core purpose of our 'Harmony' existence?"</p><p></p><p>Qishou said, "To eliminate disasters around the world and create a peaceful land for human survival."</p><p></p><p>The monk nodded, "So as long as we do what we should - eliminate disasters around the world - that's enough. As for who rules this world, we don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>Qishou hesitated, but finally voiced his doubt, "But...the last clause of the Eighteen Empire Agreement clearly states that 'Harmony' must uphold the orthodox Eighteen Empires..."</p><p></p><p>The monk said indifferently, "Qishou! The royal families are all dead, who are we upholding? So the Eighteen Empire Agreement has lost its subject and is invalid! Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Qishou's face wrinkled into a ball, "Monk, I still don't understand..."</p><p></p><p>The monk closed his eyes helplessly, sighing at Qishou's thick skull. His voice rose uncontrollably, even becoming somewhat unrestrained, "Qishou! I can't beat the leader of the Radiant Society, Jiawai! Even if all the monks of the association joined forces, we still couldn't defeat him alone! Do you understand what I'm saying? Or do I have to spell it out for you to get it? Otherwise, how do you think he was able to kidnap seventeen emperors right under my nose?"</p><p></p><p>Qishou froze, "Ah?? Um...I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Oh no, the monk's irritable nature is showing!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The plan was proceeding quite smoothly, like a dream for Zhipeng himself.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten years, the Radiant Society he personally founded had actually massacred almost all the top nobles of the world, and the Radiant Society would replace the position of the royal families to rule this world.</p><p></p><p>This was such a bizarre thing. In his view, it was even more inconceivable than the bizarre disasters occurring around the world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not forget that all of this stemmed from his cooperation with Mr. Jiawai!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Radiant Society he founded might already be dead in some corner by now.</p><p></p><p>This could not help but make Zhipeng marvel, "Jiawai, Jiayashan, Jiafengcheng, they are really too powerful! The top nobles of the world, they said eliminate and they eliminated them!"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng vaguely remembered Jiawai once revealing the reason for eliminating the royal families, "To me, the royal families are just like mosquitoes flying around me, making me uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, it made Zhipeng's heart go cold.</p><p></p><p>Just because they made him uncomfortable, he eliminated the entire world's royal families. Such a person...is too vicious! In comparison, his 'letting the light shine upon the land' amounted to nothing!</p><p></p><p>Ah! This is such a sad discovery.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Zhipeng kept reminding himself never to do anything to make Mr. Jiawai uncomfortable! Otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Yashan heard of Zhipeng's doubts, he laughed heartily, "Zhipeng, don't worry, just boldly do it! You don't have the ability yet to make the old master uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was dumbfounded - what kind of answer was that?</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng nodded and listened intently, "Mmhmm!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "No matter what the old master's orders are, do your utmost to accomplish them. Don't ask why, don't weigh the pros and cons, even if the old master's orders would make the Radiant Society collapse, even if his orders would make this world perish...do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng, "Under...stand. But..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately pointed at Zhipeng, "Don't ask why!"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng, "Okay! I won't ask!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan showed a satisfied smile and posed a simple question to test him, "Okay, now I'll ask you a question: If there is scorching molten lava in front, falling in would absolutely burn you to ashes, and the old master happens to tell you to jump in, what would you do?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng's eyes widened as he stammered, "Jump...jump in?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan patted Zhipeng's shoulder, "Your determination is still not high enough! You should answer 'jump in', don't use a question, don't hesitate! Me, Fengcheng, you, the Radiant Society, even this world - our reason for existence is to serve the old master! Do you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p></p><p>This time Zhipeng understood and was greatly shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After parting with Yashan, the more he thought about it, the more it didn't sit right, so he went to ask Fengcheng the same question.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng stroked his chin in thought, "What would make the old master uncomfortable? I'm also not very clear on that. But the old master really doesn't like trouble, so if you're sincere about it, just do whatever he tells you properly, and you can improvise the rest. The old master is very reasonable."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng's scalp went numb - what did "very reasonable" mean?</p><p></p><p>"So, since you're still doing fine, it means the old master has a good impression of you. Just do what needs to be done, and there won't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng shuddered - the way Fengcheng put it, not only did it not reassure him, it made him even more apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the opinions of Yashan and Fengcheng, Zhipeng became even more flustered. Suddenly he felt that none of these three were normal people!</p><p></p><p>When Mr. Jiayashan spoke to him, the fanatical belief in his eyes burst forth unrestrained, enveloping Zhipeng's face like a crushing tide, almost suffocating him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>He had no doubt about the credibility of Mr. Jiayashan's words. He believed that if there really was molten lava in front, with just one word from Mr. Jiawai, Mr. Jiayashan would jump in without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Just like my friend, it's inconceivable! But I can confirm, this is absolutely not a Source Ability!"</p><p></p><p>"And Mr. Jiafengcheng is the same way. Although not as fanatically devoted, it seems like the entire meaning of his life has been dedicated to Mr. Jiawai! This...is simply terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I should just ask Mr. Jiawai himself for his opinion! He will definitely tell me what I should do."</p>

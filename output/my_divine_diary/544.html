        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the others observed from midair for a while. After truly confirming that the bizarre source beast disaster had been completely eliminated, Axing planned to go down and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head in a cowardly manner and said, "I'll stay up here for now, you guys go ahead! I'm not too interested in what happens next."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he felt a chill thinking about this bizarre disaster that targeted consciousness. If he could avoid contact with it, he would try his best to do so, until he had the ability to analyze it.</p><p></p><p>However, he also understood that just avoiding it was useless. To truly ensure his own safety, he had to thoroughly analyze the essence of the 'source', so he could control these bizarre dangers.</p><p></p><p>He had made up his mind to put other matters aside for now and devote all his efforts to breaking through to the divine realm and obtaining 'divine consciousness', so he could use the divine consciousness to quickly analyze the source!</p><p></p><p>No one could stop him from cultivating. Trying to stop his cultivation would be categorized as trying to kill him. Anyone trying to kill him was an enemy, and enemies would be directly eliminated!</p><p></p><p>It was as simple and justified as that.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, some chaos broke out below, it seemed Axing, Awang and some other teams had clashed and were in a standoff.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered, deciding not to go down himself, but instead controlled the small animals that had returned to normal to run over and observe.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>A burly, hairy man with solid exposed muscles waved a large hammer wildly and laughed maniacally, "What a joke! It was clearly our Hairy Team that killed the bizarre source beast. Our Hairy Team went through immense hardships to eliminate the bizarre source beast and resolve this huge 'pandemic' crisis!</p><p></p><p>You little brats, look at yourselves, how dare you jump out trying to steal our credit? It's utterly shameful.</p><p></p><p>Get lost, or don't blame this old man's hammer for not being discriminating."</p><p></p><p>The two teammates behind the burly man also looked indignant, as if they had suffered a great injustice.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had taken the lead and obtained the source bead of the bizarre source beast. Now they were hiding the huge pig's head behind them, clearly treating it as their spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from their mud-stained bodies and blood-smeared mouths, they had also turned into pigs earlier.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, people came over to watch the commotion, their faces showing interest.</p><p></p><p>After a disaster was resolved, it was common for disputes over credit to arise. In controversial situations like this, whoever had the bigger fists would likely prevail.</p><p></p><p>On one side were three intimidating muscular men, on the other two young guys - the outcome was obvious. Regardless of who actually resolved the bizarre source beast disaster, those three big men would likely get the credit in the end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the name 'Hairy Team' didn't sound flattering, their strength was top-notch. Many people in the entire Hengxuan area could recognize this name.</p><p></p><p>Because this ferocious-looking big man was an extremely powerful bizarre source magician! Known as 'The Blacksmith'!</p><p></p><p>Could you imagine someone being hammered into the shape of a sword? Being hit by that big hammer would turn you into a weapon, but this weapon would still have eyes, ears and the ability to speak!</p><p></p><p>The burly Blacksmith's beard bristled with anger, "You little brat, what did you say? Who did you call a pig? Who did you say was laughably rooting in the dirt?"</p><p></p><p>This really struck a nerve, as if he didn't have the memory of turning into a pig, it wouldn't be so bad. But the key was that he vividly remembered everything he did as a pig, including trying to mate with his teammates after eating his fill...</p><p></p><p>The humiliation!</p><p></p><p>Everyone turned into pigs, so why were these two still clean and presentable? They deserved a beating!</p><p></p><p>Awang frowned, "Axing, let's just leave while we can!"</p><p></p><p>Axing knew his own strength was no match against the Hairy Team, and he would definitely get the short end of the stick. But a raging fire was burning in his chest.</p><p></p><p>This mission was completely resolved by Ayang alone. He and Awang had barely been able to help at all!</p><p></p><p>Not helping was fine, he didn't mind that. Everyone had their own areas of expertise, which was the point of teaming up. But he was responsible for collecting the spoils of battle. If even those were snatched from his hands, how could he face his teammates as the leader?</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to back down. At the very least, they had to fight first before retreating!</p><p></p><p>Axing gritted his teeth, "Awang, I can't just leave like this!"</p><p></p><p>Awang nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>The burly Blacksmith snorted coldly, "No need to cry until you see the coffin. Since you're so shameless as to try and snatch my spoils of war, then go die!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he erupted from the ground, letting out a "hu" sound as he charged at Axing, swinging his hammer down.</p><p></p><p>Axing dodged to the side and shot back a blade of qi.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The hammer struck the ground, shaking the earth around it. A series of sword images suddenly leapt up from underground, like a multitude of carps jumping out of water - a magnificent sight.</p><p></p><p>Ding ding ding!</p><p></p><p>These iron swords jutting out of the ground happened to block Axing's qi blade.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers quickly retreated when the fight broke out, to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The burly Blacksmith laughed maniacally as he swung his hammer, sending countless iron swords flying at Axing like a returning storm of blades.</p><p></p><p>Awang took out two pellets and flung them to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang!</p><p></p><p>Two explosions - one pellet burst into a thick earthen wall in front of them, the other released a dense cloud of smoke, obscuring the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Pu pu pu!</p><p></p><p>The iron swords riddled the earthen wall with holes until it collapsed.</p><p></p><p>But Axing and Awang's figures had already vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Hiding won't help, let's see you hide from this - Weapon Forest!"</p><p></p><p>Gripping the hammer handle with both hands, he raised it high and slammed it into the ground with a mighty shout.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Pu pu pu!</p><p></p><p>Within a 200 meter radius underground, a dense forest of spears suddenly erupted, thrusting upwards to a height of 5 meters - a chilling, terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Suhao had grabbed Axing and Awang by their collars and rapidly flown them up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were drenched in cold sweat, staring down at the spear forest below that they had narrowly avoided being skewered by.</p><p></p><p>After flying up high, Suhao released them and said, "Axing, Awang, why didn't you call me to join the fight?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said helplessly, "The bizarre source beast we took down was brazenly snatched by that shameless guy. I just couldn't let it go..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "If you can't let it go, then just kill him. Why bother arguing with them?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said helplessly, "I can't let it go, but I also can't beat them..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said speechlessly, "Who told you fighting means killing with knives? You could have just followed them, had Awang prepare some more poison gas, and secretly gas them all unconscious! Odorless and invisible, even if it doesn't kill them in one day, you can gas them for two or three days. Fill the area five meters around them with poison gas, I'm sure that would take them down...Axing, wake up! You're invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Axing was stunned after hearing this. These were tactics he used against source beasts, but they could also be used against people?</p><p></p><p>Originally Suhao had planned to casually kill those few with a few moves, but since Axing wanted to try, then let him try!</p><p></p><p>He then wrote down a few poison gas formulas and handed them to Awang, "Can your box produce these? Try mixing them, the combined effect might be better."</p><p></p><p>The two glanced at each other, seeing the surprise in each other's eyes. Was Ayang not a studious type after all? Why hadn't they seen these formulas before?</p><p></p><p>Awang nodded, "As long as I have the precise structures, I should be able to produce them. Give me a moment to make the corresponding treasure boxes."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the three members of the Hairy Team underground looked up and sneered, "Slinking away! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"This bizarre source beast was killed by our Hairy Team!"</p><p></p><p>The burly Blacksmith swung his hammer and slammed it onto the huge pig's head.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>After a muffled sound, the pig's head bounced up and transformed into a large blade, its pork-colored patterns clearly visible yet gleaming with a metallic luster in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Utterly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>The burly Blacksmith casually tossed the blade to his teammate behind him and laughed uproariously, "Let's go! Submit the mission and enjoy the wine and beauties that are ours! Hahaha!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 593</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xiangli and the Flying Chariot squad were secretly flying over the vast ocean, heading towards the island where the Small World base was located.</p><p></p><p>Xiangli kept staring at the map and compass, making sure their position didn't deviate.</p><p></p><p>"This direction should be correct, probably about 30 more kilometers to go."</p><p></p><p>"Flying Chariot, are you sure the Grand Leader Lada is on the island?"</p><p></p><p>Flying Chariot spread his hands, "Not sure! He might be imprisoned on the island, or somewhere else, or he might even be dead already. However, since the Glorious Church has announced that the Grand Leader was captured, the possibility of him being captured is higher.</p><p></p><p>But even if he's not on the island, what does it matter? Now is the time for the allied forces to attack the Glorious Church, the Armor Strippers have definitely left the island. We'll just go take a look around, and if we can't find him, we'll leave immediately, there won't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>What if we do find the Grand Leader? With the royal family destroyed and the Grand Leader captured, the entire Horizontal Region is in chaos now. To quickly restore order, the Grand Leader needs to take charge.</p><p></p><p>Plus, don't you remember the last time we were tailed during our pursuit? This time when we go to the island, we'll insist we're just tourists, so there won't be a big problem. If we do encounter anyone, don't show hostility, just say we're lost tourists."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded seriously to show they understood.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the five of them felt their feet leave the ground, drawing an uncontrolled parabolic curve as they plummeted towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, they panicked momentarily.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Source mage tried to use his abilities again, but found that the previously smooth abilities could no longer be used.</p><p></p><p>He cried out anxiously, "My abilities are disabled again!"</p><p></p><p>The other teammates also tried to activate their own abilities, but without exception, they were all disabled.</p><p></p><p>Flying Chariot shouted loudly, "Oh no, it seems this sea area has a Source Blocking effect. Be careful to keep your body balanced, feet first into the water. Take off the metal armor on your body as soon as you hit the water."</p><p></p><p>Before hitting the water, Flying Chariot suddenly remembered something and widened his eyes towards the compass in Xiangli's hand, about to remind her that she must hold onto the compass no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"Splash splash!"</p><p></p><p>The five of them fell into the water together.</p><p></p><p>They could all swim, and soon surfaced. Flying Chariot asked urgently, "Xiangli, where's the compass?"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli raised her empty hand, "Yeah, where's the compass?"</p><p></p><p>Flying Chariot slapped his forehead, damn it!</p><p></p><p>He immediately dove back into the water, resurfacing quickly. This was the deep sea, and the metal compass had already sunk to a depth he couldn't dive to, no point trying to find it.</p><p></p><p>It was overcast now, so they couldn't tell the direction from the sun's position.</p><p></p><p>And after falling into the water just now, they had quickly lost their sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>Flying Chariot's brow furrowed as he bobbed up and down with the waves.</p><p></p><p>He had figured out one thing - this special Source Blocking effect had a certain range. Unfortunately, they had just plunged right into that range, causing their Source abilities to be disabled.</p><p></p><p>The only way now was to retreat, get out of the blocking range to restore their Source abilities. But since Xiangli had lost the compass, they had lost their sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>Flying Chariot forced himself to calm down and closed his eyes to think.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced.</p><p></p><p>"Got it!"</p><p></p><p>He could calculate their current landing point by using the initial flight speed, approximate height above the sea surface, and the projectile motion formula.</p><p></p><p>He immediately found the solution: "Come towards me and listen up! We're probably about 150 meters from the edge of the blocking range, but I can't confirm the direction now.</p><p></p><p>So, you four split up and swim at least 220 meters in four different directions. Every ten seconds, look back towards my position to get your bearings. If you don't exit the blocking range after 200 meters, immediately return to my position. Got it?"</p><p></p><p>The other four, realizing it was a life-or-death situation, responded in unison: "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Empire Allied Forces had split into ten army groups, advancing towards the Glorious Church's major cities simultaneously to wipe out the Church's forces across different locations.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the other two had already transformed into "Fate Children" and were waiting patiently far away for the enemy to approach a certain position.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "The allied forces split into ten army groups of varying sizes, scattered but not too far apart, forming a massive force that can support each other at any time. The allied commander is quite capable."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Who cares about all that, I can just throw down a Million Explosion and it's over."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "We have to leave some people to run back and spread the word, otherwise how can we demonstrate our overwhelming power to the world?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I'll take care of the middle four army groups, you two handle the six on the left and right. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng excitedly said, "Sounds good, Boss Wei! Time to show off the Million Explosion!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan reminded, "But don't blow them all up, remember to leave some alive."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Old Yashan! I know my limits, I'll handle it perfectly."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Suhao said, "Alright, let's move!"</p><p></p><p>He finished speaking and flickered away from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Yashan flickered away three seconds later, while Fengcheng held back for a full five seconds before successfully flickering.</p><p></p><p>Suhao reappeared above one of the army groups, quickly forming a "Source Vector Suppression Array" beside him and activating it.</p><p></p><p>The array flashed white light, then disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It was this flash that alerted the army group below to Suhao's presence above.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>"Armor Stripper! Alarm, enemy attack!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A huge alarm immediately sounded below, and they began moving according to the predetermined plan in an orderly fashion.</p><p></p><p>However, when they tried to use their abilities, they found their powers had been disabled.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, our abilities are disabled!"</p><p>"Mine too!"</p><p>"What's going on? The 'Dispel' effect is supposed to be maintained at all times, right? Ability mages, report!"</p><p>"It's maintained, but our abilities are also disabled. Meaning the 'Dispel' is ineffective against whatever is disabling our powers."</p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p>"What do we do next?"</p><p>"Don't panic! There's a contingency plan for situations like this."</p><p>"What's the plan?"</p><p>"I don't know! The army commander didn't say!"</p><p>"Damn, which idiot is the army commander?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone saw the tall, dazzling crystal armored figure in the sky retract its fists into a boxing stance, with a huge crystal shield materializing in front of it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the armor glowed golden, and the figure threw an explosive punch.</p><p></p><p>There was no sound, and the shield didn't shatter, as if it was just a joke.</p><p></p><p>After the punch, Suhao ignored the scene below and immediately flickered away to the next army group.</p><p></p><p>Four punches later, he was done!</p><p></p><p>It was simply a divine skill for clearing out grunts!</p><p></p><p>The speed for clearing grunts was even faster than his 'Ten Thousand Swords Volley'.</p><p></p><p>Now, this ability belonged to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's actions were also swift. After activating the 'Source Vector Suppression Array', he jumped right down, unleashing his Lightning Fire Domain along with a dense barrage of Vajra Thorn explosions as the finishing blow.</p><p></p><p>Resolving the issue in an extremely short time as well.</p><p></p><p>The most outrageous was Fengcheng. After activating the 'Source Vector Suppression Array', he took out the pre-charged 'Million Explosion' from the Small World base and threw it down from high above.</p><p></p><p>Detonation!</p><p></p><p>After three loud "booms", three army groups were almost wiped out, with only a few survivors at the extreme edges who managed to endure thanks to the distance and strong physiques.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not everyone with a strong body at the edges survived either.</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't open their mouths died from their lungs exploding due to the powerful shockwave. Those who stood dumbfounded with mouths agape miraculously lived.</p><p></p><p>The three regrouped, and Fengcheng was still trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit too intense for him.</p><p></p><p>Yashan joked, "Fengcheng, you're someone who has experienced the apocalypse, yet blowing up just three army groups gets you this excited?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng calmed down a bit and laughed awkwardly, "I don't know, my hands and feet just felt a bit cold after the explosion."</p><p></p><p>Yashan teased, "You're embarrassing the Celestial Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>For Yashan, it was merely clearing some stumbling blocks on the path of research, he wouldn't have any feelings about it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Since he had been reborn into this world and decided to delay as much as possible to research the Source, then it was inevitable that this world would face a catastrophic planetary impact hundreds of years later.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't quickly research a way to destroy the planet, then the outcome was obvious - not just a matter of tens of millions of lives, but the entire planet would be destroyed and civilization would end.</p><p></p><p>So time was even more precious to Suhao. Faced with these tens of thousands of people, he couldn't afford to hesitate or show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's blade was always pointed forward.</p><p></p><p>Those who obstruct, die!</p>

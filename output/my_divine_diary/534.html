        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The short-haired man got his heart back, as expected, but what followed was rather awkward.</p><p></p><p>He realized he didn't know how to put his heart back in.</p><p></p><p>He looked to the three transparent and shaky shadows for help, but received no response, and one of the three shadows even urged him, "Try putting it back in!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his body was getting weaker and weaker, he didn't care about that much and opened his mouth wide before shoving the heart in his hand back into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>That heart's short limbs stomped around helplessly, desperately screaming and struggling.</p><p></p><p>The power erupted from the dying man was frighteningly strong.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp~"</p><p></p><p>Then he covered his mouth to prevent it from running out again!</p><p></p><p>He succeeded! With a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>But also gradually lost consciousness and slowly died.</p><p></p><p>After the hand covering his mouth fell helplessly, the heart ran out screaming once again and darted into the distance, "It's horrible!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and reached out a little.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>That heart burst apart and disappeared. Su Hao waited quietly for a while, and didn't see anything special happen.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but secretly say, "It seems to have nothing to do with these things that ran out."</p><p></p><p>What happened in these few short minutes caused the three of them, Su Hao, to look at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>One could only say that it was unscientific!</p><p></p><p>But it's called 'bizarre', how can it still be scientific ......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned and kept pondering over and over again the man's passage from his appearance to his death, analyzing the cause of the bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>Xing and Ah Wang were covered in cold sweat, this scene still had a very big impact on them.</p><p></p><p>They had seen a lot of dead people, but it was really the first time they had encountered such a bizarre death.</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang softly said, ''I've heard of Hong Gao squad's name, it's a high-level squad, the weakest of which are all intermediate level source mages. I just don't know, what happened to the rest of this squad now, and why he was left alone."</p><p></p><p>Xing said, "Let's leave this place first and find the other squads as soon as possible to exchange information."</p><p></p><p>Now that the situation was unknown, they didn't dare to casually move this corpse, so they could only wait for the disaster to be cracked and then come back to collect his body.</p><p></p><p>The three of them left slowly once again, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao's brain lit up and exited the pinball space, saying, "I understand the trigger conditions for the organs in the body to run out!"</p><p></p><p>"Hm????" Ah Xing and Ah Wang stopped their steps violently and turned their heads to look at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reached out and pointed at the densely hanging willow branches around them, "It's these willow branches! As long as you are hit by these willow branches, the organs in the corresponding parts of the body will run out."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you guys noticed just now, but that source mage from Hong Gao squad was hit twice by branches on his body when he was chasing after his own organs, the first time in his left hand and the second time in his right arm, so I'm guessing that if he was swept by one of these drooping willow branches, then it would trigger the bizarre disaster that would cause the organs within his body to activate and run out on their own. Of course, there may be other conditions that require our subsequent observation. As for whether or not, we'll know once we try."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang looked towards these elegantly swinging willow branches, his heart palpitating, if they had come in and unknowingly moved these willow branches, then they would probably have died a miserable death by now.</p><p></p><p>"How to try?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Ah Wang, you stuff something inside the dummy, then let it actively meet the swinging willow branches and see what the reaction is."</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang nodded and did as he was told.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing controlled the dummy to approach the hanging willow branch, which swung and gently tapped on the dummy.</p><p></p><p>However the expected scene of something running out of the dummy did not happen.</p><p></p><p>Xing frowned, "Could it not be?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "There's no rush! Maybe it doesn't work on dead things, let's catch some small animals to try."</p><p></p><p>"Where are there small animals in this kind of haunted place?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "There are, I can sense that there are quite a few rats underground!"</p><p></p><p>The two men's eyes rolled round, even the rats hiding underground could be sensed? It simply subverted the two of them's perception of the word 'perception'.</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang couldn't help but ask, "Ah Yang, what else can't you perceive?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and didn't say anything, focusing on grabbing the rats.</p><p></p><p>Catching a mouse was, well, simple, Su Hao reached out and pointed a finger.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>After the explosion, a fat yellow rat was accompanied by mud, flying high up, and finally falling heavily in front of Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Stomping on its short limbs, it was spinning around in place like a drunk, obviously dumbfounded by the explosion.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Isn't this coming?"</p><p></p><p>And then reaching out his foot, this yellow rat flew up and crashed on top of the swaying willow.</p><p></p><p>And then it fell to the ground, this time it sobered up a bit, and its four short legs flew apart, running out into the distance, Su Hao and the others carefully followed.</p><p></p><p>Not a moment later, saw that the yellow rat stopped, its mouth opened wide, spitting out a variety of organs, those organs as seen before, have taken small short legs, screaming and running away.</p><p></p><p>The yellow rat was uncertain and froze in place, running and running, completely immobile.</p><p></p><p>When the three saw this, their hearts were greatly determined, "It's true!"</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as they were not swept by these willows, then there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "There is also a problem of the order, these organs that run out, there is a sequence, the first is the stomach ...... and the last one is the heart, when all the organs have run out, it is the turn of the muscles, and then the brain ...... but In any case, as long as you are hit a little, after the stomach runs, you are basically dead."</p><p></p><p>Xing and Ah Wang did not know how Su Hao could say such horrible words in such a calm tone, only knowing that after listening, the whole body was numb, and it took a while for the temperature to return.</p><p></p><p>After combing through the previous clues again, Su Hao summarized, ''So, these branches are one of the triggering conditions for this weird disaster, as long as you don't get smacked by it. Not only that, all the long strips, vines, weeds, and so on, could be disaster triggers, be careful not to get hit by these things."</p><p></p><p>It was only at this point that Xing let out a long breath and nodded, "Finally figured out one of the trigger conditions! Let's go, keep moving."</p><p></p><p>The three of them continued on, heading deeper into the Willow Forest.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Night quietly descended, the light became more and more dim, only the shadowed willow branches swayed, the night wind blew from nowhere, the whole willow forest seemed to come to life.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned and said, "The wind has a tendency to gradually become stronger, perhaps the real danger is at night."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ah Xing Ah Wang also sensed the danger and couldn't help but raise his vigilance.</p><p></p><p>The willow branches hanging down from the willow forest were very dense, if one was not careful, they would be swept, and if they swayed in an unorganized manner, there was basically no room for dodging.</p><p></p><p>During this period of time, he did a lot of experiments, such as putting Xing's air mask on the mice and throwing them onto the willow branches. Then found that as long as the willow branch was pumped, the air mask had no effect, and all sorts of messy things all came to life and ran away on their own. Another example is to use a thick lump of mud to wrap the little mouse's, only revealing a mouse head, and then throw it out, the same result.</p><p></p><p>Xing's 'Gel Body Prohibition Technique' was able to restrict the willow branch from swaying for a short while, however, it was quickly broken by the special power on the willow branch.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that was feasible was Su Hao's 'Opposite Space Barrier'.</p><p></p><p>After putting on the spatial barrier, the willow branch would not be able to sweep the body, so naturally, it would not be effective, and this discovery made Su Hao's guts gradually grow bigger.</p><p></p><p>Messing around, he finally realized that he was still invincible.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and said, "Xing, let's do some other experiments and figure out the characteristics of this willow forest as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing thought about it and also felt that just looking at it would be of no use, he still had to try it out, as long as he was careful there shouldn't be any problems, so he asked, "How do we try it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed and said, "Try destroying this willow forest."</p><p></p><p>Xing frowned, "According to my understanding of bizarre disasters, doing it the hard way usually accelerates the outbreak of the disaster and creates more unknown dangers."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "It's fine, I'm sure."</p><p></p><p>"Ah Wang, open some 'oil pills' out and throw them at the nearby willows, see if you can burn them out."</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at each other, their hearts very apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang fished out a box from his arms and poured out a bunch of flammable grease balls. Su Hao grabbed a handful of them and threw them at the willow branches in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The grease balls exploded, and a large amount of grease exploded in all directions, pouring on the surrounding willow branches.</p><p></p><p>"This is a fire pill." Ah Wang handed over a small red-colored ball at the right time, and Su Hao casually flung it.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A large amount of fire splashed around, quickly igniting the splattered grease, and the blaze blazed.</p><p></p><p>The smell of fresh grass and leaves being burnt soon wafted in, and after they waited patiently for a while, they realized that the flames were actually shaking off from the willow branches, as silky smooth as peeling off a banana skin.</p><p></p><p>The flames that were shaken off the ground burned off some of the dead leaves and weeds, and then gradually extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like the flames won't work, try directly cutting down all these trees!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out a finger and picked a direction to point out, a white blinding light shot out.</p><p></p><p>'Small - Sword of Aurora'!</p><p></p><p>Don't ask, ask is the Source of Explosion Mage.</p><p></p><p>A fingertip flicked in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Pfffff!"</p><p></p><p>The dense and thick willow trees in front of him were no different from a piece of tofu under Su Hao's sword, all of them were cut off at the waist, their branches and trunks flew about, and they fell down in a "click, click, click" manner.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!"</p><p></p><p>With Su Hao as the center, a whole fan-shaped area in front of them, one tree stacked on top of another, squeezed into a cluster, and the vision in front of the three of them was suddenly empty, and there was a little bit more light in the dimness.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang looked jaw-dropped, opened his mouth, but surprisingly, he couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao lightly laughed, "This is my skill 'Precision Initiation', of course, it's fine to call it the Sword of Dawn. Normal."</p>

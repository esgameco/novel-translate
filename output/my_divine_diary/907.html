        <h1>Chapter 907</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the four people died, Su Hao, who was observing the cosmic waves at the experimental base, was puzzled: "Huh? The cosmic waves have changed...did some dimensional travelers die? After dimensional travelers died, it seems that some of the previously accumulated energy has dissipated a lot.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current situation, the current wave fluctuations are no longer enough to affect the remaining dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>And the 'misfortune' that was originally about to arrive has been postponed, needing to re-accumulate enough energy."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed a strange expression: "Isn't this just like cultivating a demonic creature? Seeing who can persevere the longest, that person will be the final winner..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was not enthusiastic about playing this killing game. Cultivating demonic creatures was not his goal. He wanted two things: one was to create powerful enough cosmic waves, and the other was to select some suitable companions from among them to explore this universe together.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the current development of events was a bit more complicated than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>He took some time to collect information about what was happening outside, and quickly understood the cause of the events' development, sighing with relief: "It stemmed from the desires and evil thoughts in people's hearts. It seems that next time I need to scatter one hundred dimensional travelers to different places, letting them explore the world in their respective areas and gradually grow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, provide them with some guidance... But since the situation is already like this, let things develop naturally for now. I'll see first before deciding, and if it really doesn't work out, then on to the next batch."</p><p></p><p>After observing the current state of the dimensional travelers again, he ignored them and focused on the impact on the cosmic waves after the deaths of several dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>Now he had preliminarily drawn a map of the observable cosmic waves within the Huangni system. Although it was only an extremely small part, it was a start.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the current pattern drawn, Su Hao muttered: "No clue at all, what exactly...is it?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Dead?"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings were very shocked to hear that their apparent fellow villager had died.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man next to them said regretfully: "Yes, dead. I never imagined that those four would die so easily. To be honest, those four were the most learned people I've ever seen, knowledgeable in astronomy, geography, literature, and mathematics. I thought the future of Haide Town rested on those four young people.</p><p></p><p>Little did I expect...alas! Such talents wasted, as the ancients said, outstanding individuals often face adversity. I can only say this was not their stage, not their era."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling frowned and asked, "Did they find out how they died?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man said, "According to our old coroner's account, it's unbelievable. No one would believe it if I told them - the four of them went out together, and suddenly one of them turned violent and killed another. Then that person was stabbed from behind by a third person and killed. The third was then stabbed by the fourth, who was in turn stabbed by a fifth person... I don't know why this happened either, because before this they were like brothers."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked in shock, "But there were only four people, right? How did a fifth person appear?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was also puzzled: "Exactly, we couldn't figure that out either. But according to the old coroner, that's how it happened."</p><p></p><p>He lowered his voice and said, "I suspect...they were haunted by an evil spirit. In recent years, there have been rumors everywhere of people encountering ghosts, I didn't know if it was true or not. But after this incident, I believe there really are ghosts in this world. Lately, anti-ghost charms have become popular in town..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the middle-aged man took out a bunch of anti-ghost charms from somewhere and tried to sell them to the siblings: "Look at this blue jade pendant, it has the recently popular Goddess of Heaven carved on it, it's definitely effective for warding off evil spirits and has been getting popular. Don't you each want to buy one?</p><p></p><p>You don't like that? No problem, here's the newly risen 'Twin Gods' - Gail and Tali, they're on par with the Great Demon Lord. They're newly emerged human gods, young and vigorous. Not only can they help you ward off evil spirits, they'll actively chase after the evil spirits..."</p><p></p><p>The siblings were speechless: so he was just trying to sell them stuff, they didn't know if what he said earlier was true or not.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, and Cong Renfei took out money and shoved it into the middle-aged man's hand: "These Twin Gods, give me several sets, keep the change."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man said happily, "Oh, you bosses really have a good eye, choosing the most powerful charms."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei gave two sets to his sister Cong Shuling, then looked at his own "Twin Gods" sculpture with satisfaction: "The Twin Gods, so powerful, heh heh!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "......"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling looked at her own sculpture, it was quite beautiful, so she accepted it too. Protecting oneself was indeed reliable.</p><p></p><p>She looked around and saw nothing unusual, so she said, "Little Fei, let's walk around town. I have a feeling that some of the townspeople here are...not quite right."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked curiously, "What's not right about them?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't put my finger on it."</p><p></p><p>The dimensional travelers' subtle abnormalities were hard to escape the detection of the two cultivated siblings at the Yuan Ying realm, but they didn't know what it meant, nor could they pinpoint the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling made note of quite a few people, but didn't find anything else unusual, so she said, "Let's go, Little Fei. We're just one step too late."</p><p></p><p>After the two siblings left, Luo Yanfeng's heart started pounding wildly, even sweating from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Those two people...those two people...they must be extremely powerful heroes from the Heroic World, that unique aura and effortless feeling, isn't that the legendary aura of the strong?</p><p></p><p>They even specifically asked about the four dead people, they must have heard some rumors and came to investigate. If they find out my identity, I'll definitely die.</p><p></p><p>They just appeared right next to me...phew, thank goodness! Indeed, spending all my points to redeem the 'Acting' skill first was the right choice. With acting, I can perfectly conceal my aura as a dimensional traveler..."</p><p></p><p>He gradually calmed himself down, picked up two baskets of rocks and headed towards the construction site, a hopeful smile on his face, thinking: "It seems Haide Town has already attracted a lot of attention and is no longer a safe place. In two more days, I'll complete this construction task and get 20 points, plus my previous accumulation, that's over 100 points. That means I can redeem the 'Blood Vigor' cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After redeeming the Blood Vigor cultivation method, I'll immediately leave this place.</p><p></p><p>Plus, there's a side quest in the system about leaving Haide Town, so I can earn some extra points too."</p><p></p><p>He liked to pretend to rest from time to time, then enter the mall to search for suitable things to protect his life. After browsing, he chose the "Blood Vigor" cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>According to the description, cultivating Blood Vigor doesn't require special talents, and once cultivated, one can be considered a powerful martial artist, able to protect oneself.</p><p></p><p>He had considered redeeming a gun for self-defense, but didn't know how many eyes were watching around, if someone found out it would be over.</p><p></p><p>"Two days later, I'll go to the entrance to the Heroic World, the Heaven's Prairie. It's a melting pot of all kinds, there are bound to be plenty of quests for me to quickly earn points and redeem corresponding survival skills. Most importantly, it's a merchant's paradise there. As long as I'm careful, there won't be too much danger. If I'm lucky, I might even get a Soul Fruit..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Luo Yanfeng reined in his thoughts and focused on acting, soon blending into the crowd and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, many dimensional travelers also had the idea of leaving Haide Town.</p><p></p><p>As for where to go, everyone had different thoughts. Some wanted to find a sparsely populated place to hide for a while, some wanted to head to big cities and rely on the powerful for protection, while others set their sights on the Heroic World, hoping to take a chance and obtain the precious Soul Fruit, which could turn one's fortunes around overnight.</p><p></p><p>......</p>

        <h1>Chapter 617</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After relaxing for a few days, Su Hao couldn't sit idle again and began making plans for what to do next.</p><p></p><p>As usual, his consciousness entered the pinball space, sitting at the familiar desk with a steel pen in hand, writing down his future plans in a notebook:</p><p></p><p>"Since this world can naturally produce 'sources', it also means that for me to obtain sources, I don't necessarily need to use spiritual power to construct an elliptical system. I can completely utilize natural forces to help me achieve my goals.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the idea behind 'formation arrays'? It can definitely be realized.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, continue to specialize in studying the laws of transforming sources into specific materials, mastering the method of source creation!</p><p></p><p>As long as I thoroughly grasp sources, then I will become the creator in myths and legends! Although just an imposter, for me it is truly a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Even...by researching to the deepest level, I may even be able to directly create an eternal body from sources! In that case, the eternal life I pursue will no longer be a extravagant wish.</p><p></p><p>Third, find a way to destroy a planet with one punch. I have a premonition that the coming disaster, whether in a hundred years or three hundred years, will still arrive.</p><p></p><p>But this time, I will definitely not be helpless against it!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps its answer is as simple as the elliptical system..."</p><p></p><p>When he got to this point, Su Hao's pen paused, his mind struck by a beam of light that illuminated the entire world.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly stood up, eyes widening in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...could the so-called ever-present disaster be caused by the effects of the elliptical system?"</p><p></p><p>The more Su Hao thought about it, the more likely this possibility seemed.</p><p></p><p>If he treated the surrounding star domain as a sphere, then at the moment Su Hao was reborn and descended, he became the center of the sphere. As an outsider, his activities would cause disturbances and fluctuations in the surrounding cosmic energy. This fluctuation would spread outward, reflect off the sphere's surface, and converge back on him...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the dispersed energy would become more concentrated, and the impact he received would grow stronger, manifesting as increasingly terrifying disasters.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the more intensely he acted, the stronger the energy fluctuations he caused, and the stronger the rebound impact would be.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao silently recalled the events that had occurred along the way, and found them highly consistent with this viewpoint.</p><p></p><p>Although it may not be entirely accurate, and he didn't know exactly what this 'spherical system' centered on him was, this was likely the general situation.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes gradually showed excitement: "So that means, as long as I find the 'system' that takes me as the focus or center, I can destroy it and dissolve this inexplicable disaster. Not only that, perhaps I can even master this miraculous power and gain the ability to inflict 'misfortune' on others, becoming the 'God of Misfortune'!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it this way, it really did feel impactful.</p><p></p><p>Casually laying a 'spherical system' on someone, making the enemy the center of the sphere - as long as they couldn't understand this operating mechanism, no matter where they ran, they couldn't escape the impact of 'misfortune' until they were defeated by it!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it just like the reason Feng Cheng adamantly refused to seal his 'ability'? Whether to use it or not is one thing, but having it or not is another.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes and re-entered the pinball space. After erasing the third point, he decided to rename the 'elliptical system' to the 'focal system', and continued writing his plans:</p><p></p><p>"Third, confirm whether the disaster targeting me is indeed the 'focal system', then find it and master it.</p><p></p><p>If not in a hundred years, then a thousand years. If not in one lifetime, then ten lifetimes. One day I will eventually uncover its secrets.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, study the spiritual power system of this world, including the source abilities of various systems, as well as all kinds of source artifacts. Try to enhance my current spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>A 20,000 mile spiritual perception range seems immensely vast, but I can clearly feel it is not enough now.</p><p></p><p>If my spiritual perception could encompass an entire planet, then perhaps I wouldn't need so much time to uncover the mysteries of sources.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since the universe is so vast, and I have decided to explore it, having spiritual perception that can sweep across an entire galaxy...cough! Got sidetracked! Such an ability can only be imagined for now.</p><p></p><p>Fifth, pick up 'cultivation' again and continue the research task left unfinished from my previous life. At the very least, investigate the realms above the 'Immortal Realm'.</p><p></p><p>I have a premonition that the path of cultivation has even greater potential than this, perhaps with an even longer road ahead.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivation places extremely high demands on spiritual power. Finding the path beyond the Immortal Realm essentially means finding a way to increase spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Sixth, transform the small world base into a spaceship..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao listed many more, all projects he needed to complete in the future.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully carry out his plans one by one, it was imaginable what level Su Hao's abilities would reach.</p><p></p><p>A 'God' walking among the cosmos?</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand and clenched his fist, feeling the powerful strength in his body.</p><p></p><p>All of these powers were accumulated through his experiences in various worlds and diligent study.</p><p></p><p>He believed that in the future, he would definitely encounter other worlds as well, learn their unique knowledge, enrich his cognition, and build an even more powerful system of abilities.</p><p></p><p>The universe was so vast, there were bound to be all kinds of strange and bizarre knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Even something as special as 'sources', he had happened to encounter by chance. So what was impossible in the future?</p><p></p><p>Anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>Whether by chance or inevitability.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two years later, when Su Hao was twenty-six years old.</p><p></p><p>A short-haired youth in white appeared on a plain - it was Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Compared to two years ago, he seemed completely unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao squinted as he observed the surroundings, muttering, "This place will do!"</p><p></p><p>After two years of research, Su Hao had mastered the method of altering the surrounding energy flow to construct a 'focal system' and obtain source pearls, no longer relying on spiritual power to build the elliptical system.</p><p></p><p>Now, to obtain source pearls, he no longer needed to construct a 'focal system' using spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could sense the flow of energy around him, then arrange objects to change the energy flow pattern, and use a bit of blood essence to activate the manually constructed 'focal system', he could obtain a small amount of source pearls.</p><p></p><p>It looked similar to a feng shui master arranging a formation array...</p><p></p><p>But the principles were vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Today he had come to this place, treating himself as an elite martial artist who had just succeeded in reincarnating, to try obtaining source pearls!</p><p></p><p>If successful, it meant that in his next life, his starting point would be higher than any other world, making it difficult to die even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first circled around, carefully sensing the flow of energy in this area, frowning, "This deviation is quite large, completing the construction of the 'focal system' won't be easy."</p><p></p><p>Then he thought, "In my next reincarnation, I don't know what the situation will be, and may not have such good energy conditions as now. If I can successfully construct the 'focal system' now, it will provide more assurance for the future."</p><p></p><p>There was nothing to hesitate about, just do it!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out his hand and a diamond-tipped hoe appeared. He tried it out and it felt quite handy.</p><p></p><p>He came to a partially exposed rock and swung the hoe vigorously, "First step, collect rocks and use them to build a stone wall to divert the energy flow path."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Su Hao threw down the hoe and cursed, "Damn! This hoe is too hard to use, how long would it take to dig like this? I'll do this kind of work in my next life! Since I have spiritual power now, why not use it?"</p><p></p><p>Then he released his magic and pointed down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Dirt flew as the huge rock was also blasted out, lying quietly to the side.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was very satisfied with his labor results. He kept pointing, one rock after another being dug out from underground and piled together.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 899</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and twenty years passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Through the combined efforts of the three, they finally completed the production and deployment of the wave monitoring device.</p><p></p><p>This device adopted the quantum communication technology learned in the previous life. The information collected by the device would be transmitted back in real-time, allowing Su Hao to receive and analyze it instantly.</p><p></p><p>In other words, through this device, Su Hao could analyze the entire wave pattern of the Xiang Hu system, though limited to the stellar map within the system.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, this was already a major breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>After testing, Su Hao found the device was operating excellently.</p><p></p><p>"Just waiting for the wave to become powerful enough to pervade the entire Xiang Hu system. For now, observing the waves of just the two siblings, they are still very weak, only able to observe the wave pattern in a small range, unable to probe further outwards."</p><p></p><p>Then an idea popped into Su Hao's mind: "Should I let Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's main bodies go out and wander around?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he decided against it. He didn't lack that bit of time, and Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were still very important to his current work. If they accidentally got into trouble, disrupting the consciousness information within the billiard space, there would be no way to undo the regret.</p><p></p><p>He never believed that consciousness information would be absolutely safe just by staying in the billiard space. There were too many strange things in the universe.</p><p></p><p>To this day, Su Hao still couldn't forget the shocking feeling of seeing a person turn into a pig in the source world.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful one feels, the universe can humble them in an instant. It's better to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao was observing the data transmitted back from the wave monitoring device, Xiao Guang sent a reminder that the wave's influence on the two siblings was about to reach another peak, a 'negative state' this time, meaning the two siblings might encounter misfortune.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao instantly transmitted himself to the Crossroads Star, his divine sense enveloping the entire planet, immediately locating the two siblings' position. He then flashed into the sky above them, observing intently.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't watching how the two siblings would encounter misfortune, but rather the micro-worlds in motion around them.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao still couldn't instantly discern the differences, he could perceive and record them into the billiard space, then have Xiao Guang calculate and analyze the subtle differences later.</p><p></p><p>More of such data would be better.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the eighteen deities were also intently watching the performance of the two world wills. The deities didn't seem nervous, but were visibly excited.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - what the two siblings were about to face was the universally acknowledged strongest dragon of the Crossroads Star world - the Crimson Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Over the past twenty-odd years, the two siblings had overcome numerous difficulties, step-by-step advancing forward. After thorough preparation, they finally stood before the Crimson Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>For the eighteen deities, this was such an exciting moment.</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity - Red Light was trembling slightly: "Finally...the humiliation my avatar suffered will finally be avenged. The two world wills must prevail. Go on, defeat the evil Crimson Demon Lord, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>As if he couldn't wait to personally charge in and finish off the Demon Lord himself.</p><p></p><p>The other deities maintained a very optimistic attitude: "That Crimson Demon Lord is powerful, no doubt, but it is definitely not a match for the two world wills. The two world wills have already reached the pinnacle of this world, invincible. Even our strongest avatars may not be a match for the two world wills anymore."</p><p></p><p>"As long as they defeat the Crimson Demon Lord, don't we complete our final duty of guarding the world wills? Since the strongest Crimson Demon Lord can no longer threaten them, they are truly invincible in this world, having grown up completely."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we will soon gain our freedom. Go for it, world wills, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the deities were unaware of the saying "Invincible under the heavens, but threatened from above the heavens."</p><p></p><p>They still appeared rather optimistic.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the deities didn't know that the Crimson Demon Lord was designated by Su Hao, and they had never even witnessed the Demon Lord's full power.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, the two siblings arrived before the Crimson Demon Lord's castle.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's castle was enormously huge, looking like a massive mountain peak. Scattered lights shone from numerous cave openings, those dim openings like gaping, bloodthirsty maws - those who entered would never come out again.</p><p></p><p>The cold night wind howled past, blowing over the castle with a low "woo woo" sound.</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei gulped hard: "Sis, this castle looks so ominous. Isn't the Crimson Demon Lord scared living in a place like this?"</p><p></p><p>Zong Shuling said: "Why else would it be called the Crimson Demon Lord? As the strongest and most evil Demon Lord in the world, living in a place like this is most fitting. Now, my blood is already boiling with excitement. Tonight, we will thoroughly eliminate this evil Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei slowly drew a long sword emitting a golden glow: "Same here! My sword thirsts for the Demon Lord's blood."</p><p></p><p>As their strength grew and the opponents became stronger, the two siblings gradually stopped using 'hot weapons', unless dealing with some small fry that needed clearing. They used long swords more often.</p><p></p><p>Although hot weapons were powerful, most of the time they couldn't accurately hit enemies. Apart from making noise, they had little use, and were also expensive.</p><p></p><p>Throwing bombs was just throwing away points, very wasteful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they saw a huge figure flash out from the castle, floating quietly before them in the air above. Its wings spread out, almost blocking the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>With glowing red eyes staring at them, mouth slightly curled up, two rows of ferocious fangs bared open, a thunderous roar came from its throat: "You - thirst for this Demon Lord's fresh blood?"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous chill assaulted them. The siblings' pupils shrank abruptly, their body hair standing on end, hearts shaken to the core: "So fast, so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the nearly 100-meter long dragon floating in the sky not far away, the siblings' hearts pounded heavily, muscles tensed, spiritual power brimming in preparation.</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined that a nearly 100-meter long dragon could possess such incredible speed, flashing out from the castle to appear before them in the blink of an eye, with such a weightless demeanor.</p><p></p><p>When they had previously heard of the Crimson Demon Lord's name, they thought it was just a slightly more powerful Red Gold Dragon. Only when truly facing this dragon did they realize just how formidable this Demon Lord was.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person would faint just from the sheer size. One should know that even a larger adult Black Lightning Dragon was only around 35 meters long. They couldn't fathom how a theoretically smaller Red Gold Dragon could grow to such proportions.</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei glanced at the long sword in his hand, then at the Crimson Demon Lord. Suddenly, this incredibly powerful sacred sword he had exchanged from the mall felt like just a glowing toothpick.</p><p></p><p>Their confidence instantly wavered.</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei said softly: "Sis, we may have been rash. Shall we retreat first?"</p><p></p><p>Zong Shuling frowned: "We'll know after fighting. Who knows, it could just be a paper tiger, one poke and it's done."</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei nodded upon hearing this: "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two tiny figures before him muttering, completely ignoring his question, the Crimson Demon Lord's tone turned cold, voice like thundering: "So you are the renowned 'Heroic Duo'! Kahaha!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Crimson Demon Lord suddenly opened its mouth and let out a ferocious roar towards the two siblings: "Roar--"</p><p></p><p>The raging sound waves burst forth in layers from its throat, sweeping towards the siblings. Even before reaching them, the solid ground instantly shattered into dust from the shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>The siblings' expressions changed drastically as they instinctively used powerful defensive skills.</p><p></p><p>Two beams of golden light enveloped the two.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The sound waves slammed into them like a massive hammer blow, their figures thrown backwards uncontrollably, tumbling several times before finally regaining balance.</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei pointed his fingers forward, his sacred sword transforming into a streak of light shooting towards the Crimson Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord glanced at the golden light and casually swatted it away.</p><p></p><p>"Ding--"</p><p></p><p>The golden light curved back, quickly dissipating and reverting to its sword form.</p><p></p><p>Zong Renfei was dumbstruck: "My attack, just deflected like that?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zong Shuling's piercing attack was also ready. With her left and right thumbs pressed together, index fingers forming a diamond shape, a dazzling thick golden beam erupted from the center towards the Crimson Demon Lord, instantly reaching it.</p><p></p><p>The 'Gilded Destruction Sword'!</p><p></p><p>"Hum--"</p><p>The brilliance momentarily engulfed the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>When the light receded, the Crimson Demon Lord's hearty laughter resounded: "You two do seem to have some ability, kahaha! But still far from enough!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, its massive body suddenly flashed and vanished from its original spot. When it reappeared, it was right before the two siblings.</p><p></p><p>"Bam!"</p><p>"Bam!"</p><p></p><p>After two dull impacts, the siblings were sent flying away like cannonballs.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Crimson Demon Lord was gloating, it saw two streaks of light curving irregularly from afar, shooting rapidly towards it. It let out a booming laugh: "Hope you Heroic Duo can entertain me tonight!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Watching from the sidelines, the deities were all dumbstruck: "How could this be..."</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined the Crimson Demon Lord could be so tremendously powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Heavenly Repose Nati, also a Red Gold Dragon, widened his eyes: "What did this gold dragon eat to grow so huge?"</p><p></p><p>Thank you for the bonus from "I'm not reading a novel, just gazing into your gentle eyes."

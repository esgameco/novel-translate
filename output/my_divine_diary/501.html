        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There is no way to undo what has been done, just do what you can do.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao is a relatively rational person, know that the current say more useless, think of ways to solve the problem is true.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how to calculate, the conclusion reached was that twenty years later the giant planet would hit the Xiu Xian star, and the Xiu Xian civilization would be extinct.</p><p></p><p>Now in front of Su Hao, there are two paths, one is to do everything possible to block the giant asteroid to hit the planet, even if you put your life on the line; one is to take Yashan, as well as some of the close people, take the still unfinished Feiyue cosmic spacecraft, flee from the cultivation star, begin to roam rootless in the universe, adhere to dozens of hundreds of years, waiting for the energy supplies to be depleted and die out.</p><p></p><p>"There are still twenty years left, not short!" Su Hao calculated in his heart, and with the remaining time, he would be able to do a lot of things.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in time, there wasn't much to choose from, he wouldn't run away by staying for that extra hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The world crisis that he himself had caused could not be undone, but there should always be some responsibility.</p><p></p><p>The emotion inside is a little lighter, it does not mean that his bottom line is gone.</p><p></p><p>The big deal was that he would die, and after countless years, he would be a good man again.</p><p></p><p>As long as he continued to live, one day, he would be able to crush all the crisis disasters that had been directed against him, all of them.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still Su Hao ah, no matter what, I can't lose face."</p><p></p><p>It was said that it was better to die than to live, and he agreed with this saying, but when he was truly faced with this kind of choice, the pride in his heart wouldn't allow him to live this hundred years of life on the sly ah!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly laughed at himself and said, "If I can still live for a few thousand or tens of thousands of years it's more or less the same, if that's really the case, then I must run away in ashes ......"</p><p></p><p>However, the technology does not allow, artificial ecology, is not so simple to realize, also can not adhere to too long, it is difficult for human beings to get out of the ecological survival alone.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao made a decision in his mind, he no longer hesitated and acted quickly, organizing people all over the world to resist the disaster according to the plan that had been formulated.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial part of the plan was to successfully build a 'coordinate positioning transmission' on the Feiyue.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's plan was to teleport the Feiyue, a two hundred kilometer asteroid, on top of the giant asteroid's flight orbit, and make it deviate from the established orbit through impact.</p><p></p><p>This plan had a certain degree of implementability, but the difficulty lay in the Feiyue's teleportation, and Su Hao's current spiritual power did not have the ability to teleport an asteroid.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps adding Yashan's spiritual power will be enough, I also need to develop a two-person collaborative teleportation technique ......"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately found Yashan and said, "Yashan, get ready for this world journey, maybe it will be over in twenty years."</p><p></p><p>Yashan silently nodded his head, and in his heart, he was also prepared, no matter what, the mountain of daggers and the sea of fire, following the footsteps of Boss Wei is.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "But it's not without a chance, destroying this giant asteroid we can't do, but just deflecting it a little is enough. I plan to beam the Feiyue directly onto the giant asteroid's flight path, and use the Feiyue's own kinetic energy to form an impact and try to deflect the orbit.</p><p></p><p>But teleporting the Leap will require your assistance to work with me to accomplish it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Understood, Boss Vi. As long as there's still a glimmer of hope, we can't give up so easily!"</p><p></p><p>The transformation of this world also had Yashan's share, and he cared inwardly, infinitely looking forward to what this world would develop into a thousand or two thousand years later, not wanting to be destroyed just like this somehow.</p><p></p><p>If it was possible to save it, even if he spelled out his life, he also wanted to try.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, ''We don't need to continue to stay on the Flying Leap, let's go back to the Cultivation Star! Only if we are both under the eyes of the people will all of us coalesce and work together to resist this crisis."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought deeply, the two of them were on the Feiyue ship, the crowd was watching, on the surface, they didn't dare to say anything, but inwardly, they were bound to spit on them for being the first to run in front of the crisis.</p><p></p><p>In this way, rallying people to resist the crisis together was nothing more than a joke, no one would take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Yashan cleaned up a bit, turned to teleport back to the Star Group headquarters, held a meeting of representatives of all levels, live broadcast all over the world, conveyed the determination to fight the crisis together, and arranged for various tasks.</p><p></p><p>And then Su Hao alone studied how to teleport the Flying Leap in concert with Yashan.</p><p></p><p>Five years later.</p><p></p><p>A towering peak, the bottom of which was hollowed out and turned into an artificial platform, as if a mountain was placed on top of the platform.</p><p></p><p>The entire peak including the interior was remodeled.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the interior. Su Hao and Yashan entered the inner cabin of a large machine and lay down separately.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent a message to Yashan through his assistant, "I'll lock the coordinates of this coordinated 'coordinate positioning teleportation', listen to my instructions for everything, you just need to act according to the tips on the assistant. This time is just a practice, don't need to have too much pressure ......"</p><p></p><p>After affirming the precautions once more, he said, "Are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan returned, "Ready Boss Vi, you can start anytime."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, adjusted his state, closed his eyes, and a large amount of spiritual energy surged out from his body, activating this 'perception increaser' with his own synchronized spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Su Hao locked onto a certain location in space, right on top of the giant asteroid's future orbit.</p><p></p><p>"First step, run the 'space wave' at maximum power to generate a massive amount of bi-living space modules, spiritual power labeled ......"</p><p></p><p>Teleporting a mountain peak required a very large amount of spatial modules, and at the same time, the requirement for Su Hao's mental power became extremely high, if not for the fact that he had already cultivated to the 'divine body realm' now, and was able to support the operation of multi-threaded thinking, he wouldn't necessarily have been able to do it to this extent.</p><p></p><p>Three hours later, the generation of spatial module marking was completed, Su Hao eased his somewhat pressurized mental power, and after a moment, he sent a message to Yashan, "Yashan, did you sense the spatial module I marked?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied back, "Can sense it!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao breathed a sigh of relief, as long as he could sense it, Yashan would be able to collaborate in the teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "Step two, locate and deliver the negative space module ......"</p><p></p><p>A few moments later, Su Hao estimated that the delivery had been successful, "Estimated delivery success, after ten minutes, I will start prying open the space module and open up the channel, Yashan, you listen to my instructions and follow the channel I opened up, and solidify it down."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Roger, standing by."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao began to extend a sea of spiritual tentacles, densely extending outwards, crawling all the surrounding nascent spatial modules, until Su Hao felt the extreme pressure.</p><p></p><p>Adding force to the rhythm!</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the surrounding space modules rhythms, and Su Hao opened the space channel, he immediately sent a message, "Yashan, now, stabilize this state."</p><p></p><p>In just one breath's time, a large number of Yashan's spiritual tentacles immediately surged along the channel he had opened, and at the same time took over Su Hao's rhythms on the spatial modules.</p><p></p><p>However, just such a channel would not be able to allow this mountain to pass through, it was still waiting to continue expanding the channel.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately withdrew, and his huge spiritual force continued to probe towards the outer spatial module.</p><p></p><p>His strategy was very simple, using his spiritual power that was many times stronger than Yashan's to pry open a smaller passageway, while Yashan's role was to, maintain the passageway that Su Hao pried open in a solid manner, Su Hao would then free up his spiritual power, and on top of that, he would continue to expand the passageway outwards, Yashan would then fix it, and so on, until a passageway that could accommodate a mountain peak was opened up.</p><p></p><p>This was what Su Hao had thought of, a way to still transmit a huge volume of matter despite not having enough spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The principle seemed simple, but it wasn't easy to operate, and there was no room for error in the process, which was why he and Yashan practiced with this mountain peak first.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Su Hao finally accomplished his goal when he felt his spiritual power begin to weaken, he said, ''Done, next step, cast! Yashan, combined pull!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's spirit was invigorated, and his huge spiritual power hooked up the mountain and himself, making a strong pull.</p><p></p><p>'Teleportation'!</p><p></p><p>This place was two years later, the trajectory of the giant asteroid's orbit.</p><p></p><p>"Success!" Su Hao's spirit completely loosened up.</p><p></p><p>And then asked, "Yashan, are you okay?"</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Yayama replied with his assistant, "......! It's okay!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 716</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Su Hao injected Yonghua with a modification serum, not only evolving her into a "Prophet Human", but also casually adding cultivating abilities.</p><p></p><p>Since she planned to learn from Yashan, she might as well cultivate along the way. Not only would she gain some self-defense abilities, but it might also be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Moreover, let me test whether a native human would be 'wave-locked' after cultivating."</p><p></p><p>He guessed it was highly unlikely, but before trying, Su Hao could not be 100% certain.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, Yonghua did not notice any difference and kept feeling around her head for wounds.</p><p></p><p>Modifying the brain...doesn't that require opening a hole in the skull with a saw, and then using all kinds of high-precision machinery to modify it?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "What hole? It's already been modified. You'll probably feel the difference after adapting for a few days. Alright, go back!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua left in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually sent a message in the group: "Feng Cheng, train Yonghua in cultivation when you have time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Got it, Master Su!"</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao pulled up the data on the spaceships that Yashan and the others had disassembled recently and studied it carefully.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, he fully grasped the Eight-Armed Race's starship construction technology and gained a general understanding of their technology.</p><p></p><p>Although the Eight-Armed Race's forces were almost ubiquitous throughout the Cloud Ring System, their technology was essentially not very advanced, almost all within Su Hao's comprehension, not reaching the so-called "dimensional strike" level.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's home planet was located near the inner ring of the Cloud Ring System. In this location, it was very easy for them to obtain energy blocks, which was the reason they developed first.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Eight-Armed Race developed to this extent by relying on the nearly endless energy blocks in the Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>Everything they had was built upon energy blocks. If the Eight-Armed Race had not discovered energy blocks, Su Hao estimated that when he woke up in this world, he still would not have been able to explore much farther beyond the Blue Light, just like before.</p><p></p><p>After reading it all, Su Hao sighed: "The development of technology is so difficult! It's not something that can be achieved just by having time...From the time I was born until now, I don't know how many billions of years have passed, but this universe remains so silent.</p><p></p><p>It seems no intelligent civilization has been able to break through certain limits to explore the entire universe."</p><p></p><p>After going through Yashan's materials, Su Hao decided that when he had time in the future, he would visit the Eight-Armed Race's home planet and perhaps gain some interesting technology there.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he closed the technical data on spaceships and pulled up the data on quantum communication devices.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll master quantum communication technology, and then study the Mother Bug's control system!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao remained in the small world, calmly studying and researching.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the adaptation period, Yonghua noticed her differences.</p><p></p><p>The world she saw became much vaster!</p><p></p><p>Before, she looked at things one by one, but now with just a glance, she could map the entire scene within her view into her mind. Even with her eyes closed, the scanned scene was still vividly present, and she could identify the placement of every single object.</p><p></p><p>Not only could she perceive things faster, but her comprehension ability had also skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>Knowledge she couldn't understand before, she could now quickly grasp the steps and principles, even instantly associating it with other relevant examples to aid understanding and memory.</p><p></p><p>Her memory, comprehension, and associative abilities had all exploded.</p><p></p><p>This was previously unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>So this was the world geniuses saw - without reaching this level, one could never understand the difference between people...</p><p></p><p>She touched her head in disbelief: "I...I've become smarter? Uncle really modified my brain! And..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed she had also gained "superpowers"!</p><p></p><p>She wanted to ask Su Hao, but couldn't find him, so she found Yashan, but couldn't find him either...</p><p></p><p>Finally, she found Feng Cheng and explained her changes and doubts.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily: "Let me just say, this is only the beginning. A few months later, you'll become even more powerful. In a hundred years, you'll reach levels you can't even imagine now. Aren't you looking forward to it?"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua's eyes twinkled with admiration: "So awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said proudly: "Of course, but look at who your Uncle Su is! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked, "Want to become even more powerful? If so, come learn from me for an hour every day!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua: "Of course! Thank you, Brother Feng Cheng!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't thank me, thank your uncle! If he didn't say so, I wouldn't teach you."</p><p></p><p>"Got it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by as everyone studied and researched.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two years passed. Su Hao received the custom "Particle Control Center" he ordered a year early.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he got it, he started quantum entanglement experiments, which were key to quantum communication devices.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao's goal was not to obtain communication devices, but rather to learn the technology within them and then use that technology to perfect his own abilities for learning more knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Through years of incessant knowledge absorption, he found that knowledge was not like simply stacking blocks, but rather a process of mutual integration, verification, and interconnection.</p><p></p><p>The more he learned, the more he could feel the joy of learning.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why Yashan, who originally disliked studying, gradually transformed into a research maniac.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't there a saying? The more you learn, the more you realize your own ignorance, and the more you want to know.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as long as the hardware could support it. Of course, if the hardware couldn't keep up, the opposite would be true...</p><p></p><p>After this period of study and research on quantum entanglement theory, Su Hao also had a general understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>Simply put: when two very similar quantum particles are close enough, they will become entangled, synchronizing the two particles so that no matter how far apart they are separated, their states will remain consistent.</p><p></p><p>Extremely mysterious!</p><p></p><p>Of course, quantum particles also had properties like "indivisibility" and "non-clonability", which was another reason Su Hao paid attention to them.</p><p></p><p>He could think of so many abilities that could be realized using quantum technology!</p><p></p><p>"However, it looks simple, but developing controllable abilities from it is very difficult!"</p><p></p><p>The more he studied, the more he felt the mysteriousness of the microscopic world. Likewise, turning microscopic phenomena into macroscopic abilities was extremely difficult!</p><p></p><p>Humans had already developed mature quantum communication devices, but manufacturing them was extremely difficult with very low output.</p><p></p><p>Only deep-space exploratory spaceships would be equipped with one; other communication devices mostly still used wireless communications...</p><p></p><p>This showed the level of difficulty involved.</p><p></p><p>Even now, after Su Hao had thoroughly mastered these quantum communication technologies, he still couldn't figure out how to achieve long-range communication using spiritual or spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"How can a biological body achieve long-range quantum communication? Perhaps the paired bug eggs produced by the Mother Bug could resolve my doubts."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to study how the Mother Bug cultivates paired bug eggs of the same frequency!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Su Hao tidied up his belongings and left the lab, sending a message in the group: "Yashan, what's the progress on your research into the Mother Bug's nervous system?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied: "Master Su, we've made some discoveries regarding the special structure of the Mother Bug's brain and the bridging technology of its nervous system. However, we still have too few samples to gain more insights."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Master Su, I'm currently roaming the Star Devourer Bug domain, searching for Star Devourer planets to capture Mother Bugs for Master Yashan...Ahem! I'm not very skilled with Starbeam Travel yet and often overshoot, so it's taking some time..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was still very satisfied with Yashan's progress, so he messaged: "Organize the relevant data and upload it. I want to take a look first."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Master Su, one moment!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 665</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's consciousness gradually faded away. In a fleeting moment, he regained his ability to think.</p><p></p><p>A faint light penetrated his eyelids and entered his eyes, gradually illuminating his conscious world.</p><p></p><p>A warm flow also converged upon his consciousness from all directions, causing it to become increasingly active.</p><p></p><p>His vision and sense of touch recovered first, followed by his hearing - heavy panting sounds entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>The world around him also came alive.</p><p></p><p>Within just a few seconds, Su Hao realized what had happened: "I, Su Hao, have been reincarnated again!"</p><p></p><p>He did not move rashly, but maintained his original posture, gradually receiving the information from his previous incarnation's body and residual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He did not hastily open his eyes, but kept them slightly closed, silently analyzing the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"Sitting upright on a hard bench, back against the wall, feeling a slight vibration from under my buttocks and back, like a faint engine vibration, though barely perceptible.</p><p></p><p>My body feels strong and powerful, much stronger than an ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>Wearing heavy armor and a helmet, tightly wrapped yet exceptionally fitted, not cumbersome at all but giving a full sense of security!</p><p></p><p>My right hand is firmly gripping a rod-shaped device, resting against my right chest, like a weapon. Combined with the heavy panting sounds around me..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but slightly open his eyes to observe the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>This was an all-metal sci-fi looking room. On the two rows of long benches to the left and right sat individuals in full green-gold metal armor suits, their right hands uniformly gripping strange-looking rifles.</p><p></p><p>A quick glance revealed about twenty people in total.</p><p></p><p>The heavy panting sounds came from under the armored helmets, sounding very tense.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>They were soldiers preparing to carry out a war mission!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's first reaction was: "Finally, after so long, I sense the presence of 'others' again. It's wonderful! The feeling of guarding the starry sky alone was utterly miserable."</p><p></p><p>Having company is infinitely better than being alone!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from this high-tech multi-functional armor suit and the strange-looking rifle, which seemed formidable, the intensity of this war must be considerable.</p><p></p><p>Engaging in war now means extreme danger - he could very well perish in this battle.</p><p></p><p>As an ordinary soldier participating in the war, his situation would essentially be no different from the other soldiers. If they get shot, they die; if he gets shot, he dies too.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Su Hao's thoughts raced: "In this situation, there's no way to escape! If I desert, I'll probably just get shot dead! Should I take out all these soldiers first, then run away? Twenty people, not impossible..."</p><p></p><p>"No, nevermind, the situation is unclear. Just when I think I have the upper hand, what if these seeming comrades suddenly transform into superhumans and take me out? That would be a huge loss!</p><p></p><p>I'll just observe for now. Even if executing this war mission, it's not necessarily a death sentence. As long as there's a glimmer of hope, I'll surely seize it."</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, it might have been more practical for him to reincarnate as a four or five-year-old child instead.</p><p></p><p>At least then he wouldn't have to face such a perilous war mission right after awakening.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly regained his usual calm thinking.</p><p></p><p>He immediately issued orders to Little Light: "Little Light!"</p><p></p><p>Little Light responded right away: "Welcome back, respected Mr. Su Hao. Little Light awaits your instructions."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gave Little Light a series of commands: "Differentiate the source world's final consciousness from the current one. Separate consciousness fragments. Add decoding task for consciousness fragment information. Unlock the 'language' reference table at maximum speed."</p><p></p><p>"Consciousness differentiation task established. Consciousness fragment information decoding task established."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Scan the current body and report basic data."</p><p></p><p>"One moment...</p><p></p><p>Species: Humanoid</p><p>Gender: Male  </p><p>Height: 186cm</p><p>Body data as follows:</p><p>...</p><p>Overall Assessment: Powerful, Ordinary Martial Practitioner"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao inwardly marveled: "Only in his teens yet already a soldier going to war? What kind of messed up social structure and system is this? And this body's physicality is unexpectedly strong."</p><p></p><p>He continued giving orders: "Organize the log board information."</p><p></p><p>"Log updated."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes again, his consciousness entering the Ping Pong Dimension. The first thing he checked was the time display above the log board.</p><p></p><p>"Over 800 million years have passed...800 million years, far too long!"</p><p></p><p>Just the 500 years he spent alone on the Source Planet felt like an extremely long time to him.</p><p></p><p>"If I had lived alone on the Source Planet for 800 million years until now, what would I have become? Would I have evolved into an even more powerful cosmic life form...?"</p><p></p><p>Dismissing such impractical thoughts, he instead checked to ensure no recorded information was missing.</p><p></p><p>Reassuringly, all the information he had archived remained intact.</p><p></p><p>When checking the star maps, he found that after just five years, the star map comparisons failed! This meant that his current location was at an unimaginable distance from the Source Planet.</p><p></p><p>A failed star map comparison indicates that based on the newly received star map information, the system could not find any matches with the known star maps to determine the current position.</p><p></p><p>The inability to match so quickly implies that the Ping Pong Dimension's mode of movement through the universe is not by conventional spatial translocation, and even more mystical than the 'spatial transfer technology' he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Su Hao accessed the Black Room, confirming that Ah Shan and Feng Cheng's consciousness information remained unchanged, just as when they fell into dormancy.</p><p></p><p>After verifying that there were no anomalies, he finally felt completely reassured.</p><p></p><p>The heavens are vast, but his Ping Pong Dimension is the vastest!</p><p></p><p>And the 'Catastrophe System', you just wait! After killing me so many times, I won't be satisfied until I've thoroughly mastered you and gotten my revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Then he silently declared to this new world: "New world, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was now so confident, so...arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao checked his physical condition once more in the Ping Pong Dimension and was pleased to find it even better than expected. He nodded with satisfaction: "Not a bad body. In the likely upcoming war mission, this gives me an extra advantage for survival."</p><p></p><p>Conservatively estimated, this body possessed the strength of an advanced ordinary martial practitioner. With his vast combat experience, he could already do a lot.</p><p></p><p>The martial techniques he had mastered were no mere display.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exited the Ping Pong Dimension, thinking: "The current task is to preserve my life, then find a quiet place to cultivate undisturbed until I reach the peak level. By then, I can simply take whatever I want - who would dare refuse?"</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what kind of situation this mission entails."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he really wanted to get up and inspect this high-tech multi-functional armor suit, as well as figure out how to use the strange-looking long rifle, since they were good life-preserving equipment.</p><p></p><p>But in the current circumstances, it was unwise to act privately.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood that in a military, one could not move about freely.</p><p></p><p>He regulated his breathing and entered a meditative state, attempting to circulate his inner energy.</p><p></p><p>Even a slight gain in inner energy would enhance his combat ability.</p><p></p><p>After sitting quietly for about two hours, the soldier sitting at the front who seemed to be the squad leader suddenly stood up and shouted something towards them: "@#!"</p><p></p><p>Given the language decoding was still incomplete and would take another six hours, Su Hao could not understand what was said.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter - he would just follow the others' reactions.</p><p></p><p>"Shaa!"</p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>All twenty soldiers, including Su Hao, stood up in unison, stomping their right feet on the ground with a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Su Hao keenly sensed that the aura of all the soldiers had changed - no longer tense and fearful, but brimming with hot-blooded vigor!</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were instantly filled with a violent force.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Hao's flesh involuntarily heated up slightly as a savagery surfaced within.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, striving to minimize the impact on his mind and remain calm. "Is it starting?" he thought.</p><p></p><p>This was the first hurdle he faced in this new world - he had to get through it successfully!</p><p></p><p>Only by surviving could he earn the right to explore this world and learn its knowledge!</p>

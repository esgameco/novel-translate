        <h1>Chapter 959</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Seven thousand years of time flashed by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A reincarnation squad of six people suddenly appeared in a dim private room of a tavern.</p><p></p><p>Though it was a tavern, this place was unusually quiet, without the usual clamor.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the six reincarnators appeared, they received a message issued by the Lord God:</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation squad adversarial mission;"</p><p>"Enemy reincarnation squad codename 'Sikong', 8/8 members;"</p><p>"The ancient Demon God King has grown old, while the newly rising Demon Prince Ravir has noticed the Demon God King's intrinsic weakness, and has decided to officially challenge the Demon God King for his throne today by leading troops;" </p><p>"Mission objective: assist Demon Prince Ravir in defeating the Demon God King;"</p><p>"Reward for completing the mission: five thousand points;"</p><p>"Penalty for failing the mission: deduct ten thousand points, if points are insufficient then automatically reclaim equipment to offset points, if still insufficient, annihilation;"</p><p>"Current identity: subordinates of Demon Prince Ravir's third echelon;"</p><p>"Safe zone opens in ten minutes, mission officially begins;"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The six reincarnators' expressions changed in unison, immediately gathering together to analyze the current situation.</p><p></p><p>A short-haired woman in black played with a small knife in her hand, her face grave as she said, "This is bad, I didn't expect this mission to actually be the highest difficulty adversarial reincarnation squad mission. The most difficult part is that this is an original world mission, not the movie worlds we're familiar with, so we have no knowledge of the plot progression or ultimate outcome."</p><p></p><p>A shaven-headed man frowned, seeming to rapidly flip through information, muttering, "Who knows about the 'Sikong' squad's situation? I've heard of their name before, but don't know much about them. I checked the information and there wasn't much displayed. But the fact that I've heard their name means they're not simple. You have to know, there are said to be thousands of reincarnation squads."</p><p></p><p>A thirteen or fourteen-year-old youth laughed lightly, "I know a bit about this squad. The latest information shows they have eight members. In terms of strength, they should be a notch above our 'Baiutu' squad. After all, we were assigned to the young and vigorous Demon Prince Ravir's camp, while they were assigned to the aging Demon God King's camp. Judging by the strength complementarity, we can determine the Lord God assessed our strength as slightly weaker."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a burly bald man laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The others all looked at him, waiting for the bald man to speak.</p><p></p><p>Because this bald man was precisely their squad's 'sage' - their squad's subsequent actions would largely follow his arrangements.</p><p></p><p>The bald man said, "Not necessarily. There's no rule that the aging Demon God King must be weaker. According to the information, the Demon God King was already the ruler of these lands ten thousand years ago. Over so many years, Ravir certainly wouldn't be the first to challenge the Demon God King.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Demon God King still firmly sits on his throne, never faltering. This indicates that his strength cannot possibly be the 'intrinsic weakness' described by the Lord God. Have you all forgotten the Lord God's habit of benevolent deception?</p><p></p><p>If we underestimate him due to his senescence, we will certainly face corresponding backlash. Our Baiutu squad may very well be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sikong squad, I'm not too worried, because I also have the latest information. From what I know, the Sikong squad suffered a major failure in their previous world's mission, with heavy losses. Arranging them as our opponents this time is likely the Lord God's punishment by throwing them into this world.</p><p></p><p>Their so-called eight members very possibly includes new additions."</p><p></p><p>The short-haired woman frowned, "So you're saying we still have the advantage? Then what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The bald man shook his head, "Quite the opposite, our predicament may not be as good as imagined, because our true opponent is not the Sikong squad, but the Demon God King. Our assessed strength is at most fifth-tier, but the Demon God King's assessed strength reaches the eighth-tier.</p><p></p><p>Haha, facing the Demon God King, our only outcome is annihilation. Perhaps we're just a bunch of bystanders, left to deal with Ravir's minor troops.</p><p></p><p>As for what to do, I lack enough information, there are still many things that need confirmation. We'll discuss again after meeting Prince Ravir. Rest assured, no major conflicts should erupt in the short term."</p><p></p><p>"Time is almost up, let's communicate via group chat."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the pale yellow protective barrier in the tavern dissipated. The burly bald man stood up, revealing a defiant grin as he flexed his muscles and headed out.</p><p></p><p>With that physique, anyone looking would immediately judge him to be the squad's meat shield charging recklessly to block damage, not an elder.</p><p></p><p>.....</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Demon God King, whose appearance remained youthful but emanated a decaying aura, looked down at the two humans dressed differently and smiled faintly, calmly saying, "You say you've received the latest news that a Demon Prince will come to attack this God King?"</p><p></p><p>The reincarnator below affirmed, "Absolutely no mistake, the opponent is prepared. Please make preparations, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King had indeed aged, and he had sensed that this body might not last much longer.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Seven thousand years now. The world passage unseals every hundred years, allowing progressively stronger beings to enter and exit, from previously only fifth-tier experts, to now even second-tier warriors freely coming and going. It's not hard to predict that before long, even first-tier grunts will be able to freely traverse the world passage.</p><p></p><p>And at that time, this entire infinite land will be interconnected and open. Not only will our Demon race be restless to expand outwards for more territory through war, but even my old classmates will face the same problem.</p><p></p><p>The racial wars we've suppressed for seven thousand years can no longer be contained...</p><p></p><p>The great world, the great world! Sigh...I don't know what direction the future will take. Will different races really have to fight to the death?</p><p></p><p>Forget it, I'm already old and lacking in strength. Let the Demons choose their own future path - whether to become the king of the great world, or face extinction, it no longer concerns me.</p><p></p><p>The eight thousand plus years I've dedicated to the Demon race is enough. And I can take this opportunity to retire and seek my own life's path. I too want to explore the distant cosmos like the disciples of the Infinite Gate!"</p><p></p><p>After such a long span of time, the Demon God King's mentality had changed greatly from his initial vigorous ambition to lead the Demon race's tenacious survival.</p><p></p><p>Time can change many things, including lofty aspirations.</p><p></p><p>But the one thing that never changed in the Demon God King's heart was his loathing for challengers: "These challengers keep coming to make trouble every few days, so annoying I'm sick of it. I can't understand why there are so many challengers - kill one batch and another comes. It's like they're purposely being sent to me."</p><p></p><p>However, the Demon God King would never go easy. He utterly loathed challengers and would never forget the humiliation of being tricked by them in the past.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find those original challengers, he'd vent his anger on the other challengers instead.</p><p></p><p>As long as challengers were sent before him, he would mercilessly kill every single one.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King looked at the two humans below and said mildly, "Ravir does have some strength. If I'm not careful, I may indeed risk being ambushed by him. I'll be cautious. Hmm...are there just the two of you? Where are your companions? Call them all out!"</p><p></p><p>The two reincarnators glanced at each other and replied, "Reporting to Your Majesty, there are only the two of us."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King nodded, "Oh, then go die!"</p><p></p><p>The two reincarnators' expressions changed as they were about to act, but they saw the Demon God King wave his hand, and the two instantly exploded into a shower of bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Specialized attendants immediately came to clean up the mess.</p><p></p><p>"Prompt: Your teammate Andochun has died."</p><p>"Prompt: Your teammate Chengfa has died."</p><p></p><p>The remaining six members of the Sikong squad hiding in the shadows showed looks of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"How did they suddenly die? How did they die?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the captain's caution was correct. If we had all gone to meet the Demon God King, we might have been annihilated."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Baiutu squad also received the notification that two opponents had died, and they too looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired woman said in the group chat, "This Sikong squad is really vicious, directly killing the disobedient newcomers."</p><p></p><p>The thirteen or fourteen-year-old youth said, "Very normal, there are many squads like this. If newcomers without conviction aren't killed, they may cause a lot of trouble later on."</p><p></p><p>The short-haired woman shook her head, "Regardless, I don't approve of directly killing newcomers who haven't adapted yet."</p>

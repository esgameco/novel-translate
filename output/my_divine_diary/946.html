        <h1>Chapter 946</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the heavenly realm within the Soul Power Network, the eighteen deities looked at Su Hao with excited expressions. The most impulsive ones seemed about to rush forward and hug Su Hao's legs.</p><p></p><p>They had been diligently working for hundreds of years, and the "First Primordial God" had been built to perfection by the eighteen of them. It could automatically produce trial products meeting the standards as long as travelers were input into it.</p><p></p><p>They had been waiting for Su Hao to appear and give them praise and affirmation. Of course, it would be even better if he could impart the secret techniques to them.</p><p></p><p>Now that Su Hao had suddenly appeared, they felt that winter was departing and spring had arrived. Their happiness was about to come.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the eighteen deities' wide, eager eyes, Su Hao could not bear to disappoint them further. He casually praised them: "Your Excellencies the deities have done very well, better than I imagined. Without your dedicated care over the years, the First Primordial God I created would have been riddled with flaws. In short, you have worked hard."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities immediately beamed, almost jumping for joy like children, but remembering their status, they forcibly restrained themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! What is Lord Lei An saying? This is what we should do."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it can't be called hard work. In fact, we have gained a lot from doing these things, such as great insights into building and operating the system. We take pleasure in it, hehe, pleasure in it."</p><p></p><p>"The celestial beings in heaven are very obedient and cooperative. They also expressed no need for a life of leisure, voluntarily participating to help us build the First Primordial God. Now they can perfectly operate the First Primordial God."</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Ever since the celestial beings took over perfectly, we've been quite bored."</p><p></p><p>"The only regret is not being able to see Lord Lei An at all times. We miss you so much. There are fewer and fewer old friends now. Sometimes we want to chat with Your Excellency but can't find you. Alas~"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we mainly miss Lord Lei An...We really wish we could learn teleportation and star travel, so we could occasionally visit you for tea and such, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The deities chattered endlessly, all expressing their longing for Su Hao, almost telling him they wanted to follow him around all the time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I understand your feelings, so I've come to see you all this time. Since you lords are bored now and want something to do..."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities immediately widened their eyes, looking at Su Hao expectantly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Su Hao said, "I have a long-term project in the works that suits your expertise. I don't know if you're interested. </p><p></p><p>If you're willing to take it on, as a reward, I can teach you the teleportation skills you've been longing for, without any cost in points. Most importantly, I can teach it to you before you start working."</p><p></p><p>"Whewâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Happiness came so suddenly - this was truly their spring.</p><p></p><p>Zhen Tian Zhi Shen-Na Ti exclaimed excitedly, "Lord Lei An, I'm willing! Please grant me the teleportation ability!"</p><p></p><p>An Ye Zhi Shen-Yong Shi curiously asked, "What is this long-term project?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You should know that besides the Cruciform Star, there are hundreds of other trial planets developing different civilizations in this star system, as well as even more planets you don't know about. I intend to connect all these worlds together into an expanse of boundless lands, then lay down the Soul Power Network across it all, granting 'souls' to all beings under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In building this Soul Power Network, you are the most suitable people. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities were stunned by Su Hao's grand project, looking at each other, and chaos soon erupted in their group chat.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, do we have to start endless work building soul power structures again? I don't want to!"</p><p></p><p>"During those hundred years of construction before, I wanted to give up countless times...I never want to do that kind of work again."</p><p></p><p>Before the dejected comments could continue, Na Ti interrupted: "What are you lords thinking? Have you forgotten what Lord Yi said? Working for Lord Lei An is our honor - we are willing to be his humble followers for ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now Lord Lei An has finally 'spared' some work for us, how can you have this attitude? This is Lord Lei An's trust in us. We cannot let Lord Lei An down. We must firmly follow Lord Lei An!"</p><p></p><p>The others were slightly reinvigorated by Na Ti's words.</p><p></p><p>Then Wan Lei Zhi Shen-Gu Ha Ha let out a booming laugh, speaking in an extremely domineering tone: "Lords, I completely agree with Na Ti. I am willing to devote myself fully to completing this work. Because don't you all think this is an extraordinarily great endeavor?</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Lord Lei An is asking us to join, inviting us to participate in this project! Years later, we will become existences as great as Lord Lei An."</p><p></p><p>He surveyed the deities with a slightly disdainful smile. "Every time Lord Lei An calls us 'deities', I feel an immense shame, because I cannot bear the weight of those two words in his presence. I don't feel worthy.</p><p></p><p>But if we follow by Lord Lei An's side, the result will be different."</p><p></p><p>Gu's words left all the deities in silence. They had been convinced. As Gu said, after getting to know Su Hao, they had developed a strong aversion to the term 'deities'.</p><p></p><p>But they were unwilling to give up that title, their will did not allow them to deny their former selves.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Huang Jin Zhi Shen-Ba Li was pushed forward as the representative to say: "Lord Lei An, on behalf of the eighteen of us, I officially accept your mission. We will complete it perfectly according to your requirements. Please trust our abilities."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Then allow me to introduce myself solemnly. Lei An is just an alias - you can call me Jia Wei like everyone else."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities were shaken. Jia Wei! So this was Lord Lei An's true name? We have gained Lord...Jia Wei's trust, which is the foundation of everything!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao unlocked the 'Teleportation' skill in the deities' mall, allowing them to browse it freely, then said: "I have unlocked the teleportation ability for you. If you have any questions, you can ask your assistants and they will tell you what to do."</p><p></p><p>The deities eagerly opened their world-building assistants and the 'Teleportation' skill, with detailed explanations and cultivation methods laid out for them to browse freely.</p><p></p><p>The deities flushed with excitement. The cosmos and stars seemed within reach.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "As for that project, you don't need to rush. When I need you, I'll come find you. It shouldn't be too long. For now, I'll assign you a task."</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately focused their attention on Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Newly born world wills often encounter sudden events that threaten their lives during their growth, making it difficult for them to mature smoothly.</p><p></p><p>So I recently created a little gadget called the 'Lucky Goddess' Lost Coin' that can eliminate some of the ill fortune affecting world wills to a certain extent, keeping their luck at a relatively stable level.</p><p></p><p>You can look up its information in the mall, but for now it's only open to newborn world wills for effect testing.</p><p></p><p>What I want you to do is observe the world wills that redeem the coin and see if they still encounter various sudden events."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the deities looked at the coin's information with astonished expressions. They had never imagined that a small coin could actually control a person's luck.</p>

            <p>After passing through another world passage, Gao Qi grabbed Lu Yijiang's collar and yelled, "Yijiang, listen to me, our natural yuan qi clusters are ready to run out, this time give me some peace, don't act rashly, do you hear me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi Jiang waved his hand awkwardly and said, "Got it Gao Qi, don't worry, I won't act rashly. But it's all because the other party moved first, it has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Taicheng whispered, "Do the three of us look that beat up? Why are there always people looking for trouble with us?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi Jiang said, "We are practicing and cultivating, it's normal to encounter trouble, haven't you guys noticed that we've been progressing very fast in the past few years?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi knew that the words he just said were in vain, Lu Yi Jiang was afraid that he didn't listen at all.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Land was good for them in every way, except for the lack of Yuan Qi.</p><p></p><p>Without the replenishment of heaven and earth's Yuan Qi, their combat power was actually greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, they only treated the Infinite Land as a place for trial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Arrow Gaoqi's head was full of black lines, Lu Yijiang comforted in a rare moment, "Gaoqi, don't be too nervous, I remember the way we came, if we really don't have enough natural yuan qi, then we'll just go back the way we came, and wait at the border of the Infinite Land for Cong Renfei to come to us."</p><p></p><p>Just after saying that, the three of them immediately sensed someone approaching sharply in front of them, looked at each other and took up a defensive stance.</p><p></p><p>They were already familiar with this kind of situation, and it was usually a fight.</p><p></p><p>The two streams of light dissipated, revealing two young men's shadows, flying in mid-air smilingly looking at the three of them.</p><p></p><p>It didn't look like they had come over to fight.</p><p></p><p>Rather, Lu Yi Jiang's trio couldn't help but jump in their hearts, "It's two humans, what a strong aura, the strength of these two people is definitely above all their previous opponents."</p><p></p><p>Then Lu Yijiang's battle spirit rose up in leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi slashed a hand knife on Lu Yi Jiang's head and roared in a low voice, "Yi Jiang, you shut up and don't speak."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang suffered pain and covered his head, "Got it."</p><p></p><p>The people who came were the old Giant King and the old Hairy Tail King who wanted to pull the Berserk Three Warriors into the demonic realm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi stepped forward and asked, "Who are you guys? If we have stepped into your territory, then I am very sorry, we will back off."</p><p></p><p>The Old Giant King laughed, "There is no need to be nervous for the three young friends, we don't have any malicious intent, we just want to have a good exchange with you.</p><p></p><p>First of all, I introduce myself, my name is Giant Burgundy Demon King, next to me is Mao Hun Demon King, belonging to the Demon Realm, and is now responsible for searching for wise and good talents, and jointly constructing a Demon Realm Paradise that belongs entirely to us.</p><p></p><p>We heard about the feats of you Berserk Three Warriors above the Infinite Lands and came after them, wanting to have a good chat with the three of you."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi's three were surprised, "Magic Realm? Never heard of it!"</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King didn't care and smiled, "Hehe, it's very normal that you haven't heard of it, because there aren't many people who know about the Demon Realm. The Devil Realm is another infinite land independent of the Infinite Land, and its greatness will never be lower than the Infinite Land in the future, you will know after you go."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi shook his head and said, "We are not interested in the Demon Realm, at the moment, we just want to turn around in the Infinite Land and look at the various landscapes, we don't want to be known as any Demon King, and we don't have any quest for greatness. I am very sorry for making you guys come all the way to us for nothing."</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King said "Don't be in a hurry to reject, the reason why you guys don't have any pursuits is because you don't know what it means to join the Demon Realm, as long as you know, then you will definitely join us without hesitation. To be honest, there are a lot of people who want to join our Demon Realm, but none of them have which qualifications, not everyone can join, even the vast majority of the kings of the races in the infinite lands don't have that qualification."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang asked curiously, "What does it mean for us to join the Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King grinned, "It means power, wealth, knowledge, strength, and ...... eternal life! Everything you want can be obtained in the Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--" the three of them, Lu Yi Jiang, couldn't help but suck in a mouthful of cold air despite their inner resistance.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Cultivation handed over to them by Mr. Javi would only allow them to have just over a thousand years of lifespan, eternal life, one wouldn't even dare to think about it.</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King said, ''If not, why do you think I joined the Demon World? Simply put, in the Infinite Land, you guys won't get anything, but unlike in the Demon Realm, you will have everything."</p><p></p><p>Taicheng's eyes widened and he said with some interest, "Really? Can you live forever?"</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King hemmed and hawed and said, "It's not just as simple as living forever, to be precise, it should be living forever. As long as you join the Demon Realm and gain the recognition of the great Chip Great Demon King, you may be able to integrate your souls into the Demon Realm, and as long as the Demon Realm doesn't perish and you don't perish, you will be able to come back to life in the Demon Realm even if your bodies are pulverized to the bone. This is true immortality."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng: "Good ...... good!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi blackened his face and whispered, "Hey, Taicheng, don't be convinced by someone saying two sentences, there are a lot of liars in the Infinite Land."</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang asked, "Is there Yuan Qi in the magic world?"</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King froze, puzzled, "Yuan Qi, what Yuan Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang casually spread out his hand and a small ball of Yuan Qi was born in his hand, "This is it."</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King perceived it carefully, and the old Hairy Tail King looked at each other, and said uncertainly, "This ...... we can t be sure of for the moment, but as long as it is found in the infinite land, we have it in the Demon Realm. You'll know if you make a trip with us."</p><p></p><p>As long as one went with them to the Devil Realm, then those who were not from the Devil Realm would eventually become from the Devil Realm, and could not run away. Unless those Golden Immortals with spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>But Golden Immortals with spatial abilities were incomparably rare in the Infinite Lands, it was very hard to see one, and they didn't believe that the Berserk Three Warriors in front of them would be three Golden Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi Jiang said, "There is no Yuan Qi in the Infinite Lands, so that means the Demon Realm should not have it either."</p><p></p><p>Old Giant King: "......"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Hairy Tail King added, "What Infinite Land doesn't have, we in the Demon Realm do."</p><p></p><p>The Old Giant King immediately nodded, "Precisely."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi decisively refused, "Sorry, we're still not interested in the Devil Realm. After we are interested, we might go to the Demon Realm to take a look, and then if you still need manpower, we will consider joining."</p><p></p><p>There was no way they would agree to join some devil realm just because of the other party's three words.</p><p></p><p>Their roots were in the Martial Dao Star, and they were only here to experience and cultivate, they wanted to hone their power and strive to reach a higher realm of Martial Daoists, and they were not interested in any Demon Realm for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Even the immortality that the old Giant King had spoken of, they had little concept of it.</p><p></p><p>Because in their cognition, the life span of human beings is only about a hundred years, now they already have more than a thousand years of life span, which is already an unimaginable number, similar to eternal life ......</p><p></p><p>However, if the Demon Realm possessed Yuan Qi, then it could still be considered, since it didn't, then forget it.</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King turned his head and whispered to the old Hairy Tailed King, ''Old Hairy, what should we do, they don't seem to be too agreeable, this recruitment is considered a failure, right? Not even willing to take a trip with us to the Demon Realm, do we look like bad guys."</p><p></p><p>Old Hairy Tail King stroked his chin and said, "When you were talking just now, I already showed a gentle smile as much as I could the whole time, I shouldn't look like a bad guy. Maybe it's because they think we don't have that strength and are unwilling to believe our words."</p><p></p><p>The Old Giant King asked, "What then?"</p><p></p><p>Old Hairy Tail King said, "Beat them down, then twist them to the teleportation array and bring them back by force, they should recognize our words. Well, at the same time, it's also good to weigh whether the three of them are as powerful as the rumors say, and whether they have the qualifications to join our Demon Realm, if they're too weak, then forget it."</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King nodded his head and said, "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to Lu Yi Jiang and said, "You guys are bound to not believe that we have that strength, since that's the case, let's do a fight and let you guys take a good look at what is the true power of the devil realm, after seeing it, you guys will definitely change your mind."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he reached out his hand and a giant hand appeared out of thin air, grabbing towards the three of them.</p>

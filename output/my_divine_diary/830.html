        <h1>Chapter 830</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Mu-ti and his new lover only woke up after a long time. The two battered and bruised red golden dragons looked at each other speechlessly.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around the cave, the female dragon Dai'an suddenly said anxiously, "Ti, where are our children? Our children are gone."</p><p></p><p>Mu-ti searched around the cave but couldn't find the two dragon eggs anywhere. Angrily he said, "It must be Sha-duo who took our children away. What does she want to do?"</p><p></p><p>After Mu-ti said this, Dai'an immediately believed that their children were taken away by the female dragon Sha-duo. She pleaded, "Ti, let's go get our children back now!"</p><p></p><p>Mu-ti nodded, "Okay! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>But after walking to the cave entrance, he turned back and said, "Dai'an, I can't defeat my son. Even if we go after them, we may not be able to bring our children back."</p><p></p><p>Dai'an asked anxiously, "Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's have another clutch! Don't worry, this time we'll find a place where Sha-duo can't find."</p><p></p><p>Dai'an regretted, "I shouldn't have suggested tricking her to go to the Cloud Mountain Range..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The palace of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati was not located in the ancestral lands, but was built in the highland mountains north of the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>This was because of the agreement between the deity Nati of the red golden dragons and the deity of the black thunder dragons. The entire Dragon Continent was divided by the ancestral lands, with the north being the territory of the red golden dragons and the south the territory of the black thunder dragons. Neither side would invade the other, and they lived in peace.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the ancestral lands and the palace of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati was not far. But at the speed of the female dragon Sha-duo, it would take about four days to reach.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Su Hao made more [Divine] avatars for future use.</p><p></p><p>One day later, when Su Hao sensed that the two dragon eggs were about to hatch, he infused the consciousness information of Ya Shan and Feng Cheng into them.</p><p></p><p>The process went very smoothly, and the fusion was completed in no time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the consciousness of Ya Shan and Feng Cheng began to operate violently, which was the prelude to their awakening.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng fully awakened.</p><p></p><p>The two of them seemed very confused about their current state and did not break out of the shells for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ya Shan sent a message in the group: "Old Master Wei? I feel like I've been resurrected."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Feng Cheng also sent a message: "Old Master Ya Shan, you're here too! That's great! Is Old Master Wei here too? I'm in a bit of trouble right now, in a very cramped place, it seems like I've been captured. Emergency rescue!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan sent a 'confused Feng Cheng' emoji and said, "I'm in the same situation, feeling a bit suffocated, can't protect myself. Calling Old Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a photo of the two dragon eggs and sent it to the group: "Here! This is you two, see what you look like? Round and handsome."</p><p></p><p>After receiving Su Hao's response, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's unsettled hearts finally calmed down, thinking to themselves: "Old Master Wei is here, we're saved!"</p><p></p><p>Then they saw the photo Su Hao sent and were stunned: "Aren't these bird eggs?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "These are dragon eggs, you two have turned into dragon eggs. What are you waiting for? Hurry up and come out, or I'll eat boiled dragon eggs."</p><p></p><p>The two were dumbfounded, never imagining that they had turned into eggs, and according to Old Master Wei, they were dragon eggs.</p><p></p><p>No wonder their bodies felt so strange.</p><p></p><p>The problem now was how to get out?</p><p></p><p>They struggled for a while but couldn't move at all, unable to exert force with their hands and feet to break through the sturdy eggshells.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Old Master Wei, can you help break open the eggshell from the outside? I can't seem to move my hands and feet."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and refused, "It's best not to interfere when animals hatch from their shells."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng: "..."</p><p></p><p>In the end, they finally discovered the two pointed dragon horns on their foreheads and used them to crack open the eggshells and crawl out.</p><p></p><p>The two freshly hatched, completely red baby dragons with white bellies stretched their bodies vigorously, as if they had been cramped up and suffocated.</p><p></p><p>After the two baby dragons fully stretched out, their bodies felt relaxed, and they couldn't help but let out two moans from their throats.</p><p></p><p>Then the two baby dragons looked at each other and examined one another.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan held back a laugh and asked, "Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "It's me, are you Old Master Ya Shan?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan suddenly stretched out his claw and pointed at Feng Cheng, bursting into laughter with a strange and unclear voice, "Hahaha, Feng Cheng, you look so funny. Is this a dragon? Why do you look so weird?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng barely understood and looked at himself, puzzled, "But Old Master Ya Shan, don't you look the same as me? What's so funny?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan turned to observe his own appearance and was speechless for a moment: "..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng saw a red baby dragon standing beside them, several times larger than them. They asked uncertainly, "Old Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "It's me! How does it feel to turn into a dragon egg, hatch from it, and become a giant dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Su Hao had also turned into a baby dragon, the two immediately accepted their new identities.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan stretched out his claw and scratched, "A very novel experience...just like the first time controlling the [Eight-Armed God], still a bit unaccustomed."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "I think it's pretty good, it's not bad to experience a different body and growth. I just don't know if this dragon brain is smart or not."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly thought of something and looked down at his crotch, seeing nothing there. He then peeked at Ya Shan's crotch and saw a small thing.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was stunned at first, his young brain rapidly processing the data he had collected and analyzing the current situation. His smart brain quickly figured it out.</p><p></p><p>Then he gradually turned to stone, stiffly turning his head towards Su Hao: "Old...Old Master Wei, where is my little brother?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao naturally knew what Feng Cheng was asking about. Of the two dragon eggs, one was male and one female, and Feng Cheng happened to be reborn from the female one.</p><p></p><p>He said nonchalantly, "What's the big deal? If you don't like it, I can give you a shot in a few days and get your little brother back for you. You can have any size you want."</p><p></p><p>If conditions permitted, he would have preferred to directly reincarnate them as male dragons. But the two dragon eggs he obtained happened to be one male and one female, so he could only awaken them like this for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, for beings like them, being male or female didn't really matter. With just one shot, they could freely switch at will.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that he could change back, Feng Cheng was almost moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan curiously looked at Feng Cheng's crotch, then at his own, and laughed heartily. He then asked curiously, "Feng Cheng, how does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chatted idly with the two for a while. Seeing that they were both in good condition, he said, "First eat some food to refine your blood energy, and practice your spiritual power at the same time. I'll modify your bodies in three days.</p><p></p><p>This world is still quite interesting. Quickly recover your strength, and once you have some self-protection ability, you can go out and take a look."</p><p></p><p>The two baby dragons were full of anticipation for the future: "Understood, Old Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng knew that they had died in their previous life, and Old Master Wei had brought their souls to another world, where they were reborn in dragon form. But after truly awakening, apart from feeling relaxed and excited, they had no other special feelings about being resurrected.</p><p></p><p>To them, this long period of death was like their consciousness slowly coming to a halt, only to slowly revive in the next moment, with just a split second in between, and no sense of estrangement from each other.</p><p></p><p>If there was any difference, it was that the formidable power they had cultivated in their previous life was gone, and of course, they had also changed from being human to the non-human red golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>But none of that mattered, as long as they were alive. As long as they were alive and could still see Old Master Wei, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days passed in the blink of an eye. The female dragon brought the three baby dragons to the outskirts of the palace of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati and found a temporary dwelling place.</p><p></p><p>The divine palace was extremely large and rugged, with an enormous arched gate. Behind the gate was a vast square, and further back was a huge stone palace. Inside the palace was a giant statue of a red golden dragon, its eyes slightly open and wings spread as if about to take flight, looking like a dragon that had just awakened.</p><p></p><p>This must be the statue of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati.</p><p></p><p>At this time, nearly ten adolescent red golden dragons had already gathered around, waiting for the ceremony to begin. In ten days, the awakening ceremony would officially commence.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked the female dragon Sha-duo, "Mother Sha-duo, will the deity Nati descend in person during the soul power awakening ceremony?"</p><p></p><p>The female dragon Sha-duo corrected him, "Leiyan, you must address the deity as 'His Majesty the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati'. You cannot be disrespectful in front of His Majesty Nati, understand?"</p><p></p><p>After the correction, she answered Su Hao's question, "The soul power awakening ceremony must be personally conducted by His Majesty Nati. So at that time, you will be able to see His Majesty the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati, whom our golden dragon tribe reveres."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled in response, "I understand, Mother Sha-duo."</p><p></p><p>In other words, by following the female dragon Sha-duo on this journey, he had reached his destination. Here, he would obtain the soul seed and unravel the mysteries of soul power.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he could also invite an avatar of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati into his small world. Taking advantage of the deity's lack of reaction, he could record its consciousness information, find its main body's location, and then capture the main body of the God of Stabilizing Heaven - Nati before it had a chance to relocate...</p><p></p><p>"There's still some time left, I might as well write a program specifically to analyze the 'main body location' from the consciousness information, so that I can find the deity's main body location the moment I record its consciousness information."</p><p></p><p>Fully analyzing the data of a consciousness information would take a very long time, not something that could be done in a short while. But if he only needed to crack a specific point, the difficulty would be much lower, and Su Hao could quickly complete writing the program.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the deities of this world were just too cautious. Countless years of overt and covert struggles with other deities had made them extremely sensitive, and they would swiftly relocate their main bodies at the slightest hint of trouble.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao didn't do this, even though he had the 'Galactic Network' to quickly search, it would still be very difficult to find the deities' main bodies on a single planet.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had never seen what the Ten-Colored Plates looked like. If he had seen them once, it would be much easier to find them.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 911</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Tali Garde has sent you a party invitation. Do you accept?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King suddenly heard a prompt in his mind, and was slightly stunned: "Who is Tali Garde? A party invitation? What is this?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cong Shuling said loudly: "Crimson Supreme Demon King, I am Tali Garde, and this is my brother Gail Garde. Did you see my invitation?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King said in astonishment: "You are Tali Garde?"</p><p></p><p>He could not understand how the other party was able to connect to the 'Universal Demon King System' that his third brother had given him and initiate some kind of 'party invitation'.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling took a deep breath to calm her complex emotions, and then said: "Crimson Supreme Demon King, I think we can have a good talk. Perhaps we are not enemies, and there is even ample room for cooperation, if you don't mind wasting some time. We can find a place to sit down, as you said, and have a drink."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King suddenly laughed loudly: "Tali Garde, I appreciate your courage. If you're not afraid, you can come to my castle! By the way, my name is Crimson Oakes."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he turned around and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei exchanged a glance, following behind the Crimson Supreme Demon King, flying towards the distance, and soon disappeared from this sea area.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the eighteen deities were perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? The two great enemies not only did not fight when they met, but they even turned from enemies to friends and were going to drink together? One has a body hundreds of meters long, the other less than two meters, two different beings drinking together?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, this is really beyond my expectations. I have a feeling that there are things we don't know happening in between. What happened in the middle?"</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, now is not the time for amazement. We should think more about our own situation. If the World Will and the Crimson Supreme Demon King shake hands and become friends, our chances of getting out of trouble are remote. Or rather, as long as they become friends, we will have no chance to leave our posts."</p><p></p><p>"It may not be that bad. What Lord Leian said was that as long as the World Will's power reaches or exceeds that of the Crimson Supreme Demon King, it doesn't necessarily mean the Crimson Supreme Demon King has to be eliminated. So there's no need to worry about that... or maybe there is!"</p><p></p><p>The Bathing Light Deity Yiming suddenly said calmly after watching this period of record: "I think I've guessed what the problem is."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Yi said: "The two siblings seem to be unaware that the other World Wills also have systems. After this great battle, they only noticed the existence of other World Wills, and then they seem to have found a way to identify system holders. So their first reaction was to find the Crimson Supreme Demon King for testing."</p><p></p><p>"And the result? The Crimson Supreme Demon King doesn't have a system, and there's no mark of the Crimson Supreme Demon King in our systems."</p><p></p><p>Yi shook his head: "Quite the opposite. Based on their reactions after contact, I guess the Crimson Supreme Demon King does have a system, but his system is not under our management authority. We only have the authority to manage the World Wills. If this is the case, the Crimson Supreme Demon King's formidable strength has an explanation - he can also earn points to exchange for skills and items."</p><p></p><p>The deities were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yi continued: "And did you not notice the Crimson Supreme Demon King's surname? He said it himself, 'Crimson Oakes'. This can explain a lot of problems."</p><p></p><p>The deities' minds suddenly conjured up the image of Su Hao, and they instantly understood many things.</p><p></p><p>The deities suddenly felt a sense of futility: "What's the point of playing anymore?"</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity Red Light smiled bitterly: "In that case, how can I avenge the grudge I held for over a thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>Barian comforted him: "Lord Red Light, look on the bright side. Isn't it just an avatar? If you knew the Crimson Supreme Demon King was related to Lord Leian, I'd be willing to send ten of my avatars to the Crimson Supreme Demon King's feet to have their nails trimmed, get painted, and have bloody red manicures."</p><p></p><p>Red Light lost his strength: "You have a point..."</p><p></p><p>The Salvation Deity Baishen asked: "The problem now is, how do we get out of this predicament?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King looked at Cong Shuling and her brother in shock: "We are actually on the same side?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling downed a bowl of strong liquor and laughed heartily: "Of course, we are on the same side. All the previous fighting and killing was completely unnecessary, just a misunderstanding. Come, drink this bowl, and we'll be friends."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei raised the wine bowl in front of the Crimson Supreme Demon King and also laughed loudly: "Indeed, we would not have known each other without fighting. Drink this bowl, and let's wipe out all previous grudges, what do you say?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King quickly reacted, his mind rapidly turning, recalling the scene where his third brother had planted the Reincarnation Imprint on him. He couldn't help but open a ferocious grin, laughing loudly as he grabbed a huge barrel next to him, clinked it with Cong Renfei's bowl, and downed it in one gulp: "We're all on the same side, hahaha, cheers! We would not have known each other without fighting, all grudges wiped clean. We'll be friends from now on."</p><p></p><p>It was only then that the Crimson Supreme Demon King realized that these two humans were the only two friends he had in his Dragon Life.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the liquor, and suddenly thought of something, and said: "Let me confirm one last thing, show me your imprints."</p><p></p><p>Imprints?</p><p></p><p>The two siblings had them. Without hesitation, they rolled up their sleeves and revealed the 'Double Sword Imprint' on the back of their hands.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King leaned down and scrutinized them carefully, puzzled: "Huh? Your imprints are fake, aren't they?"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings immediately said: "Fake? Impossible, take a closer look, this is called the Double Sword Imprint."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King revealed the Double Ring Imprint on his forehead and said: "A real imprint looks like this, this is the Double Ring Imprint, I like to call it the Reincarnation Imprint."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the dragon and the two humans were all stunned: "!!"</p><p></p><p>A doubt inevitably arose in their minds: Could it be that the other party is not on my side? Are they still enemies... should we fight?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Crimson Supreme Demon King examined them carefully again, and couldn't help but laugh loudly: "Indeed, we are colleagues. Hahaha! On the same side. Come, for our two new friends, cheers!"</p><p></p><p>After three rounds of drinks, Cong Shuling suddenly looked up at the Crimson Supreme Demon King and extended her hand: "Crimson Supreme Demon King, since we are friends now, let's cooperate and grow stronger!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King: "Cooperate? We're all friends now, just say it, what cooperation?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shook her head: "Although that's true, this matter still requires cooperation. Let's cooperate to grind points and grow stronger, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Supreme Demon King: "???"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "From now on, we'll communicate through the team channel to avoid trouble. Don't let anyone else hear it."</p><p></p><p>The deities were about to drop their jaws: "Oh my, they can even grind points?"</p><p></p><p>So, from that moment on, the entire Crucis World became different.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, people suddenly found that the situation in the world became more and more intense. The newspapers almost reported battles between the Twin Deities and the Crimson Supreme Demon King every few days, and their conflicts became more and more fierce.</p><p></p><p>The world fell into turmoil, of course, limited to the turmoil reported in the newspapers.</p><p></p><p>But it also caused people to be alarmed and at the same time yearn for such a life of fighting and killing.</p><p></p><p>True heroes, true warriors, should wield their swords and fight against the evil Crimson Supreme Demon King, to restore peace to the world.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the 'Age of Justice' began. Out of admiration for the strong, a wave of seeking apprenticeships arose again in various parts of the world, and a group of brave people flocked to the Heroic World in search of the legendary 'Palace Island' where they could take apprentices.</p><p></p><p>And the best news was that as long as they passed the test of the Double Sword Gate of Palace Island, they could learn powerful skills and gain unparalleled strength.</p><p></p><p>Even more shockingly, the Crimson Supreme Demon King's army was also openly recruiting demon soldiers, opening a path upwards.</p><p></p><p>In other words, by joining the Crimson Supreme Demon King's army, one would also have the opportunity to gain tremendous power and have their name spread throughout the world through newspapers.</p><p></p><p>Wealth, fame, power...</p>

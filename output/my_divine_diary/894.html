        <h1>Chapter 894</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Misfortunes of different stages have varying degrees of impact. As time goes on, their power grows stronger and stronger. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the cycles also become longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>But if one's strength reaches a certain level, they can basically ignore the effects of the misfortune waves, until the misfortune exceeds the limit of what they can withstand.</p><p></p><p>For example, after Suhao was reborn, he could quickly gain enough powerful strength that even without hiding, he could basically be immune to misfortunes within the thousand-year stage.</p><p></p><p>Such minor misfortunes before him at his prime would merely be like a gentle breeze blowing against his face, not even making him blink.</p><p></p><p>The current stage of misfortune was similarly harmless to the Cong siblings.</p><p></p><p>When facing the Huo Li pirate gang, it seemed extremely dangerous, but in reality, the resources and strength they commanded were far beyond that of the pirate gang.</p><p></p><p>This was a crushing superiority in resources.</p><p></p><p>With the initiative, there was almost no possibility of failure.</p><p></p><p>The two siblings flew high in the air and suddenly launched an attack, wildly bombarding Huo Li Focal Island below, expending all the artillery shells on them and from their personal spaces.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom—"</p><p></p><p>Flashes of fire, shattering rocks, wooden splinters flying from the ships, igniting raging fires, thick smoke rising from the sea surface. Many members of the Huo Li pirate gang on the island didn't even understand what was happening before their consciousness faded into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Soon the scene below was in complete chaos, shouts intermingled with the roar of artillery fire, almost indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's hands kept throwing bombs tirelessly. His sharp eyes spotted some pirates below who had noticed them and were shouting to send up airborne warriors to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei grinned, taking out a rocket launcher from behind and aiming it at those pirates, pulling the trigger.</p><p></p><p>"Bang—whoosh—"  </p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Those pirates immediately vanished without a trace, either having taken cover or blown away.</p><p></p><p>"Sis, we've been discovered. Let's get closer to bomb them, otherwise our aim won't be accurate and we'll waste ammunition. This is all from our points, you know!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shurong nodded: "Be careful."</p><p></p><p>They had already switched to lifesaving abilities earlier, so they didn't need to worry about sneak attacks from the enemy at all. In this current stage of air-to-ground combat, there was temporarily no danger to them. The subsequent clean-up work was the key point.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two siblings had expended all the artillery shells in their hands. The island below was shrouded in thick smoke, its original appearance no longer recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shurong took a deep breath and drew the long sword from her waist: "Let's go down and clean up any surviving pirates."</p><p></p><p>Her tone was filled with coldness, her eyes reflecting the flames, without a shred of mercy. In her view, this was not only for the mission, but also for the justice in her heart. In her previous life, she hated her father the most, and next were the bandits who made a living by killing and robbing. The pirates they now faced were basically the same as bandits, and she believed these people deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei fired the last bullet, put his firearms back into his space, and also drew out his long sword, flying downwards: "Let's do this!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Watching this battle, Suhao thought to himself: "Indeed, at this stage the misfortune poses no threat to these two. The previous batch of crossers was really too weak, so I gave the system extremely high permissions. With such a system, once it encounters outstanding crossers who can think for themselves, it becomes the most powerful cheating tool."</p><p></p><p>Without comparison, there would be no gap. Apart from their own excellence, by comparing themselves to other crossers, it made Suhao look at these two favorably no matter how he viewed them.</p><p></p><p>"They are good seedlings. With focused cultivation, they may become small assistants who can lend a hand in a few hundred years."</p><p></p><p>He pondered and sent a message to Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, do you remember the Cong siblings we encountered on the Ceramic Road back then?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's memory was computer-grade. He chuckled: "Those two siblings ah, I remember. They were looking for their father, but I don't know if they found him. What about them? Why is the old master bringing this up?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "About a month after you left, they found their father. But it seems they didn't even have a chance to recognize each other before being killed by their father's guards.</p><p></p><p>I happened to be there at the time, so I casually preserved their souls and sent them to adventure on the Cruciform Star.</p><p></p><p>This time when I came back to observe them for a bit, I found these two aren't too bad. Remembering that you seemed to get along well with them, I wondered if you might be interested in taking them as disciples? With a few hundred years of cultivation, they could become decent assistants, making things easier for us in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you're not interested, then never mind. We can just let them struggle on their own for now."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng became interested: "Oh? Where are they? I am interested, but I don't know about their learning abilities or if they still remember me. Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao sent Feng Cheng the location of the two siblings, then said: "Learning ability isn't an issue. As long as their character is tenacious enough and they have a special skill, they can be properly cultivated. Besides, it's not like your learning ability is that great either."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed: "That's true! I'm so awesome now that I almost forgot how foolish I used to be. Hahaha! I'll go take a look first and see what situation these two siblings are in now."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Go take a look, no need to rush. This is just the first batch of candidates. I plan to screen a second batch after some time and pick out some promising people to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, old master."</p><p></p><p>After arranging the subsequent matters for the two siblings, Suhao stopped paying attention to them. To him, it was just a casual act. Whether they could successfully grow depended on themselves.</p><p></p><p>After all, to become assistants to the three of them, it wasn't just about having strength - they also needed to possess vast and profound knowledge. If their minds were already rusty and unable to actively learn and think, even giving them new brains would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Time to continue producing my equipment."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Cong siblings bombarded Focal Island, directly killing most of the ordinary pirate members. But for those pirates with powerful abilities, it wasn't quite enough.</p><p></p><p>This required them to engage in close-quarters combat with their swords.</p><p></p><p>However, with their overwhelming advantage in this situation, there was no reason for them to fail.</p><p></p><p>After another perilous melee battle, they successfully beheaded the pirate leader Huo Li, and the fight ended.</p><p></p><p>The two siblings, covered in wounds, turned back silently to gaze at the hellish scene, slowly sheathing their swords.</p><p></p><p>There was joy at completing the mission, but also sadness at the loss of life. The two emotions offset each other, leaving them appearing very calm.</p><p></p><p>In this perfectly solemn atmosphere, Cong Renfei unexpectedly opened his mouth to break it: "Sis, let's search the island, maybe there will be some good stuff."</p><p></p><p>Even though they had bombarded the place, who knows if there might still be some good things left.</p><p></p><p>To prepare for this battle, the two of them had spent every single point they had accumulated. If they couldn't recoup some of their investment, it would truly be a case of bleeding money for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shurong said dully: "You go search first, I'll rest for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He started wandering around the small island.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Cong Shurong found a rock to sit on and subconsciously opened her system panel.</p><p></p><p>"Name: Tali Garde</p><p>Talents: Internal Force Talent, Cultivation Talent, Life Detection</p><p>Bloodline: Type III Gene-Enhanced Human, Phantasm Clone Soulmind Human</p><p>Items: Blue-Bladed Longsword, Purple-Gold Chainmail, Grenade Launcher, Rifle, Mouth Truespeak Whip...</p><p>Points: 15,028</p><p>......"</p><p></p><p>The mission reward was only 5,000 points, but after completing the mission she had a total of 15,000 points, meaning the points from killing enemies were also included.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the 15,000 points, Cong Shurong couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest points she'd ever had. Previously, she had accumulated for a long time to barely reach 10,000 before being forced to spend them.</p><p></p><p>"Which means this mission not only made up for the expenditure, but also left a decent surplus. My strength can advance another step."</p><p></p><p>She opened the mall again, browsing through those ultra high-class items, muttering: "When will I ever earn 1 million points? Feels impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Every time she managed to accumulate some savings, she would soon face an even greater danger, forcing her to spend the points to increase her strength for self-protection.</p><p></p><p>She estimated this time would be no exception.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Cong Renfei suddenly shouted excitedly from over there: "Sis, come quick, I found a crate of good stuff!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shurong's eyes lit up and she immediately got up and walked towards Cong Renfei: "What stuff?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Three perfectly preserved soulmind fruits! Haha, we hit the jackpot!"</p>

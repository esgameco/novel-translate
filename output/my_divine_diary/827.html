        <h1>Chapter 827</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the mother dragon Shaduo was flying over the vast ocean. At the horizon where the sea and sky met, a gray line was vaguely visible. That was the destination of this journey - the Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>After two months of travel, Mother Dragon Shaduo had finally brought her three children safely back to this familiar land. Excited and extremely proud, she couldn't help but say to the three curious young dragons: "My children, do you see that land ahead? That is the Dragon Continent, the fertile land that has nurtured our dragon race for so long. It is our homeland.</p><p></p><p>Your father Muzhuo is on that land. We are about to set foot on the Dragon Continent and then find your father..."</p><p></p><p>"Woooo--"</p><p></p><p>The eldest dragon son Chipu and second daughter Moli stood up excitedly, flapping their wings and howling towards the distance. Though they didn't know why they were excited, perhaps it was because their mother Shaduo was excited, so they got excited too.</p><p></p><p>As they approached the Dragon Continent, Mother Dragon Shaduo no longer stopped the young dragons from howling, because she no longer had to worry about enemies from other races. This was the dragon race's territory, relatively safe.</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised his eyelids and glanced at the continent ahead, not interested in finding some father named Muzhuo. He had no feelings for this father he had never met. He just wanted to quickly obtain a soul seed and master soul power, so he could study what exactly soul power was.</p><p></p><p>As for whether rashly accepting a soul seed from a deity would cause any problems, Suhao wasn't worried at all. It wasn't his main body accepting the soul seed - it was his [Egg God] clone body accepting it, so what did it have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo said, "Leian, my child, there is about a month left until the annual soul power awakening ceremony. You don't need to be in a hurry. At that time, I will definitely take you there. Of course, you are too young, so I can't guarantee whether the deities will plant a soul seed in you.</p><p></p><p>And I know where Muzhuo is. After finding him, I will immediately take you to the temple of the Deity of Overwatch Nati. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>If it was just a month, Suhao could wait. He could take this time to awaken Yashan and Fengcheng as well.</p><p></p><p>The deities of this world hid themselves too well. Having two more people help search would make it faster.</p><p></p><p>Suhao retracted his head and said, "Okay, let's wait a month then! If anyone refuses to plant a soul seed in me, I'll just beat them up until they agree. It's not hard to imagine - the reason they won't give me a soul seed is probably just because they think I'm too young. Beating them up will change their minds."</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo quickly explained, "Leian, my child, whether to plant a soul seed in you is decided by His Majesty Nati. You cannot be disrespectful to His Majesty Nati."</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't respond to Shaduo's words, only thinking to himself: "The Deity of Overwatch Nati? If he doesn't give me a soul seed, then I'll just blow up his temple."</p><p></p><p>He then closed his eyes and entered the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>By now, Little Light had finished translating the fragmented consciousness information of the Deity of Eternal Night and the Golden Deity Bali, obtaining some scattered, general information.</p><p></p><p>Suhao retrieved the information on the two deities, constantly removing useless parts, until he was left with two relatively important pieces.</p><p></p><p>One was the method for mortals to transform into deities. The other was the locations of the main bodies of these two deities.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "A great harvest."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A complete consciousness information contains an enormous amount of information. Since Suhao listed consciousness information as a target for cracking, he had not stopped cracking consciousness information for many years, until now when he had made great progress.</p><p></p><p>One aspect of consciousness information was the language system, which made it extremely simple for Suhao to learn a new language. On the other hand, he could analyze useful information from the fragmented consciousness information through comparison.</p><p></p><p>Although this information was not plentiful and appeared a bit messy, it was enough for Suhao to obtain certain pieces of information.</p><p></p><p>This ability to crack consciousness information was not much different from what the Deity of Eternal Night called "soul searching."</p><p></p><p>"The results of the analysis are quite unexpected. I never imagined that the so-called deities of this world were born in such a way. This starry realm is far more interesting than I thought."</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the results analyzed by Little Light, Suhao couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>The fragmented information showed that the two deities Eternal Night and Bali had abandoned their physical bodies and fused with a special Ten-Colored Plate to transform into deities.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be inferred that the other sixteen deities were born in the same way.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, there existed a plate that could emit many colors, called the "Ten-Colored Plate" or "Divine Light." This plate was composed entirely of highly pure "soul power." If an ordinary person fused with this plate, they would transform into a "deity."</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, this Ten-Colored Plate was originally alive, with its own consciousness and wisdom - a special intelligent life form.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the main bodies of all deities were the Ten-Colored Plates, and the so-called eighteen deities were those who had usurped the bodies of the Ten-Colored Plates and transformed.</p><p></p><p>As for what exactly the Ten-Colored Plate looked like, Suhao had not pieced that together from the consciousness information, only obtaining the information about the "Ten-Colored Plate" itself.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the origin of the Ten-Colored Plates, the Deity of Eternal Night and the Golden Deity Bali had different views.</p><p></p><p>Bali believed it was a gift from the Creator to humans, or a natural miracle of the planet.</p><p></p><p>But Eternal Night believed that these special Ten-Colored Plates came from the depths of the endless starry void, a special life form born in the depths of space, perhaps existing everywhere in the universe. The Ten-Colored Plates they had fused with just happened to come to this world by chance.</p><p></p><p>The information revealed that Eternal Night had tried to fly into space to explore the universe, but for some unknown reason, eventually gave up.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Suhao agreed with Eternal Night's view.</p><p></p><p>"Soul power does not originate from the life forms of this planet, but from outside space. It's just that the humans of this world developed soul power as a tool for immortality and power.</p><p></p><p>This result is even more interesting than I imagined. No wonder these deities are unwilling to mention how they transformed into deities - usurping bodies is not something these self-righteous people would want to brag about."</p><p></p><p>While understanding the origin of how mortals transform into deities, Suhao also realized why this world, after who knows how many years, only had eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>After all, obtaining a Ten-Colored Plate was not as simple as just "luck."</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be seen that each of these eighteen deities was an absolute "child of destiny" that appeared only once every million years in this world.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought with a smile, "My luck is actually not bad either. What's even luckier is that although the universe is vast, it is not unreachable for me. As long as the birthplace of the Ten-Colored Plates is within this galaxy, I can find them. Then I can have as many as I want."</p><p></p><p>Suhao could enter the "Galactic Network" now to search for the birthplace of the Ten-Colored Plates, but the galaxy was too huge, making it difficult to find. It wouldn't be worth it.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to first create a massive number of [God] clone bodies and directly study the human deities. After all, the human deities' understanding of the Ten-Colored Plates was not low, and Suhao might need to learn some of their application methods.</p><p></p><p>"I really look forward to finding out what exactly the Ten-Colored Plates are. I'd love to invite the deities to my small world as guests to discuss the nature of the Ten-Colored Plates together. But obviously, these deities are extremely cautious. Even if I express goodwill towards them, they won't believe me.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case...then let me see where the main bodies of the Deity of Eternal Night and the Golden Deity Bali are hidden!"</p><p></p><p>After reading further, Suhao rarely showed a look of surprise: "The Golden Deity Bali actually hid his main body in the deep ocean trenches, that's too cowardly and exaggerated...The Deity of Eternal Night actually hid his main body on an orbiting satellite...too slick."</p><p></p><p>Suhao felt a flicker of interest: "I wonder where the other sixteen deities have hidden their main bodies. I'll find them out one by one after some time!"</p><p></p><p>As for how to find the deities' main bodies, he originally planned to awaken Yashan and Fengcheng to help with a comprehensive search. But now he had a better strategy: just capture the deities' clone bodies.</p><p></p><p>"From the analyzed information, it seems that after being pulled into the small world, the deities' clone bodies cannot contact their main bodies, giving me a lot of room to operate. But I need to personally confirm it first."</p>

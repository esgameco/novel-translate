        <h1>Chapter 600</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Regarding Suhao's unreasonable demand, the emperors were indeed unwilling to comply.</p><p></p><p>Who were they? They were the supreme sovereigns of this world. When did they need to report their names and abilities to someone?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that something those lowly subjects should do for them?</p><p></p><p>Delusional thinking! The dignity of being emperors in their hearts would not allow them to compromise so quickly!</p><p></p><p>At least...they should wait for the other party to threaten them first?</p><p></p><p>The emperors made up their minds - as soon as the other party threatened them, they would immediately yield!</p><p></p><p>As Suhao frowned and his words trailed off, everyone's heart skipped a beat, sensing something ominous was coming.</p><p></p><p>Could that count as a threat? It must count as a threat, with his brows furrowed, looking very displeased. What could be more threatening than that expression?</p><p></p><p>The young Jia Emperor was pointed at by Suhao, and his legs immediately felt a bit weak. He gulped hard, glancing around to see all the emperors, including the Taoist priest, staring at him with piercing eyes, all anticipating his next move.</p><p></p><p>To Jia Emperor, those gazes seemed to hope he would act defiantly to see what consequences would follow. Then they could decide whether to act defiantly themselves when it was their turn.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, maybe acting defiantly would earn the other party's admiration instead, sparing him? After all, many plays had such examples where the captured protagonist refused to yield, impressing the villain with heroic spirit. The villain then admired him, and the protagonist narrowly escaped with his life...</p><p></p><p>What if this young man who clearly looked like a villain was the same?</p><p></p><p>Jia Emperor inwardly cursed the group of disloyal fellows. In his view, at this moment, these emperors should stand together with him to face this.</p><p></p><p>Jia Emperor could not gauge Suhao's temperament. Hesitating and stammering, when he saw Suhao about to lose his temper, he immediately spoke clearly, rattling off his background like a string of firecrackers: "My name is Xian Jia, male, the 'Jia Emperor' of the Xian Hou region. I only ascended the throne five years ago to become the emperor of Xian Hou region. As for the work of an emperor, I have just started and don't understand much. If Mr. Jia Wei wants to learn more, the other emperors who ascended long ago would likely know better than me...</p><p></p><p>I am a source mage, an air elemental source mage, but I don't usually practice and am not proficient in using it. According to the Mage Association's rating, I have only reached the beginner level, posing no threat!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao showed a slight smile: "Very good! Next!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Emperor exhaled deeply, unable to stop wiping the cold sweat from his brow with his sleeve. Just that short minute earlier, he was terribly afraid.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the disdainful looks from the other emperors, he retreated to the side.</p><p></p><p>Following Jia Emperor's good start, the other emperors quickly reported their basic information as well.</p><p></p><p>As for lying, no one present even considered it. Who were they? They were the rulers of this world - anyone could easily find out about them by asking around. No need to lie.</p><p></p><p>They told themselves: as emperors, they had dignity and would not stoop to lying...</p><p></p><p>After all the emperors had reported, Suhao turned to the last person - the Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>After a brief adjustment, the Taoist priest regained his confident demeanor, his expression mild with a faint smile. Without Suhao's prompting, he spoke up himself: "My name is He Zheng, with the title 'Taoist He'. I am the president of the New Era City Mage Association, usually handling some trivial association matters. I have some prestige in the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>I am an illusion elemental psychic source mage. I have some personal insights into using sources."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes lit up, smiling: "So you're the leader of all source mages in the world. My apologies, I actually had something I wanted to discuss with you but didn't know where you were. It's fortunate we meet today.</p><p></p><p>Let's set aside what I wanted to discuss first. I'll ask these emperors some things to see if they want to live or die."</p><p></p><p>The seventeen emperors inwardly shouted: "Of course we want to live, who wants to die?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao turned to them and said, "As you may have guessed, I do have some connection to the Glorious Society, and I want to borrow their power to remove the imperial clan from their ruling position."</p><p></p><p>The seventeen emperors present were shaken to the core!</p><p></p><p>It was one thing to hear the rumors before, but another to hear the other party say it to their faces. They could sense the uncompromising tone in Suhao's words.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "Removing the imperial clan is not my goal, just a means to an end! By destroying the imperial clan that has ruled for over a thousand years, I can demonstrate my power. Then with that prestige, I seek the full cooperation of the Mage Association to help me complete a certain task, sparing no effort."</p><p></p><p>He candidly told them his plans and goals, hoping they would answer his questions truthfully in return.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Suhao's words, the seventeen emperors felt a tinge of panic rise within, accompanied by anger.</p><p></p><p>Their imperial clan, the world's supreme rulers, a noble race equal to the Creator - yet someone dared declare their intent to destroy them right to their faces!</p><p></p><p>Their supreme imperial clan was to become a mere tool for someone else to demonstrate their power?</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Emperor could no longer restrain himself, his face flushed with anger as he roared: "Audacious! Your plan is impossible to achieve! Even if you kill all of us here, it still cannot be done!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Then I'll not only kill you, but also everyone with imperial bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Another elderly white-bearded emperor also turned red, as if greatly insulted. Disregarding that his life was in the other's hands, he shook his head and declared loudly: "Your plan seems feasible but is fundamentally impossible. Your understanding of this world is too superficial!</p><p></p><p>You think the imperial clan rules the world? No, essentially the imperial clan is just a representative elected by the great families. The imperial clan is only the surface ruler - the real rulers are those unseen 'interest groups'!</p><p></p><p>You want to seek the Mage Association's full cooperation, but do you know the Mage Association's stake in these 'interest groups' is greater than all eighteen imperial clans combined? If you destroy the imperial clan, you're affecting the Mage Association's interests. Why would they then devote all efforts to help you complete your task?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "You make some sense, but my goal is to seek the Mage Association's cooperation, not undermine their interests. Clearing out the imperial clan is just demonstrating my power to gain the qualifications for cooperation - don't conflate the two.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there's also the intent to eliminate a nuisance. I dislike the imperial clan's conduct. If I don't destroy them, they'll hinder me for the next three hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao unmoved, that emperor continued, "The relationships are intricately intertwined, extremely complex, involving matters that could destabilize the world's lifeline. Don't take it lightly!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "But even if I don't act, this world is already doomed to destruction! What I aim to do is far more important than this so-called world's stable lifeline you speak of."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then stated, "Don't doubt my resolve. At most half a year, the imperial clan will vanish from this world. What I want to know now is whether you emperors choose to die with the imperial clan, or wish to live out your natural lives and enjoy your remaining days.</p><p></p><p>Let me be clear - if you want to die with the imperial clan, I can grant that wish today. If you want to live, you must cooperate with me unconditionally. Half a year later, you'll be free."</p><p></p><p>The Jia Emperor asked, "How do we cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Simple, give me the imperial clan's roster."</p><p></p><p>The Jia Emperor's pupils constricted as he couldn't help but take two steps back.</p><p></p><p>The elderly white-bearded emperor's face drained of color, swearing loudly: "Delusional thinking!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao glanced at him, "I understand your choice."</p><p></p><p>With that, he pointed a finger and a white beam shot out.</p><p></p><p>"Pffft!"</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded emperor's head suddenly burst open, red and white matter splattering all around, sprinkling the surrounding emperors' bodies and faces!</p><p></p><p>The emperors present were shaken to the core, their faces turning deathly pale as they instinctively retreated several steps away from the slowly toppling body of the white-bearded emperor.</p><p></p><p>They had not seen wrong - this youth calling himself Jia Wei was indeed a ruthless killer who would murder without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>But all the emperors realized that dealing with such a ruthless person was easier in a way. As long as...they obediently cooperated!</p><p></p><p>Suhao retracted his finger, smiling at the remaining emperors, "What about you?"</p>

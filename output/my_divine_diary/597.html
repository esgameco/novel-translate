        <h1>Chapter 597</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Seventeen Empire's mobilization of the 'Heavenly Calamity Cannon' was a secret operation, and there was no way for the Kouyao Society that had placed the roc, as well as Su Hao and the others, to know about it.</p><p></p><p>However, even if Su Hao learned of the news, he wouldn't care, he had wanted the Mage Association to bring out their strongest means, and then break it with an absolutely powerful force for later cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, one thing on the surface and one thing behind the scenes, this would annoy him to no end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the matter had already been handed over to Yashan to handle, and he also believed in Yashan's ability.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Su Hao stayed in the test base drumming up experiments about 'source transforming blood qi and spiritual energy' with great peace of mind, thinking to summarize the law of 'source transforming into specific substances' as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>As for Yashan, apart from taking out a little time every day to spend on studying the spiritual bands of fantasy mages, the rest of his energy was put into the building of the Light Shining Society, smoothly bypassing the Mage Association and taking over the administrative work of various cities, so that the cities that had fallen into a certain amount of turmoil after the royal family of the Hengxuan District had been blood-washed, would gradually return to order.</p><p></p><p>This process, the Mage Association of Hengxuan District acted as if they didn't see it, turning a blind eye and not interfering.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it caused the discontent of the other seventeen empires.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the Mage Association didn't want to intervene, but the scene of 100,000 mages being annihilated in an instant was right in front of their eyes, and no one dared to make a confrontation without understanding the Illumination Society's methods.</p><p></p><p>They weighed the pros and cons and realized that their own lives were more important.</p><p></p><p>And the wind became ......</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xing Ah Wang brought him to open the door to a new world, he had a new pleasure, and that was to search all over the world for a place to spend a good night.</p><p></p><p>He very much enjoyed going to a new city, visiting places in the city that were unknown to most people, and when he came across one he was satisfied with, he would hide a locator stone of his own for the next time he came back.</p><p></p><p>The result is that he prefers to visit new cities and find new excitement as opposed to coming back again.</p><p></p><p>On this day, after Feng Cheng had finished his chores and completed his corresponding study program, he failed to hold back his inner restlessness again and teleported away from the base small world to a large city.</p><p></p><p>He had come to this city a few days ago, and it was not his goal.</p><p></p><p>This period of time spent in the midst of the major cities had made him yearn for the world's largest metropolis, 'New Era City', to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Because it was rumored that there was one of the world's top clubs in New Era City, called the 'ZuoLe XianGong', in which there were countless treasures of all kinds, and as long as one had the money, one could stay there until one's youth was gone, and one's energy was dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The wind into the extreme yearning.</p><p></p><p>His goal tonight is to go to New Era City, looking for the so-called 'ZuoLe XianGong'.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that Xinji City was not far from here.</p><p></p><p>During this period of time, he had often explored outside, traveled to quite a few cities, met quite a few redheads, and boasted that he was also a person who had seen a lot of things. This was about to see what the so-called top clubs that were blown up to the sky were really like.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng came to Xin Ji City, money drove the way, very skillfully found the 'Zuo Le Xian Palace'.</p><p></p><p>This was not a clubhouse, but a castle!</p><p></p><p>The palace is distributed back to the shape, different heights, each with its own characteristics, but also opulent, green plants wigwam Xiaotan can be seen everywhere, exquisite fences are linked together, a variety of warm-colored lights reflecting, the water, grass, paths, green leaves, exudes a decadent atmosphere everywhere.</p><p></p><p>White powder walls painted with a variety of gestures of thousands of women, cool, dignified, gentle, delicate, bright, lively, charming ...... everything, will be the castle embellished with people's desire place.</p><p></p><p>Known as the 'Flower Hall' of the palace pavilion windows, there are all kinds of attitude of women standing by the window, eyebrows frequently looking out, seems to be waiting for, looking forward to something, let a person can not help but want to climb up the wall to ask the truth.</p><p></p><p>There is also the shadow reflected in the white curtains under the light of the house, which makes people think.</p><p></p><p>The entire 'ZuoLe Immortal Palace' was bustling with guests, all of them dressed in gorgeous clothes, wandering around in an endless stream, talking and laughing in twos and threes, looking for their favorite one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 'Flower Palace' is just one of the categories, the 'ZuoLe Immortal Palace' has more functions than that.</p><p></p><p>But the other functions would have nothing to do with Feng Cheng, the purpose of his coming here was the 'Flower Palace'.</p><p></p><p>He wandered through it, his eyes wide open, and couldn't help but sigh, "Rich people really know how to have fun, in the next couple of days, I will bring Ah Xing and Ah Wang here to take a stroll."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng turned around and thought the searching process was too slow, and he was an acute person, so he found a seat and sat down, closing his eyes, his powerful divine thoughts swept out and contracted within the 'Flower Palace', identifying his favorite ones one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss - this is good ah, pending! This one is also like, deposited into the knowledge station to be noted, wow, this one is also very good ...... Feng Cheng ah Feng Cheng, I did not expect you to change your heart so easily!"</p><p></p><p>Just let Feng Cheng did not expect is that this divine thought sweep over, all are like.</p><p></p><p>This makes him difficult to choose.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it, he suddenly realized a different plot.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--two girls!"</p><p></p><p>"They're still chatting, chatting so happily, I'm really curious about what they're chatting about? Why don't we use the Knowledge Platform Calculations to parse out what they're chatting about!"</p><p></p><p>Curiosity drove Feng Cheng to parse out what these two extremely talented girls were chatting about while interacting.</p><p></p><p>"Baby~ You're awesome~!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's a blessing for my little girl to be honored by you! I will definitely give you the best~ Your Majesty, you are so beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>"Baby your mouth is so sweet, uhm~o(*￣▽￣*)o well!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng exclaimed 'Crap exciting'!</p><p></p><p>Soon, Wind Cheng heard something different.</p><p></p><p>"You also have to thank the Illumination Society as well! Otherwise, how would this Emperor come to New Era City, and how would he recognize you, baby? After this matter is over, you return to the 'Liyuan District' with this Emperor! This emperor will appoint you as a favored concubine."</p><p></p><p>"Really ...... really? Your Majesty, you are willing to take in your little daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! This Emperor is true to his word."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty! However, when will the little woman be able to return with Your Majesty? When will the chaos of the Illuminati be resolved ......"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry baby, the Eighteen Empire Council has unanimously decided to utilize the 'Heavenly Calamity Cannon', and in less than two months, it will be able to completely annihilate the Light Flare Society. At that time, this Emperor will come back to take you away."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was surprised, "Natural Disaster Cannon? What is that, never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he sent a message in the group and asked, "Two bosses, have you heard of what a 'natural disaster cannon' is?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied, "Don't know."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng added, "I've heard that it's intended to be used against the Illuminati, so I don't know what it is!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Where did you hear that?"</p><p></p><p>Kazunari said, "Ahem! It's in the 'Zola Immortal Palace' in Shinki City, if Boss Asan is interested, I'll bring you here next time, it's very exciting~"</p><p></p><p>Yayama said, "No need! But it's not easy to find out what it is? Whoever said that, just bring them back and ask."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "That makes sense! Then wait a bit, Boss Yashan, I'll go and bring the people back."</p><p></p><p>The group stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>The woman who called herself 'This Emperor' seemed to be quite powerful, and the palace they were in was heavily guarded by a large number of security mages outside in addition to the room, not allowing anyone to approach at all.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not difficult for Feng Cheng, he casually set up a formation to conceal his figure, and then slowly activated the flash program, directly flashing into the other party's boudoir.</p><p></p><p>Seeing with one's own eyes is not the same as seeing with one's own eyes! It made Feng Cheng want to join their activities.</p><p></p><p>"Steady, steady, calm down, it's still important to get down to business!"</p><p></p><p>He quietly leaned forward, and with a 'Fixation Technique', he fixed the two hugging bodies together, along with the stunned expressions of the two of them, with only a little 'grunting' sound stifled between their throats, as if they were begging for help.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of sound at this time, no one would even notice that it was a cry for help.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng casually pulled off a bed sheet, casually wrapped it, tied a knot, picked up the two people, and slowly started the teleportation program again.</p><p></p><p>Three seconds later, Feng Cheng took the two women and teleported away, returning to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>The room that was originally filled with spring colors became empty.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng carried the two people and knocked open Yashan's lab with great gusto, then handed the two people up as if offering treasure and said, "Boss Yashan, I've brought the people back for you. Next so ask?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan looked at the two girls who were naked and hugging each other in a weird position, and was speechless for a moment, "......"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng saw the strange look in Yashan's eyes and looked suspiciously at the two women in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were horrified, but their whole body could not move, the thin sheet was completely unable to wrap the exposed spring light, comparing the scene in the laboratory, out of place.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng slapped his forehead and said: ''Damn! Forgot to bring their clothes back together!"</p>

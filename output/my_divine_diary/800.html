        <h1>Chapter 800</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo directly shook her head in refusal of Suhao's request: "You are still too young. Mastering soul power requires a very mature mind and a strong physique, which you are far from meeting the requirements for.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if I wanted to guide you now, I would have no way to do so. For our dragon tribe to master soul power, we need to return to Dragon Continent and hold an awakening ceremony before we can successfully grasp soul power.</p><p></p><p>Leian, my child. Do not be impatient. One day you will grow into an extremely powerful golden dragon. At that time, you can soar freely anywhere in the world. You will possess everything you want to know, but before then, it is enough for you to just have a keen curiosity and desire to explore this world. And I, your mother, will guard over your growth."</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked up at this dark red giant dragon, grinning: "Thank you Mother Shaduo. When will we return to Dragon Continent?"</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo glanced at Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli, then gazed at the distant mountains outside the cave: "When my children learn to fly, I will take you all back to Dragon Continent."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Mother Dragon Shaduo felt a bit of pressure raising and caring for the three dragon cubs alone. She also hoped to return to Dragon Continent as soon as possible to find her mate Muti and co-parent the three cubs.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the time of rapid growth for the cubs. Staying in the Cloud Valley Mountains ensured a sufficient food source to allow the three cubs to grow up sturdily. After returning to Dragon Continent, there were too many giant dragons, and food resources were not abundant, so it might not be possible to find enough food to feed the cubs.</p><p></p><p>Once the cubs' wings developed enough strength for long-distance flight, their food demands would not be too great. That would be the opportune time to return to Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>The already over 2-meter-long Suhao turned to look at his immature wings, flapping them twice. He found that relying solely on his wings, he did not know how long it would take before he could fly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it would be simple for him to fly, but more difficult for Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "It's not impossible though. I can take this time to calmly recover my strength. The analysis and reorganization of the giant dragon genes is expected to be completed in a few days. At that time, I can first evolve into a 'Minion'."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then responded to Mother Dragon Shaduo: "Okay, Mother Shaduo."</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Dragon Brother Chipu and Dragon Sister Moli were able to learn to speak in a similar fashion. The 'Language Soul' imported information into their minds, helping them understand many things and express simple meanings within just a few days.</p><p></p><p>For example, one day Dragon Brother Chipu opened his wings, wobbling as he ran in front of Suhao and called out: "Little brother!"</p><p></p><p>Then he was violently beaten by Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao corrected him: "Call me Third Brother or Leian, otherwise I'll hit you."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Brother Chipu called out "Third Brother" aggrievedly, then asked: "Why...why?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "I like it."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Brother Chipu racked his brain, trying hard to think, but he still could not figure out why Suhao would hit him.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon put this matter out of his mind, then looked at Suhao with anticipation: "Third Brother, come play."</p><p></p><p>Suhao stood up, grabbed Dragon Brother Chipu's tail, dragged him out of the hatching room, then casually tossed him next to Dragon Sister Moli: "I'm not interested in playing. Go find Moli to play with you!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao deeply regretted that the hatching room had no door, allowing these two cubs to come and go freely. More importantly, Dragon Brother Chipu never remembered the beatings, actively seeking out Suhao to get beaten every so often, and even showing a tendency to get more excited the more he was beaten...</p><p></p><p>Look at Dragon Sister Moli, she was much more well-behaved.</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao had praised Dragon Sister Moli for being well-behaved, she came running in with bright shining eyes and said to Suhao: "Little brother!"</p><p></p><p>Then she had an expression like she was waiting for Suhao to hit her.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "This golden dragon race...is not quite right!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Valley Mountains, a team of around a dozen people did simple disguises with their clothing, hiding in the jungle as they stealthily moved forward.</p><p></p><p>It was the Fugold squad that specialized in poaching dragon cubs to sell.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a nearly 5-meter long ferocious spotted tiger pounced out from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>This fierce tiger had clearly been lying in ambush for a long time, making no sound. When the group passed by, it launched a surprise attack from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful! It's a soul beast, the Demon Pattern Tiger Cat!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged pale-faced Geya, who was at the rear, reacted instantly when the tiger cat pounced out. His body twisted, a large sword appearing in his hand from behind his back.</p><p></p><p>He only had time to horizontally block the sword in front of himself before being tackled by the huge tiger cat.</p><p></p><p>However, he first curled his body into a ball, then rolled out from under the tiger cat, avoiding its descending fangs.</p><p></p><p>"Severing Flash!"</p><p></p><p>Among the group, the big-bearded Xibo reacted first, letting out a roar. Only a gray flash was seen.</p><p></p><p>"Pffft--"</p><p></p><p>An enormous cat head fell.</p><p></p><p>As blood spurted out, the tiger cat's huge body slowly toppled over.</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced middle-aged Geya said with lingering fear: "It's a good thing I reacted quickly, otherwise if it had bitten me, I would have died."</p><p></p><p>Viya immediately stepped forward, placing her hand on the fallen tiger cat's head on the ground. Closing her eyes, she concentrated for a moment, then curled her fingers outward.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of pale yellow mist was seen being pulled out from the cat's head, disappearing into the palm of her hand.</p><p></p><p>Viya then let out a moan, as if she had just finished an invigorating massage.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~"</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so men were shaken by her sweet moan.</p><p></p><p>Each of them thought to themselves: "This woman is really something, even more alluring than the ladies at the Golden Jade Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, none of them dared to try anything.</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo kicked the tiger's body with regret: "The fine fur of this Demon Pattern Tiger Cat is worth quite a bit of money. But it's not our target this trip, so bringing it would just be a burden. Let's bury and conceal it, then keep going!"</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the Fugold squad of around a dozen people finally climbed up a steep cliff, lying on the cliff top and panting heavily. This stretch of the journey was extremely rugged, with continuous climbing for several days that had utterly exhausted them.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Viya, the rest of the Fugold squad were all physically strong soul warriors, possessing powerful soul power within their bodies that could unleash tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>The reason they felt fatigued trekking through the mountains was because soul warriors recover soul power too slowly, so they were unwilling to casually use it. This journey relied almost entirely on physical strength.</p><p></p><p>But despite their currently sprawled and exhausted appearances, they could jump up at any time and unleash formidable combat power.</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo's muscular chest heaved like a bellows. He turned to the sexy Viya and said: "Viya, how about casting a soul technique to relieve our fatigue? Use that 'Fatigue Removal' one you have."</p><p></p><p>Viya looked much better than the others, just needing to catch her breath for a bit. Smiling, she said: "Let me correct you, that soul technique is called 'Ox Strength'. It allows me to have extreme endurance. So, are you planning to pay with favors or money for me to use this technique?"</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded man's mouth twitched, not wanting to speak.</p><p></p><p>Viya covered her mouth daintily and giggled: "You soul warriors look so stalwart and formidable, with remarkable martial prowess. Yet it's only been a few days and you can't take it anymore? Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced middle-aged Geya sat up: "Hey, underestimating us? You can come find me alone tonight and see if I can't take it. We soul warriors aren't just all talk."</p><p></p><p>Viya rolled her eyes: "Trying to take advantage of me again. I'm afraid that if I come to your door, you won't dare do anything to me. Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Geya grinned wryly, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>As Viya said, even if she came knocking on his door herself, he wouldn't dare do anything to her. If they were in the midst of passion and Viya, as a soul technician, made a move on him, that would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>After all, soul technicians were a group that could manipulate souls.</p><p></p><p>After recovering a bit, the big-bearded Xibo also sat up, unfolding a map and pointing to a location: "Our current position is here. Going further ahead is the area we previously circled as the giant dragon's nest location. Next, we'll disperse and hide in the high ground around the area, waiting to spot that red golden dragon's entry and exit routes to finally confirm the nest's location."</p><p></p><p>Then he turned seriously: "We've prepared for so long, and now it's time to reap the rewards. Stay focused, all of you. If anyone messes up and ruins this big score for the rest of us, don't blame my sword for showing no mercy."</p><p></p><p>The others lowered their voices replying: "Don't worry, Captain Xibo! This isn't our first time, we know what to do."</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo studied the map, making detailed personnel arrangements in pairs to designated observation points. Then with a wave of his hand, the Fugold squad members headed towards their assigned positions.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Viya, everyone else left this cliff top area.</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo then gathered some grass and leaves to cover himself and Viya, lying prone and quietly gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>He said: "At most two days, and we should be able to confirm the location of the dragon's nest. Heh, I really look forward to it!"</p><p></p><p>Turning to Viya, he said: "Viya, you rest first. I'll wake you up in eight hours to switch watch shifts."</p><p></p><p>Viya: "Will you take advantage of me while I'm asleep?"</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded man: "I'd rather spend the money we earn to find gentle, understanding ladies at the Golden Jade Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Viya pouted, clearly looking down on men who frequented the Golden Jade Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>One day later, a dark red giant dragon flew in from the distance, flying low between the mountain ranges, doing its utmost to conceal its movements.</p><p></p><p>But it was still spotted by the prepared Fugold squad keeping watch.</p><p></p><p>It was currently Viya's shift on lookout duty. Seeing the dragon, she confirmed it was the mother dragon they were waiting for and immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>She quietly approached the big-bearded Xibo, gently shaking him awake and pointing into the distance, keeping her voice low: "Quick, look! The red golden dragon we've been waiting for is back."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xibo instantly became alert, squinting his eyes to gaze into the distant mountains.</p>

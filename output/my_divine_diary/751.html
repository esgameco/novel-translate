        <h1>Chapter 751</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Joy is a common human emotion.</p><p></p><p>Who can remain silent after encountering an extremely fortuitous event?</p><p></p><p>When encountering something worth rejoicing over, he too would feel joyful, no matter how powerful he was, he could not avoid it.</p><p></p><p>But this was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>From this incident, Su Hao also confirmed that he was not simply a 'lifeless being' solely pursuing knowledge, he too could experience the range of emotions like ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>On most ordinary days, the reason he could maintain relative emotional calmness was because he had not encountered anything that made him particularly happy.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, his threshold for excitement had increased. Normally he would not have major emotional fluctuations, but in special circumstances, he would also experience intense fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Just like this time when he discovered the 'material information world', he was overjoyed to the point of ecstasy.</p><p></p><p>This joy was no less than when he first discovered the secrets of runes;</p><p></p><p>No less than when he successfully constructed the 'identification platform' and transformed matter into its source form...</p><p></p><p>The feeling of joy could last for an extremely long time, leaving him excited for several days before gradually calming down.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao feel pensive: "A powerful body, spirit and brain not only raised my threshold, but after gaining excitement, it also made it more lasting..."</p><p></p><p>Joyful emotions are contagious, and Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were infected by Su Hao's joy, losing interest in research and playing with Su Hao for a few days instead.</p><p></p><p>After racing cars, Su Hao and Ya Shan egged Feng Cheng on to start a livestream, and the two of them went wild gifting Feng Cheng with 'massive battleships' in the livestream chat.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan even made Feng Cheng's funny dance videos into all kinds of emote stickers and happily shared them in their group chat.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also suggested playing Chinese poker, wanting to win back through the game, but ended up with his face painted like a turtle...</p><p></p><p>In the end, Feng Cheng let out a despairing cry: "It's clearly a fair game, why can't I win?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After relaxing for a few days, Su Hao's heart calmed down again, returning to a state where he could delve into research.</p><p></p><p>His main body re-entered the life support chamber, controlling the [Eight-Armed God] to enter the experimental micro-world.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will fully master the 'material information world'!"</p><p></p><p>To what extent? Of course, to make the 'material information world' a part of his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>To the point where in this star system, as long as there was matter, he could sense it.</p><p></p><p>And be able to enter the 'material information world' anytime, anywhere!</p><p></p><p>Achieving this would not be easy, but Su Hao had great confidence.</p><p></p><p>"If the 'material information world' is truly as I imagine, a network produced by the distortion of space-time by matter, then the approach to study it would not be complicated."</p><p></p><p>He first gave the 'material information world' a more understandable name, calling it the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Then he immersed himself in the study of the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>His initial research approach was not complicated:</p><p></p><p>1. Analyze the material conditions for accessing the 'Planetary Network', such as whether small pieces of dream stone split from the Planet of Gods could access the 'Planetary Network'. What was the minimum volume required to access it? And why was this the case?</p><p></p><p>2. The information structure within the 'Planetary Network', how it manifested as specific scenarios in the human brain, and how the human brain obtained specific information from this vast network.</p><p></p><p>He could foresee that as long as he completed the analysis of these three points, he would not be far from being able to enter the 'Planetary Network' at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try first, how large a piece of dream stone allows me to access the 'Planetary Network'."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao randomly found a spot on the planet, entered the crust, and broke off a basketball-sized piece of dream stone.</p><p></p><p>Grasping this fragment of dream stone in his hand, neural tendrils spread out from his palm and tightly clung to the dream stone. He closed his eyes and carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he opened his eyes, casually tossing the dream stone fragment aside, and muttered: "Faint signals transmitted through nerve cells into the brain, but unable to enter the 'Planetary Network'."</p><p></p><p>He then knocked off a water tank-sized piece of dream stone.</p><p></p><p>No good, toss it!</p><p></p><p>Then a house-sized piece.</p><p></p><p>No good, toss it!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the pieces of dream stone Su Hao knocked off grew larger, the signals transmitted through the nerve cells into his brain grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Until he knocked off a piece of dream stone as large as a battleship, he finally succeeded in entering the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised him was that everything he saw in this 'Planetary Network' was extremely blurred, even the planet was distorted into bizarre shapes, let alone being able to view any information through this 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "It is indeed related to volume, just like the quality of a network cable affecting signal transmission. Smaller pieces of dream stone may receive very weak signals, to the point of being unable to enter the complete, clear 'Planetary Network'."</p><p></p><p>He set this huge piece of dream stone aside.</p><p></p><p>He re-entered the crust and knocked off a mountain-sized piece of dream stone...</p><p></p><p>He brought the mountain-like blue crystal out of the ground, then placed his hand on it.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he opened his eyes: "It became clearer again. Keep going!"</p><p></p><p>Until Su Hao excavated a piece of dream stone with a diameter of ten kilometers, forcibly digging it out from under the crust.</p><p></p><p>The entire 'Planetary Network' finally became clear!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "It's related to volume, but volume is just the surface, to be precise, it's related to some underlying principle, what could it be? Some special energy in the dream stone, or the gravitational waves brought about by the massive volume, or the degree of space-time distortion..."</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao pondered this.</p><p></p><p>At the human observation station stationed on the Planet of Gods, an observer noticed changes in the observation data and couldn't help but think: "Huh? Could it be an earthquake?"</p><p></p><p>He quickly pulled up the data to locate the source, then accessed the satellite video, continuously zooming in to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>When he saw clearly what was happening in the video, his mouth gradually opened wide, staring in astonishment. He couldn't help but call out to his companion: "A Zhong, come quick and see this supernatural being!"</p><p></p><p>The man named A Zhong was stunned when he heard this, puzzled: "Supernatural being?"</p><p></p><p>Then he got up and walked over to the observer, looking at the screen. Soon he too was dumbstruck, his eyes filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>After watching, he couldn't help but swear: "Holy shit!"</p><p></p><p>What did they see? A tiny human forcibly pulling out an enormously large blue crystal from underground...</p><p></p><p>It looked like a tiny ant moving a spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Was this even possible? It seemed completely impossible...</p><p></p><p>If the intelligent system didn't automatically identify the human form, they might not have even noticed that tiny human figure.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's actions of moving the blue crystal were too dramatic, not only noticed by these two, but also seen by many others.</p><p></p><p>Including some of the mushroom people who had entered the stargazing world on reconnaissance missions, they too witnessed Su Hao's actions.</p><p></p><p>Then all these people were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The level of shock was the same as when Su Hao dug a hole on the Eight-Armed clan's colony planet and directly pierced through the crust.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly dig out a blue crystal stone with a diameter of ten kilometers from underground, what a concept!</p><p></p><p>Difficult!</p><p></p><p>After all, many people felt that detonating a bomb was quite simple, right?</p><p></p><p>But to move such an enormously large crystal stone out from underground, this was beyond people's imagination.</p><p></p><p>Everyone who witnessed this scene could not believe their own eyes and rubbed them repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, multi-angle videos of Su Hao excavating the blue crystal were transmitted back to Bluelight and went viral on the internet.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! A mysterious man spotted on the Planet of Gods doing unimaginable things!"</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! A mysterious man shouldered an enormously huge asteroid!"  </p><p></p><p>"Shocking! The legendary immortal appears on the Planet of Gods, immensely powerful and able to move mountains and rivers."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of eye-catching headlines emerged.</p><p></p><p>Then someone with sharp eyes circled the human figure and noted: "Why does this person look so much like 'Divine Xu Shiqiang'?"</p><p></p><p>Then a bunch of people chimed in: "Now that you mention it, he really does look alike, could it be Divine Xu Shiqiang himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Verified with my super alloy eyes, it is Xu Shiqiang, confirmed!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this video real or fake? Is this even something a human could do? It's just absurd..."</p><p></p><p>"There are a total of twenty-three cameras that captured this scene from different angles, professional analysis confirms the video is real."</p><p></p><p>"The strongest superhuman, simply terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I'm completely dumbfounded right now."</p><p></p><p>"I'm dumbfounded too, I can't help but feel this world is not quite right, is the world we live in really the real world? Could it be something like a brain in a vat..."</p>

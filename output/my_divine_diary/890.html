        <h1>Chapter 890</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Regarding this group of deities, Su Hao had not paid much attention to them for a long time, basically leaving them in a free-range state.</p><p></p><p>Although he would occasionally step in to discipline them, he really didn't understand much about what specific things this group of deities was doing.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't have the hobby of staring at the group chat of the deities all day long either.</p><p></p><p>But now when he took a look, he was surprised by the deities' operations.</p><p></p><p>"This group of deities actually came up with a method of 'artificially controllable misfortune' to help travelers overcome misfortune, and from their plan, it even seems quite feasible. These deities are capable, each one a rare talent."</p><p></p><p>After understanding this, Su Hao couldn't help but mock the nearly thousand travelers who had died before: "With eighteen such dedicated deities taking such good care of you, you all died so quickly, you're too incompetent. If I had such enthusiastic deities helping me back then, why would I have died so many times? I would have taken off long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Su Hao concealed his form and went to the airspace above the Cong siblings, observing their actions from above.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have reached the final stage of the misfortune outbreak. I might as well stay here for a few days and experience the changes in luck waves and surrounding energy before and after the misfortune outbreak. At the same time, I can see if this 'artificial misfortune' is really feasible and how one can successfully get through it."</p><p></p><p>The misfortune at the five-hundred-year stage was nothing to him. Even if he was made to travel to another world now, he could easily get through it.</p><p></p><p>This was simply because ever since he obtained the power of blood vigor and runes, he could acquire sufficient power for self-protection at the fastest speed after reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>When danger arrived, he could simply crush everything with the power in his hands.</p><p></p><p>But obviously these new travelers did not possess this ability to grow rapidly, and on top of that, their senses for impending danger were not sharp enough.</p><p></p><p>Only those with steadfast, calm, and composed minds, the true experts, had the ability to grow.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao also had enough patience to wait for the right person to be born.</p><p></p><p>While observing the Cong siblings' actions, Su Hao's mind began to wander, thinking most about one question: "The energy of the misfortune system locks onto the focal point of the luck wave, accumulates, and then feeds back to act on the focal point, destroying it.</p><p></p><p>But then the question arises, why can the misfortune merge with the 'artificial misfortune' constructed by the deities?</p><p></p><p>In theory, the feedback from the misfortune system takes some time, and this period is not fixed. So how can the deities determine the timing of the misfortune system to perfectly connect the 'artificial misfortune' to the feedback misfortune energy?"</p><p></p><p>But soon he realized the key: "I understand now, the reason for the connection is 'change'.</p><p></p><p>The deities cannot accurately pinpoint when the misfortune will feed back. They only know the approximate time, so they created an extended 'dangerous event'. When the energy feeds back, it will naturally act on this dangerous event, completing the impact on the focal point.</p><p></p><p>And when the energy feeds back, the deities observing at all times will be able to detect signs of the impending misfortune from the surrounding clues, thereby determining the timing of the 'final battle'."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao couldn't help but smile slightly: "These deities are smarter than I expected, and their execution is not bad either. With proper cultivation, they should be quite useful."</p><p></p><p>As for why the misfortune system would follow the 'dangerous event' to act on the focal point, Su Hao was still pondering...</p><p></p><p>Whether he could figure it out or not depended on fate.</p><p></p><p>Besides, he hadn't even understood how the misfortune system operated, so this knowledge was clearly beyond the scope.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At dusk, Cong Shuxing was panting heavily, holding a bloodstained dagger as she ran to a large warehouse door. With a casual slash, she cut off the lock chain and slipped inside, finding a dark corner to hide.</p><p></p><p>"Huff puff..."</p><p></p><p>She tried hard to calm her breathing and heartbeat, allowing herself to settle down and be in the best state to confront the enemy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she squinted her eyes to observe the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>This was a flour warehouse on the east side of the small town, filled with many tall wooden grain barrels about three meters high, requiring four or five adults to fully embrace.</p><p></p><p>There were many such grain barrels in the warehouse. One could disappear from sight by slipping in and turning a couple of corners.</p><p></p><p>A streak of white on one of the barrels caught her attention. She pinched a bit and brought it close to examine.</p><p></p><p>"This is... flour? It seems this is a warehouse for storing flour, but it looks like it has been emptied out. Only these wooden barrels and some flour dust remain on the ground that's hard to collect."</p><p></p><p>She thought: "Should I hide inside a wooden barrel?"</p><p></p><p>But she quickly shook her head. Although hiding inside a barrel would conceal her well, once discovered, she would have no room for resistance. She wasn't used to being cornered.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the safe spots the system explored and provided, with a 35% survival rate. Didn't expect it to be a granary. Looking at the layout here, it is indeed quite complex. I can make use of my agility, and be able to calmly deal with any thief."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I utilize the environment well and don't let more than two thieves surround me..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I didn't expect these thieves to be so formidable. I almost fell into their hands earlier. Luckily my lightness skill is solid, and I narrowly escaped."</p><p></p><p>"The mission requires me to kill all members of the thief gang, with a reward of 500 merit points. It seems to be the final mission. But relatively, the danger has increased exponentially. One careless mistake and I might perish! The merit points are tempting, but my life is more important. I'll run if I can later, and absolutely not recklessly fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>She stood up and slowly walked among the wooden barrels to familiarize herself with the environment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she heard a light laugh coming from outside the warehouse: "I smell her sweet scent, she must be hiding inside, hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be rash, don't underestimate her small size, her strength is extraordinarily great, and she's extremely agile too. Be careful or you might fall to her."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, watch out for each other, be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing frowned as she carefully listened: "Oh no, from the sounds, there are at least eight people. All the thieves have come after me? I remember only four were chasing me earlier. Dealing with three was already difficult, eight and I'm definitely dead."</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to sneak out from the small opening at the back, she turned around and bumped into a figure, her heart skipping a beat as she was startled: "Who can approach me so silently without me detecting it at all? Danger!"</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, she fiercely slashed out with her dagger.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound rang out in the dim warehouse.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, her opponent was also caught off guard, swinging a blade back at her. The two blades collided head-on, spraying a few sparks of fire.</p><p></p><p>The clash was fruitless, and both immediately retreated, staring intently at each other.</p><p></p><p>The person in front... seemed so familiar.</p><p></p><p>After the two saw each other's faces, they were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Gail?"</p><p></p><p>"Tali?"</p><p></p><p>Then the two said in unison: "What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>They both confirmed the other was their brother/sister.</p><p></p><p>Next, they looked at the blades in each other's hands, and in that instant, they thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, they spoke the same words again: "How did you end up here?"</p><p></p><p>The two fell into silence, their minds in a mess.</p><p></p><p>'About my brother/sister having a hidden identity as an expert?'</p><p></p><p>Footsteps came from outside as members of the thief gang entered.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing's expression changed as she said: "Let's leave here first before talking."</p><p></p><p>With that, she took the lead and ran towards the small opening she had spotted earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was quick, grabbing Cong Shuxing's collar and pulling her back. At that moment, a cold ray slashed down right in front of where Cong Shuxing had been.</p><p></p><p>If not for Cong Renfei's pull, Cong Shuxing might have met her demise.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing felt a lingering fear too.</p><p></p><p>The deities watching the whole scene had their hearts in their mouths, as if that slash had struck them.</p><p></p><p>"Can't run now!" Cong Shuxing instantly judged the current situation, then glanced back, "This brother Gail seems to have some skills. Perhaps if we team up, we have a chance of winning. If so, let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>She let out a light shout, her footsteps light as she kicked up a cloud of dust, charging towards the thieves in front.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei didn't hesitate either, following right behind her.</p><p></p><p>The two coordinated, their blades slashing high and low at the thieves.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>Two cold rays flashed by.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>"Puh!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing's initial attack was blocked, but Cong Renfei's follow-up slash made it through, opening a long gash across the thief's chest that instantly dyed his clothes red with blood.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The thief clutched his chest and staggered back, collapsing against a wooden barrel and sitting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing was about to go in for the kill when she realized the other thieves had caught up. She instinctively sheathed her blade and fled.</p><p></p><p>With his chest nearly slashed open, temporarily losing his combat ability, there was no need to take the risk of a follow-up attack.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei did the same, the siblings both instinctively choosing the same course of action.</p><p></p><p>So the thieves ended up chasing the two siblings around the warehouse in circles, playing a game of cat and mouse.</p><p></p><p>If they happened to run into an enemy with no way to escape, they would briefly cross blades before fleeing in another direction.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the entire warehouse was in an uproar, filled with swirling dust everywhere...</p><p></p><p>And in the process of fleeing, the two siblings inevitably suffered injuries of varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>The deities observing through the soul network were on the edge of their seats.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Barry even urgently said: "Enough, quickly quickly, activate the final plan. The two world wills have lost too much blood and grown too weak. They can't hold on much longer."</p><p></p><p>The Radiant God Yi also stared intently at the current scene and nodded: "Okay, initiate the final plan."</p><p></p><p>As Yi finished speaking, the two siblings heard a 'ding dong' sound in the depths of their consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Successfully killed one thief, reward one draw. Draw now?"</p><p></p><p>It was the thief they had just killed. The two siblings were overjoyed: "Draw immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Ding! Congratulations on obtaining a one-time high-efficiency shield, lasting thirty seconds. It has been stored in your personal space."</p><p></p><p>A thirty-second high-efficiency shield, enough for them to withstand the thieves' blades and kill two more.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they immediately took it out and chose to use it!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a green shield materialized out of thin air, enveloping the two siblings.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to turn back and fight desperately,</p><p></p><p>A thief raised his long sword with a laugh: "Got you little rabbits! Watch my awakened soul technique, 'Flame Blade'!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, flames ignited on the long sword.</p><p></p><p>What no one expected was that the flames instantly spread from the sword, igniting the flour dust in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>An explosion rocked the warehouse, blasting it apart.</p><p></p><p>The flames and shockwave consumed everything inside.</p><p></p><p>The deities let out a sigh of relief and cheered: "Success!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, look quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The deities turned their attention back to the two siblings, and what they saw made their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>The two siblings had been blown out of the warehouse, and their shield had already dissipated. At this moment, a huge beam was hurtling straight towards them, coincidentally one beam per person.</p><p></p><p>In their weakened state, being struck by one of those would likely be fatal.</p><p></p><p>The deities: "!!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the deities were despairing, the two siblings seemed to notice their predicament too, and calmly rolled inwards...</p><p></p><p>"Thump!"</p><p></p><p>They successfully dodged the impact!</p><p></p><p>The deities stared at this scene, unconsciously praising: "These are the best world wills I've guided. They can even dodge on their own? Unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>And in outer space, Su Hao suddenly opened his eyes with a smile: "The changes in the luck wave before and after a misfortune outbreak, as well as the surrounding energy fluctuations, are truly interesting."</p>

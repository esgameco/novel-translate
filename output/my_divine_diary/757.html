        <h1>Chapter 757</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was gazing into the distant galaxy, lost in thought, Feng Cheng sent a message in the group: "Two bosses, it seems the Octopus Monster has attacked again."</p><p></p><p>"I heard from the captain that this time they've organized over a billion warships, coming ferociously, as if wanting to wipe out all of humanity in one go!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the message, Su Hao flashed back to the small world and casually asked, "They're here?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "I heard they've arrived at the outskirts of the human star domain. Humans have organized counterattacks several times. At first, they fought back and forth, but in the end, humans suffered heavy losses and escaped back through the transmission formations."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Octopus Monster has also mastered the 'energy burst wave' and can shoot farther than humans."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of overall strength, humans are no match for the Octopus Monster's warships at this point."</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't been long, but the colonies and bases occupied before have been taken back..."</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race attacked the human star domain simultaneously from all sides, gradually encroaching inward and compressing humanity's strategic space.</p><p></p><p>A few areas could withstand the Eight-Armed attacks or annihilate their fleets, but most areas collapsed under the massive Eight-Armed warship assaults.</p><p></p><p>Overall, humans were at an absolute disadvantage again.</p><p></p><p>The disadvantage stemmed partly from the technology gap, but mainly because human warships were too few compared to the Eight-Armed Race.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the infrastructure gap was too wide, severely limiting production capacity. Even with all-out warship production over the years, the numbers couldn't be raised.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed had over a billion large warships, while humans had less than a million at most, which couldn't make up for the numerical difference even with various bases...</p><p></p><p>To defeat a larger force, human technology needed to surpass the Eight-Armed by a whole level.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, humans didn't have that capability.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Don't underestimate the Octopus Monster's research ability. After all, they spread across the entire cloud ring system through their own efforts, so they can't be simple."</p><p></p><p>"In such an environment, it's not easy to cultivate researchers with strong independent innovation abilities."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan agreed: "Indeed, the overall environment is very important. Humans have only recently had some soil for independent research over the past few years. It would take at least two hundred years to cultivate a large number of people with independent R&D capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng thought for a moment and tried to offer a solution: "Old Master Wei, all the 'energy burst waves' humans used to attack energy blocks have been gradually cracked by the Eight-Armed Race."</p><p></p><p>"They seem to have a special instrument that collects and analyzes fluctuations, allowing them to quickly crack human wave weapons during battle and upgrade their warships."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, it won't be easy to drive back the Eight-Armed fleets this time."</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Wei, how about this? I'll personally help humans research new wave fluctuation weapons to update their equipment."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, I'll control two thousand [Eight-Armed Gods] and scatter them to blast the Eight-Armed warships one by one!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng had been taken out by Eight-Armed warships many times before, so he disliked them. Plus, he was partial to humans, so he didn't want the situation to continue developing like this.</p><p></p><p>Because at this rate, the territory humans had painstakingly expanded could very well be lost in a few decades.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difficulty was that without outside help, it seemed extremely difficult for humans to defeat the Eight-Armed Race under the current circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because the Eight-Armed had too many warships that were too scattered, and the previous 'energy burst waves' used to clear Eight-Armed warships had lost their effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Feng Cheng found it difficult to deal with the numerous scattered fleets.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Feng Cheng, Ya Shan's eyes lit up, as if he found the idea of controlling a large group of [Eight-Armed Gods] to fight very interesting. He said, "That sounds good. If that's the case, I'll join in too. I can control three thousand [Eight-Armed Gods]..."</p><p></p><p>The corner of Su Hao's mouth twitched: "You guys just want to play around! The Eight-Armed Race has over a billion warships. You two only have five thousand [Eight-Armed Gods] combined. Divided up, each of your [Eight-Armed Gods] would have to destroy tens of thousands of warships. Can you handle that?"</p><p></p><p>"As for wanting to eliminate such a vast number of Eight-Armed, your method is too slow and only treats the symptoms, not the root cause."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you destroy all those Eight-Armed warships, with their powerful manufacturing capabilities, they could pull out another massive fleet in a few decades. It would be a constant headache."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at each other, curious: "Then what should we do, Old Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Cut off the Octopus Monster's roots directly. Let's go find the Xia Qing military leader."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qing saw Su Hao, he was as overjoyed as seeing his closest kin, almost unwilling to let go of Su Hao's hand.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Leader, don't worry too much. Do as I say, and they will be completely annihilated very soon."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing noticed the words "completely annihilated" from Su Hao's mouth.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't think too much of it, because he was all too clear about the current situation. What he wanted most now was a way to resolve the crisis.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Su Hao finished speaking, he readily agreed: "Great Qiang, we'll do whatever you say."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Can humans operate the Eight-Armed warships?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing immediately said, "With some simple modifications, we can use them."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Do humans have enough manpower to pilot the warships?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing looked uncertainly at the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain spoke up: "Anyone who has graduated from high school has received warship piloting training. We can gather them, give them some basic training with a few veterans to lead, and they'll have no problem piloting warships."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Okay! Here are the three things you need to do next:"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was instantly alert and listened intently.</p><p></p><p>"First, immediately produce as many 'insect-killing cubes' as possible, the more the better."</p><p></p><p>"Second, prepare a large amount of transmission formation materials capable of transmitting large warships, the more the better. Also, be prepared to receive a large number of Eight-Armed warships and get ready for modifications."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao finished and looked around, asking, "Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded: "Just...just that?"</p><p></p><p>They couldn't figure out how those things alone could defeat over a billion Eight-Armed warships.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everyone felt the icy, terrifying aura emanating from Ya Shan and couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>They instinctively retreated in their minds: "Damn...this aura is too freaking terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Then they said in unison: "We understand!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Ya Shan's expression soften.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Since you understand, then do it! The faster you get it done, the faster the crisis will be resolved."</p><p></p><p>With that, he transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also left afterward.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at the terrified human leaders and revealed an amusing expression: "Heh heh, Old Master Ya Shan is like that, getting rough at the slightest provocation. You don't need to mind him. Just do as instructed, and you won't go wrong."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he also transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>Back in the small world, Feng Cheng followed behind Ya Shan, full of admiration: "Old Master Ya Shan, the way you exuded that aura just now and scared those people, it was too awesome."</p><p></p><p>"Is there any trick to it? Teach me, I want to learn too! Just think about being able to make people retreat with a single glance, how cool would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed lightly: "What trick could there be? I was serious. If they continued to disrespect Old Master Wei, I would have beaten them all up."</p><p></p><p>"What status do those people have? Don't they know it's their greatest honor that Old Master Wei is willing to help them?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly understood: "I see, I get it now, Old Master Ya Shan. Next time, let me try it and see if my gaze works."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled: "Sure!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao and the others left, Xia Qing and the other high officials all breathed a sigh of relief, as if a huge weight had been lifted from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, able to see the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Never had they imagined that a person's gaze could be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was extremely steadfast in mind and spirit, yet they were truly frightened.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xia Qing took a deep breath and said, "Everyone, although we don't understand the purpose of doing this, let's just do it!"</p><p></p><p>The others nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, at least they could confirm that Xu Shiqiang was human, and that was enough.</p>

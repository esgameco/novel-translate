        <h1>Chapter 997</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Treating the pinball space as a giant's brain, Suhao devised a plan to construct a special giant's body, which he called the 'Giant Project'.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not mean that Suhao abandoned his previous 'Reincarnation Positioning Plan' after coming up with the Giant Project. He planned to carry out both projects simultaneously, as completing either one would achieve his goal.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the Giant Project would take a relatively shorter time, while the Reincarnation Positioning Plan would take much longer.</p><p></p><p>After finalizing the design, Suhao quickly began the specific manufacturing work for the 'Giant Project'.</p><p></p><p>According to his calculations, making a simple 'eye' would not be too difficult or time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>The hard part was capturing matter, because in reality, matter in the universe was also extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>Only when the pinball space moved to a location with matter would he have the opportunity to try.</p><p></p><p>And this required a long wait.</p><p></p><p>However, this was much easier than the pinball space carrying him through reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Based on past experience, roughly every ten to fifty years, the pinball space would occasionally arrive above a planet, briefly linger, and then disappear and transfer away through some inexplicable means.</p><p></p><p>This brief period was probably only one to five seconds, but for Suhao, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pinball space, Suhao connected the pinball eye he had made to a consciousness information, then exited the pinball space and asked a nervous-looking short-haired man in front of him, "Kim Soo-bum, close your eyes and try to perceive, then tell me what you see?"</p><p></p><p>Kim Soo-bum was an experimental subject that Suhao had brought from Yashan to specifically test the 'eye' and 'ear' of the Giant Project. The requirement for this experimental subject was to be articulate and able to accurately describe visuals.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a name, Suhao knew nothing about this experimental subject, as to him this person was no different from other experimental subjects, and being able to call out a name was already good enough.</p><p></p><p>However, based on Yashan's character, he had probably brought a prisoner. Of course, given Suhao's requirement for strong expressive ability, there was also a possibility that this person was a great writer.</p><p></p><p>Following Suhao's instructions, Kim Soo-bum closed his eyes to perceive, and after a moment, opened them with an astonished expression and stammered, "Mr. Javey, I...I saw an amazing scene, but I don't know how to describe it. It's like...a deep yet bright, clear yet distorted, vast yet hazy starry sky. This amazing starry sky changes every few seconds, interspersed with a hazy curtain of nothingness, like a computer screensaver constantly switching..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao understood that his 'pinball eye' had preliminarily succeeded - the consciousness could now observe the scenes outside the pinball space through this newly built-in eye at any time.</p><p></p><p>But he was not satisfied with just this. Since he planned to build a giant, then this so-called eye must possess all the functions of a real eye.</p><p></p><p>He pondered and said, "Is that all? Try to see if it's possible to naturally adjust the focus point like a normal eye and concentrate on observing different locations."</p><p></p><p>Kim Soo-bum tried again, then shook his head and said, "It's not working, Mr. Javey. All the details of the image are mapped into my brain. It won't fade other areas just because my attention is focused on one spot."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I understand."</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it was passively receiving all the picture information, but unable to actively focus and choose, unable to highlight the key points, and insensitive to changes in the image.</p><p></p><p>Solving this problem was not difficult, and he quickly came up with many improvement plans. He went back into the pinball space to modify it.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, after Kim Soo-bum closed his eyes to perceive for a moment, he opened them with even more astonishment and said, "Mr. Javey, the scene I see is extremely clear, as if I truly have an invisible yet powerful eye that allows me to freely focus and observe within this vast starry sky image. Most importantly, now with just a glance, I have a sense of 'far' and 'near'."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Very good, it seems our experiment is progressing smoothly."</p><p></p><p>He then asked Kim Soo-bum some more questions about vision, and said, "Then let's proceed to the next test."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Suhao completely disconnected the pinball eye from Kim Soo-bum's consciousness information, and asked, "How do you feel now?"</p><p></p><p>Kim Soo-bum carefully perceived, then frowned and said, "I can't sense anything."</p><p></p><p>"And your mental state?"</p><p></p><p>"There's a sense of emptiness, not being able to see that starry sky image, a feeling of loss as if I had a million fortunes that vanished in an instant. There's also some mental fatigue and drowsiness...that's not quite accurate either, because I can still feel that a weight that was pressing on my mind has been lifted."</p><p></p><p>While Kim Soo-bum was expressing this, Suhao observed his consciousness information and did not detect any abnormalities, meaning the pinball eye did not cause any serious damage to the consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "The first giant organ is done. Now it can simply observe the outside through the pinball eye. Next, start making the second organ, the ear."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and fifteen years went by in a blink of an eye. </p><p></p><p>Suhao was conducting experiments on capturing matter when suddenly his gaze focused as he thought, "The pinball space has arrived above a planet. I can try capturing matter now."</p><p></p><p>He was not particularly nervous or excited, as he had anticipated this moment long ago and had already set up an automatic matter-capturing program, so he didn't have to worry about missing it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao returned to the pinball space and connected his consciousness information to the pinball eye to observe the situation outside the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>A dim yellow scene instantly mapped into his mind, like a hawk overlooking a vast land.</p><p></p><p>From this scene, the pinball space had indeed arrived at a planet, but was flying in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Suhao frowned slightly, "If it hasn't entered underground, then I can only try to capture some gaseous matter."</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as the thought arose, the pinball eye's view rapidly descended underground.</p><p></p><p>The preset program immediately activated, radiating a special force field wave from the inside out to attract and adhere matter.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a large amount of matter surrounding the area the pinball space passed through was attracted and adhered, tightly following the pinball space and compressing into a mass, forming a huge matter cluster that rapidly passed through the interior of this planet like flowing sand.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it went, matter was shattered and adhered, with no obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "Success!"</p><p></p><p>After briefly lingering on this planet, the pinball space seemed to encounter a new gravitational force and disappeared from its original location, heading to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>The large amount of matter that had adhered around the pinball space scattered after losing the pinball space's attractive wave force.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "Failure!"</p><p></p><p>Success in that the pinball space could capture matter, failure in that the pinball space could not take the captured matter away with it.</p><p></p><p>If it could not take the matter away, then even if a giant was built, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Because such a giant's brain would run away on its own...</p><p></p><p>There were two solutions: find a way for the pinball space to take the matter with it, or have the pinball space stay behind.</p><p></p><p>Either way, the difficulty was enormously high.</p><p></p><p>Suhao watched as the pinball space arrived at another location, and slowly calmed down, thinking, "As expected, it's not that simple. But I had anticipated this, and the first step of adhering matter has proven feasible. I need to carefully think about how to make the pinball space take the matter away, or make the pinball space stop."</p><p></p><p>"So, how should I do it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao guessed that the operating mode of the pinball space was like a small ball floating on the water's surface, moving with the rising and falling waves - sometimes sinking into the water and being carried away by undercurrents, sometimes bouncing out of the water and blown to another location by raging winds.</p><p></p><p>Underwater was the material world that Suhao was aware of, while above water was the non-material world that Suhao knew nothing about. The pinball space was like a special floating object, coming and going along this water surface boundary.</p><p></p><p>Could such a small ball stop?</p><p></p><p>In theory, it was possible. If it grew a pair of wings, it could fly in the sky. If it took on the shape of a fish, it could swim in the water. Otherwise, it could only be carried away by the surging waves to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the appearance of the pinball space and his mouth twitched. "I can't even find the boundary of the pinball space, let alone reshape it into the form of a fish. With my current abilities, the most I can do is modify the information structure inside the pinball space. I can't do anything else, as I myself am just a piece of information."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Suhao thought, "Among everything I know, the most special is the 'source' - it's an intermediate product between matter and energy. Perhaps the unique nature of the source could allow it to leave with the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Another is spirit energy, a parasitic material. Perhaps spirit energy could complete the parasitism on the outer surface of the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>I can try using these two things to make the outer body of the giant. As long as one of them works, then it's a success."</p><p></p><p>If neither worked, he might have to try every known material...</p><p></p><p>What if one of them succeeded in adhering?</p><p></p><p>With a foothold, all problems could be solved.</p><p></p><p>"The next step is to design a corresponding program to try and convert some matter into the source within the two seconds that the pinball space makes contact with matter - another high-precision operation."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Suhao contacted Yashan and Feng Cheng, "Yashan, Feng Cheng, has the unknown material exploration experiment group you established made any new breakthroughs?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 567</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This ability named 'Let's Be Friends' by the association, as Zhipeng's secret, he didn't want to reveal it to others. However, for some reason, when facing Suhao, he couldn't help but tell him involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that this Mr. Jia Wei in a crystal armor had a special charm that made people unconsciously trust him.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng thought, it must be one of Mr. Jia Wei's bizarre abilities!</p><p></p><p>More powerful and unresolvable than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Just like the rumors, after casually chatting for more than two hours, Zhipeng's ability would activate, making the other person become his good friend, even Zhipeng himself didn't know how to undo it.</p><p></p><p>However, the condition for activating the ability was not just chatting for two hours. It could also activate in less than two hours, as long as the person was moved by the stories Zhipeng told and had emotional fluctuations to a certain extent, they would become his good friend.</p><p></p><p>If one knew about it, they could be on guard. If not, it was easy for them to be exploited and become his friend.</p><p></p><p>What could a friend do? A lot. The word 'friend' sometimes meant more than just a companion. Under Zhipeng's ability, the meaning of 'friend' was severely distorted. His friends could even take a blade for him. The key was that after taking the blade, they would still think it was natural - taking a blade, isn't that what a friend should do?</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "Do your friends know they are being controlled by your ability?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng felt a bit embarrassed by this question. After thinking for a while, he shook his head and said, "I'm not very clear about this. I can't understand their mental state. On the surface, they seem normal, except that they treat me as a friend. It's just that friendship is given the top priority in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>What people value most in their hearts is different, but there are always some differences in the degree to which they value different things. For example, some people value freedom more than life, some value love more than freedom, and some value money more than love...</p><p></p><p>There is always a priority, and for those affected by Zhipeng's ability, after a strange substitution, the thing they value most is 'friendship', which has become the top priority, to the extent that they can even sacrifice their lives for it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked again, "Does this ability have a limit on the number of people?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng shook his head and said, "I'm not sure, but so far I haven't felt any sense of reaching a limit. However, I vaguely sense that there should be no limit, because after my ability takes effect, the people affected and I don't have any necessary connection, they are just ordinary friends, just like..."</p><p></p><p>He frowned, trying to find an analogy, but couldn't think of an example no matter how hard he tried. Perhaps this was because he didn't study language well enough before!</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng widened his eyes in delight, "Yes, yes, that's the feeling."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "If that's really the case, then there should be no limit. Have you ever thought about turning everyone in the world into your friend?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was astonished, "This...this is unrealistic."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Actually, you don't need to turn everyone into your friend. A small portion would be enough, not many, the first phase is estimated to be ten thousand people."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng's mouth gaped open, "Ten thousand...if I chat with one person for two hours, ten thousand people would take twenty thousand hours..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Who told you to talk to them one by one? Who said you need two hours for each person? There are plenty of touching stories that can win people over in just ten minutes.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't your Illuminati want to get rid of all the royal families? With just you few people, it's impossible. You need to spend more time making more talented friends and form a truly massive, well-organized group that acts in an orderly and planned manner.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand people is just the number needed for the first phase. If you want to completely replace the royal families in the Horizontal Region, you'll need at least a hundred thousand people with certain abilities to help you.</p><p></p><p>By the way, you're not planning to just kill the royal family members and leave it at that, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng said embarrassedly, "Originally, that was indeed the plan, like assassins randomly selecting royal residences for massacres until all the royal families were killed. But Mr. Jia Wei, other than that, what else do I need to manage?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head vigorously, "There's a lot more you need to manage. It's hard to explain everything to you right now. Don't rush to get rid of the royal families, as it's not something that can be done in a year or two. Your first step should be to increase the number of your friends."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Suhao smiled and said, "As for how to increase your friends, I need to understand more about your ability first, then I'll help you develop a 'making friends' plan. In the next period of time, you should cooperate with me on some simple experiments!"</p><p></p><p>With things having developed to this point, Zhipeng had no choice but to agree. He nodded readily, "Whatever experiments need to be done, please instruct me, Mr. Jia Wei."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually said, "Oh right, you have two Bizarre Source mage friends, right? Will they be willing to cooperate with our experiments?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng confidently said, "Of course they will."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled slightly, "Excellent."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At Suhao's request, Zhipeng temporarily put aside his activities of randomly selecting lucky royal residences for massacres. Together with his friends who had been subjected to the 'Equilibrium Technique', they were instantly transported to an island to cooperate with two researchers in various experiments.</p><p></p><p>The Quintessence Source mage was assigned to experiment under someone called Jia Yashan. The Illusion Source mage was assigned to experiment under someone called Jia Fengcheng. The Ability Source mage followed Jia Wei's experiments.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it couldn't be simply called an experiment. It was euphemistically called: "Helping you design a reasonable way to use your abilities."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with the help of Suhao and the other two, Zhipeng and his companions' Source abilities were greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the others' creative thinking opened everyone's eyes. They exclaimed in amazement: "Damn, it can be used like this too? This structure is brilliant! This equation is awesome, it really works! The 'Starry Eyes' ability can also be used to hit dummies' heads? How didn't I think of that? 'Crying Uncontrollably' can make people 'cry with joy'?..."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng's ability in particular underwent a qualitative leap. Suhao packaged him as an erudite scholar, changing him greatly in both content and appearance, especially the latter. After Suhao's modifications, one look at him would give the impression of a respectable great sage.</p><p></p><p>Suhao even gave him a philosophically profound name - Wulai!</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was about to travel around and begin his preaching career: "Friends, would you like to listen to my stories?"</p><p></p><p>It was foreseeable that a great storyteller king was about to be born.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of miscellaneous tests and experiments took half a year.</p><p></p><p>After half a year, Suhao handed the thick planning book to Zhipeng, then sent them off to officially begin their 'preaching' and 'making friends' journey.</p><p></p><p>During this half year, Suhao's main work was collecting information from all over the world. He went to the royal palace of the Yixuan City in the Horizontal Region several times without being discovered, gaining abundant rewards. He even found records of the history of humans' use of Source power from nothing to its origins, along with various detailed event records dating back more than ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>After a brief review, he found that it was about the same as his guess. In this world, a very long time ago, there were extremely few Bizarre disasters, mostly natural disasters and Source Beast disasters. It was only after humans developed civilization that Bizarre disasters gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>And it took humans an extremely long time to fully grasp and utilize Source power. At first, there were only occasional awakenings within human tribes. As humans' knowledge gradually increased and their thoughts became more complex, more and more people awakened as Source mages...</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that it was related to human spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The only puzzling point now was why some Source Beasts with very weak spiritual power could still instinctively grasp the use of Source power and manifest abilities even stronger than humans'.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to spiritual power, but only to a certain quality within spiritual power. This quality not only exists in human spiritual power, but also in the faint spiritual power of other creatures, and is even not limited to spiritual power - some special inanimate objects may also possess it..."</p><p></p><p>After guessing this, Suhao immediately arranged experiments on spiritual qualities for Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>If they could analyze the way spiritual power affects the conversion to Source power and form a systematic theory, then Suhao would be able to freely use Source power to achieve various functions, including Ability System, Quintessence System, and Illusion System.</p><p></p><p>A few months had passed, and he didn't know about Yashan's research progress yet.</p><p></p><p>One day, as Suhao was pondering over a pile of materials, Yashan sent him a message: "Old Master Wei, I seem to have found the frequency band closely related to Source power among the various spiritual qualities you asked me to research."</p>

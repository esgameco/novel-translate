        <h1>Chapter 566</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I had previously heard that you planned to establish the Glory Society and eliminate the royal families. I have some interest in that and can provide you with some assistance. To be honest, your strength is too weak. It will be difficult for you alone to eliminate the royal families."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was surprised that Suhao also had thoughts of overthrowing the royal families. Whether true or not, it greatly encouraged him. At least it proved that there were many people in this world with such ideas.</p><p></p><p>He nodded in acknowledgment, "I know it's difficult, but I still want to try. If I don't do it, and no one else does it, then there will be less and less hope in this world. More and more people will suffer misfortune. If we sink into depravity like this, it's unimaginable what the world will become. Perhaps I won't succeed, but I still have to stand up. Even if it just causes the royal families to restrain themselves a bit, that would be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Suhao sighed unusually, "I've tried such things before, but unfortunately I don't know the final result."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng asked curiously, "You've tried? It's said that you blew up the Association Hall in Huchang City and destroyed the most advanced Changqing Factory in the entire Hengxuan District. Was that the incident?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head, "No, that was a very long time ago when I was still too weak to change anything."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng clenched his fists silently. His strength was indeed so weak that he couldn't even protect his own wife, let alone change anything. Everything was irreversible. If he had possessed great power, things wouldn't have reached this point.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Since you want to eliminate the royal families, it so happens that I have the same intention. Cooperate with me, and I can provide you with assistance beyond your imagination. It would be easy to even pull the imperial clan off the throne."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng didn't believe it, "What do you want? Why would you cooperate with us? You're so powerful, you can take action yourself."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled slightly, "As you said, I can indeed act alone. Give me a few months, and I can slaughter all the royal families in the Hengxuan District. But that's not my goal - to me, the royal families are just like flies buzzing around, annoying but not worth wasting a few months to kill them all. That wouldn't be worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>And don't misunderstand, I don't necessarily have to cooperate with you. I happened to run into you tonight, and I happened to want to clear away some unsightly garbage, that's all. Cooperating with you is just to reduce my troubles. You can think of yourselves as laborers helping me eliminate the royal families.</p><p></p><p>Do you understand being my trouble-reducing laborers? If you're not useful and can't meet my requirements, I won't hesitate to kick you aside and find others to cooperate with.</p><p></p><p>Besides, I can't think of anything you could offer me. You're just some mages I could easily get rid of. As you saw, even the most mysterious Demonic Source mages had no effect on me, so put away any ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Pointed out by Suhao, Zhipeng was startled, his back drenched in cold sweat. He guessed in his heart that this person called Jiawai, known as "Kai the Land Scraper" and wanted by the entire Hengxuan District Mage Association, was some kind of divine being.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, he made up his mind and asked, "How do we cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao liked straightforward people like this. "The way to cooperate is simple. I can help you gain greater power and formulate the organization's principles and action plans for eliminating the royal families. You'll carry out the specifics. Once successful, you'll be the masters of the Hengxuan District or even the world. You can then allow people to live a bright life according to your ideals. As for me, I only need the various files and archives hidden in this world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that's just the most basic form of cooperation. There's more room for future cooperation, like when the 'Glory Society' matures, you can provide research talents and various materials and information to me. I don't need much, and I'm not interested in power."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng didn't ask "what if I choose not to cooperate", because in his view, he only had two choices: cooperate, or be tortured half to death by that dizzying ability and then cooperate.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't think too much and simply nodded, "Okay. I'm Zhipeng, and I'll cooperate with you."</p><p></p><p>Once Suhao demonstrated his power, at least half the trouble of what he wanted to do was reduced. If he didn't have absolute power, it would be questionable whether Zhipeng would ultimately cooperate with him.</p><p></p><p>After confirming their preliminary intention to cooperate, Suhao casually summoned a parrot that appeared by his side like magic, shocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>Could this self-proclaimed "Kai the Land Scraper" named Jiawai actually be a Material Source mage capable of creating life? Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored their astonished expressions, tossed the parrot, and it flew flapping its wings to perch on Zhipeng's shoulder. "Take good care of this parrot. Use it to keep in contact from now on. If you have anything, you can tell the parrot, and it will answer you."</p><p></p><p>Then the parrot suddenly spoke, "Hello, I'm called Number Seven. Please take care of me in the future."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng was dumbstruck but managed a smile, "Hello Number Seven, I'm Zhipeng. Please take care of me too in the future."</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand, "I have something else to do tonight. I'll find you again tomorrow night for more details."</p><p></p><p>Then with a flash, he disappeared from the spot, leaving the ten people staring at each other blankly.</p><p></p><p>They had encountered many Source mages and knew quite a few powerful Demonic Source mages. But someone who could leave them so helpless was the first they had met.</p><p></p><p>After tonight, the most doubtful about life were the two Demonic Source mages. Their abilities had failed for the first time, greatly diminishing their sense of invincibility.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After reaching a preliminary cooperation intention with Zhipeng and the others, Suhao directly left to continue sweeping through the various cities to obtain useful information.</p><p></p><p>To Suhao, Zhipeng and those people were just a casual interest. Perhaps years later there would be some surprises to reap? Failure didn't really matter, did it?</p><p></p><p>The parrot he left behind was just an ordinary experimental specimen kept at the test site. Its only advantage was clearly simulating human speech. Controlled by Xiaolite, it could enable ultra-long-range real-time communication, very convenient.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this Number Seven parrot also shouldered some monitoring responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of Source ability Zhipeng had, Suhao was quite curious, but it clearly wasn't the right time to discuss it in front of his friends. So in the end, he arranged to meet Zhipeng again the next evening for more details.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't worried at all that Zhipeng's ability would work on him. First, the "Suhao" Zhipeng saw was just a projection, his true self wasn't present. Second, his divine consciousness was now highly sensitive to manipulations of Source, so if Zhipeng tried to activate his ability, he could instantly sense it and avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Without full confidence, Suhao wouldn't take any risks.</p><p></p><p>The next evening, Suhao used the parrot to locate Zhipeng and directly entered the "second-level space" to appear before him.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng had changed from last night's unkempt appearance. His hair was neatly groomed, his beard shaved clean, and he wore a new set of clothes, looking very energetic overall.</p><p></p><p>A green parrot perched on his shoulder, preening its feathers.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time since his wife's death that Zhipeng had groomed himself so properly. He couldn't quite explain why, only feeling that Mr. Jiawai was an unreachable great figure.</p><p></p><p>Tonight when meeting Mr. Jiawai, he should tidy himself up a bit. Otherwise it would be disrespectful to Mr. Jiawai.</p><p></p><p>Since they had agreed to cooperate, giving the cooperating partner a basic level of respect was the most basic courtesy. He didn't want others to think he was an impolite person.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Suhao appeared, Zhipeng immediately greeted him, "Good evening, Mr. Jiawai."</p><p></p><p>Suhao responded, then pointed to Xiaohui and Aming standing behind Zhipeng, "Tonight we'll discuss many things involving you. Do they need to leave?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng turned back, "Xiaohui, Aming, you two go stand guard outside the door. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Mr. Jiawai means me no harm."</p><p></p><p>He added in his heart: Even if he did, your presence wouldn't help.</p><p></p><p>Xiaohui and Aming looked worried but still went out.</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand, setting up a soundproof barrier, and directly asked, "Your bizarre ability is called 'Let's Be Friends', right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng hesitated slightly, then smiled bitterly, "Indeed, I can't hide it from you, Mr. Jiawai. That's right, my ability is recorded as that name in the Mage Association's records. But I don't really like it. I prefer to call it 'Listen to My Story'. The rumors are somewhat inaccurate. Only those who are moved by me will become my friends. Friendship cannot be forced - only by treating others sincerely will they treat you sincerely in return."</p>

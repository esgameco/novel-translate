        <h1>Chapter 669</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The facts proved that Suhao's strategy to save his life was correct.</p><p></p><p>As long as he killed all the octopus monsters that his eyes could see, he would be safe.</p><p></p><p>No matter what other treatment he received for not listening to his superiors' commands, at least he preserved his life first.</p><p></p><p>Let him quietly cultivate for a year, and everything would no longer be a problem.</p><p></p><p>By that time, no matter what he said, others would believe him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Suhao could judge from the subtle clues that humans were not in an advantageous position in the war against the octopus monsters.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if this tough battle dragged on for too long, even more dangerous things would happen.</p><p></p><p>So the best choice was to quickly clear out the resisting octopus monsters outside, let the so-called "plasma team" come in, destroy the extremely solid hemispherical fortress, and achieve victory.</p><p></p><p>And he did it!</p><p></p><p>There was no need to clear out all the octopus monsters, as long as he opened a gap in the base's defenses. The human officers were no fools and would surely seize the opportunity!</p><p></p><p>So later, wherever he went, it became deathly quiet, but after he left, octopus monsters would emerge again, attacking other advancing squads, and the gunfire continued!</p><p></p><p>He reached out and tapped the metal surface of the base sphere, making a "dang dang" sound.</p><p></p><p>This metal called "embroidered gold" was extremely hard. Even Suhao's energy guns could only make a white mark on it, while the various energy cannons and bombs of other squads were useless against this spherical fortress.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the current way for humans to destroy it was to use a special method to form plasma to break the internal structure of the "embroidered gold", and then use explosives to blow it up.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very curious about this metal, and not only about this metal, but also about the guns in his hands, the armor on his body, the spacecraft he rode before, the internal structure of the base sphere, the body structure of the octopus monsters, and so on. He had a great interest in all of them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, now was not the time for research, and his desires had to be put aside for the time being!</p><p></p><p>To Suhao's surprise, Captain Yan and Little Chang were still tenaciously holding on and had not been killed yet, though they looked a bit tired as they leaned against the base sphere wall, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao stopped, the captain finally had a chance to catch his breath and couldn't help but say, "Big Strong...you little bastard really are reckless enough! I've been in the army for many years, but you're the first soldier like this that I've led!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he patted Little Chang beside him and praised, "Well done, Little Chang. I didn't misjudge you - you were able to survive this situation!"</p><p></p><p>Little Chang's slightly childish voice said, "Captain, this is thanks to the 'Number Three Enhancement Serum' that my dad bought for me before I enlisted. My physical abilities are a bit higher than ordinary people's! If I can make it back alive, I'll definitely thank my dad."</p><p></p><p>The captain cursed, "F**k, 'Number Three Enhancement Serum'! Your family is so rich, why didn't you just become a young master instead of coming to be a soldier?"</p><p></p><p>Little Chang's tone was extraordinarily firm: "For the sake of humanity!"</p><p></p><p>The captain fell silent, thinking to himself, "Just like me back then, brainwashed into joining!"</p><p></p><p>However, if he had another chance to choose, he would enlist again without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew he might die on the battlefield at any time.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but turn and ask Suhao, "Big Strong, why did you become a soldier?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao understood but couldn't open his mouth for the time being due to the language issue, so he didn't react, as if he hadn't heard.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan couldn't help but reach out and pat Suhao twice. Suhao simply pointed to his ear and shouted loudly, "Huh???"</p><p></p><p>The meaning was that he had gone deaf and didn't want to be spoken to since he couldn't hear anything.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan realized and cursed, "Damn it! So you went deaf. No wonder you had the guts to disobey orders!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Zzzzzzt!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a blue flash flickered in the distance, accompanied by a piercing electric current sound.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a huge bang shook the entire ground!</p><p></p><p>He immediately reported to his superior officer, "Reporting to Colonel Jiang, this is Squad 405. We're holding the exit of the central base sphere. Over!"</p><p></p><p>Colonel Jiang's hearty laughter came through, "Yan Xiang, you did a good job, hahaha! Now go support the plasma team immediately. I'll put you in for a merit citation!"</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>The octopus monsters seemed to sense their precarious situation and became agitated, opening their weapon ports again to unleash various missiles at Suhao's trio.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan cursed loudly and quickly jumped up to evade.</p><p></p><p>As Suhao and the others were dodging, the base sphere's hatch opened, and five octopus monsters unexpectedly rushed out, shouting and firing at them in a desperate struggle.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stumbled but used his armor's thrusters to instantly dodge into cover.</p><p></p><p>Then he swiftly moved around, waiting for an opportunity to raise his gun and fire.</p><p></p><p>"Zhi!"</p><p></p><p>A beam accurately shattered the thick protective visor and shot into an octopus monster's eye.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a muffled explosion sounded, and the tentacles about to block Suhao's view froze in midair before falling limply.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>No matter how many times Captain Yan and Little Chang had seen such godly marksmanship, they couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed so inconceivable to them.</p><p></p><p>They glanced at their own inaccurate shooting and decided not to look anymore!</p><p></p><p>The octopus monsters were actually quite helpless too.</p><p></p><p>Against an opponent like Suhao who could hit the eye with every shot, there was no way to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Turning their backs could indeed save their lives, but then they couldn't see the enemy either. The bullets they fired had no accuracy and posed no threat!</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, that human moved with unbelievable agility.</p><p></p><p>They had tried attacking him with various weapons, but he always detected them in advance and evaded them one by one, as if their every move couldn't escape his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was even more ridiculous than the "Compound Eye Clan"!</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan no longer guarded the central base sphere but ran to Suhao's side. Getting close to his ear, he shouted at the top of his voice, "The plasma team is under attack! We're going over to support them immediately and quickly take down this small supply station!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but turn his head away, then nodded to show he had heard.</p><p></p><p>The captain was afraid he couldn't hear, so he shouted with all his might, making Suhao's ears ring.</p><p></p><p>So the three of them returned towards Squad 744's direction. Along the way, they blasted the heads of more than a dozen octopus monsters and successfully joined up with the plasma team.</p><p></p><p>The octopus monsters clearly understood that the plasma team was their biggest enemy. Disregarding everything, they poured out of the base sphere and, together with the sphere's cannons, launched a fierce attack on the plasma team.</p><p></p><p>Then the plasma team members witnessed what truly godly marksmanship looked like.</p><p></p><p>They saw an ordinary armored soldier constantly jumping, rolling, and dodging among various buildings and obstacles while avoiding attacks. From time to time, he would fire a single shot that would accurately blow up an octopus monster's head.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this one person could hold off an entire squad of octopus monsters.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't all wearing thick armor, their gaping expressions would surely be visible.</p><p></p><p>"Zhi zhi!"</p><p>"Boom--boom--"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the octopus monsters retreated!</p><p></p><p>Unless they used "human wave tactics"!</p><p></p><p>If they concentrated their forces to deal with that bizarre human, other areas would be instantly defenseless and they would die even faster.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao cleared out the octopus monsters, the plasma team was like waking from a dream.</p><p></p><p>Under the squad leader's orders, the plasma team members each found a target base sphere. First, they took four thermos-like metal rods from the box behind them and attached them to the sphere's outer shell, forming a square. Then they took a square-shaped bomb and stuck it precisely in the center of the square.</p><p></p><p>After quickly completing these steps, the plasma team members swiftly evacuated and found places to take cover, then pressed the buttons in their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Rrrriiiip"</p><p></p><p>The four rods suddenly released a large amount of plasma, bathing the surroundings in a blue glow.</p><p></p><p>Two seconds later, the square bomb in the center violently exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The base sphere's indestructible embroidered gold shell shattered like fragile glass.</p><p></p><p>After the commotion settled, the base sphere had a large hole in it.</p><p></p><p>Someone quickly threw two high-explosive grenades into the hole.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The entire base sphere shook, and flames spewed out from the hole!</p><p></p><p>The fate of the octopus monsters hiding inside could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>After the explosion, another squad rushed in. A few gunshots rang out, and then a voice came through: "Danger cleared, this is an energy chamber!"</p><p></p><p>Other demolition teams also reported in succession, "They're all energy chambers!"</p><p></p><p>And "energy" was precisely the goal of this surprise attack operation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's faces showed excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>But Suhao remained expressionless, vigilantly scanning for any potential incoming black guns, while his mind was very curious: "Energy chambers?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 649</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Based on Su Hao's current abilities, finding the Disaster System was extremely difficult. After many years of attempts, there were no results.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he planned to set it aside for now and wait until he gained powerful spiritual strength in some future world before searching for it again, which would undoubtedly make the task much easier.</p><p></p><p>However, the destruction of the Source Star made Su Hao change his mind.</p><p></p><p>He urgently wanted to find the Disaster Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't find the specific Disaster Calamity, being able to find a way to offset the Disaster Calamity would be good.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't want a sword hanging over his head at all times, nor did he want to become a 'planet destroyer' whose presence led to the extinction of civilizations wherever he went...</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Su Hao quickly made up his mind and continued writing: "Conduct targeted tests:</p><p></p><p>1. Use the 'positioning teleportation auxiliary device' to continuously advance at light speed to test if the 'disaster' can keep up with me;</p><p></p><p>2. Personally guide Fei Yue on the immortal cultivation theory, allowing him and I to jointly deduce the realm beyond the 'Divinity Realm';</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wrote, then crossed out Fei Yue's name, muttering: "Fei Yue has already learned our 'immortal cultivation techniques', perhaps his essence has changed and he can no longer serve as a reference."</p><p></p><p>"However, having two surviving natives is enough. I'll raise them first, observe them for a few years, then have them reproduce offspring and continue observing..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao destroyed the 'Sealed Disaster Satellite System', the rampant energy on the Source Star continued intensifying for a month before showing a declining trend, indicating the source on the Source Star was no longer growing.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late - the vast majority of marine life had already perished, with only some extremely hardy microbial lifeforms surviving, preserving the source of life.</p><p></p><p>For the Source Star, this incident could be called a 'mass extinction event'.</p><p></p><p>Countless years later, if a new civilization managed to develop, the new civilization would likely never imagine that in the distant past, there had once been such a vast 'Source Cultivator' civilization.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps there would be no opportunity at all! The existence of life on a planet does not necessarily mean intelligent life will arise - the conditions required for intelligent life to emerge are far too stringent.</p><p></p><p>As of now, everything about the Source Star was over for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Aside from leaving a positioning stone on the remaining satellites to facilitate periodic observation, he had no lingering attachment to the Source Star.</p><p></p><p>Now aboard the Initial Ship, he slowly departed from this small star system.</p><p></p><p>There were six people on the ship - Su Hao's group of three, Fei Yue, as well as Yuan Feng and Ling Xue.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Feng and Ling Xue had accepted the fact that their home planet was destroyed and quickly adapted to life on the ship, displaying immense curiosity about everything on board and roaming about as if patrolling their own territory.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others did not restrict the movements of the two as long as they did not disturb anyone else - they could do whatever they wanted.</p><p></p><p>There were many entertainment facilities on the ship, and at first the two played happily, but as time passed they gradually became bored!</p><p></p><p>The two suddenly realized a very serious problem: even if this amazing ship belonged to them, they could not be happy.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that there was no one to show off to - any achievements they made felt meaningless.</p><p></p><p>In the past, they worked hard to study and join the astronomy group, which was the highest honor in the world.</p><p></p><p>They could make everyone look up to them, boast about their talents to neighbors and relatives, frequently show off in front of those who used to look down on them, and even engage in 'invisible showing off' online to gain praise from internet trolls...</p><p></p><p>In the past, these seemed to be the entirety of life, but now it was all gone!</p><p></p><p>Life seemed to have lost its joy...</p><p></p><p>All the previous scheming and infighting had lost its meaning.</p><p></p><p>So what was the point of them still being alive?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they seemed to have found the most fundamental meaning of life - reproducing offspring.</p><p></p><p>As for how to reproduce offspring, that's a topic best skipped over.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Captain, the star coordinates within 5,000 light years of the Source Star have all been cross-referenced. Which direction should we head now?"</p><p></p><p>In the cockpit, Ya Shan projected a 3D hologram of the surrounding universe and showed it to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>As for why only the 5,000 light year range was cross-referenced, it was because the maximum lifespan of Su Hao and the others was probably around 5,000 years.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the farthest they could travel was 5,000 light years.</p><p></p><p>Not even one-twentieth of the distance from the Source Star's galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step, it was impossible to demand too much at once. Besides, whether they could truly live to 5,000 years was another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that during the journey, they might suddenly encounter some inexplicable incident and end up with the ship destroyed and everyone dead.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the star map and casually asked, "What's the nearest star system to us?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan zoomed in on the star map, locking onto a small star system, "It's the Muslin Star at the tip of the Beehive Cluster, 7.3 light years away from the Source Star system. If we activate the 'positioning teleportation auxiliary device' now, we can arrive in eight years at most."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Then let's go to the Muslin Star! But to be safe, we'll teleport once per light year, eight jumps total to get there. Calculate the coordinates for the first jump now and activate the positioning teleportation device."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Captain, one moment please."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan then passed this simple calculation task to Fei Yue, and had Feng Cheng open the 'positioning teleportation device' in advance.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Fei Yue provided a set of specific coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed into the teleportation chamber, connected his spiritual power to the device, began constructing a 'negative space module', and finally, with the device's assistance, launched the negative space module at light speed towards the designated coordinates.</p><p></p><p>A one-year countdown then appeared on the device's display screen.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there was still one year until the actual teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exited the auxiliary device and told Feng Cheng, who was waiting nearby, "Feng Cheng, remind me three days before we reach the teleportation point!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately replied, "Understood, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>However, Feng Cheng was inwardly flustered, worried he might forget this matter!</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a whole year away!  One careless mistake and he could miss it...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng thought to himself, "I absolutely cannot mess up the Captain's affairs! I'll immediately write an alarm program in my neural network...Writing a program in the neural network isn't enough, I'll also write one using the assistant expansion function, just in case. Hmm, one isn't reliable enough, I'll write three that take turns reminding me..."</p><p></p><p>Currently, only Su Hao could teleport the ship over extremely long distances.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that the ship was essentially a 'small world', so teleporting while carrying the ship meant teleporting the small world. Ya Shan and Feng Cheng could not do this.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's sensitivity to space was too weak - to this day they still had not comprehended 'second-level space', let alone the application of 'small worlds'.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the difference between a 'researcher' and a 'learner'.</p><p></p><p>One comprehends the 'essence', while the other learns the 'method'.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only if Ya Shan and Feng Cheng truly comprehended the essence of space like Su Hao could they learn to apply 'second-level space' and 'small worlds'.</p><p></p><p>Such things could not be forced - all the information about space could be found in the omnipotent assistant, but whether they could learn it depended on them.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned to the cockpit and directly addressed Fei Yue, "I have a new research project called 'Beyond Divinity', and I may need your help to study it together!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue was stunned, "Do you need my help, Mr. Jia?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ya Shan was burning with jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue nodded, "If you need me, I will do my utmost."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "However, you have not yet reached the 'Divinity Realm', so I will first teach you how to quickly cultivate to the 'Divinity Realm', as well as the 'Divine Body Realm' after that. Oh, come find me again in three days, still at Lab No. 1."</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue replied, "Very well, Mr. Jia."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's aura gradually intensified, he really wanted to hug Su Hao's leg, "Captain, I want to join the research too!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 908</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the blink of an eye, ten years have passed.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the efforts of the travelers, the entire world had surprisingly undergone a subtle change in appearance, with many more fresh gadgets.</p><p></p><p>Even such things as newspapers spread throughout the entire world had come out, allowing people from all places, to see the big events happening around the world.</p><p></p><p>The biggest change was that people's tools of production became more efficient, and the change in tools, which soon swept across the whole world, plunged the world into a wave of renewed tools of production.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during this wave of change in the times, the travelers died one by one.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the real death came that they were able to determine that they were not the protagonist of this world, but only an insignificant supporting role ...... perhaps not even a supporting role.</p><p></p><p>And the original one hundred people, by today, there are still ten people left.</p><p></p><p>Smoothly survived, none of them are exceptionally careful and prudent people, not only has a lot of life preservation means, good at hiding themselves, rarely expose their true strength, but also can restrain the curiosity that is always scratching in the heart.</p><p></p><p>One more than a goat.</p><p></p><p>Not goat can't, they ten people this ten years to see too many 'accidents'.</p><p></p><p>The popularity of newspapers allowed them to know clearly where there was some extraordinary character, where something big happened, and which character died because of what ......</p><p></p><p>Then they realized that many of the new big names that had risen to prominence weren't precisely those 'acquaintances' that had gone out of the town of Hyde.</p><p></p><p>Shortly afterward, they saw these acquaintances dying one after another, which simply scared them enough that one by one they hid better.</p><p></p><p>And so they all comprehended the truth that under the premise of having a 'system', there were millions of roads to success, but the only one that was the most reliable was - goading!</p><p></p><p>They agreed that as long as they lived long enough, the so-called strength and power would be there, but if they were lifeless, everything would be gone.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, their realm of hiding their selves was so high nowadays that they were at the point where they could ignore when they saw a scoundrel blatantly grabbing a little girl's lollipop on the street.</p><p></p><p>Their inner endurance was exceptionally terrifying, and as long as it wasn't required by the mission, they were able to hold back strongly.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng was even the best of them.</p><p></p><p>"Within a thousand meters, eight nasty incidents are occurring, two thefts of silver money, one burglary of a young woman's intimate clothing, one molestation of a good woman being chased by a grandmother with a stick, three snatching of a little girl's sweets resulting in the little girl crying in the street, and one very nasty incident: a beautiful young girl who actually salivated at my beauty and tried to come over to talk to me!</p><p></p><p>It is intolerable, the young girl is the source of trouble, must not be contaminated in the slightest, otherwise the consequences are hard to predict."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng suppressed his inner restlessness and took a few deep breaths of cool air to calm down the desire for the maiden that welled up inside: "Maiden, it's really scary, it's so invisible that it confuses my mind, but I, Luo Yanfeng, won't fall for it. I'll dodge!"</p><p></p><p>Perception is an ability he exchanged a long time ago, for safety, he unfolded his perception ability every moment, any wind and grass can't escape his eyes, even in his sleep, he unfolded his perception, detecting anomalies and avoiding dangers.</p><p></p><p>If it is not necessary for the mission, as long as he senses that there is a soul power awakened person or a powerful brave person, he will avoid it in advance, and will definitely not venture close to it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew that there was a valuable soul power fruit not far away, he was not moved.</p><p></p><p>In his opinion, with the system, as long as he was alive, he had everything, so why bother coveting other external objects?</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he had built his life-preserving ability to a first-class level, and even the deities observing him tsked.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if there was a mission, or if the points given were large enough, it was another story.</p><p></p><p>In the case of receiving a mission, even though he knew that there would be a certain amount of danger in going out, he would still choose to risk a certain amount of danger to complete the mission. If he refused the mission and was unable to earn enough points, it would be nothing more than a chronic death.</p><p></p><p>That day he received a new message.</p><p></p><p>''Dingdong.''</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng: "......"</p><p></p><p>Don't reward if you can.</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by a system prompt, "A mature host has to learn to manage his emotions, desires, and also master the most basic survival skills, as well as learn to take the initiative to learn to become a knowledgeable person, but you can never go far behind closed doors, you need to take the initiative to go out and look for more powerful people, worship them as a teacher, and learn from them about stronger power and more profound knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Quest: please travel to the Brave World, seek out the 'Twin Gods', and worship under the Twin Gods."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng couldn't help but tremble in fear when he saw the words 'go out on your own accord', this was similar to going out on your own accord to die in his opinion.</p><p></p><p>After reading the entire prompt, he couldn't help but freeze, "Worship a master? Or to worship the famous Twin Gods?"</p><p></p><p>The first thought was 'impossible'.</p><p></p><p>He was just a small person who was obscenely begging for a living, without the slightest bit of fame spreading out, for someone like him to go and worship the Twin Gods as a teacher? It would be good to even meet someone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, over the years, he had heard that many people had also sought out the Twin Gods to worship their masters, but without exception, they had all been rejected, so how could he allow the Twin Gods, who stood at the top of the world, to give him a high regard?</p><p></p><p>"Hiss - a two thousand point master worship mission. Does this ...... want to go?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng was caught in a tangle.</p><p></p><p>After all the thoughts, he finally decided, "Do it! It's not that I'm not careful, but it's too much to give. Brave World, it seems like I have to break into it after all. However, there's still a need to be prepared for everything,"</p><p></p><p>Not only Luo Yanfeng, the ten surviving travelers, all of them received the task of worshipping their masters, and without exception, they all succumbed under the points offensive.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand points, not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's just to worship the master, it's not like you're going out to die, if you find out that the Twin Gods are too ferocious at that time, then you can just give up the mission.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ten travelers scattered all over the world, have made preparations, and then changed their identities, quietly left the place where they used to live, and traveled to the paradise of the strong - the world of the brave.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the world's most powerful and terrifying Chip Daemon King, is there ......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Of course, this quest works both ways, not only did the ten travelers receive the master worship quest, but the siblings also received the disciple acceptance quest.</p><p></p><p>"What? Accepting disciples?"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>How could they not have expected that there would be this kind of strange task, but they had no experience in accepting disciples?</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was, after accepting disciples, what would they teach their disciples? Most of this strength of theirs was exchanged from inside the mall, relying on their own cultivation, there wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>At most, they could hone the fit of their spiritual energy and spiritual thoughts, as well as practice practical spells.</p><p></p><p>Now that they were asked to lead disciples, truth be told, although they knew how to cultivate, it wasn't very systematic.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "I also received the task of taking on disciples, but I'm fine with fighting and killing, but taking on disciples, I really don't know how to do it!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling also had a difficult face, recalling when Feng Cheng taught them, trying to learn how to teach disciples, but soon gave up, because her memory, master Feng Cheng complained the most is that their brains stupid ......</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "The mission doesn't specify what to teach either, or else teach some disciplines and then some cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei reluctantly smiled, "Seems ...... like it could work."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said thoughtfully, "Moreover, our diligence system won't give useless tasks, it's bound to be giving us some kind of hints ...... I think the biggest possibility is that, although our current strength is strong, most of it is pieced together from the east and is not systematic, limiting our ability to continue to develop upwards.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Diligent System hopes that we can organize our knowledge and strength by instructing our disciples, which in turn will prompt us to deepen our understanding of the nature of strength ......"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei praised, "Sister, you are really smart. By the way, when Master left, that palace island is still there, let's go there and collect it!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A few months later, the square in front of the palace island's massive palace.</p><p></p><p>The two siblings looked at the sixteen people in front of them with different expressions and couldn't help but reveal a smirk.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei coughed and said, ''All of you have passed our test, and are also determined enough enough to follow us to learn all kinds of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Then, from today onwards, you are disciples of my Double Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>As for why there were six extra, apart from the ten travelers, there were also six other local geniuses who had come here in admiration, not even remotely inferior to the travelers, and the unknowing two siblings were subsequently enrolled under the door.</p>

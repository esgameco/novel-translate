        <h1>Chapter 969</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling was left speechless by her brother's actions.</p><p></p><p>What was the difference between this and revealing his full power?</p><p></p><p>After all, her view was that a warmhearted man was generally better than an indifferent one...</p><p></p><p>Since her brother had stepped in, in Cong Shuling's eyes, this physical battle between the two men had now ended.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng looked around in astonishment, but they could no longer see the figure of An Mingwang.</p><p></p><p>Based on what they had just heard, Gao Qi believed An Mingwang's disappearance must be related to the long-haired young man who had introduced himself as Cong Renfei.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed and said, "We have an ability called projection that can project objects to other places, just like our current state. I just projected An Mingwang to a place with no one around. Once you've rested, I can send him back, and then you can fight him again."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng wiped the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth and exclaimed in amazement, "That's incredible! I've never even heard of such a miraculous martial art!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Lv Yijiang, who had been buried under the rocks, burst out of the ground like a carp leaping out of water.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang shielded his face and roared madly, "Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>His aura was full of vigor, his hair flying upwards.</p><p></p><p>But after shouting for a while without being attacked, he stopped, looking around in confusion. He didn't see An Mingwang's presence anywhere.</p><p></p><p>He immediately flashed to Gao Qi's side and asked, "Where's An Mingwang? Where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lv Yijiang covered in wounds, his tattered martial arts robe almost completely stained red with blood, yet his eyes still clear and full of fighting spirit, without a hint of fear, Gao Qi couldn't help feeling inadequate.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he always felt inferior to Lv Yijiang.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi took a deep breath and pointed at Cong Renfei, saying, "He projected him away. He said he'd let us rest for a bit, then send An Mingwang back to fight us. Oh, he said his name is Cong Renfei, and that's his sister Cong Shuling over there."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang then turned to Cong Renfei and said, "Send An Mingwang back! I want to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said, "Yijiang, he can't understand what we're saying."</p><p></p><p>Then Gao Qi asked Cong Renfei, "Cong Renfei, do you have that language pack?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked conflicted and sought help from his sister. Two hundred points was quite expensive, and he felt reluctant to spend it.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling turned her head away, pretending not to see.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei gritted his teeth and exchanged for one, handing it to Lv Yijiang.</p><p></p><p>Following Gao Qi's guidance, Lv Yijiang slapped the yellow light into his brain. He felt a wave of dizziness, then an influx of new information fusing into his mind, as if something had changed, though he couldn't pinpoint what.</p><p></p><p>Until Cong Renfei asked, "Can you understand now? Are you sure you want me to send An Mingwang back right away?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's eyes widened. "Huh?"</p><p></p><p>But he quickly nodded firmly, "Yeah!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the seriousness in his eyes, Cong Renfei casually pointed to the side and said, "Okay, he's over there."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked in the direction he pointed and saw a brawny, shirtless bald man appear out of thin air - it was none other than An Mingwang himself.</p><p></p><p>When Lv Yijiang saw An Mingwang, his eyes burned with fury. "An Mingwang!!"</p><p></p><p>Without another word, he charged forward, fists swinging.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the others, An Mingwang's face twisted into an ferocious snarl. "So it was you lot playing tricks! You insignificant bugs, courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Then he and Lv Yijiang clashed again, or rather, Lv Yijiang was brutalized by An Mingwang's attacks.</p><p></p><p>However, Lv Yijiang was incredibly resilient. Under such intense pressure, he gradually grasped An Mingwang's rhythm and managed to land a few blows amid the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>This ability to rapidly improve through intense combat was a talent few possessed.</p><p></p><p>One could say Lv Yijiang was a true battle genius.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was being tough enough to endure.</p><p></p><p>If he crumpled after a single blow, even the highest combat learning talent would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng watched in horror as Lv Yijiang took a beating. If they were in his place, they wouldn't have lasted nearly as long.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi suddenly exclaimed, "Oh no, Yijiang's condition is dropping rapidly, he can't take much more!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to rush in, Cong Renfei laughed and said, "I can help."</p><p></p><p>With that, he withdrew An Mingwang back into the small world.</p><p></p><p>The world was peaceful once more.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "I've sent An Mingwang away again. Have Lv Yijiang rest up, and let me know when he's ready."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng were speechless at this turn of events. This battle felt so bizarre now, the initial tense atmosphere against An Mingwang completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang flashed in front of Cong Renfei, panting heavily to recover, then asked in confusion, "Where's An Mingwang? Did you send him away again?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei replied, "Yeah."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang raised his fists. "Then send him back! I have to defeat him, and I feel like I can win!"</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Cong Renfei waved his hand and An Mingwang reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang charged again. "An Mingwang!!!"</p><p></p><p>While An Mingwang roared furiously, "Ahhhhh! Unforgivable scum!"</p><p></p><p>He punched Lv Yijiang away, then extended his hands towards Cong Renfei and the others, gathering energy for an attack.</p><p></p><p>In his view, these people must be behind the trickery that kept transporting him to this bizarre place.</p><p></p><p>"Shhhhing--"</p><p></p><p>The energy blast erupted. Gao Qi and Tai Cheng instinctively shielded Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>After the explosion, Lv Yijiang stood before them, arms crossed in front of his face as he roared, "An Mingwang, I am your opponent!"</p><p></p><p>He then flashed behind An Mingwang's back to attack, but An Mingwang elbowed him away, sending him flying with a pained cry.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>The intense fighting resumed.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi cried out, "No good, Yijiang can't take much more!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei promptly withdrew An Mingwang again.</p><p></p><p>When Lv Yijiang returned, Cong Renfei released An Mingwang, who raged furiously.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang quickly faltered, so Cong Renfei withdrew An Mingwang, then released him again to An Mingwang's outrage.</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang went berserk with anger.</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang became enraged beyond reason.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This series of actions left even Gao Qi and the others dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A battle that should have been thrilling and blood-pumping had devolved into this bizarre spectacle.</p><p></p><p>To the point that even Lv Yijiang's fighting spirit couldn't help but wane.</p><p></p><p>When Cong Renfei released An Mingwang again, instead of immediately attacking, An Mingwang trembled all over, pointing at them as he roared furiously, "Scoundrels, villains! Damn you, despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, helpless in his frenzied rage, he bellowed, "Fight me fair and square, damn you!"</p><p></p><p>His aura surged even more intensely than his previous peak, clearly amplified by his accumulated fury, unleashing even greater power.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang turned to Cong Renfei and said haltingly, "Cong Renfei, I can do this, let me fight him to the death! I can definitely stop him from using his power to harm this world. Don't send him away, let me truly battle him."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei nodded. "Mmhmm, go Lv Yijiang, I support you, you will definitely achieve final victory."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's fighting spirit reignited, his aura soaring as he charged at An Mingwang again...or rather, charged in to be brutalized by An Mingwang once more.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling sighed. This heated battle had devolved into such a sorry state, she had completely lost interest in watching further.</p><p></p><p>She waved at Cong Renfei. "You guys keep playing, I'm leaving first."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked, "Sis, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "I'll wander around the cities in this world and collect some language data, try to crack the language system as soon as possible, then report back to our master."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "But didn't you say there was no rush?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shook her head. "A battle without any aesthetic appeal has no entertainment value."</p><p></p><p>With that, she flashed away.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, An Mingwang and Lv Yijiang's furious roars continued to ring out, interspersed with Gao Qi's cries of alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Damn you! I'm going to explode! Lv Yijiang, fight me fair and square!"</p><p></p><p>"Come on An Mingwang, I'll defeat you right here!"  </p><p></p><p>"Oh no, Yijiang's condition is crashing, he can't take much more!"</p><p></p><p>"Release An Mingwang, Cong Renfei, I want to fight him to the death."</p><p></p><p>"Scoundrels, are you going to fight or not? If not, then don't..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, An Mingwang!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Cong Shuling found Feng Cheng's avatar and reported the situation in this martial world to him.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said in surprise, "Oh, you found a brand new human martial world?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling sent him the video footage.</p><p></p><p>After watching it, Feng Cheng said, "Okay, I understand. Have you placed my locator stone?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling replied, "Yes, it's locator stone number 5312."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Got it."</p><p></p><p>Then, in Su Hao's lab, Feng Cheng approached Su Hao. "Master Su, Shuling and the others have found an interesting human martial world. Would you like to go check it out with me?"</p><p></p><p>He also shared the video footage in their group chat.</p><p></p><p>"A human martial world?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was equally astonished.</p><p></p><p>Human civilizations in the universe were not easy to come by, each one exceptionally precious.</p><p></p><p>After watching the video, Su Hao decided to put aside his research on demon insects for now and go to this new world with Feng Cheng first.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Ya Shan suddenly popped up. "I'm quite interested too, Master Su, wait for me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 779</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao gained from Zijun and the Dragon Seed was not just the 'spirit power grid' and 'magic power' of the Separating Spirit Realm. </p><p></p><p>He also acquired an extremely miraculous technique: the biological fusion technique.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, he could combine two or more different species together to form a new composite species.</p><p></p><p>For example, transplanting two dog heads onto the sides of a lion's neck to create a 'one-lion-two-dog beast', or switching the positions of the dog and monkey heads in a seamless connection, as if born that way...</p><p></p><p>Such applications were relatively simple biological transplants, but there were more advanced applications.</p><p></p><p>Like performing specific genetic modifications on various canine cells, then fusing them into the human body to combine with human cells into new types of cells, giving humans the ability to transform into dog-headed humans.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the effects of a Zoan-type Devil Fruit.</p><p></p><p>As for what use such a technique has...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the future someone will want to turn their ears into animal ears?</p><p></p><p>Or maybe someone wants to gain 'wild power', and Su Hao could lend a hand!</p><p></p><p>After completing the research on the Dragon Seed Planet, the speed of acquiring new knowledge inevitably slowed down.</p><p></p><p>In the time ahead, he could only continue to deepen his understanding based on the existing information.</p><p></p><p>While researching the Dragon Seed Planet, he did not stop exploring farther star systems, hoping that after completing the research, he could find another civilized planet to learn from.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were currently working hard to search for new life-bearing planets.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the exploration was too slow, while Su Hao's research speed was too fast...</p><p></p><p>In other words, the production rate was far lower than the consumption rate, resulting in an undersupply.</p><p></p><p>It made sense, given Su Hao's current super brain and vast knowledge reserves, his research speed on the unique knowledge of a life planet was far beyond what it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Normally, for him to fully master the unique knowledge on a planet, it would only take five to twenty years.</p><p></p><p>This was his current level of strength.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, when he began his research, he appeared more relaxed and at ease, unlike the previous few worlds where he was so eager.</p><p></p><p>This was the leisurely time he had once pursued.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level of power the Separating Spirit Realm's 'Eight-Armed God' with the spirit power grid can reach. Let me try it out!"</p><p></p><p>The simplest way to test was to head towards a black hole and see how close he could get.</p><p></p><p>Using a black hole as a reference to test one's strength, no one could fault that...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed and appeared in space, quickly forming a suit of armor from pink crystal, establishing the 'Gravity Formation'. In an instant, he connected to the 'Planetary Network', and with a thought from his 'minor self', he had already arrived on a planet near the black hole in the star system.</p><p></p><p>'Network Transmission'!</p><p></p><p>With a flash, he appeared in space, and the armor formation on his body slightly adjusted and undulated, naturally switching to the 'Stargating Formation'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's body lit up, and in the blink of an eye, he activated Stargating, disappearing from his original spot and speeding towards the black hole at extreme speeds.</p><p></p><p>The process was exceptionally smooth, without the slightest pause.</p><p></p><p>His use of various formations had reached an effortless, transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>The 'Stargating' became faster as Su Hao used it more frequently.</p><p></p><p>Six years later, Stargating could no longer be maintained under the black hole's immense gravitational field, and Su Hao exited the Stargating state.</p><p></p><p>Observing the surrounding space-time situation.</p><p></p><p>He quickly drew a conclusion: "My control over Stargating has improved slightly. The exit position is even closer to the black hole than before. Next, I'll continue flying towards the black hole."</p><p></p><p>This meant that as long as he kept practicing and adapting, his control could improve even further.</p><p></p><p>But it was impossible to break through his current state through practice alone; he could only keep approaching the limit...</p><p></p><p>This minor progress was not very significant for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>'A hairbreadth difference' might be what those martial artists pursuing the ultimate would yearn for, but it was definitely not what Su Hao sought.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was 'faster', 'more', 'greater'...</p><p></p><p>After flying for another four years, Su Hao finally felt he had reached his current limit and had to stop.</p><p></p><p>Going any further, the Eight-Armed God's avatar would not be able to withstand the various high-energy beams ejected outwards when the black hole devoured matter.</p><p></p><p>"This is closer to the black hole than before, the first time I've come this close to a black hole! The strength of the Separating Spirit Realm is at least several times that of the Refining Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, in the face of absolute celestial bodies in the universe, it's still not enough."</p><p></p><p>Although still very far from the black hole, Su Hao believed that as long as he kept strengthening his body and spells, enhancing his defenses, he would definitely be able to get infinitely closer to the black hole.</p><p></p><p>Testing the strength of the Separating Spirit Realm was only one of Su Hao's goals.</p><p></p><p>He also came here to test whether he could find more star systems by using the 'Planetary Network' at this point.</p><p></p><p>The armor formation changed, becoming the 'Gravity Formation'. As the formation successfully transformed, it lit up, forming a brilliant large light sphere, then dimmed, leaving only dark golden patterns on the armor.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space-time was distorted by the powerful force.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Su Hao's numerous 'minor selves' entered the 'Planetary Network', spreading outwards. In an instant, they reached the edge of the star system, gazing outwards.</p><p></p><p>After some attempts, Su Hao found that he could still only transmit to adjacent star systems.</p><p></p><p>But the empty space between adjacent star systems had narrowed, and the blurry, distant star systems had become clearer.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, as long as I keep getting closer to the black hole, I can use the black hole's powerful space-time warping force to connect to even farther star systems.</p><p></p><p>If one day I can stand on the black hole like a 'man bracing the heavens', perhaps I could bring an entire galaxy cluster, or even an infinitely large range, into the 'Planetary Network'..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exclaimed in admiration: "It's simply too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>As for whether he could actually do a 'man bracing the heavens' stance on a black hole, Su Hao didn't know.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one had ever been inside a black hole, so no one knew what it was like.</p><p></p><p>Even with an understanding of black hole celestial bodies, it was limited to imagination and speculation.</p><p></p><p>After testing, Su Hao did not linger, randomly choosing a spot and flashing away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with motivation: to continue searching for more cosmic civilizations, strengthen his current power and defenses, keep getting closer to the black hole, and obtain an even more massive planetary network.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could acquire more knowledge, he believed he would keep growing stronger, until one day...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao originally wanted to say 'until one day I can stand on a black hole', but he thought that sounded too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>What kind of power would be needed to stand upright on a black hole...</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't even imagine that!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent a message in the group: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, where have you explored to now?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately sent a star map, marking his specific location, and replied: "Master Wei, I've reached the Red Disk System and am about to explore this galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also replied: "I'm on the other side, preparing to go to the next Infant Cap System. Master Wei, you've already completed your research on the Dragon Seed Planet? So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "I spent six years on the Dragon Seed Planet, gained some things, and the testing took ten years, so it's not that fast."</p><p></p><p>Then he shared their gains, and continued: "This is what we gained from this exploration. As long as we find more civilizations and learn more knowledge, we will surely gain even greater power.</p><p></p><p>So keep it up, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng! One day, the three of us will be able to explore all the mysteries of the universe."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were energized and excited: "Understood, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>For them, finding knowledge was like opening treasure chests, but that was only one aspect. Following Master Wei to freely explore the universe was the true romance.</p><p></p><p>If they did this alone, they would surely find it dull and uninteresting. But doing it following Master Wei made it completely different.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the vitality of youth?</p>

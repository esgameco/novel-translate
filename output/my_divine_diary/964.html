        <h1>Chapter 964</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the Elf King Vari left, the Demon of Mount Ya directly accessed the soul network enveloping the infinite lands, observing the current situation of the rulers of various races through the network.</p><p></p><p>When the Elf King Vari mentioned this matter to him, Mount Ya was actually somewhat concerned, after all he had personally taught them for a hundred years, so there were some teacher-student bonds.</p><p></p><p>However, he still believed in his own judgment. It was fine for these students to run around and experience things themselves, as they could bring out their own strengths and talents, gaining their own insights. However, they were not suitable to be his direct disciples.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he did not plan to take in more disciples in the future. If there were suitable candidates, he would have his current disciples guide and teach them instead.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Gate now had millions of disciples, and many matters no longer required his personal involvement, as the disciples could arrange everything in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Most of these disciples were now scattered across different star domains exploring. Every ten years they could expand outwards a vast distance, incorporating suitable planets into the infinite lands.</p><p></p><p>Every few years, they could find interesting life-bearing planets in the cosmic starry sky. His main work was to research these newly discovered life-bearing planets, discover and summarize new knowledge, and upload it to the database for the Old Master to review.</p><p></p><p>In the future, they would inevitably find more and more life-bearing planets, perhaps exceeding his capacity to research them all. In simple terms, the number of planets discovered surpassed his research speed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, most knowledge was universal, with only a few special cases that were not as numerous as imagined.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the situations of his former students in the infinite lands, Mount Ya shook his head and thought: "Originally, not many of the students I did not accept wanted to seek me out, less than one-tenth. The others had their own ideas, so let them be."</p><p></p><p>These former interlopers had become rulers of their respective races for nearly ten thousand years. What glory and wealth had they not experienced? What they now pursued was merely more knowledge and greater power.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Infinite Gate could provide these, but exploring the infinite lands was also possible.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the infinite lands represented infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>What the three of them could achieve, the people of the infinite lands could also achieve, perhaps even better.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot let everyone in this world become the same. There must be differences. Only through contrasts can one easily discern the strengths and weaknesses of things."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Mount Ya no longer paid attention to those students. Let them find their own paths in the future!</p><p></p><p>Mount Ya slowly closed his eyes. His small self left this avatar body and returned to a newly discovered planet to research a recently found civilized world.</p><p></p><p>That's right, this was a civilized planet found by disciples of the Infinite Gate. However, it was not a humanoid civilization, but rather a fist-sized spherical flying life form living in the forest, resembling fairy sprites from a child's imagination.</p><p></p><p>However, their civilization level was very low, only using simple symbols to record information. Their situation in the forest was not good - one could say that without banding together for survival, these fairy sprites could be bullied by larger creatures in the forest.</p><p></p><p>What interested Mount Ya was that these fairy sprites possessed a unique ability - puppetry.</p><p></p><p>Some special individuals could invade the bodies of larger creatures, taking over as their own.</p><p></p><p>This was the fairy sprites' weapon for defending their homeland.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few thousand years, the Infinite Gate and the Twin Blades Sect had found many such special civilized worlds. Mount Ya delighted in these new discoveries.</p><p></p><p>Only now did he truly understand what the Old Master pursued.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing such strange and wondrous things did indeed bring immense joy.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Old Master was born for this purpose. And I am fortunate to participate in this, witnessing the marvels of the universe."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you're over eight thousand years old, why haven't you gotten married yet?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling glared at Cong Renfei in the co-pilot seat, "Little Fei, you've grown up and become headstrong, huh? You're even sticking your nose into whether I get married or not."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei sighed, "I'm over eight thousand years old too, why do you still think I haven't grown up...You know how hard it is to be a younger brother?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Hey, having an older sister manage you and take care of your life, you should be secretly enjoying it!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "I can't control whether you want to get married or not, but I want to take a wife! Over these years, I've talked about marriage with over a thousand girls, but you scared them all away. It's really too difficult for me. If our mother knew, she would definitely pull your ear and scold you harshly."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Were the girls you took a fancy to decent? I didn't see a single good one, they were all after your status. If you married one, who knows how much trouble she'd cause? In the end, they might not even respect me as your older sister.</p><p></p><p>Besides, I vetted them privately, and not a single one was worthy of you."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said helplessly, "They crave my status and power, I crave their youthful beauty - it's fair, right? There's nothing wrong with that. I think as long as they're good-looking, they're worthy of me..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "I'm not listening. I'm the older sister so you have to listen to me. In the future if I meet a suitable girl, I'll help pick her for you."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "..."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his desire to take a wife was not that strong, otherwise he would have to fight with his sister.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei thought secretly, "Whether I get married or not doesn't really matter. I don't even want kids. Over the years, I've been with over a thousand gorgeous girls anyway, so it's not too bad overall."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Get ready, we're about to reach the designated location. Prepare to jump to the 'Orchid System' next door. Little Fei, activate the gravity drive, I'll link the shuttle to the star system network."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei acknowledged and began operating the controls on the front display.</p><p></p><p>"Hum..."</p><p></p><p>The entire shuttle shook slightly, releasing a brilliant glow, then retracting it as an intense gravitational force spontaneously generated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cong Shuling's soul had already connected to the shuttle's mainframe and entered the star system network, locating the 'Orchid System' and locking onto a suitable position to calculate the landing point.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the shuttle's mainframe transmitted a precise spatial module model.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to use her psychic feelers to locate the corresponding spatial module.</p><p></p><p>About five minutes later, Cong Shuling rejoiced inwardly, "Success!"</p><p></p><p>'Transmit'!</p><p></p><p>The two of them then exited the shuttle.</p><p></p><p>As Cong Renfei stored the shuttle into subspace, he said, "We've already crossed the boundless void to another star system! Every time we complete a jump, I feel it's extraordinarily miraculous. I can't fathom how this shuttle manages to leap such vast distances. Our master and senior martial uncle are truly celestial beings, capable of anything."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling nodded in agreement, "The more I learn and grow stronger, the more I'm amazed by our master and senior martial uncle's immense power. It's simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Previously, I thought our master and senior martial uncle were once ordinary people who gradually grew stronger after luckily learning a vast amount of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>But the more I experience, the more I feel this is impossible.</p><p></p><p>Because in this universe, an ordinary person without guidance from a powerful existence could never, no matter what, attain such formidable abilities.</p><p></p><p>Even with a lifespan of millions or tens of millions of years, it would be impossible to leave one star system and come to another without that.</p><p></p><p>So the answer is only one - as you said, our master and senior martial uncle are celestial beings, born with innate knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Other than this, I cannot think of any other reason to explain their immense power."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei scratched his head, "I'm so smart now, yet there are still things I can't comprehend. Inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "You're just good at using your brain, not actually smart at all. Let's go, we'll search separately, one person per side, scouring this star system."</p>

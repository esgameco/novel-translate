        <h1>Chapter 662</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao figured out these few questions, he believed he had found the sensing material for the 'Ill-Fate System'.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Suhao believed that this sensing material was highly likely to be those semi-transparent high-quality substances he had seen.</p><p></p><p>There were three reasons:</p><p></p><p>First, this substance transformed from the materials on the spacecraft after its disintegration. </p><p></p><p>He confirmed that this transformation was definitely not caused by the particle flow, nor was it produced after an explosion from the source on the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>So the only possibility was that it was a special material produced after the invisible yet massive energy of the Ill-Fate System converged.</p><p></p><p>Second, there were no particles of such great mass on the spacecraft, or in other words, the original material of these particles was just ordinary matter, yet now they had inexplicably gained tremendous mass out of nowhere. What was the source of this tremendous mass?</p><p></p><p>This again indirectly proved that the semi-transparent substance was the material produced when the energy of the Ill-Fate System converged.</p><p></p><p>Third, based on Suhao's judgment of the relationship between matter and energy in this world, he had always believed that when matter is produced, it must inevitably affect other matter, and all things that are mutually producing must have an inherent connection.</p><p></p><p>It can also be simply described as Suhao's knowledge and judgment of the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Commonly known as the sixth sense.</p><p></p><p>The material produced by the energy of the Ill-Fate System must inevitably have a certain correlation with the Ill-Fate System, and must be able to find the corresponding energy of the Ill-Fate System through it.</p><p></p><p>This is like the principle that 'around extremely poisonous things, there must be accompanying antidotes'.</p><p></p><p>After connecting all the links, Suhao was excitedly overwhelmed: "That's it! This is what I've been looking for."</p><p></p><p>However, a new problem arose now. The particle flow was becoming increasingly massive, making it impossible to go out, and the semi-transparent substance was also gradually moving away. Suhao was completely unable to get his hands on it for proper research.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he could only look at it now, not touch it.</p><p></p><p>This was truly an upsetting thing. The material he had been searching for hundreds of years was right in front of him, yet he couldn't get his hands on it.</p><p></p><p>It was just like watching the female lead in a movie, extremely frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"There's too little of this material, so little that even if I got it all, it might not be enough for me to study. But no matter, I know where there's more of this material, and a lot more!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Suhao didn't hesitate and directly chose to transmit to the other side of the 'second-level space', and then locked onto the positioning stone left on the source planet, transmitting back without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>That's right! The material Suhao was looking for was on the source planet. After wandering the universe for a few hundred years, he had ultimately returned to this place.</p><p></p><p>"The small island on the source planet was once violently impacted by the Ill-Fate System, so there must be remnants of this semi-transparent material!"</p><p></p><p>If Suhao's guess was correct, and the semi-transparent material was indeed the material with sensing ability produced by the Ill-Fate System, then he would definitely be able to find it on the source planet!</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if Suhao couldn't find this semi-transparent material on the source planet, it would mean that this semi-transparent material was not produced by the Ill-Fate System, and was not the material with special sensitivity to the Ill-Fate System's energy that Suhao was looking for.</p><p></p><p>But if it wasn't there, it didn't matter!</p><p></p><p>What if his judgment was wrong?</p><p></p><p>Who was he? As long as he saw it once, could it really escape him?</p><p></p><p>If there's one, there must be a second!</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly transmitted back to the remaining satellite of the source planet. He didn't rush to the source planet, but instead stayed to set up the 'focus system' with the little energy he had left, converting the materials on the satellite into a sufficient amount of source.</p><p></p><p>Then, he used the obtained source to convert it into blood energy and spiritual power that he could flexibly wield.</p><p></p><p>Then he converted the source again, then converted blood energy and spiritual power, cycling like this until he obtained enough spiritual power and blood energy.</p><p></p><p>After staying on the satellite for a month, Suhao finally recovered to a normal state.</p><p></p><p>At this point, his physical body had recovered, containing immense blood energy and spiritual power, and he had re-engraved a new 'core compound rune', with his spiritual perception returning to its peak state.</p><p></p><p>Although his physical body was extremely weak and his vitality had declined to the extreme, in terms of relative strength, he was not much weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>With only a head left, he was able to recover to the peak state soon after, simply invincible.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain unlimited vitality and cells that could regenerate at will, then he would truly be invincible!</p><p></p><p>Suhao stood up and moved his newly acquired body around. Apart from his severely depleted vitality and weakened flesh, he didn't feel anything particularly special.</p><p></p><p>Still powerful!</p><p></p><p>Suhao continuously flashed from the satellite and quickly returned to this long-missed planet.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he had just been reborn here, it was completely different.</p><p></p><p>A scorched wasteland, filled with deathly stillness!</p><p></p><p>Many places were still emitting thick smoke, the atmosphere everywhere filled with dust particles, the oceans turned a murky color, emitting a black glow.</p><p></p><p>The terrain and topography were also completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the current state of this planet, one could not see any similarity to the previous source planet.</p><p></p><p>Suhao headed straight for the location of the original small world base, and soon hovered over the former small island.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was no trace of the small island left, only a stretch of churning black sea.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the location, he plunged into the murky water, diving to the seabed.</p><p></p><p>The seawater was now slightly acidic, dark and gloomy, devoid of any life.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether any microorganisms could survive tenaciously.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there were!</p><p></p><p>The history of this planet may have seen even harsher environments than this, yet life still managed to continue and develop into the source civilization.</p><p></p><p>The current state was just a trifle!</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly dived to the seabed.</p><p></p><p>In no time, he found what he was looking for - the semi-transparent material!</p><p></p><p>There was simply too much of it.</p><p></p><p>It was almost covering the entire seabed!</p><p></p><p>After going around in circles, he had returned to this place.</p><p></p><p>The thing he had searched for so long and couldn't find was actually right under his nose.</p><p></p><p>Such are the vicissitudes of life.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, if he hadn't chosen to stay behind and clean up the battlefield as per his usual habit after the spacecraft's collapse, perhaps he wouldn't have discovered the outward-flying semi-transparent material.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't see the semi-transparent material, he wouldn't have known all this.</p><p></p><p>And ultimately, he might not have returned to that small island on the source planet, nor found these special things.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually created a small world and put all the semi-transparent material he could find into it. Then he flashed up to the surface and flew away from there at top speed.</p><p></p><p>On the continent, he randomly found a place to set up a temporary base to study these semi-transparent materials.</p><p></p><p>All the answers lay within these materials.</p><p></p><p>He only had less than 500 years left in his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>But these 500 years were completely enough for Suhao! As long as he successfully found the Ill-Fate System and broke through its enclosure, even if he only had 5 years left, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the universe where the source planet was located was so silent, so silent that he was the only one there. However, Suhao didn't feel the slightest bit of loneliness.</p><p></p><p>Because he was doing what he wanted to do!</p><p></p><p>Did he need anyone else to accompany him?</p>

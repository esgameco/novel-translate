        <h1>Chapter 824</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Yonsei and Barry froze slightly as they listened.</p><p></p><p>How could a Deity not know how to become a Deity? Even if one didn't know before metamorphosing into a deity, after completing the metamorphosis, one would definitely know the answer.</p><p></p><p>Barry subconsciously retorted Su Hao, ''Your Excellency Javi don't joke with us, as a deity, one is bound to know everything. The difference is that each deity has different abilities, and for you to say that you don't know, that's simply admitting that you're not a deity ......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yong Shi suddenly spoke out, "Barry, stop talking!"</p><p></p><p>Barry turned his head to look at Yong Shi in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi shook his head at Barry and looked at Su Hao's eyes, which became very sharp: "What you should know, you don't need to say more, and what you shouldn't know, you don't need to say more. So, it's right not to say anything."</p><p></p><p>This was a bit of a roundabout way to make Barry confused, but he still fell silent and quietly looked at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said indifferently, "Isn't it good to make casual small talk, why did you suddenly stop talking when you were talking about it, does the experience of turning into a deity really embarrass you guys that much? It's really curious."</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi suddenly said, "Jia Wei, you are actually different from us, you are not a deity, are you!"</p><p></p><p>Barry froze.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Oh? Why do you say that? What else could it be if it's not a deity, without reaching the level of a deity, how could it bring you here?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi revealed a rare smile and said, "I wasn't so sure just now, but when you asked me this, I became even more certain that you aren't a deity. In that case, all my doubts make sense. I said why I couldn't perceive a new god being born, why I couldn't perceive your existence, it turns out that you aren't a deity at all. You are just a ...... mortal!"</p><p></p><p>Barry: "???"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Consider me a mortal, so can you tell me what I want to know? How did you guys metamorphose from an ordinary person to a deity?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi said, "This belongs to the secrets of deities, you, a mortal, have no right to know, I refuse to answer your question."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could no longer remember how the last person who refused to answer his question, he just couldn't figure out, asking some questions was just a matter of casual chit-chat, why must his mouth be stubborn and not say anything, he had to let him come to the hard way.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning of the conversation, Su Hao used the source ability of 'let's be friends', as long as he turned these two deities into his friends, he believed that whatever he wanted to know, he could smoothly learn from the two deities.</p><p></p><p>But inexplicably, this unrivaled ability failed on these two deities for reasons that were not yet clear.</p><p></p><p>He slowly got up, his tone of voice not changing in the slightest, ''Since neither of you are cooperating, I'll take matters into my own hands! What I want to know, I still have to rely on myself."</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi and Barry immediately got up and backed away, looking at Su Hao warily.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Yong Shi's mouth slowly hooked up, and he softly said, "Are you planning to do it the hard way? But I'm very sorry to tell you that coming hard doesn't necessarily get you what you want to know. It just so happens that I also want to try to see what kind of power you, a mortal, have, to even presume to probe the secrets between the gods."</p><p></p><p>Although Barry didn't understand how Eternal had decided that Javi was just a mortal, he wasn't afraid since he was going to start a fight.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that since disconnecting from his main body, his soul power was degrading, and this will hidden within his body was gradually weakening, and if this trend continued, it would completely crumble and dissipate in at most another ten days' time.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the only way to avoid the collapse of this will was to leave this weird place and regain contact with his body, which also made him realize one thing: a will without a core couldn't last long.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't change the fact that it was collapsing, it would be better to fight with this Javi and find out what exactly his abilities were.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also had the exact same intention, wanting to test out what power these deities actually had. If he was in his main body now, he definitely wouldn't have done anything to test it, but he was now a [God] doppelganger, so it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi suddenly raised his fist and slammed it hard on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>With a loud bang, the little dirt within this small space that was isolated, crumbled layer by layer under the vigorous bombardment, rising upwards one after another, just like the splash of water raised by a large rock hitting the surface of the water.</p><p></p><p>It was also this splash of water that blocked the three people's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's thoughts moved, and ''Nian Ruyi'' surged out, filling up this small space.</p><p></p><p>'Fixation'!</p><p></p><p>Including Yong Shi and Barry, they all froze and couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>Purple and golden rich light emerged from Yong Shi and Barry's bodies at the same time, in diffusing within the space.</p><p></p><p>''Break the ban''!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, "Is it the same principle as the soul breaking technique? The effect of a deity using it is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao had already studied this kind of soul art, as long as he let Xiao Guang isolate his consciousness protection, he would not be affected by this kind of soul art.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of regaining freedom, Yong Shi raised his right finger, quietly pointing it towards Su Hao's brow, while Barry similarly turned his vertical palm into a blade, gently slashing in Su Hao's direction, heading straight for his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Bare..."</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh--"</p><p></p><p>A slender purple ray and a golden arc blade shot out violently, arriving in front of Su Hao in no particular order, the attacks were executed extremely fast, coupled with such a close distance, there was no room for evasion under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't think of dodging, he just raised his palm full of crystal armor and blocked it in front of his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>The purple ray instantly penetrated Su Hao's palm, while the golden curved blade cut off the hand that was erected against it from Su Hao's elbow.</p><p></p><p>The two attacks went on unabated, accurately shooting at Su Hao's vitals, and at the same time, a faint golden film lit up on Su Hao's body.</p><p></p><p>"Ding! Ding!"</p><p></p><p>After two crunching sounds, the attacks dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's other hand caught the broken arm and then attached it to the break.</p><p></p><p>"Ka ka ka ka~"</p><p></p><p>The repair was completed in the blink of an eye, while the exact strength of the attack was gathered.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but praise, "What a sharp attack. However, it seems that it's still a bit short, so you guys work harder. Now it's my turn to perform the attack."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out a finger, and golden light continued to converge at his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi frowned, staring at the golden light at Su Hao's fingertip, then turned to the light golden shield shrouding his body, his eyes slowly narrowing as he sent a message to Barry, who nodded imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, Su Hao's cannon strike was ready, pointing out towards the two.</p><p></p><p>''Destruction Cannon''!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's expectation was that this cannonball would be able to wreak havoc on this small space several times, but analyzing from the strength of those two attacks just now, such a cannonball's power wouldn't kill the two deities directly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's destructive cannon didn't shoot at the two deities, but instead shot into the land in between them.</p><p></p><p>The two deities jumped away to the sides with a grave expression, while making preparations for protection.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The isolated space of the small world suddenly exploded violently, and the entire space could barely be seen as a normal scene, all of which was filled with smoke, dust, and stone particles splattering. The soil that was originally used as the ground was already shattered and floating in mid-air, flowing violently with the chaotic air currents.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a golden light quietly lit up from one side, unexpectedly crossing the heavy dust barrier, enveloping Su Hao's entire body.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was slightly surprised, "After being abused by a round of cannonballs, there is still such vigor."</p><p></p><p>Before he had time to perceive the impact of the golden light attack, a brilliant purple ray shot out from the space barrier behind Su Hao, heading straight for his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao saw all of Barry and Yong Shi's small actions in his eyes, but Yong Shi's operation still slightly surprised him.</p><p></p><p>This God of Darkness even utilized the characteristics of the 'opposite space barrier' set up by Su Hao to quietly send out an attack to the other side that Su Hao couldn't see, and after passing through the 'opposite space barrier', the attack suddenly appeared from behind Su Hao, and accurately shot at Su Hao's head! .</p><p></p><p>Although the attack was very sudden, Su Hao still had time to evade into the 'secondary space'.</p><p></p><p>But did he need to dodge?</p><p></p><p>No. Let's wait until these two can break his 'Crisp Defense'!</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't even break his brittle defense, then he would be too disappointed in the gods of this world.</p><p></p><p>Such a good power system, but they wouldn't use it, a waste.</p><p></p><p>The purple light was swift and lightning came to the back of Su Hao's head, attacking on Su Hao's brittle defense.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time, the golden light cast by the God of Gold-Barry became incomparably bright.</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's entire head violently burst apart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yong Shi and Barry, whose mouth corners were overflowing with blood and their bodies were in an abnormal mess, had a relieved heart, "Won!"</p><p></p><p>A mortal, even if he was more powerful, would die immediately after his brain suffered a destructive attack.</p><p></p><p>The reason why their gods were called gods was precisely because they were immortal, no matter how many times they abused their flesh a hundred times a thousand times, or even burned their flesh to ashes, it would do nothing to them.</p><p></p><p>However, just when the two deities thought that the battle was over, they saw that the enemy in front of them actually stretched out his hand, wanting to touch his own head that was no longer there ......</p><p></p><p>Then a hand touched empty.</p><p></p><p>It looked like this headless body was quite puzzled.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 745</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was formed by the planet's special gravity and motion compression?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly shook his head, it was only a possibility!</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the two chief elders and asked, "What should we do? Give a demonstration!"</p><p></p><p>The elderly mushroom person glanced at the middle-aged mushroom person. </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged mushroom person nodded and walked forward.</p><p></p><p>After making a special gesture to worship the Earth God, the mushroom cap opened up like an umbrella, covering the entire body on the ground, like a large bowl overturned on the ground...</p><p></p><p>The 'earth tendril' tail behind the umbrella-like mushroom cap raised up, and the 'earth tendril eye' at the end suddenly bloomed like a flower, revealing a large number of red fleshy tendrils inside, densely packed like a flower bud, which is the reproductive part of a plant.</p><p></p><p>It then slowly approached the exposed oval blue crystal around the round platform, layer upon layer enveloping the blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>At the moment it was enveloped, the middle-aged mushroom person shuddered, but quickly regained composure.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the elderly mushroom person said, "The dream stone is a spiritual need for the creatures on our planet, equivalent to humans' 'drugs', with addictive properties, but not very harmful to the body.</p><p></p><p>We compound eye people have always lived underground, precisely because we cannot leave the dream stones.</p><p></p><p>Only by going underground near the dream stones can we feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Especially entering the 'star-gazing world' using the dream stones, it gives us immense pleasure, which is the pursuit of most compound eye people.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Earth God gave us the ability to enter the 'star-gazing world', but also confined us to this planet.</p><p></p><p>We saw the colorful universe very early on, but regrettably, no one was willing to go out.</p><p></p><p>Only when the Octopus Clan grew completely and destroyed countless civilizations did we belatedly realize, but it was too late..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was only slightly interested in the history of the compound eye people, nowhere near as interested as he was in the 'star-gazing world'.</p><p></p><p>He walked slowly to the side of the middle-aged compound eye person, curiously looking at it, then turned to ask the elderly mushroom person, "Has it entered the star-gazing world? What is the star-gazing world like?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly mushroom person nodded, "Correct, it is the chief elder of this Earth God Temple, with considerable ability. It has now entered the star-gazing world. If it wishes, it can even see things happening on distant stars, including the Octopus Clan's mother planet Houyan.</p><p></p><p>As for what the star-gazing world is like..."</p><p></p><p>It pondered for a moment, seemingly organizing its words, then said after a while, "In the star-gazing world, we have a peculiar perspective. Under this perspective, distant distances are no longer constraints, and distant planets become within reach.</p><p></p><p>Our souls seem to be liberated and can roam among the various planets, clearly seeing what happened at that time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we can only see things happening on the planets. The farther away from the planets, the more blurred what we see becomes."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked in surprise, "You have been in contact with the dream stones for so long, but you have never studied why they allow you to roam other planets?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly mushroom person smiled bitterly, "We regard the dream stones as the mouthpiece of the Earth God, a divine object bestowed upon us compound eye people by the Earth God. Who would think of studying divine objects?</p><p></p><p>Over the long period of time, our understanding of the dream stones was limited to the 'star-gazing world'.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Octopus Clan brought the threat of extinction that our people finally woke up, but it was too late! There was not enough time, and we could not research anything."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled slightly, "Too late? Not too late. As your friend, haven't I come to help you all?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly one's heart was extremely conflicted. It hoped that its own people could personally research this themselves, rather than relying on a human. But this human in front of it was after all its friend.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for a friend to come help, and moreover, it should help its friend too, even if it was scolded as a "compound eye traitor" by its fellow tribesmen.</p><p></p><p>But, it still felt a bit strange...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at the middle-aged mushroom person and said, "If I touch it, will there be any problem?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, as long as the connection between the earth tendril eye and the dream stone is not severed, it will not easily wake up."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao extended his hand to touch the middle-aged mushroom person, absorbing its physical form including its consciousness information into his blood energy, and then entered the bouncing realm space, retrieving its information.</p><p></p><p>"Little Light, retrieve this experimental subject's visual data."</p><p></p><p>"Received, please wait a moment, Mr. Su Hao."</p><p></p><p>Little Light quickly parsed the middle-aged mushroom person's consciousness information, then precisely retrieved the current visual data.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a patch of blackness appeared.</p><p></p><p>Nothing could be seen! In other words, the middle-aged mushroom person's eyes were not currently seeing anything.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned, "It seems that what the compound eye people call 'seeing' is not truly seeing in the literal sense, but more like scenes from the imagination. Unfortunately, I cannot yet analyze the imagined scenes!</p><p></p><p>In other words, to know what the compound eye people see in the 'star-gazing world', I need to analyze their physical structure and mechanisms, and then equip myself with a corresponding 'earth tendril eye'."</p><p></p><p>"You can first create a clone of a compound eye person, then use 'control clone' to try entering the so-called 'star-gazing world'."</p><p></p><p>He exited the bouncing realm space and came to another dream stone, carefully observing this blue crystal that gave off a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Then he reached out and grasped a dream stone.</p><p></p><p>It felt smooth and warm in his hand, like holding a piece of warm jade.</p><p></p><p>But there was no special feeling.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he retracted his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was normal, perhaps to connect with the dream stones and enter the star-gazing world required special sensory nerve cells, which as the body of an [Octopus God], he precisely lacked.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the eyes and hands both have many nerve cells, but only the eyes can see light while the hands cannot.</p><p></p><p>Different sensory cells have different functions.</p><p></p><p>And the compound eye people's 'earth tendril eyes' were the key.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the key point, Su Hao immediately made plans for the follow-up:</p><p></p><p>One, comprehensively analyze the compound eye people's earth tendril eyes;</p><p></p><p>Two, create a clone body of the compound eye people;</p><p></p><p>Four, transplant the compound eye people's abilities onto the [God] body;</p><p></p><p>Six, break free of the limitations of the Earth God planet, and make the star-gazing world a permanent ability...</p><p></p><p>Going to great lengths to analyze the star-gazing world, but being unable to take it away - this was something Su Hao would not allow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he believed that as long as he could analyze the core principles, then no matter what abilities or conditions were involved, he could find a way to recreate them.</p><p></p><p>He said softly, "Let's stop here for today! Oh right, you are the grand chief elder of the compound eye people, right? Find me a few compound eye people with the talent of 'star-gazing priests', I want to chat with them, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this wondrous race."</p><p></p><p>The grand chief elder nodded, "Very well! But they may not necessarily acknowledge you as a friend, or be willing to chat much with you, after all you are a human."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "No problem, just find them over."</p><p></p><p>He slowly walked out of the star-gazing Earth God Temple, looking at the unique scenery of this planet, revealing a slight smile, "The star-gazing world? Very intriguing indeed. So, starting from today, this planet belongs to me!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao expanded the underground space of the compound eye people's star-gazing Earth God Temple and carried out some reorganization, transforming the Earth God Temple into his permanent laboratory.</p><p></p><p>In the laboratory, besides himself, there were dozens of compound eye people who were "invited" to participate in the research project. Originally these compound eye people were very resistant to Su Hao's experiments, but after Su Hao communicated with them, their attitudes changed completely, and they all expressed that they would fully cooperate with Su Hao's experiments.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed his progress to be very rapid. With a large number of samples for reference, it only took him half a year to figure out the compound eye people's brain domain signal nodes.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the bouncing realm space, randomly selected the consciousness information of a mushroom person, and instructed Little Light, "Little Light, activate 'control clone'."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Mr. Su Hao."</p><p></p><p>The scene changed, and he appeared in a small space, lying down naturally. A reclining chair appeared out of thin air to support him, and the surrounding lights gradually dimmed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a mushroom person suddenly fell into a daze, but opened its eyes again very shortly, regaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Only in the blink of an eye, its consciousness had changed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly got up, trying to take a few steps, but almost tripped himself up with his left foot catching his right foot.</p><p></p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched, finally understanding why these short compound eye people kept tripping and falling - it turned out they were simply not used to standing upright and running.</p><p></p><p>After adapting for a while and ensuring there were no issues, he headed towards the giant blue crystal in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's try entering the star-gazing world!"</p><p></p><p>His actions caught the attention of the other mushroom people.</p><p></p><p>A mushroom girl who looked delicate blinked her eyes and said, "Chang Tong, what are you going to do? Enter the star-gazing world?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao not respond, the mushroom girl continued, "Without Elder Jia Wei's permission, we cannot touch the dream stones. Do you want to lose Jia Wei as a friend?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao found her too noisy and glanced back at her.</p><p></p><p>The mushroom girl was immediately so frightened by Su Hao's gaze that she scurried backwards, her heart in disbelief, "Chang Tong actually... actually looked at me with such a terrifying gaze... Does he not love me anymore?</p><p></p><p>I... I need to find another one, to soothe this wounded heart of mine!"</p>

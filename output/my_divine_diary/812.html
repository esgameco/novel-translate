        <h1>Chapter 812</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the dragon's lair, four red golden dragons, one large and three small, surrounded a wet human corpse.</p><p></p><p>The eldest dragon brother Chipu and second eldest dragon sister Moli were very curious, wanting to take a bite multiple times, but were stopped by their dragon mother Shaduo.</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo's eyes were full of astonishment. She was absolutely certain that this human was the divine envoy who had previously injured her, with swift speed and tremendous power - she was no match for him. </p><p></p><p>But this divine envoy seemed fine, so how did he suddenly die?</p><p></p><p>And with blood gushing from the seven orifices, his death was extremely horrific.</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo used her soul power to examine the divine envoy's body and found that his entire brain had been smashed into a pulp.</p><p></p><p>The more she thought about it, the more something seemed amiss. She couldn't help but look towards her youngest son Leian. She clearly remembered that it was after Leian said "fell into the sea" that this divine envoy fell into the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored dragon mother Shaduo's doubtful gaze and pointed at the divine envoy's corpse, asking, "Mother Shaduo, is this a divine envoy of the human gods? Doesn't look that special."</p><p></p><p>The "divine envoys" of the human gods sounded so formidable to Suhao's ears, but he never expected that a casual "Locking Fist" would kill one.  He regretted not being able to gauge the full extent of this divine envoy's power.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "If I had known these so-called divine envoys were so weak, I should have captured him to experiment on him thoroughly. But it's too late now, what a pity. Safety comes first. Besides, it seems there are many divine envoys, so I can find another one in the future."</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo nodded and said, "This human was indeed a divine envoy of the human gods, possessing extremely powerful soul force. He could be considered the strongest under the gods themselves. Even we adult golden dragons are generally no match for a divine envoy. The only ones who can contend with human divine envoys are our dragon tribe's Dragon Masters.</p><p></p><p>If you encounter one in the future, run as far away as possible. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao took this opportunity to demonstrate the power of his "variant golden dragon" abilities to mother Shaduo, so she wouldn't find it too abrupt when he used various abilities later.</p><p></p><p>He waved his tiny paws and said, "Mother Shaduo, but for such a powerful divine envoy, I only had to lightly hit him once and he died."</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo lowered her head to look at Suhao. "Leian, are you saying...you killed this human divine envoy?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Yes, when he flew over, I punched him and he fell into the sea."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shaduo's confused expression, he explained, "Mother Shaduo, my fists can strike anything, anywhere. Look at that rock over there, I just need to stand here and lightly punch, and I can shatter it."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he punched the ground. At the point of impact between his fist and the ground, there was no sound at all. Instead, a rock far away suddenly shattered, startling the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "So when this human divine envoy charged in earlier, I just punched his head and killed him."</p><p></p><p>As Suhao explained, dragon mother Shaduo immediately imagined that horrific scene, causing the scales all over her body to stand on end.</p><p></p><p>She did not sense even the slightest fluctuation of soul force from Suhao.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't a soul technique...it definitely wasn't a soul technique.</p><p></p><p>At such a close distance, any fluctuation of soul force should not have escaped her perception.</p><p></p><p>But if it wasn't a soul technique, then what was it? An innate ability of the variant golden dragon?</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand what mother Shaduo comprehended, but it seemed he didn't need to explain further.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Shaduo pointed to another rock and said, "Leian, try using your innate ability to attack that rock."</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't hesitate and punched with his Locking Fist.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The distant rock shattered.</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo focused all her attention, carefully sensing if there was any fluctuation of soul force, but even as the rock shattered, she did not perceive the slightest bit.</p><p></p><p>This made dragon mother Shaduo confirm: it was an innate ability, not a soul technique.</p><p></p><p>To better demonstrate his ability, Suhao walked to the edge of the cave and pointed towards the sea, saying, "Mother Shaduo, I can sense there is a sea beast down there. I can knock it out with one punch."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Suhao estimated the location of the sea beast's brain and punched the ground.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the water below started churning, as if a huge sea beast was writhing in pain.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Looks like I didn't hit its brain. Then..."</p><p></p><p>He bent down slightly, clenched his paws into fists, and rapidly threw a series of punches, almost creating afterimages.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, a massive sea beast slowly floated up, dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>This time, dragon mother Shaduo had no more doubts. When she looked at Suhao, it was like looking at a pile of shining treasure. With a little thought, she could understand the power of this ability - if used well, the explosive force would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Aside from gods and divine envoys, any other enemy, one by one, would suffer greatly at the hands of her third child Leian if caught off guard...</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo thought about how to guide her children, and praised, "Well done, Leian."</p><p></p><p>Then she swooped down, picked up the sea beast, and in no time had roasted it, filling the cave with a special aroma.</p><p></p><p>By now, Suhao no longer needed to consume large amounts of food to transform his blood energy. After eating enough for physical development, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo was very concerned about her third child and asked caringly, "Leian, my child, does the sea beast not suit your taste?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Mother Shaduo, I'm already full. After successfully awakening my ability, I no longer need more food."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo was somewhat skeptical, but after thinking about it, what Suhao said did make sense, so she didn't dwell on it further. Instead, she said, "Leian, give your ability a nice name yourself! This is your own powerful force that may allow you to defeat extremely powerful enemies."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually said, "Then I'll call it 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits'."</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo: "Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits?"</p><p></p><p>After considering it carefully, it seemed...not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>She nodded and said, "Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits, good name, Leian!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the three young dragons finished eating, dragon mother Shaduo swallowed the remaining sea beast in a few bites, then went deep into the lair to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Shaduo gathered the three young dragons and said, "My dear children, our location has been exposed, so we must leave and find a new dwelling."</p><p></p><p>She lowered her body and spread her wings wide. "Hop on!"</p><p></p><p>The eldest dragon brother Chipu and second eldest dragon sister Moli were excited to move again and eagerly jumped onto mother Shaduo's back, calling out happily, "Woo woo! Moving homes! Going to fly!"</p><p></p><p>These two young dragons' language abilities had improved over this period of practice.</p><p></p><p>After jumping onto Shaduo's back, Suhao curiously asked, "Mother Shaduo, didn't we kill the human divine envoy? How was our location exposed?"</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, dragon mother Shaduo shook her head and said, "That human divine envoy did not truly die."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes widened. "Even with his brain smashed into pulp, he didn't die?"</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at the corpse lying to the side. It was clearly there, definitely not faking death.</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo smiled, "Leian, you're still too young to know the power of gods and their divine envoys. Gods and divine envoys are no longer ordinary lifeforms - you cannot kill them by destroying their physical bodies."</p><p></p><p>Suhao immediately thought of himself and pointed at the divine envoy's corpse. "So this isn't their true form, but an avatar?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo said, "This is indeed their true form, but simply destroying their body cannot kill them. Their will departs from the body and returns to the god, who will then revive them.</p><p></p><p>This is the most powerful aspect of gods and divine envoys. In a sense, they are immortal, unless you can destroy their will at the exact moment you kill their body."</p><p></p><p>The term "astral projection" popped into Suhao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Mother Shaduo, is there a way to destroy their will?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo smiled, "Of course there is a way. Supposedly there is a special soul technique called the 'Mind Disruption Art' that can destroy their will.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mind Disruption Art is a forbidden technique, and not many know it. I don't know it myself.</p><p></p><p>Even if you learn the Mind Disruption Art, it's not guaranteed you can destroy a divine envoy's will, because no one knows what the will is or where it resides.</p><p></p><p>So normally, it's impossible to destroy the will of gods and divine envoys. The gods and their divine envoys are the eternal rulers of this land."</p><p></p><p>Suhao breathed a sigh of relief. "As long as they can be defeated, that's good."</p><p></p><p>Dragon mother Shaduo was afraid her child would become arrogant due to his powerful innate abilities and look down on others, inviting disaster.</p><p></p><p>So she said very seriously, "Leian, my child, the gods are existences that cannot be opposed with force. Don't fantasize about challenging the gods and divine envoys, understand? What you should do is support our great golden dragon tribe's god, the 'Heavenly Stabilizing God - Nati', and live under His Majesty Nati's protection..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied in his childlike yet crisp voice, "I understand, mother Shaduo. I won't use force to oppose or challenge the gods. Don't worry!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 688</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The battle alarm soon sounded on the spaceship, and everyone entered combat mode at top speed.</p><p></p><p>They put on armor, then went to their battle stations, ready to act at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the commander gave the order, the crew would execute the command without hesitation, until the mission was completed, or they died, or received orders to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were two billion kilometers apart, which seemed very far, but for the vast universe and extremely fast spaceships, it was not a very distant distance.</p><p></p><p>Plus, the two sides were heading towards each other, so they would meet in less than ten hours.</p><p></p><p>After the Yaoxing ship turned around, the enemy fleet of the Eight-Armed Race seemed very puzzled that the small human patrol ship dared to turn around and take the offensive.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely rare situation.</p><p></p><p>They guessed the reasons: Did the humans know they couldn't escape, so they gave up fleeing and turned to fight a desperate battle as a last stand?</p><p></p><p>Or did the humans master some powerful weapon that could attack from an extremely long distance?</p><p></p><p>The video footage showed their fighters abruptly disappearing, or the enemy's bullets abruptly appearing, directly killing the fighters.</p><p></p><p>Until now, they hadn't figured out how the humans did this.</p><p></p><p>Could it be wormhole technology?</p><p></p><p>Because after many years of exploration, the great scientists of the Eight-Armed Race had unanimously concluded: "Spatial transfer only exists in theory and cannot be achieved within ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>But no matter what method the humans used, it didn't matter. This time they had made full preparations to deal with any situation, and there was no possibility of failure.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine, five warships forming an encirclement, moving in close, covering all curved spaces, and opening fire with full force - how could the humans resist?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the warships of both sides got closer and closer. The five warships of the Eight-Armed Race gradually spread out to the sides, forming a pocket, intending to envelop the Yaoxing ship within it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Yaoxing ship no longer approached, but changed direction, drawing a large arc and navigating to the right side of the ship.</p><p></p><p>This move left the Eight-Armed Race baffled again.</p><p></p><p>What did the human warship mean, was it going to fight or flee?</p><p></p><p>Their hearts couldn't help but race: "It's said that humans are exceptionally cunning and good at deception, and now that we've seen it, it's indeed true."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Eight-Armed Race had suffered losses at the hands of humans in this regard before.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they noticed something abnormal.</p><p></p><p>A tiny human fighter jet, like a mosquito, was flying straight towards the Leapfrog mothership.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race was completely baffled: "What kind of trick are the humans playing! Do they really think they can fight with just this tiny fighter jet? Or is this just a decoy to divert attention?"</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't figure it out, they wouldn't think too much about it. When it got closer, they would lock on with the main guns and destroy it directly.</p><p></p><p>The human patrol ship couldn't escape either way.</p><p></p><p>All these meaningless actions were just a futile struggle in the face of death.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao entered their firing range. The Leapfrog mothership, which was very vigilant, extended two gun barrels and locked on to fire.</p><p></p><p>"Open fire!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race showed no expression, killing an insect required no expression.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved that these meaningless, foolish actions of the humans were completely pointless.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next second, they couldn't help but reveal a look of astonishment: "Huh? That fighter jet hasn't been destroyed yet! Is the monitor delayed? Or did we miss?"</p><p></p><p>They were absolutely certain that the two energy beams had hit, the entire beam of light had enveloped it. If this didn't count as a hit, then what would?</p><p></p><p>After a while, they realized that the fighter jet was still approaching.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>So the mothership fired two more shots at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Again, direct hits!</p><p></p><p>But the fighter jet was completely unscathed, and even seemed to glow a bit brighter.</p><p></p><p>After the commander of the Leapfrog mothership learned about this, he quickly realized something was wrong and immediately ordered: "Launch fighter jets to intercept and destroy it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Then, like a fish spawning, the Leapfrog mothership released a dense swarm of Eight-Armed fighter jets from the rear, swarming towards Su Hao in droves.</p><p></p><p>This scene was enough to show the commander's cautious attitude.</p><p></p><p>Anything that posed a threat to the mothership would be given sufficient attention, and even the slightest possibility of damage to the mothership that could be ignored would be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>And this was the reason he became the mothership commander.</p><p></p><p>Stable enough!</p><p></p><p>Through the monitoring displays of the Eight-Armed fighters, all the pilots abruptly died when they approached within 50 kilometers of the human fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>They were just flying the fighters, then suddenly shook violently and became motionless, without exception.</p><p></p><p>The scene was extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Every Eight-Armed officer watching the monitor was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Then, all the Eight-Armed immediately realized the danger: "We can't let this human fighter jet get within 50 kilometers!"</p><p></p><p>However, what they didn't know was that Su Hao's attack range was actually 200 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the pilots of the Eight-Armed fighters failing to realize the danger and approaching the human fighter jet one after another, the mothership commander immediately reacted and ordered a retreat!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he roared: "Mothership, change course immediately, don't let the human fighter jet get close."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the commander, the mothership's speed is too fast, unable to turn in time to avoid the human fighter jet."</p><p></p><p>Even if they avoided it, the fighter jet piloted by Su Hao was very agile and could adjust its course to get close again.</p><p></p><p>The commander's tentacles rose up, twisting frantically in the air, while the large mouth hidden beneath the tentacles roared: "Open all weapons, including main guns, missiles, lasers, spatial shockwaves... All of them, aim at that human fighter jet, immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>Then countless projectiles of all sizes rained down on Su Hao. The lasers were the fastest, almost instantly enveloping Su Hao's fighter jet, followed closely by energy blasts. However, without exception, they all passed through Su Hao's fighter jet as if striking a mirage.</p><p></p><p>Then came various missiles...</p><p></p><p>The next second, Su Hao's expression changed drastically. He sensed a strange ripple sweeping past, causing the surrounding spatial modules to violently shake. Caught off guard, he lost control of space and was forcibly expelled from the "second space."</p><p></p><p>"What happened? My second space has been disabled!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the incoming missiles, Su Hao's spiritual tentacles surged out frantically.</p><p></p><p>'Flash Step'!</p><p></p><p>"——"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao released his spell to conceal his form, then turned to look back and saw that the 'Crack-88' fighter jet he was piloting had been reduced to fragments.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "That was a close one... Luckily Flash Step could still barely be used!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, any carelessness could cost him his life!</p><p></p><p>Then, the armored Su Hao silently watched the distant Leapfrog mothership, his brow gradually furrowing: "What was that ripple that disrupted space just now? It felt similar to the effect of the dual spatial suppression runes I designed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the civilization of this world has mastered the ability to interfere with space? Looks like the danger level of this world is not low. I must proceed with caution!"</p><p></p><p>Having relied on his spatial abilities to be invincible, plus finding a way to avoid the Fate Waves, Su Hao had almost thought he was invincible again...</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed there was still some distance to true invincibility!</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Leapfrog mothership and thought inwardly: "I was originally planning to use the fighter jet as a disguise, but since you've destroyed my fighter jet, then I don't need to disguise anything anymore. I'll just charge in and wipe you all out!"</p><p></p><p>Then, the armored Su Hao stealthily transformed into [Fate Child], encasing his entire body in a thin layer of adamantine armor, and then...</p><p></p><p>'Flash Step' 'Flash Step' 'Flash Step'!</p>

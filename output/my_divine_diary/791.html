        <h1>Chapter 791</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the other two gradually became aware of the decay of their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>Even though they confirmed that their power did not diminish but increased instead, even though they could still live for over a thousand years, far exceeding ordinary people, the feeling of decay in their flesh and blood still pervaded their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The vibrant spiritual power within their bodies stood in stark contrast to their decaying flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>They realized that this body had entered old age.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan had died of old age before, so they didn't feel much about it. It was Feng Cheng, who had never aged before, who felt a little worried. He sighed frequently, lamenting the passing of time and that his youthful days were gone - he had less time filled with the vigor and vitality he had before.</p><p></p><p>One day, as Feng Cheng was lamenting that his days were numbered, Ya Shan could not help but say: "Feng Cheng, could you stop bringing this up every day? It's just getting old, what's there to lament? Which life does not grow old and die?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said sadly: "Master Ya Shan, you don't understand the feeling of watching your own unstoppable decay!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan snorted: "On the contrary, I understand it much better than you do."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Since you're afraid of dying, you could study why life grows old. Maybe you'll be able to unravel the secret of eternity."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng had no confidence in this: "I don't think I can figure this out. After all, even planets, star systems, galaxies, and the universe itself may be aging. For a tiny life form like me, aging is only natural."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Then what are you lamenting about?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "How should I put it? We've successfully solved many problems we've encountered. Even the 'Diversified Divine Egg' mission that Master Wei assigned me was completed smoothly over thousands of years. This made me a bit arrogant.</p><p></p><p>It's just that as powerful as we are, we are still so powerless in the face of time. What I'm lamenting is that deep sense of 'helplessness'.</p><p></p><p>It's as if time is telling me, 'I'm the butcher's knife that will kill you, what can you do about it?'</p><p></p><p>I really am helpless. Yeah...that's it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "The changes in mentality you're going through, Ya Shan and I have experienced long ago. The reason we seem nonchalant about it now is because we are looking for ways to resist the butcher's knife."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked curiously: "Have you found it, Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan replied directly: "Ordinary people can only live a hundred years, while you can live eight thousand years. Isn't that a way to resist the butcher's knife?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "Indeed, eight thousand years is not bad at all. But to live even longer...it's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at Su Hao in surprise.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao said: "It's not perfect yet. Relatively speaking, it's not much longer than eight thousand years. Living a bit longer this way doesn't mean much."</p><p></p><p>After years of research, Su Hao found that the 'spiritual brain' he created seemed to lack a core that a wise life form should have, unable to produce the multi-dimensional spiritual power he wanted.</p><p></p><p>This basically shattered his hope of attaining eternity through the 'spiritual brain'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the spiritual brain can be eternal, but the prerequisite is having 'spiritual power' to maintain regular updates. But the spiritual brain is precisely incapable of using spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if Su Hao uploads his consciousness into the spiritual brain now, gaining powerful cognitive and learning abilities, without spiritual power to regularly update the spiritual brain, it will naturally decay and die after a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The result is not much different.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he's willing to grant Ya Shan and Feng Cheng access permissions, then he could cleverly bypass this death loop. But Su Hao would never play such a dangerous game by handing over the core of his consciousness information to others.</p><p></p><p>Not even to his two most trusted companions.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Indeed, attaining eternity is not so easy. The spiritual brain and neural brain will both gradually age, it's just that the spiritual brain is different from the neural brain in that I can update it at any time to keep it evergreen. Once I lose the ability to update it, the spiritual brain is no different from the neural brain."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Su Hao's experiment of projecting his consciousness into the virtual world continued. He wanted to obtain more data about the spiritual brain and mental brain through this experiment, hopefully cracking the underlying multi-dimensional spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>However, the 'travelers' were no longer the first batch, having been replaced batch after batch.</p><p></p><p>Because after the first consciousness Su Hao tested struggled, became desperate and self-destructed, he decided that the consciousnesses used for testing would last no more than two hundred years before giving them a relatively peaceful termination.</p><p></p><p>Through years of experimental observation, Su Hao made a new discovery - he found a subtle difference between the spiritual brain and neural brain: explosive power.</p><p></p><p>The neural brain could give consciousness more powerful explosive force, while the spiritual brain had extremely strong comprehensive abilities but lacked this particular quality.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps spiritual power is related to this wondrous 'explosive force'."</p><p></p><p>With this new discovery, Su Hao continued his experiments on consciousness' 'explosive force'.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao found that the neural brain's explosive force was a natural attribute, which the spiritual brain precisely lacked.</p><p></p><p>It was like how glass is naturally transparent, while a girl's clothes are not transparent. Different materials exhibit different qualities.</p><p></p><p>So, was there a way for the spiritual brain to have the explosive attribute?</p><p></p><p>After extensive experiments, Su Hao reached a basic conclusion: No.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao raised another question: "Since the spiritual brain cannot naturally possess the explosive attribute, is it possible to simulate the explosive state?"</p><p></p><p>Simulating the state is certainly feasible, but it requires a massive amount of data.</p><p></p><p>He settled down and focused on his work.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and a thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>However, during this thousand years, the research on the spiritual brain and spiritual power yielded unsatisfactory results.</p><p></p><p>He could simulate explosive force, but after the simulated explosion, the consciousness within the spiritual brain would fall into a degree of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the person became stupid after one simulated explosion.</p><p></p><p>Then through further research, Su Hao discovered that the reason the consciousness fell into confusion after the spiritual brain's explosion was due to the spiritual brain's inherent nature - it lacked the neural brain's powerful 'fixed connection circuit'.</p><p></p><p>The neural 'fixed connection circuit'? No problem, Su Hao could simulate and create fixed circuits.</p><p></p><p>After doing so and testing it, a new problem emerged - the thought process became completely rigid, trapped in an endless loop...</p><p></p><p>So it went, solving one problem only for another to appear, then solving that and another emerges, as if in a big cycle, ending up back at the starting point - the spiritual brain simply lacked explosive force.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly said: "Damn it."</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao's research had temporarily reached a dead end, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's work was still progressing smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's task was to find a way to resist the massive radiation near black holes. He first gave Su Hao a simple report: "Master Wei, I've researched a 'Cone Force Field' that can greatly block particle attacks, cleverly deflecting them.</p><p></p><p>As long as I deploy the 'Cone Force Field', I can ignore the particles spewed out by the black hole and keep approaching it.</p><p></p><p>Ahem! However, I've tried getting close to the black hole multiple times, but there seems to be a relative limit. Once I reach a certain point, the 'Cone Force Field' loses control and collapses.</p><p></p><p>In the moment it collapses, before I can react, my 'Eight-Armed God' avatar is gone."</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the 'Cone Force Field' was not smooth, consuming a great deal of Ya Shan's time and effort.</p><p></p><p>When Ya Shan first tried it, he encountered immense difficulties.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that no matter how powerful his spiritual power was, the high-energy particle flow would gradually penetrate and destroy any defensive structure built from spiritual power from the outside.</p><p></p><p>When the repair speed was slower than the destruction speed, the 'Eight-Armed God' avatar would quickly be destroyed at the particle level.</p><p></p><p>So using a 'fragile shell defense' type of energy shield to confront the particle flow was an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>After struggling fruitlessly with energy structures for many years, Ya Shan changed his approach: using a 'force field' type of defense might work.</p><p></p><p>So he tried using a 'force field defense' against the particle flow, and the effect was unexpectedly good, blocking a certain type of particle and deflecting it away, preventing it from getting close.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the particles shooting out from the black hole were of too many varieties. To block them all, he had to study them one by one...</p><p></p><p>Thus, for nearly a thousand years, Ya Shan collected data on all kinds of particles near the black holes of various star systems. For each type of particle, he had to construct a corresponding force field defense, with the difficulty increasing as he went along.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until recently that he successfully designed and tested it.</p><p></p><p>The 'Cone Force Field' contained over six hundred different defensive force fields.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first praised Ya Shan, then asked, "Can you connect to the planetary network?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan grinned: "At the extreme position, without relying on the 'Gravity Array', I can connect to nearly thirty star systems. If we add Feng Cheng's Gravity Array, maybe we can reach a hundred.</p><p></p><p>However, at the extreme position, although I can access the network, transmitting is extremely laborious with a high failure rate. Moving back a bit and there's no problem.</p><p></p><p>Master Wei, I suggest we change the name of the planetary network. Calling it the 'Star System Network' would be more fitting."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily: "Alright, we'll call it the Star System Network from now on."</p><p></p><p>Though the star system is vast, it can be traversed in an instant.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 758</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao had Xia Qingjun produce the 'Insect Killing Cubes', planning to use the 'Planetary Network Transmission' technology to directly teleport the 'Insect Killing Cubes' into the air above the Eight-Armed Race's planets...</p><p></p><p>Delivering one 'Insect Killing Cube' to each of the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets, as many as needed.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining the effect made it seem unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>The massive Eight-Armed fleet was fiercely attacking human space domains, while their distant rear suddenly came under an extinction-level attack...</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown what the Eight-Armed fleet would feel when they suddenly lost contact with their headquarters one day.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they would think it was just a bad signal?</p><p></p><p>Doing this would benefit both sides.</p><p></p><p>Suhao would save himself a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>And humanity would gain a great battle worthy of being recorded in history.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One year later, at Victory Square in the center of Blue Light City.</p><p></p><p>It was piled high with 'Insect Killing Cubes', the result of humanity's full production over the past year.</p><p></p><p>Enough to drop one on each of the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets in the Cloud Ring System, with plenty to spare.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and other high-ranking human officials had gathered here, awaiting Suhao's arrival.</p><p></p><p>According to Jia Fengcheng, Xu Shiqiang would come here shortly to receive this batch of 'Insect Killing Cubes'.</p><p></p><p>To show respect for Xu Shiqiang, these people had all come to wait here. Of course, curiosity was also a factor.</p><p></p><p>They were all very curious about what Suhao planned to do with these 'Insect Killing Cubes'.</p><p></p><p>Could he really take these cubes himself and go drop them on the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets?</p><p></p><p>Even the fastest warped ships would take thousands of years to visit all those colony planets.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, that wouldn't resolve the current crisis!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others felt the poverty of their thinking, the more they thought about it, the more questions arose.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Fengcheng arrived first.</p><p></p><p>He came to the square, greeted Xia Qingjun and the others, then looked at the neatly arranged piles of 'Insect Killing Cubes' and praised, "Not bad efficiency! Let me inspect them first."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others immediately greeted Fengcheng in return.</p><p></p><p>Of the three - Suhao, Fengcheng and Yashan - they most preferred dealing with Suhao, because he was always calm and patient, able to explain many of their questions clearly and simply;</p><p></p><p>The one they least wanted to deal with was Yashan. Every time they saw him, even before anything happened, they felt a chill, as if one wrong move and this Mr. Jia Yashan would berate them like pigs, just like the over 1,000 people who knelt in the square to apologize decades ago...</p><p></p><p>It was just strange!</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng wouldn't just take what he said at face value, he had to inspect them himself before he could be reassured.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, he randomly pulled out hundreds of cubes from the piles and lined them up to inspect one by one.</p><p></p><p>After putting them back and randomly sampling hundreds more cubes repeatedly,</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled, "Not bad, the random sampling shows they're all qualified products. Alright, let me finish the final processing and sealing!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, his vast mental powers enveloping all the cubes, and with a wave of his hand, countless faintly glowing white 'source beads' suddenly appeared in mid-air, then surged towards the cubes in the square.</p><p></p><p>"Kaca kaca kaca!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp crackling sound.</p><p></p><p>Each source bead precisely embedded itself into a cube, without a single error.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the human leaders gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The divine humans truly lived up to their reputation, this casual display of power was beyond their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>And what were those white beads?</p><p></p><p>Of course, they had secretly studied them for a while, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>These three 'divine humans' were always so mysterious.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Fengcheng finished sealing all the cubes, then contacted Suhao in their group: "Old Master Wei, the 'Insect Killing Cubes' are ready."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the message, Suhao put down what he was doing and transmitted himself to appear beside Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>After randomly inspecting some cubes, he nodded, "Since the cubes are ready, we can begin."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun curiously asked, "Great One, what are you going to do with so many 'Insect Killing Cubes'?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course, to drop them on the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets, and see if we can wipe out most of the Eight-Armed Race in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>Though Xia Qingjun still had many questions, he didn't voice them.</p><p></p><p>Because for some reason, the normally affable Mr. Jia Fengcheng was now looking at them with a strange gaze...</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Stand back."</p><p></p><p>They were stunned for a moment, but obeyed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, numerous pink crystal formations appeared around Suhao's body, encasing him, and gradually forming extremely complex arrays that lit up.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others felt an immense attractive force emanating from Suhao, as if trying to pull them towards him.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions changed, and powerful forces within them instantly erupted as they retreated further.</p><p></p><p>Successfully accessing the 'Planetary Network', thousands of Suhao's sub-avatars scattered, each finding one of the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets.</p><p></p><p>Selecting suitable coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's vast computing power immediately activated.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Suhao waved his hand, and the cubes arranged in the square rose up, floating rhythmically in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>'Planetary Network Transmission'!</p><p></p><p>At first, Xia Qingjun and the others didn't notice anything unusual, but as the floating cubes became fewer, they finally realized something was different.</p><p></p><p>Someone said, "It seems the Insect Killing Cubes are decreasing, or is that my illusion?"</p><p></p><p>"No illusion, the Insect Killing Cubes are indeed disappearing..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this an ability to hit with 100% accuracy? Where are they being sent?"  </p><p></p><p>"I just heard Xu Shiqiang say these cubes were meant to be delivered to the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he sent these cubes to all the Eight-Armed colonies? Looking at the numbers, there are enough cubes to cover all their colonies."</p><p></p><p>"This...how is this possible? Do you know how vast the Cloud Ring System is? Either I'm going crazy or this world is crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just kidding, don't take it seriously. Perhaps he just stored these cubes elsewhere. After all, those three divine humans have the ability to come and go freely. How enviable."</p><p></p><p>"I actually hope he did send all these cubes to the Eight-Armed colonies. After all, whether we can win this war still depends on Xu Shiqiang. But I know it's just an unrealistic fantasy."</p><p></p><p>"No need to guess, Xu Shiqiang must have a use for these cubes. Let's just wait and see! And with the effort spent guessing, we'd be better off thinking about how humanity should respond if even Xu Shiqiang can't handle the Eight-Armed Race."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the captain quietly approached Fengcheng and asked in a low voice, "Mr. Jia Fengcheng, where did the Great One send those cubes?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Fengcheng also shook his head curiously, "I don't know either, I didn't understand Old Master Wei's move!"</p><p></p><p>The captain was surprised, "You don't understand either? Don't you also know that teleporting skill?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "You underestimate Old Master Wei too much, and overestimate me. Old Master Wei knows far more than I do, it's normal not to understand."</p><p></p><p>The captain silently calculated a math problem in his mind: "The gap between me and Jia Fengcheng is infinitely large. The gap between Jia Fengcheng and the Great One is infinitely large. Then what is the gap between me and the Great One? Answer: Infinitely large... damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The gap between people could really be 'infinitely large'!</p><p></p><p>While Suhao focused on transmitting the 'Insect Killing Cubes', Xia Qingjun and the others focused on watching Suhao's operation.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't understand anything, it didn't stop them from thinking Suhao was incredible.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Suhao finally transmitted away the last cube.</p><p></p><p>"Kaca kaca kaca!"</p><p></p><p>The pink crystal formations around him gradually receded, revealing Xu Shiqiang's appearance once more. He let out a long breath, "Finally done!"</p>

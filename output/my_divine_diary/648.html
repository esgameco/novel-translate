        <h1>Chapter 648</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivation planet may eventually be destroyed, Suhao did not witness the destruction of the planet with his own eyes. Perhaps in the end, the cultivation civilization was fortunately preserved through the combined efforts of everyone...</p><p></p><p>But the source planet burned fiercely right before his eyes. The former civilization of mages was burned to ashes. The only thing left was the various information he recorded in the ball space, including characters and knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Suhao directly faced the extinction of a life planet, and his heart felt complicated indescribably. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't say he felt sad or grieved, but there was some uneasiness.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a lump of air stuck in his chest that he couldn't vent no matter what.</p><p></p><p>In order to have enough power to destroy planets when facing asteroids next time, he had worked very hard learning and researching in this world for so many years, and had also sought ways to destroy planets.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the catastrophe that befell him was not the impact of an asteroid...</p><p></p><p>This made his heart, tempered by the deaths of countless worlds, feel stifled.</p><p></p><p>But he was helpless about it.</p><p></p><p>"I must find the Doom System quickly! If I don't completely resolve it, I can't be at ease. But how exactly should I find the Doom System?"</p><p></p><p>Some things are just like this - you want to do it in your heart, you want to achieve a certain goal, but you are limited by your own strength and powerless to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao suddenly felt that he was actually very weak.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the vast universe, perhaps he was no different from a two or three-year-old child before.</p><p></p><p>As weak as he was, did he have the right to feel sad about the fate of the source planet?</p><p></p><p>From outer space, the source planet was still burning steadily, as if nothing was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He composed himself and flew towards the source planet: "Let me figure out the chain reaction mechanism first!"</p><p></p><p>Such a small project was very simple for him, and he quickly understood the principle. In fact, it was similar to the 'source vector' wave fluctuation they had studied.</p><p></p><p>And to terminate this chain reaction mechanism, all he needed was a 'source vector suppressor' to easily suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was not on the source planet when the catastrophe occurred.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, even if he was on the source planet, he might not have been able to react in time.</p><p></p><p>Suhao circled the source planet once, deeply imprinting the image of this planet in his mind, then directly teleported back onto the spaceship. After sharing the investigation report on the source planet with his assistant, he entered the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Fengcheng learned that Suhao was back, he specifically checked Suhao's investigation report, then found Feixiang and said, "Do you want to go back and take a look at the source planet?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiang took a deep breath and nodded: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng didn't say anything else. He cast a 'Balancing Technique' on Feixiang, grabbed his shoulder, linked to the remaining positioning stones on the satellite, and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they came back.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang looked lifeless, without his usual vigor.</p><p></p><p>There was no one Feixiang knew on the source planet, and he didn't understand why he suddenly became so dispirited.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was just that he had suddenly become a lonely cosmic soul without a place to return to!</p><p></p><p>If even a planet is so fragile in the face of catastrophe, how much more fragile are humans when accidents occur?</p><p></p><p>"You can try to treat this ship as your second home planet. After all, every grass, wood, stone and soil here came from the source planet, essentially no different."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang nodded: "Thank you, Teacher Fengcheng."</p><p></p><p>After Fengcheng left, Feixiang sat on the grass, quietly looking at the vibrant small island in front of him, and muttered, "A second home?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he sensed two sneaky figures approaching, Yuanfeng and Lingxue.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang glanced at them and said bluntly, "Come out, I saw you two!"</p><p></p><p>Lingxue was a girl with delicate features. Now that she was the only girl in the world, Yuanfeng treasured her immensely.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Yuanfeng showed signs of becoming Lingxue's puppy.</p><p></p><p>Lingxue pushed Yuanfeng out as he stammered. After a long pause, he finally asked, "Teacher Feixiang, are you... in cahoots with the 'Creator' Jiawai?"</p><p></p><p>This question left Feixiang at a loss for how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Lingxue immediately smiled awkwardly and added, "We don't mean anything else, we're just purely curious. After all, Teacher Feixiang, you don't seem the same as Teacher Fengcheng, so..."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang curiously asked, "How am I different?"</p><p></p><p>Lingxue said, "The three of them look about twenty years old, as if they won't age, while Teacher Feixiang looks middle-aged, older. So we guessed that you're not in the same group as them."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang: "..."</p><p></p><p>This analysis was reasonable and the conclusion made sense.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang laughed wryly, looked up at the two little observers and said, "So?"</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng said, "Teacher Fengcheng looks too scary, we don't dare talk to him... so we wanted to ask, did the source planet really burn up?"</p><p></p><p>Feixiang nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng and Lingxue looked at each other, their eyes dimming.</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng asked again, "Teacher Feixiang, then what is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"A spaceship that is flying out of the stellar system."</p><p></p><p>The two were astonished. "A spaceship? We're on a spaceship leaving the source star system?"</p><p></p><p>It's confirmed!</p><p></p><p>The reason the source planet was destroyed must be because the 'Creator' Jiawai did it!</p><p></p><p>Someone on the source planet must have offended him, so he decided to destroy the world and leave the source planet to live on another planet!</p><p></p><p>This is simply too terrifying! Even more terrifying than the great demon kings and villains in stories.</p><p></p><p>Then a terrible thought popped into their minds: Why did the Creator bring the two of them? Would they be killed? Or perhaps... kept as food reserves when hungry?</p><p></p><p>Trembling in fear!</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng stepped forward and gently put his arm around Lingxue: "Don't be afraid, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the laboratory, Suhao entered the ball space and sat at the familiar desk, spinning his pen.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he wrote the first sentence on the paper: "My existence will bring unknown catastrophe to life planets."</p><p></p><p>Bringing catastrophe to planets was not his wish; he only wanted to 'quietly study all kinds of knowledge'.</p><p></p><p>His request was not high, was it?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps someone hid knowledge from him and didn't want him to see it, or someone hindered his studies, or perhaps his lifespan was not long enough and he died naturally.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the wish to quietly study and research was always difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Suhao guessed that the culprit was the 'Doom System'.</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao wrote the second sentence: "Find the 'Doom System', and then crack it!"</p><p></p><p>Cracking the 'Doom System' was no easy task. If he could do it, Suhao would have done it years ago, without having to wait until now.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he hadn't even taken the first step of 'finding the Doom System', so everything else was out of the question.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the scene outside the desk in the ball space turned into a void.</p><p></p><p>"Little Light, retrieve all death scene data, retrieve all data marked as 'first-level events'."</p><p></p><p>"Little Light received, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all the 'dooms' with a certain pattern that he had encountered since being reborn into the ball space manifested and hovered in mid-air, replaying the past scenes vividly.</p><p></p><p>As Suhao reviewed the misfortunes he had suffered, he wrote in smaller text under the second sentence: "The essence of the 'Doom System' is the 'Focus System', meaning the energy fed back to form various catastrophes originates from my own actions."</p><p></p><p>The general pattern of the catastrophes he had suffered did indeed seem to be so.</p><p></p><p>When he was very weak, the catastrophes he triggered were not intense, just things like 'dying of illness', 'drowning', 'falling to death', 'exploding to death', 'killed by a female warrior', 'bitten to death by beasts', 'killed in the crossfire of battles'...</p><p></p><p>After he gained some power, he could basically ignore this series of death methods.</p><p></p><p>But as his power grew, the catastrophes that followed gradually intensified, until eventually they even triggered planetary impacts.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered: "If I lower my own activity, can I reduce the energy fed back by the Doom System to the minimum?"</p><p></p><p>Soon he shook his head: "No, I can't affect my studies just to reduce the energy feedback. If I can't learn knowledge, my rebirth will be meaningless, I might as well remain in slumber!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if I don't quickly gain greater power, that would be a slow death."</p><p></p><p>In the end, he had to find the Doom System and resolve it!</p>

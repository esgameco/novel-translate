        <h1>Chapter 922</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Possessing a soul brain in the [Divine] body brought great shock to the deities.</p><p></p><p>What amazed them most was that their perception systems underwent a complete upheaval. The most obvious manifestation was that they all gained a large number of 'mini-selves'.</p><p></p><p>Each one was dumbfounded by their new abilities.</p><p></p><p>They thought that if they only had one mouth, they could simultaneously argue with and defeat a hundred elderly ladies.</p><p></p><p>The deities were extremely curious about their newly acquired bodies, eager to explore them thoroughly, as everything about these bodies seemed mysterious to them.</p><p></p><p>Then a series of bizarre farces occurred. A group of deities tumbled to the ground in disarray, or inexplicably transformed into various strange appearances. Some even accidentally turned into wisps of smoke, scaring themselves half to death, exclaiming in terror: "Aiya, my body has melted, I can't change back..."</p><p></p><p>"Aiyo, my body has grown hair! Dense black fur, just like a gorilla."</p><p></p><p>"I've grown bigger!"</p><p></p><p>"Who put their tentacles on my leg?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the place became a complete mess, with wailing and howling everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's mouth twitched, too lazy to say much more. He sent all the deities into space with a teleportation, letting them struggle on their own.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can stay here for a while! Contact me through the system when you've gotten used to controlling your bodies. Oh, there's a beginner's guide function in the system for body control, you can familiarize yourselves there first, it should make things twice as easy."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he ignored the deities' various appearances and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, when Su Hao reappeared in this space, he saw the deities skillfully controlling the [Divine] bodies, playing all kinds of tricks, reveling in delight.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Su Hao appeared, the deities immediately communicated with him telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lei An, this body is truly incredible. Where did you get it from?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe there are such miraculous creatures in this world. Both the brain and the flesh are simply the most perfect masterpieces I've ever seen, capable of anything."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and replied, "I made them myself. The process was a bit complicated but not too difficult. Since you deities have gotten used to the bodies, I'll send you back to the Crosstar now! You'll be free from then on."</p><p></p><p>The deities were extremely excited and immediately agreed to go back and take a look.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Su Hao, the scene changed, and everyone instantly returned to the highest mountain peak on Crosstar.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Ancient looked around and suddenly asked, "Lord Lei An, I've carefully read the manual, but why doesn't it mention the 'teleportation' skill? Just relying on flight, this body is still too slow."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "The body doesn't come with the teleportation skill. This skill requires some knowledge and mental cultivation. Just having the body is useless. If you really want to learn, I can teach you, but you need to meet some conditions first. As for what those conditions are, no need to rush, we can discuss that later."</p><p></p><p>Barry widened his eyes in disbelief, "Lord Lei An, you're willing to teach us?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "If you're fellow travelers, there's no problem teaching you. If not, then I'm too lazy to teach."</p><p></p><p>Nati asked doubtfully, "Fellow travelers? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head and changed the subject, "If you think your speed is too slow, there's a skill in the mall specifically for traveling called 'Starlight Roaming'. After learning it, you'll be able to freely roam the Xionghuo System. If you're interested, you can redeem it and learn it, but the points you have probably aren't enough."</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately opened the mall and searched for 'Starlight Roaming'. Seeing the price of 'one million', they gasped in shock.</p><p></p><p>Red Light couldn't help but say, "Why is it so expensive..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "The prices here are commensurate with the value and difficulty. The higher the value and difficulty, the higher the price. Moreover, this skill contains a lot of knowledge, so redeeming it is a bargain, not a loss.</p><p></p><p>Besides, it's already good that you have something to redeem. Otherwise, no matter how many points you had, you wouldn't have the opportunity to learn it."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I wish you deities an enjoyable life."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he teleported away.</p><p></p><p>The deities looked on enviously, wishing they could also learn teleportation to come and go without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the deities looked at each other, then at those they disliked, snorting coldly before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>They had disliked each other for over a thousand years. If not for the camaraderie of playing games and doing raids together, they might have started fighting on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, the deities grew restless on Crosstar. They suddenly realized that although they were free, they also felt empty.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I? Where am I? What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light was the first to @ everyone in the group: "Want to game together?"</p><p></p><p>The group immediately responded, diving into the game.</p><p></p><p>As they played, they suddenly realized that this life didn't seem much different from before...</p><p></p><p>They no longer had any thoughts of ruling the world, since they knew this was a world personally created by Lord Lei An, and they couldn't ruin it for him.</p><p></p><p>As for roaming the universe, even with [Divine] bodies, their flight speed was still very limited...</p><p></p><p>In other words, they were still essentially imprisoned, just changing from their previous fixed workstations to this single planet now.</p><p></p><p>The Resurrection God Zhuxia suddenly said, "Fellow deities, I feel that I'm not free..."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this their thought as well?</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Su Hao imprisoned them, making them feel unfree, but an unfreedom on a spiritual level.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the vast universe and the marvels of Su Hao's abilities, their horizons had expanded beyond just this single planet.</p><p></p><p>What they now yearned for was the distant starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But even with [Divine] bodies, they could not escape this planet.</p><p></p><p>Because the universe was simply too vast.</p><p></p><p>They lacked the ability to travel through the universe.</p><p></p><p>Nati said, "I don't know what you all think, but my idea is to find Lord Lei An and work for him, to be an obedient subordinate who comes and goes at his beck and call."</p><p></p><p>The other deities were greatly moved.</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshi said, "Remember how many world wills previously sought to become Jia Feng's disciples? Perhaps we can take Lord Lei An as our master and have him pass on his techniques to us."</p><p></p><p>The deities were even more moved at the idea of becoming disciples instead of subordinates.</p><p></p><p>But then the Light Bathing God Yi shook his head, "That's unrealistic. Not every world will is like Feng, willing to accept any disciple. I've observed their criteria for taking disciples - only those with steadfast, loyal minds are accepted. Those who like to be clever and take shortcuts are not accepted, nor are those who like to make excuses for themselves...In short, taking disciples seems casual but is actually very strict.</p><p></p><p>And us, although we are not world wills, our minds are steadfast and we have sufficient ability, we don't meet the other conditions. Let me ask you, are you loyal to Lord Lei An?"</p><p></p><p>Nati said, "How could I not be loyal? I'm even voluntarily going to be his subordinate."</p><p></p><p>Yi shook his head, "It's not the same. In fact, Lord Lei An has already given us many opportunities, but it seems we haven't seized them. Let me point out one thing - just by us actively seeking freedom from Lord Lei An, we've already been eliminated."</p><p></p><p>"What does that have to do with it?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's related. In reality, the freedom we've obtained now is no different from before. We can now freely move about on Crosstar, but before we could also freely move our avatars. Lord Lei An never restricted us.</p><p></p><p>So, do you understand now? What we've gained is actually no better, but we felt that working for Lord Lei An was being coerced and imprisoned by him. Psychologically speaking, we are disloyal to Lord Lei An.</p><p></p><p>In other words, none of us have a chance to become Lord Lei An's disciple."</p><p></p><p>The deities fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Yi continued, "But if we are wholeheartedly willing to be Lord Lei An's subordinates for ten thousand years, diligently working no matter what, then there is still a possibility of learning the true knowledge."</p><p></p><p>The deities realized that Su Hao was their only hope of leaving this planet.</p><p></p><p>Nati said eagerly, "What are we waiting for? Let's find Lord Lei An now!"</p><p></p><p>He could hardly wait to become a qualified subordinate.</p><p></p><p>For some inexplicable reason, Su Hao ended up taking on eighteen self-proclaimed subordinates...</p><p></p><p>This was something Su Hao had never expected.</p><p></p><p>When the eighteen deities expressed their intentions to him through the system, a thought suddenly occurred to Su Hao: these deities might still have some use, such as with the matter of the primordial deity.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 811</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After testing his abilities, Su Hao returned to the dragon's nest, using it as the coordinate point to directly upgrade the base small world into a large 'second-level world'.</p><p></p><p>He then flashed again to the Cloud Mountain Range, moving a large amount of mud, rocks and vegetation into the second-level world. Quickly, he built the second-level world into a rather decent place.</p><p></p><p>After a month of cultivation, three [Divine Eggs] were born from the twenty-five bird eggs, while the rest were scrapped in the experiment.</p><p></p><p>"Next, hatch the [Divine Eggs] and create suitable avatars."</p><p></p><p>Only by completely hiding his main body, preventing Yun Bo from locking onto his unknown, would Su Hao explore this unknown world.</p><p></p><p>And the [Divine Eggs] were a crucial step.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out his claw, and a [Divine Egg] made from a bird's egg appeared on his palm. Crystal armor surged under his feet, forming a huge array of runes.</p><p></p><p>He took a source bead and embedded it in the small groove at the center of the array.</p><p></p><p>Then with a point of his finger, a golden beam of light entered the array, activating the entire formation.</p><p></p><p>The runic array slowly lit up, radiating heat while also emitting fluctuations that could promote the [Divine Egg]'s evolution in the designated direction.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining it and making slight adjustments, he placed the [Divine Egg] from his palm at the center of the array.</p><p></p><p>"It should hatch in about five days. I'll come back and check then."</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Su Hao left the second-level world and went to the small world where humans were kept.</p><p></p><p>He first had these people use their soul arts and skills until they were drained, then adjusted the size and environment of their small world, leaving behind ample food and water before returning to the nest.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons were still recklessly making a ruckus, as if playing was their entire existence, without a shred of worry for the future.</p><p></p><p>This was perhaps the unique happiness of childhood.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Su Hao no longer had that leisurely feeling from before.</p><p></p><p>Because his mother dragon Sha Duo had not returned for two days.</p><p></p><p>This would have been very normal before, but since coming to the seaside nest, the mother dragon would return to the nest within two days at most, no matter how much prey she had caught.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao still remembered the mother dragon telling the three young dragons before leaving, "I will return by tomorrow night at the latest."</p><p></p><p>But now, she had already exceeded the time she had set herself.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned: "Could Mother Sha Duo have run into some trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, that seemed impossible. According to Mother Sha Duo, as a mature red-golden dragon, she possessed nearly the most formidable power in this world. What kind of problem could she possibly encounter?</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, within his perception range of over fifty thousand meters, he could not sense Mother Sha Duo's presence.</p><p></p><p>He let out a breath and thought to himself: "Unfortunately, I haven't installed the 'blue crystal' and 'external brain' yet, so I can't enter the 'Starry Network' to search for Mother Sha Duo's presence."</p><p></p><p>Accessing the 'Starry Network' was not simple - it required three conditions: 'a special neural cluster that could sense blue particles', 'a blue crystal with a high concentration of blue particles', and 'a gravity array'.</p><p></p><p>The blue crystal and gravity array were easy, but the 'special neural cluster' was more difficult - it required the assistance of an external brain to modify one's own neural system.</p><p></p><p>Creating an external brain and modifying the neural system was not difficult for his previous self, but for his current self, the difficulty was not low.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not even a [Prophet] now, and the brain running his consciousness was just a 'decent' dragon brain. His spiritual power was also far from its peak state, so there was not much he could do.</p><p></p><p>He could do it, but it would take a much longer time.</p><p></p><p>"Worrying now is useless. I can only wait patiently and hope she is safe."</p><p></p><p>Besides hoping that Mother Sha Duo would take him back to the dragon clan's base to learn about spiritual power and soul arts, Su Hao also cherished his feelings for the mother dragon.</p><p></p><p>After all, this young dragon's body was born from her, so from a blood relationship, she was indeed Su Hao's mother in this life. Plus her continuous nurturing and protection for two months allowed him to successfully recover part of his strength. Su Hao was grateful for that.</p><p></p><p>No matter which angle he looked at it from, Su Hao did not want the mother dragon to be in danger.</p><p></p><p>And so he waited until the second night, when he finally sensed Mother Sha Duo's aura within his spiritual perception range.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's heart immediately relaxed. No matter what, sensing Mother Sha Duo's aura meant she was safe.</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine what he would do if something happened to Mother Sha Duo and he had to take care of the two young dragons...</p><p></p><p>He might have to awaken Ya Shan and Feng Cheng prematurely to have them care for the young dragons.</p><p></p><p>But then Su Hao's eyes suddenly widened, a cold glint flashing through them: "Mother Sha Duo is returning from the sea, different from her previous returns from the Cloud Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>And her aura is unstable, as if she has been seriously injured. From her cautious manner, it seems she is on guard against enemies following her."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly stood up, locking onto the mother dragon's figure, ready to flash over at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He quickly analyzed the current situation in his mind, deducing what might have happened: "Mother Sha Duo must have encountered a powerful enemy while hunting and been injured before fleeing. After confirming she had shaken off the enemy, she took a big detour from overseas to avoid being followed back.</p><p></p><p>So who could it be, capable of injuring such a powerful mother dragon to this extent? Whoever it is, if I encounter them..."</p><p></p><p>After the mother dragon flew to the cliff, instead of directly returning to the nest, she quietly observed for two hours to confirm no one was following before returning to the nest.</p><p></p><p>However, the enemy that the mother dragon did not see, Su Hao sensed, hiding in the distant sea water and following the mother dragon all the way to this coast.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the mother dragon returned to the nest, a black human figure slowly rose from the sea, chuckling lightly: "So this is where this red-golden dragon's nest is hidden? Heh heh, indeed well concealed, no wonder I followed for so long.</p><p></p><p>I just don't know if that huge explosion crater in the Cloud Mountain Range has anything to do with this red-golden dragon."</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, there was an extremely violent explosion in the Cloud Mountain Range that shook nearly the entire range. Coincidentally, this powerful explosion happened to alert the Golden God Bali, who was panning for gold on the Heavenly Prairie. Bali casually mentioned it to his divine messenger, having him investigate what happened in the Cloud Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the huge crater there, he was utterly shocked. It was clearly the result of an extremely powerful force striking it - almost a blow from a deity!</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely related to this red-golden dragon, but based on my tests, this dragon does not possess such immense power. So that means there is another even more powerful dragon behind this one.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if I can injure this dragon and then secretly follow it, I'm bound to find the dragon behind that massive crater.</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, with my intelligence, I'll quickly complete Lord Bali's mission.</p><p></p><p>I wonder what powerful abilities Lord Bali will reward me? I'm really looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>He lightly flew up, like an ethereal ghost without weight, following the mother dragon's aura towards the seaside cliff.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Hao carefully sensed this human figure with his spiritual perception, weighing whether the power he currently possessed could contend against the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Before fighting, everything was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "He looks quite formidable. Why don't I try a 'Locking Strike' on him first?"</p><p></p><p>Against an unknown enemy, Su Hao's habit was to use his most effective attack to probe, ideally killing the enemy outright. After all, what he wanted was knowledge, not a physical brawl with a powerful foe.</p><p></p><p>To him, a dead enemy was a good enemy.</p><p></p><p>But before hammering the opponent to death, he still needed to confirm things, in case of accidental harm.</p><p></p><p>After the mother dragon returned to the nest, Su Hao directly ran up to her, eyes wide as he asked: "Mother Sha Duo, what happened? Why were you injured?"</p><p></p><p>Before returning to the nest, the mother dragon had deliberately used her soul arts to heal the wounds and blood stains on her body, so there were no outward signs of injury.</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo was startled: "Lei An, my child, how did you know I was injured?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao answered truthfully: "I could sense it. I could sense that Mother Sha Duo suffered serious injuries."</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo was very surprised, lowering her head in amazement: "Lei An, you really are incredible. You truly are a rare variant golden dragon born once in thousands of years, innately possessing extremely keen perception abilities. Your current strength already surpasses many golden dragons."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed his teeth in a smile, then stretched out his claw pointing outside: "Mother Sha Duo, I also sense that a human followed us here from outside. He's now flying this way."</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo's pupils shrank as she whipped her head around to look outside, her expression immediately turning extremely ugly: "Lei An, are you telling the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Although she phrased it as a question, her entire being had already risen to peak intensity, ready to fight with all her might at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo's heart was extremely complicated: "I...I should not have come back. But no matter what, I must protect my children, even if I die here."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked again: "That human in black robes, flying like a ghost, so fast - who is he? Is he the one who injured Mother Sha Duo?"</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo grew more and more tense, stepping slowly to the cave entrance to intercept the enemy. She turned her head to look deeply at her three adorable children, her tone tinged with sadness: "Yes, it was him who injured me. He is a divine messenger of the human gods, possessing extremely powerful abilities. But children, I will protect you."</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Mother Sha Duo's keen eyes spotted that hateful black human figure rapidly flying towards them.</p><p></p><p>She vaguely heard the human arrogantly laughing in the dragon language: "Red-golden dragon, so your nest is hidden here. Call out that other dragon too - you alone are no match for me! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood, clenching his claw and slamming it down hard on the ground.</p><p></p><p>'Locking Strike'!</p><p></p><p>"——"</p><p></p><p>His claw struck the ground with decent force, but not a sound was made - extremely eerie.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao retracted his fist and said to the mother dragon who was about to fly out: "Mother Sha Duo, that human fell into the sea."</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao finished speaking, Mother Sha Duo saw the arrogant human suddenly fall silent, tracing a perfect parabolic arc into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Mother Sha Duo: "???"</p>

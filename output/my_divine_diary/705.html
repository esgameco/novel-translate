        <h1>Chapter 705</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao was about to start making the Seeker Ring, the captain came running through the transit ball to find Suhao.</p><p></p><p>This year the captain had exercised less and socialized more, his belly protruding slightly despite the shaping effects of the enhancer, no longer looking like the tough middle-aged captain but more like a portly middle-aged uncle.</p><p></p><p>Suhao paused his work and asked, "What's going on? Why the rush?"</p><p></p><p>The captain said with some resignation, "Your niece Yonghua has been asking around about your whereabouts, suspecting you've been kidnapped. It's even trending on the news now. Take a look yourself!"</p><p></p><p>The captain showed Suhao his personal terminal and opened a web browser. </p><p></p><p>They saw the top trending topic was: 'Niece of superhero Xu Shiqiang' questions whether Xu Shiqiang has been treated unfairly. Is this really the case? How should we view this issue?</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "What does she want to find me for?"</p><p></p><p>The captain shrugged, "I don't know. She says she wants to learn knowledge from you, to become a useful person in the future. But her grades are just average...</p><p></p><p>Maybe she just wants to get closer to her famous uncle. After all, you great Xu Shiqiang only go home once a year. Or maybe she simply wants to fulfill a young girl's hero fantasy, given your identity... To be honest, if I were your relative, I might fanboy harder than your niece."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "You could look up our ancestry, we might be blood-related going back millions of years."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Then we must be relatives for sure..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said indifferently, "Let her come find me if she wants. It's not a big deal, we'll know once we ask her."</p><p></p><p>So what if her grades aren't good? As long as she's willing to study hard, she can learn something. He didn't mind teaching this niece.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, didn't he, Suhao, used to be utterly mediocre long ago?</p><p></p><p>Suhao chuckled, "It's just about the Compound Eye Race getting our new technology, right? No problem, once I get some time, I'll research how the Compound Eyes obtain secret tech, and design countermeasures tailored to their abilities."</p><p></p><p>The unspoken second half was: "If I can't block them, then I'll just wipe out the entire Compound Eye Race."</p><p></p><p>The captain thought for a moment, "Okay, let her in, but I'll talk to her first."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, he had no objections.</p><p></p><p>Ever since finding a way to evade warp tracking, time was no longer so urgent for him, and his attitude towards things had subtly changed, becoming more casual.</p><p></p><p>It was like before when he only had enough money for one day's meal and had to think about how to stretch it for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>Now as a multi-millionaire, he didn't worry about food and drink, and could take it easy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Compound Eye Race, one couldn't avoid discussing the racial distribution in the Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>Human astronomers hypothesized:</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Ring System was very special in the universe. Under the complex interplay of cosmic forces, miraculously, there was frequent material exchange between planets.</p><p></p><p>This might explain why the Cloud Ring had so many life-bearing planets and intelligent races.</p><p></p><p>They guessed that in the distant past, life emerged on one planet that prospered, but then suffered some catastrophe that shattered it into fragments.</p><p></p><p>These fragments carried massive amounts of life information that spread to various planets in the Cloud Ring, creating the vibrant scene of life there.</p><p></p><p>Of course, among so many life-bearing planets, only a small proportion could give rise to intelligence and civilization. But that small proportion across an entire system was still a large number.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, among these intelligent races, the Eight-Handed Race with their nine brains and exceptional intelligence developed first.</p><p></p><p>Then the disaster for the other races in the Cloud Ring began.</p><p></p><p>Under the Eight-Handed's "survival of the smartest, Eight-Handed supremacy" policy, countless intelligent races suffered devastating blows and gradually disappeared from cosmic history.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Eight-Handed were about to dominate the Cloud Ring, humans had only just gone through the electrical revolution and were still very weak - they should have been doomed to the same fate of extinction.</p><p></p><p>However, among the Cloud Ring's intelligent races, there was one oddball - the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>Their visual system was completely different from humans, Eight-Handed and most other races. They could somehow perceive the "second structural feature" of planets through special signals.</p><p></p><p>Then the Compound Eyes used their special eyes to peer across light years of distance and saw the Eight-Handed's technology...</p><p></p><p>Without the Eight-Handed knowing, they stole a lot of their high-tech.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, while the Compound Eyes' eyes were capable, their technological intelligence was lacking, so they couldn't understand most of the tech they stole!</p><p></p><p>Can you imagine having a treasure trove of tech but not understanding any of it? Ask the Compound Eyes.</p><p></p><p>When the Compound Eyes had nothing better to do, they liked randomly peering into space.</p><p></p><p>They watched helplessly as the Eight-Handed fleet exterminated race after race, trembling as they awaited the fleet's arrival at their own homeworld to destroy them too.</p><p></p><p>Then one smart Compound Eye suggested: "We may not understand the tech, but we can find other races who do. We'll steal the tech, they'll research it, and together we can resist the Eight-Handed's extermination."</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the Compound Eyes managed to find humans on Earth before the Eight-Handed, using their crude communication devices to make contact.</p><p></p><p>After a few hundred years of such efforts, humans finally believed the Compound Eyes' "nonsense" - because using the tech the Compound Eyes provided, humans achieved warp travel, only for their first ramshackle ship to be blasted apart by the Eight-Handed.</p><p></p><p>Humans fell into panic; civil war broke out; a unified alliance formed; a technological explosion occurred; humans succeeded in cloaking Earth; humans turned the tables and subjugated the Compound Eyes...</p><p></p><p>Then the Compound Eyes threatened humans: share all tech and teach us, or we'll reveal Earth's location to the Eight-Handed for mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>So the Compound Eyes became the masters humans had to worship!</p><p></p><p>What could they do? They couldn't just say outright: "You Compound Eyes are too dumb, we can't teach you, just give up!"</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes would probably have a meltdown and betray the humans, ruining everything.</p><p></p><p>So humans came up with delaying tactics - teaching in full force outwardly, but making excuses when the Compound Eyes couldn't learn, like "adults' mindsets are set, better to start from childhood" or "language translation is a huge issue, the Compound Eyes should all learn human languages" or "human learning methods don't suit Compound Eyes, we're researching methods tailored to you - after all, there are no unteachable students, only bad teachers..."</p><p></p><p>What else could they do if the Compound Eyes couldn't learn? They just hoped the Compound Eyes would stay calm and not go to extremes - survival was paramount.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes' survival intelligence was high, but their technological intelligence really wasn't...</p><p></p><p>While teaching, humans directly provided the Compound Eyes with tech products, teaching them hands-on how to use everything, helping them cloak their homeworld and build a fleet to jointly resist the Eight-Handed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was all done remotely - the Compound Eyes adamantly refused to let any humans near their homeworld.</p><p></p><p>For humans, it was great to have someone distracting the Eight-Handed's attention!</p><p></p><p>For the Compound Eyes, it was great to have help building powerful ships and weapons!</p><p></p><p>However, the Compound Eyes ultimately weren't on the same side as humans - different tribes have different minds.</p><p></p><p>Their current cooperation was only due to the mutual Eight-Handed threat. Once the Eight-Handed weakened enough, the Compound Eyes would surely betray humans, waiting for both sides to destroy each other so they could profit.</p><p></p><p>So from start to finish, humans remained wary of the Compound Eyes, hoping to eventually break free of their shackles completely.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As for Suhao...</p><p></p><p>He was extremely curious about the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>This special race could clearly perceive half the Cloud Ring system and, crucially, steal the Eight-Handed's technical data from afar?</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the Compound Eyes' vision was even more powerful than his own "Mind's Eye" - so powerful that Suhao could barely stop himself from drooling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The "Mind's Eye" he created in his previous life was a stopgap measure; installing a "Seeker Ring" in his brain was ultimately inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps by unraveling the Compound Eyes' life secrets, he could not only gain their abilities, but evolve the "Mind's Eye" into a physical capability, maybe even grow it directly on his psychic power!</p><p></p><p>Whenever he thought of this, Suhao could hardly contain his urge to research the Compound Eyes immediately.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, while humans had a rough guess of the Compound Eyes' homeworld location, they hadn't confirmed it, so Suhao had no way to obtain Compound Eye specimens.</p><p></p><p>Most bizarrely, humans only knew their name "Compound Eye Race" - they didn't even know what the Compound Eyes looked like, only able to imagine based on their custom ship designs.</p><p></p><p>Flies? Dragonflies? Bees? Spiders? Eyeballs with limbs?</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao believed he would have answers soon.</p><p></p><p>Because he planned to thoroughly master all human knowledge, complete the necessary experiments, and then personally visit the Compound Eyes' homeworld...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 918</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng had different ways of teaching students.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng would set a grand goal, completely unleashing everyone's desires, and then assimilating these people towards himself.</p><p></p><p>Yashan, on the other hand, gave the students a relatively free environment, arranged some tasks with a certain level of difficulty, and let the students complete them.</p><p></p><p>In this process, each person would unconsciously expose their true nature in order to complete the tasks.</p><p></p><p>What Yashan wanted was the students' hidden true natures and bottom lines.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they successfully completed the assigned tasks or not, that was not the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought to himself: "Faith, loyalty, righteousness, gratitude, desire, one's concepts of being human, bottom lines, as well as the keen ability to perceive the basic balanced logic towards things and people...according to my observations, out of fifty people, only sixteen meet my preset requirements."</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years together, Yashan had developed some feelings for these students, but feelings could not become the criteria for his judgment. He clearly knew that how he felt was not important. He was teaching these students not only for himself but also for the Great Elder.</p><p></p><p>He sighed lightly: "It's about time to complete the final evaluation."</p><p></p><p>Yashan sent a voice transmission, gathering all the students in the palace hall, and said softly: "The hundred-year period, the second test of 'Learning and Exploration' has ended. I can tell you that out of fifty people, sixteen have met my requirements. These sixteen will have the qualification to know my full name and become my disciples."</p><p></p><p>The fifty students were greatly shaken. They never expected that only sixteen out of fifty met the teacher's standards, not even one-third...</p><p></p><p>But they had all observed their fellow students, and in their eyes, everyone was very hardworking and excellent...</p><p></p><p>So what exactly was the criteria for evaluation?</p><p></p><p>Would they be one of the qualified ones?</p><p></p><p>The students were apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Yashan continued: "The qualified ones will leave with me, while the rest of you can return to your original worlds. With the system mall, you still have infinite possibilities. Perhaps in the distant future, we may meet again. It's just a pity that we don't have the destiny to be teacher and disciples, no need to dwell on it too much."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Yashan casually waved his hand, sending thirty-four people back to their original planets, leaving sixteen people behind.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "Are you willing to take me as your teacher?"</p><p></p><p>The sixteen people below were suddenly awakened. Seeing the empty space around them, they immediately knew they had qualified. A great joy enveloped their hearts, and they unconsciously knelt down, loudly calling out: "The disciples are willing, we greet the teacher."</p><p></p><p>Among them were the Elf King Vari, the Beastman King Blackgill, the Winged King Quanfugui, and the Sea King Yuanshu.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled: "Get up. From now on for countless years, you will be my disciples, and you can call me Master."</p><p></p><p>The sixteen people bowed again: "We greet the Master."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "My full name is Jia Yashan. I founded the Infinite Gate Sect. You are the first generation of disciples of my Infinite Gate Sect. I hope you will abide by your true nature, respect your teacher and the Way, and never cease in exploring the unknown of the universe."</p><p></p><p>With that, he casually waved his hand, and sixteen purple light ribbons flew out, drilling into everyone's foreheads and forming an Infinite Seal.</p><p></p><p>"This is the exclusive seal of my Infinite Gate Sect, the Infinite Seal. Upon seeing this seal, you will know the person is a disciple of my Infinite Gate Sect. In the vast universe, you can help and cooperate with each other in exploration.</p><p></p><p>Apart from my Infinite Seal, there are two other seals you need to know, the 'Double Ring Seal' and the 'Double Sword Seal'. If you encounter people with these seals in the future, they belong to the same sect, and you should address them as fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>Understood?"</p><p></p><p>"The disciples understand!"</p><p></p><p>Those travelers who were directly sent back to their original worlds by Yashan were briefly dazed, but upon seeing the familiar environment, they realized they had been eliminated and sent back to where they came from by the teacher.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past hundred years, everything seemed like a dream.</p><p></p><p>They felt an indescribable sense of loss. They realized they had lost something very important.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a precious opportunity had been presented before them, but they failed to seize it properly. Pain and regret intertwined, making them lose interest in anything.</p><p></p><p>They pondered deeply but still could not figure out why they were eliminated.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, they reopened the system and the mall...</p><p></p><p>Their eyes gradually became determined: "You don't want me, you don't appreciate me, it was in vain that I called you teacher for a hundred years. It doesn't matter, I still have the system, I still have a chance. One day, I will become extremely powerful, I will make you take a second look at me, I will make you regret your choice today."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years, Su Hao returned to Heaven and met with the deities again.</p><p></p><p>The deities excitedly showed Su Hao their remodeled White Galor bodies, describing how dedicated and hardworking they had been over the years, with an expectant look for praise.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily and generously praised the deities, then said: "You've all done well. To complete such a massive project in just a hundred years, I'm truly amazed. Your talents, abilities, and willpower are among the best I know."</p><p></p><p>The deities were very pleased with Su Hao's praise, without exception.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Su Hao had assumed an absolute leadership position among these deities, perhaps due to habit and recognition of his power.</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately downloaded the new large-capacity file from the system and clicked to install it.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to a typical computer software installation, this program downloaded quickly but installed slowly...</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until ten days later that the installation was complete.</p><p></p><p>After the installation, a new panel appeared before the deities.</p><p></p><p>"'Primordial Deity' has been activated, connecting..."</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen main machines, connection successful, adjusting channel, adjustment successful, retrieving data, retrieval successful..."</p><p></p><p>"Please select 'Manual Mode', 'Semi-Automatic Mode', or 'Fully Automatic Mode'..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Choose Semi-Automatic Mode. First, assist in debugging and testing, patching any loopholes that appear in the Primordial Deity, and once fully tested and successful, you can switch to 'Fully Automatic Mode', at which point you can leave your White Galor bodies."</p><p></p><p>Nati and Bari were astonished: "What? We still need to debug it? How long will that take?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said matter-of-factly: "Of course you need to debug it. If I just let you leave directly and something goes wrong, I can't bring you back again, can I? That would be even more troublesome for you, so it's better to resolve all the issues at once. As for the time...fifty to a hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other. Bari shook his head: "Unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "I know! So in these next few decades, not only do you need to monitor the dynamics of the Primordial Deity, but you also need to practice how to perfectly separate your will from the White Galor bodies."</p><p></p><p>Nati laughed: "I see, Lord Leian is so good to us."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "By the way, since the last batch of World Wills successfully grew and transcended their planets, the World Wills have been extremely satisfied and remained inactive for a full hundred years with no movement.</p><p></p><p>Now, a new batch of World Wills is about to be born. In these next few decades, you'll need to take care of them as well. Just like the previous batch, as long as ten of them grow up, it will be considered a pass.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, you can also use these World Wills to debug the Primordial Deity, striving to patch any loopholes as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The deities' eyes nearly popped out: "What? Another new batch of World Wills is coming?"</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that in the coming years, they would have to be nannies again?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Of course. The Primordial Deity's intelligence is quite decent and can replace many of your caretaking duties.</p><p></p><p>However, as a newly born intelligent program, it needs some time to collect data and grow. Once it absorbs enough sample cases, it will be able to execute various tasks on its own."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hinted meaningfully: "Moreover, I've set up ten work ports on each White Galor body. You can completely train the celestial spirits in Heaven to help you take care of things, right?</p><p></p><p>Gentlemen, you're hoarding many resources. Be more flexible in handling things, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The deities suddenly realized: "That makes sense, we can outsource the tasks we don't want to do!"</p>

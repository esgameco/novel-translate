        <h1>Chapter 575</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the entire Hengxuan District, in less than three years, he had more than four thousand source mage friends, as well as more than two hundred thousand commoner friends, which was still very impressive when you thought about it.</p><p></p><p>Because aside from Zhi Peng's weird ability 'Let's be friends', the only one who could do this was probably another 'banknote ability' - Spreading Coins - that could do this to such an extent.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was still very satisfied with his results in these two years, and smiled, ''Mr. Jia Wei, these over 4,000 source mage friends of mine are all the ones I have made over the years as I traveled around the continent of Heng Xuan District, and each one of them approves of my words from the bottom of their hearts, and treats me as the best of friends, so if there is anything you need help with from my friends, you can say it by all means. It's just that these friends of mine come from all over the Heng Xuan District, so it will take a little time to gather them together."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Aren't you going to clean up the royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng immediately said, "Cleaning up the royal clans is imperative, but I think that the current 4,000 people are not enough, and it's hard to clean up the entire Heng Xuan District's royal clans. Moreover, I learned from my friend that if we openly deal with the royal clan, the Mage Association will definitely intervene. Our four thousand people, compared to the entire Mage Association of the Hengxuan District, is still too weak, and I plan to spend another two years ......"</p><p></p><p>The entire Hengxuan District was very vast, and there were more than nine hundred towns with a population of twenty thousand or more, not counting the small towns and small villages that were just like Wyvern Water Town, with an extremely large total population.</p><p></p><p>And every town had a Source Mage Association chapter set up to absorb and manage the local Source Mages, as well as being responsible for dealing with various disasters around the town.</p><p></p><p>The number of mages in each source mage association was not fixed, but on average, it could reach more than three hundred, and the entire Hengxuan District had at least three hundred thousand source mages registered in the association.</p><p></p><p>Although the source mage associations of different towns belonged to the same organization, they also had some rivalry and competed for a matter of face.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, with the passage of time, the source mages have also gradually divided into various schools of thought within the association, with two of them being the most representative and at the same time incompatible.</p><p></p><p>One school of thought was called the 'Innovation School', which advocated the abolition of the last clause of the agreement of more than 1,200 years ago, which was 'maintaining the rule of the royal family', and letting the world develop freely in accordance with the laws of nature, with the Source Mage Association not interfering too much.</p><p></p><p>The other school was called the 'orthodox school', which believed that the Source Mage Association must inherit all the regulations of the 'peace', including the last clause, because the wisdom of the previous generations was unquestionable, and this was the premise on which the world was able to maintain peace for more than a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were in opposition to each other, with no room for moderation, and neither side would give in to the other, and there were many clashes as a result.</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, the 'Innovation Faction' gained the upper hand, and the royal families of the various districts that ruled the world panicked, and began to spend large sums of money on recruiting those powerful source mage squads, in an attempt to use this as a means of regaining the disadvantage of the 'Orthodox Faction'.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it really gained some results, and the royal families outside the royal family followed suit, and recruiting source mage squads became the most popular activity among the royal families, suppressing the 'Innovation Faction' for a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>It just didn't take long for the royal family to start rotting away internally, and along with those source squads that the royal family had raised heavily, they also rotted away.</p><p></p><p>After that, the position of the 'Innovation Faction' could no longer be shaken, and the contradiction with the royal family was increasing, just not knowing when it would suddenly explode.</p><p></p><p>Although the Mage Association and the Royal Family were in conflict, what Set Peng was still able to confirm was that if the 'Illumination Society' openly took action against the Royal Family, then the Source Mage Association would definitely come forward to stop the actions of the 'Illumination Society'.</p><p></p><p>With their current strength, it was impossible for them to be a match for the Mage Association, and in the end, they would only end up bringing his friends into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't know what Zhi Peng was thinking, and directly poked through his beautiful dream, ''You've already been discovered by the Imperial Clan and the Mage Association, and have investigated you and your friends without your knowledge!</p><p></p><p>So, what are you going to do about it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng said incredulously, "Discovered? When did this happen. My dating has always been low-key and unassuming, it shouldn't be!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's a fact that I've been found out now, the reason why I haven't made a move on you yet is probably because I want to find out the person who's doing the pushing behind the scenes! That is, me. But I guess the association won't wait too long, you'd better make plans as early as possible."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng's face was gloomy, and finally gritted his teeth and said, "Mr. Javi, I would like to gather my friends together tomorrow and implement the second phase of the plan, first occupying the three municipalities as turf, and gradually expanding outwards until the entire Hengxuan District is annexed.</p><p></p><p>But ...... since I have already been watched, doesn t that mean that as soon as I make a move, I will immediately be discovered. In that case, how can I gather my friends together?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I've already thought of this point for you, later I will give you a 'transit ball' that can directly connect to the gathering location, you only need to bring the transit ball to find your friends! Strive to stroll through the entire Hengxuan District within two months."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was surprised, "Transit ball?"</p><p></p><p>"Catch it!"</p><p></p><p>Just issued a doubt, a basketball-sized metal ball appeared out of thin air in front of him, he subconsciously reached out to catch the metal ball, it was so heavy that he almost fell to the ground unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is the transit ball, do you see a door on the sphere?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng flipped the ball around and immediately saw the small door that Su Hao was talking about.</p><p></p><p>"You open the door, go inside, there is another door inside, and through that door inside, you can go to the meeting point."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng pointed at the small door that was only the size of an egg and stumbled, "In ...... in?"</p><p></p><p>Just such a small door, a living person, how to get in? Said what there is a door inside, can go to the meeting point ......</p><p></p><p>Is this Mr. Jarvie joking, or did he send something over that was accidentally wrong ......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew Zhi Peng's doubts, didn't explain too much, and directly said, "Go and try, you put the transit ball on the ground and walk into that door!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng: "......"</p><p></p><p>He always felt that there was a problem, but he didn't know what it was, and couldn't help but secretly say, "Maybe it's my problem!"</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like someone asking him to stab himself with a knife and then smiling and saying to him, "Try it, it's fine!"</p><p></p><p>But since Mr. Jarvie strongly urged him to try, then let's give it a try? If he couldn't get in later, it wouldn't be too late to tell Mr. Javi.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Zhi Peng hesitated not knowing whether to reach out or lift his foot first, or to put a finger first?</p><p></p><p>At the next moment, the expected feeling of hitting an obstacle did not appear, his foot stepped in as if it was stepping into the air, and then in a trance before his eyes, he realized that he had arrived in a bright spherical space, roughly about fifty meters in diameter, and there was a stone door in the middle of it.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was stunned, ''This is really possible? It's too awesome. Mr. Javi, how do I get out?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "If you exit through the door behind you, you will return to your room, if you walk out through the center door, you will go to the meeting point. This ball is just a transit ball.</p><p></p><p>You can take this ball and send all your friends away quietly, but move fast, once you are discovered, the difficulty of the next action will increase."</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's opinion, the action of summoning friends would inevitably cause the Mage Association to be alerted, and it would be good to be able to summon half of them in the end.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao explained some precautions, he disconnected the parrot card voice with Set Peng.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng's ability, was indeed good, but he was just a source mage without any foundation, everything had to start from scratch, the difficulty of starting a business was extremely high, and even though he had been struggling for two years without stopping for a moment, the volume was still too small.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with Su Hao backing him up, everything is possible.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Chief Radha, the artifact collection room has been burglarized, all the source artifacts have disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>A cloaked man with a pipe in his mouth stood up in a huff and roared, "All the source weapons in the artifact storage room are gone? Are you kidding me, do you want to die?"</p><p></p><p>Coming up to report the three mages were so shocked that they couldn't help but take a step back, and one of the women, with tears in her eyes, said with a face of fear, "You'd better go and take a look at it quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Ka-ching!"</p><p></p><p>The whole office desk was actually crushed by him with one hand, he deeply pinch a mouthful of pipe, spit out thick smoke, and walked out first with a booming pace.</p><p></p><p>While walking while grinning: "If it is fake, you are dead, dare to joke with the old man! If it is true, the thief is dead, even dare to steal to the old man's head! His grandmother a fierce!"</p><p></p><p>A moment later, from the basement came a loud roar, "Check! Give the old man check! Give me a hard check! His grandma's fierce! @#￥%......"</p>

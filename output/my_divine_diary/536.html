        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Everyone could hear the helplessness and resignation in Beech's tone.</p><p></p><p>The heart and lungs were still there meant that the rest was gone, and even he himself didn't know how long he could support his survival by relying on his source body.</p><p></p><p>They came in at a different location than Su Hao and the others, and much later, careful at first, but nothing happened, and then became more and more bold and traveled faster, until nightfall, strong winds blowing, willows raging, did not pay too much attention to them, hit.</p><p></p><p>First Jiang Ji was swept, a few breaths later, the organs jumped and escaped, Beech's attention on Jiang Ji's body in the moment was also hit, until his own organs also escaped before he woke up. However, it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Only Sugar followed the two, and was lucky.</p><p></p><p>When Jiang Ji saw Xing's trio appear, he was like seeing a savior and asked for help from Ah Wang, "Ah Wang, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang immediately took out two healing pills from his bosom and threw them to Bitch and Jiang Ji, who took them as if he had received a life-saving straw and swallowed them in one gulp....... However, his stomach was long gone!</p><p></p><p>Beech took the healing pills, put them in his hands and played with them for a while, and threw them back to Ah Wang, "No need!"</p><p></p><p>The miracle Jiang Ji expected didn't happen, and snotty tears flowed as he said, "Ah Wang, go help me get my stuff back, will you! I don't want to die ah! As long as ...... as long as you help me get it back, I won't snatch Little Sugar from you, trust me ......"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang's face changed and he chided, "Jiang Ji, what nonsense are you saying!"</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar was full of disappointment, looking out to the side, not knowing what was in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The field once again fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ji's pleading voice grew weaker and weaker until it completely lost its voice.</p><p></p><p>Electricity flickered on Bitsy's body as he stuck his greatsword on the ground before sitting down and leaning his back against it. He glanced at Little Sugar and slowly said, "I can't hold on much longer! Xing, help me take Little Sugar out! From now on, there will be no more 'Thunderstorm Squad'. And ...... help me say sorry to Mei Lan!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing had just nodded his head when Beech shook his head again, "Forget it, there's no need to say anything, everyone knows in their hearts that there will always be a day like this, either sooner or later!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Yangwangxing squad set off again, now with an extra Sugar.</p><p></p><p>Xing told Sugar all about the attention to detail, but Sugar just nodded sullenly and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre disaster was indeed very dangerous, and without knowing the triggering conditions, the probability of being hit would be very high, and perhaps a careless sneeze could trigger the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Take this 'nowhere to run' for example, a normal person walks into a weeping willow forest, looking at the clusters of weeping willows, can he or she resist not reaching out to jerk a handful of leaves?</p><p></p><p>Once the hand itches, who can bear it? Obsessive-compulsive disorder this disease, is very difficult to cure, ten can have nine strokes!</p><p></p><p>Of course, except for those who have been specially trained.</p><p></p><p>The sky is completely dark, two lighting pills one after the other to illuminate the surroundings, the wind is howling, willow tree shaking violently, the branches of the chaotic pumping, full of the world is the meaning of berserk.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how the willow branches lashed, they could do nothing to Su Hao and the others.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed, a sword of dawn could cut down a large willow tree in front of him, and then the small cannon blasted open a spacious passageway, coupled with a blast of air controlled by Xing, it could isolate all the dangers.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of a song came faintly from the distance.</p><p></p><p>"It's raining! It's going to rain~ Run, run, run! Hurry up and hide!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao heard what was in it, and with a creepy shock, he immediately voiced out, "Xing, it might be raining, it's likely that the rain also carries a bizarre effect, and getting caught in the rain is probably the end of the line. Can you blow all the rain away?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing sniffed and without saying a word, a huge triangular cone air shield was propped up above the heads of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>After five seconds passed, a torrential downpour of rain, descended on their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Snap~Wow!"</p><p></p><p>The rain slapped against the triangular cone air shield, making a crackling and crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>The four of them hid below and looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>If not for Su Hao's quick reminder, this wave of rain would have wiped them all out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flipped his hand, and a yellow rat was baptized by the rain as he flung it into the rain.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the things under the skin of this rat each ran out.</p><p></p><p>Watching the crowd's hearts palpitate.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the willow branch was just an appetizer, and the real killing move was actually the rainfall from the sky!</p><p></p><p>The problem was, before the rain hit, who could realize that it would rain? When the rain fell and realized it was raining, they were bound to have been drenched all over, and then if they wanted to hide from the rain, it was all too late.</p><p></p><p>And that, that's the real horror.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao hadn't reacted quickly when he heard the sound ......</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was savoring the aftertaste of danger, Xing's face changed drastically as he said, "Oh no, the weird effect of the rain is working on my air shield and is destroying the structure of the shield, I won't be able to hold on for long."</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang panicked and reached out and pulled out a box, opening four umbrellas from it ......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the umbrellas in his hand, this kind of source creation was not expected to last long, so he said, "Move closer to me!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd didn't know what Su Hao was going to do, and after holding the umbrellas open, they approached Su Hao as they were told, and with a thought, Su Hao began to generate an 'opposing spatial shield' around the crowd, enclosing them in it.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing's air shield collapsed, and the rainwater immediately hit the umbrella, making a "popping" sound.</p><p></p><p>Soon Ah Wang's umbrella also collapsed.</p><p></p><p>One of Xing's air masks opened up again, and Ah Wang took the opportunity to pull out more umbrellas, but helplessly said, "It won't last long. ......"</p><p></p><p>Sugar punched the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom~"</p><p></p><p>The earth rumbled and rose a stone pillar, which then unfolded on both sides, forming a huge stone umbrella like a gazebo in a park.</p><p></p><p>However, the stone umbrella was only able to support itself for two or three seconds before its internal structure was destroyed, and it collapsed and fell down one after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!" The hearts of the crowd chilled, and a bad feeling struck their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar let out a long breath, as if she had unraveled her heart and was ready to meet the end.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao said, "It's okay, no need to hold an umbrella, the rain can't get in!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he was the first to throw away the umbrella in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing's eyes rounded and said, "Ah Yang!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was also creeped out and were about to lean their own umbrellas over when they noticed the abnormality on Su Hao's head.</p><p></p><p>All the rainwater inexplicably disappeared as it approached Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>That's right, it just disappeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>When rainwater normally hit the air cover, it would splash out some water, but the rainwater on Su Hao's head was as if it was directly vaporized.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the rainwater on Su Hao's head disappear, they realized that the rainwater on their own heads also directly disappeared after approaching a certain distance.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao prompted, ''Within this area, the rainwater can't enter for the time being. This is my source ability, don't be surprised, it's normal!"</p><p></p><p>Xing looked at Su Hao in astonishment, and then slowly lowered his umbrella.</p><p></p><p>It was a very itsy-bitsy experience, and he couldn't help but say, "Ah Yang, how many more abilities do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It should be quite a lot! I'm not sure about the specifics."</p><p></p><p>With such heavy rain, there was no way to continue, so the crowd stopped where they were to take shelter from the rain, clearing the crazy willow trees around them while waiting for the rain to stop.</p><p></p><p>This time, they waited for an hour, yet the rain still had no tendency to stop.</p><p></p><p>Xing and the others had an unusually heavy heart, not knowing what the situation of the other teams that had entered this disaster was like, if this rain covered the entire disaster area, then the outcome was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>And who could escape this kind of torrential rain? Even the mages with the strongest defense ability, the Source of Gold mages, couldn't! This kind of rain had a weird effect attached to it, which could be called 'nowhere to escape', ignoring the defense effect and directly destroying it from the inside, so even the most powerful Source Mages must be helpless.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ah Yang this exception will not be said ......</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the only way to solve the problem is to destroy the nucleus of the bizarre disaster as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing made up his mind, as soon as the rain stopped, he would immediately find the nucleus.</p><p></p><p>"It's raining! Why aren't you guys hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a tender childish voice came from behind the curtain of rain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was creeped out and turned his head violently to look for the voice, surprisingly, someone was able to dodge his perception to lean so close!</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and the others also looked on guard.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a ragged child came out from the rain curtain, staring at Su Hao and the others with big, empty eyes.</p>

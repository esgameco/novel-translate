        <h1>Chapter 985</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——"</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang——" </p><p></p><p>"Ding ding ding——"</p><p></p><p>The intense explosions completely engulfed Lyu Yijiang and the other two, with the center resembling the epicenter of the world's destruction, full of raging energies running amok in utter chaos.</p><p></p><p>This made the twenty-eight kings worry that the three berserk warriors might have died.</p><p></p><p>Putting themselves in their shoes, they realized they would not be able to survive such an attack either.</p><p></p><p>After a short moment, as the smoke cleared, three sturdy figures stood at the bombing center.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-eight kings were dumbfounded: "What, they're fine? More importantly, their clothes aren't even torn..."</p><p></p><p>'Chrysanthemum Gold Spear'!</p><p></p><p>It was Ravir, the new Demon King.</p><p></p><p>He seized the moment when everyone was lost in thought to launch a sudden attack.</p><p></p><p>The instant Ravir's spear pierced Lyu Yijiang's throat, he couldn't help but curve his lips slightly: "Got him!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think anyone could block this spear strike he had been storing power for. In fact, so far, no one he had struck managed to block it - not even the strongest former Demon God King he had encountered died from this spear.</p><p></p><p>He believed this time would be no exception!</p><p></p><p>As for whether this strike would kill the opponent, he had no worries, for he possessed many healing techniques. He would pierce through the opponent's throat and cervical vertebrae, depriving them of the ability to fight, while keeping them alive.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound rang out as Ravir's spear was blocked by the opponent's throat, as if striking a thick steel plate.</p><p></p><p>No, with his strength, he could easily pierce through steel plates with a casual thrust of his spear.</p><p></p><p>Yet this strike was blocked - Ravir's eyes bulged as he instinctively retreated.</p><p></p><p>The other twenty-seven kings were also stunned by Ravir's futile strike.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they realize just how formidable the "indestructible body" mentioned in the intelligence was.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang rubbed his neck forcefully, frowning: "That hurt, you guys really are powerful - you almost broke through my defenses."</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists, his aura rising another notch, and shouted loudly: "Now it's our turn to attack!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Lyu Yijiang's words, the kings couldn't help but back away, continuously layering various protective shields over themselves, not feeling too confident.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Lyu Yijiang and the other two vanished from their spots, charging towards the different kings.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King's pupils constricted as his eyeballs rolled back: "Behind me, too late!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's fist struck the Earth Spirit King squarely in the back, shattering the layers of shields around him, but ultimately blocked Lyu Yijiang's attack.</p><p></p><p>However, the Earth Spirit King was still blasted away by that ferocious punch.</p><p></p><p>The Turing King secretly rejoiced: "Blocked it, and got blasted away too. Good, that way the berserk warrior will surely go after the other kings."</p><p></p><p>But before he could revel in that thought for even a second, a figure appeared on his flight path, fists raised in a boxing stance.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Another punch struck the Earth Spirit King's chest, shattering his remaining shields. The Earth Spirit King coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood from this attack and was sent hurtling back, crashing heavily into the ground and plowing a deep trench.</p><p></p><p>During their previous battles with the other racial kings, Lyu Yijiang and the other two had grasped these kings' defensive capabilities - two consecutive full-power strikes could shatter their defenses.</p><p></p><p>The ensuing scene descended into chaos, a free-for-all between the twenty-eight kings and the three warriors, smoke billowing, sand and rocks flying, trees snapping and soaring, the earth rumbling and quaking.</p><p></p><p>This was not at all the ganging up the twenty-eight kings had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>The more Lyu Yijiang fought, the more exhilarated he became, his whole body brimming with even greater vigor. With a flash, he suddenly appeared before the Demon King Ravir and unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>Ravir's numerous shields shattered as he was blasted away.</p><p></p><p>But he saw the berserk warrior Lyu Yijiang giving chase, his mind racing: "I must counterattack, otherwise I'll just get blasted away again by another punch. My remaining shields won't be enough to block his immense strength, and I don't have time to reinforce them now."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, demonic power surged wildly within the Demon King, instantly halting his soaring body and restoring his balance.</p><p></p><p>Facing the charging Lyu Yijiang, he swung his long spear: "Behold the genesis of yin and yang, the force that moves mountains..."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Ravir was blasted away again, crashing into the ground and plowing a trench like the other kings.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After the battle, the twenty-eight kings regrouped to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Their regal bearings showed no sign of their earlier disarray as they sat on their king's thrones, exuding a kingly aura from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King Ravir said gravely, "These 'Berserk Three Warriors' are indeed formidable. We could only fight them to a draw, they cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King nodded, "Indeed, their strength exceeded our expectations. For them to fight us to such a state, they have reason to be proud."</p><p></p><p>"Most crucially, I did not sense any magical fluctuations from them - they were battling us purely with their formidable physical bodies, ignoring our spell attacks. Those indestructible bodies, like forged artifacts, are enviable!"</p><p></p><p>"Have you all forgotten? The 'Berserk Three Warriors' possess lucky coins that allow them to travel the Infinite Lands at will. I believe they must have chanced upon some body tempering technique in the Infinite Lands and accidentally cultivated themselves into such an indestructible state. This body tempering technique must be extremely valuable."</p><p></p><p>"Right, before they appeared, I had never heard of such an unreasonable ability. I won't hide it from you kings, I had perused my race's ancient texts before and found no records of body tempering techniques."</p><p></p><p>Ravir said, "I understand the importance of this body tempering technique, but none of the twenty-eight of us could subdue them, so we likely have no chance of obtaining it."</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King said, "I know of a powerful organization spanning the entire Infinite Lands. If it's them, they would surely have a way to deal with the Berserk Three Warriors."</p><p></p><p>Ravir asked curiously, "What organization?"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King smiled faintly, "The Demon Race!"</p><p></p><p>Ravir frowned, "The Demon Race? You mean the recently emerged Demonic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King nodded, "Correct, the Demonic Realm has been increasingly active in the Infinite Lands, openly recruiting. It was only by chance that I learned about them. I know something you all might not - the minimum requirement for the Demonic Realm's recruits is the eighth rank. They don't even look at someone like us."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh..."</p><p></p><p>The kings gasped, realizing that their seventh rank peak was almost the pinnacle of the Infinite Lands, yet this newly emerged Demonic Realm had such astounding strength.</p><p></p><p>Ravir frowned, "I don't think we can enlist the help of such a Demonic Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit King smiled, "But they would be interested in this body tempering technique. As informants providing useful intel, asking for a bit of the body tempering technique isn't too much, is it?"</p><p></p><p>"What if the Demon Race refuses to share the body tempering technique with us?"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Race is exceptionally powerful, far beyond us. Naturally, they wouldn't place too much importance on the body tempering technique. Since they're recruiting, as long as we humble ourselves and revere the Demon Race as a divine race above our own, allowing them privileged treatment in our domains, they would surely not begrudge imparting the body tempering technique to us."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Earth Spirit King curved his lips, "Moreover, this is a three-for-one deal. First, we can capture those three berserk warriors to vent our resentment. Second, we might obtain the body tempering technique. Third, we can find our twenty-eight alliance a powerful backer."</p><p></p><p>The kings looked at each other, seeing the glint of interest in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What an ingenious plan!"</p><p>"As expected of the Earth Spirit King!"</p><p></p><p>They couldn't defeat them in battle, but they were also unwilling to give up. Even if there was the slightest chance of obtaining the body tempering technique, they were willing to take that gamble.</p><p></p><p>After intense discussion, Ravir, who had organized this operation, finally said, "If that's the case, then let's find a way to locate the Demon Race and convey our request to them, and provide the location of the Berserk Three Warriors. What do you kings think?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The former Human King and former Furry Tail King had smoothly retired from their racial king positions ten years ago during a coup by the new generation, just like the former Demon God King.</p><p></p><p>This was the legendary retirement of the old.</p><p></p><p>They had even taken on youthful human forms, finally becoming human again after eight thousand years.</p><p></p><p>After ten years of secluded cultivation, they had regained most of their former power and returned to the pinnacle of the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, their old classmate the former Demon God King had found them, hoping to team up and seek out their teacher Ayashan to re-join the Infinite Sect.</p><p></p><p>But they had rejected him.</p><p></p><p>They still harbored resentment over what had happened back then. In their view, since Ayashan had already rejected them once, they could never return to the Infinite Sect.</p><p></p><p>They believed that through their own efforts, they would surely surpass their teacher Ayashan, at which point they could go before him and proudly proclaim, "Thirty thousand years east of the river, thirty thousand years west of the river."</p><p></p><p>This had become their obsession.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not uncommon for former racial kings to have such obsessions.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, it was rare for former kings like the Demon God King to eventually join their old classmates and successfully enter the Infinite Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just as the former Human King and former Furry Tail King were seeking their future path, the newly emerged Demonic Realm started recruiting!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Demonic Realm's strength and opportunity, they unhesitatingly chose to join.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Demonic Realm, the former Human King and former Furry Tail King discovered that many of their old classmates had also joined and were now working for the Demonic Realm, recruiting talents across the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>The former Human King and former Furry Tail King were greatly encouraged: "Excellent, through our joint efforts and progress, one day..."</p><p></p><p>However, before that day arrived, the two former kings had to first recruit enough talents for the Demonic Realm.</p><p></p><p>One day, an Earth Spirit suddenly approached the former Human King and former Furry Tail King, telling the story of the "Berserk Three Warriors" who had tempered their bodies into an indestructible state.</p><p></p><p>The former Human King's eyes lit up as he said to the former Furry Tail King, "Old Furry, these Berserk Three Warriors sound promising. Let's recruit them into the Demonic Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The former Furry Tail King nodded, "Good idea, Old Human."</p>

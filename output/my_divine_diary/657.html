        <h1>Chapter 657</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After implanting the 'Spiritual Eye to Perceive Ripples', Su Hao carefully studied this special type of rippling undulation that he could 'see', but after researching it for a while, he realized that perhaps this undulation was of no use to him.</p><p></p><p>It was just a specific frequency of energy emitted by celestial bodies in the universe!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Su Hao removed the 'Spiritual Eye 1.0' from his brain.</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao discussed the issues with the 'Spiritual Eye' with Yashan.</p><p></p><p>"Yashan, the Spiritual Eye project can be considered a preliminary success. But based on my experience using it, the defects are still not small, and further optimization is needed.</p><p></p><p>First, it cannot be freely turned on and off. Our eyes can still close, but if the 'Spiritual Eye' cannot be turned off when not in use, it will consume a lot of our energy;</p><p></p><p>Third is the optimization of the overall shape. In the future, we need to install multiple Spiritual Eyes in our brains, not just one, even up to over a hundred. So miniaturization is the focus of future research.</p><p></p><p>Fourth..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan took diligent notes accordingly, and then said, "Got it, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and then said, "Or maybe I can make it into a ring-shaped device, and fix the metal ring in the brain, connecting all the brain nodes.</p><p></p><p>Then on the metal ring, I'll create a hundred identical grooves specifically for embedding different 'Spiritual Eyes'. If we need to observe the 'Ripple One' undulation, we'll embed the 'Spiritual Eye for Ripple One'. If we need to observe the 'Ripple Two' undulation, we'll embed the 'Spiritual Eye for Ripple Two', and so on.</p><p></p><p>Just like a computer motherboard, we can plug in different graphics cards and memory sticks... This way it will be very flexible. What do you think, Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at Yashan in surprise and said, "Good idea, Yashan! You're very insightful to have come up with this great solution so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled and said, "It's from learning from Master Wei for so long that I've grasped the essence of 'flexibility'!"</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, you become like the people you associate with.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had been with Su Hao for such a long time, and as a Precog himself, his brain wasn't bad either. The way he thought about problems gradually became more like Su Hao's, which was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Feiyue also made an external 'Spiritual Eye'. He ruthlessly opened a small hole at the back of his head, and then inserted the signal tentacle of the Spiritual Eye through the hole...</p><p></p><p>With the help of Yashan and Fengcheng, he finally succeeded in 'seeing' the different scenery of the 'Ripple One' undulation.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shaken and gained new insights into the universe.</p><p></p><p>After that, he became extremely passionate about researching the 'Spiritual Eye' project.</p><p></p><p>"I yearn to see the true appearance of the universe."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After discussing the follow-up design issues of the 'Spiritual Eye' device with Yashan, Su Hao returned to his own laboratory.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering one question: how to find the material that can sense the 'Doom System' energy undulation.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if such a thing existed, what it was, or where it could be found!</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao was never afraid of taking chances...</p><p></p><p>After all, wasn't his reincarnation also a matter of chance?</p><p></p><p>He firmly believed one thing: since there was an energy undulation of the 'Doom System', there must be a corresponding material that could sense that undulation. As long as there was such a sensing material, he would eventually find it in the endless flow of time.</p><p></p><p>However, there were different ways of taking chances.</p><p></p><p>The higher the probability, the better the luck; the lower the probability, the worse the luck.</p><p></p><p>So what Su Hao was thinking about was how to increase the probability of finding the sensing material.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot change the quantity and location of the sensing material, but I can change the efficiency of my search. So, I need to develop a special kind of 'planetary virus'..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the clearer Su Hao's thoughts became: "Create an 'Exploration Cube' virus similar to the 'Star-Shattering Cube', which can spread to every corner of a planet.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the 'Star-Shattering Cube' whose function focuses on replicating itself and converting matter into 'Source', the 'Exploration Cube' will emphasize 'self-replication and exploration of unknown materials'.</p><p></p><p>This way, when I arrive at a star system, I only need to release the 'Exploration Cube' onto a planet and let it self-replicate and explore. I can then obtain the materials I want, increasing the efficiency by at least ten thousand times.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, I won't risk missing anything."</p><p></p><p>As for the technical implementation issues, this was not a difficult point for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had been studying 'Source Materialization', researching various common elements, compounds, and mixtures thoroughly, even calculating the 'Energy Coefficient' for different materials one by one.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was easy to calculate whether something was a 'known material' or an 'unknown material'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself, "The spacecraft will reach the Purple Wolf Star System in about five years. I'll take this time to try developing a 'planetary virus' called the 'Exploration Cube'!"</p><p></p><p>With that in mind, he immediately entered the Ping-Pong Dimension and retrieved the relevant information on 'planetary viruses' to start designing based on it.</p><p></p><p>"First, the main body structure should be designed like a drill, a burrowing robot to freely move inside the planet..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five years later, the spacecraft completed its final 'Positioning Transmission' and appeared near the outermost planetary orbit of the Purple Wolf Star System.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gathered in the cockpit.</p><p></p><p>Yashan reported the information they had collected: "Analysis of the eight planets in the Purple Wolf Star System is complete. Four are Source-like planets, three are gas giants, and one is an ice giant. The fourth planet is a 'Source-like planet' with the most hospitable environment for life forms.</p><p></p><p>Master Wei, shall we go to the fourth planet first for a look around?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Then let's go to the fourth planet first. There might be a pleasant surprise."</p><p></p><p>It was like opening a prize - no matter how you guessed, no matter how small the probability, you couldn't confirm whether life existed or not until you actually landed on the planet and explored.</p><p></p><p>After some preparation, everyone transmitted directly near the fourth planet in the system, docked at a satellite, and then exited the spacecraft to embark on another exploration journey.</p><p></p><p>As they had expected, there was no sign of life.</p><p></p><p>Just desolation.</p><p></p><p>However, about half of the planet's surface was liquid water, providing a prerequisite condition for the emergence of life.</p><p></p><p>But to give birth to life...</p><p></p><p>They couldn't imagine what kind of miracle would be needed for the first life form to emerge on such a planet.</p><p></p><p>After exploring for a few days, everyone flew out of the planet's atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan and the others saw Su Hao take out an apple-sized metal cube from his Storage Dimension, with a high-quality Source Pearl embedded in a groove on it.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding, Yashan curiously asked, "Master Wei, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised it in front of Yashan and said, "This is another planetary virus."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--"</p><p></p><p>Everyone shuddered and instinctively stepped back a few paces, away from the exquisite little cube in Su Hao's hand.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew Su Hao could create 'planetary viruses', they still couldn't comprehend how he did it.</p><p></p><p>They all had a natural fear of planetary viruses.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "What are you afraid of? It's not like it can eat you."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled awkwardly, "It's not fear, it's just an indescribable feeling, like we should keep our distance."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng curiously asked, "Master Wei, are you planning to blast this planet away?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "No, this is a new planetary virus I created. Its function is not to destroy planets, but to search for unknown materials on planets, replacing our search tasks and greatly improving efficiency."</p><p></p><p>"There's such a method?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course, as long as you think of it, what method is impossible?</p><p></p><p>Yashan and the others had a thought: "Master Wei is revered as the Creator by the people of Source Star, and it seems they are not wrong..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 585</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the improved method for the 'Source Variable Suppressor', Su Hao already had a plan, he just hadn't found the time to modify it yet.</p><p></p><p>Now he happened to encounter the Chairman Lada who possessed the 'Deadlock Fist', so he set about improving it.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's view, Lada's ability was indeed very powerful. Any living beings within his perception range could be killed with a casual punch, ignoring outer defenses.</p><p></p><p>The limitation on his ability was just the perception range!</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao obtained this ability, coupled with his 200,000 meter perception range, he would be considered a deity in the eyes of ordinary mortals!</p><p></p><p>So the optimal choice now was to capture Chairman Lada and experiment on him to extract his ability.</p><p></p><p>However, it wouldn't be easy to get Lada to cooperate with their experiment. One careless mistake could lead to retaliation!</p><p></p><p>The 'Source Variable Suppressor' worked quite well, fundamentally suppressing source masters' ability to use their powers, turning them into completely ordinary people, yearning for their lost powers.</p><p></p><p>As for improving the suppressor, Su Hao was quite experienced. Back in the Summoner's World, he had personally researched the spatial suppressor 'Dual Suppression Field'!</p><p></p><p>In just five days, Su Hao came up with a feasible plan and tested it on Ya Shan's experimental subjects. Without exception, all of them were unable to use their source powers within the suppression field.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled and said, "Those being suppressed won't know their abilities are suppressed until they try to use them. In the future when Zhi Peng comes to chat, I'll turn on the suppressor for him so he can talk until he's parched without any effect. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Don't always think of playing tricks on Zhi Peng!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Cheng took the initiative, "Master Wei, let me take the suppressor to deal with Chairman Lada! At the very least we need to take back our territory."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "I'll go take a look too, do a test. I want to know if the 'Second Space' can effectively block the 'Deadlock Fist' attack."  </p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "That's too dangerous..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, "As long as I hide my brain well, there won't be a big problem!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the three of them located Lada's squad of five that very day. They transformed into three [Minions] and hovered 100,000 meters away, observing the enemy with their divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The source variable suppressor was powered by spiritual power, so the range it could cover was consistent with the spiritual power wave range, reaching up to 200 kilometers. However, beyond 50 kilometers the wave began to weaken, and past 100 kilometers it became very unstable with greatly reduced suppression effect.</p><p></p><p>In summary, within 50 kilometers the suppression effect was optimal, which was 50,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Last time I was 10,000 meters from the enemy, I was directly struck. I guess their attack range exceeds that, so to be safe, it's better not to get too close."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "No rush, I'll probe first."</p><p></p><p>With that, his figure landed on the ground and transformed into an adamantine vine spreading out from his feet, layer upon layer of adamantine vines enveloping him until he became a nearly 100-meter tall adamantine giant.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a giant, he engraved complex structures all over his body, turning into a super huge mecha with wings that shone brilliantly in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's eyes lit up with golden light, "Wow! So cool!"</p><p></p><p>This was just Su Hao's method of concealing his body. According to Feng Cheng's description, although the enemy could attack any location, their attack range wasn't as large as imagined.</p><p></p><p>So as long as his body was big enough that the enemy couldn't guess where his real body was, it would work!</p><p></p><p>At least it greatly reduced the risk of being directly struck. As long as his luck wasn't too bad...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took two steps, shaking the ground with thunderous rumbles. The 100-meter giant's mouth said, "The control feels decent, like piloting a real mecha."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he lifted a foot and took a step forward. His figure gradually faded and hid in the 'Second Space', slowly disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an enormously tall crystal giant figure slowly materialized in front of Lada and the others.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Hao's projection - the Crystal Gundam!</p><p></p><p>What kind of feeling is it to have a 100-meter tall giant standing in front of you? The feeling is that it could step on you and crush you at any moment.</p><p></p><p>That oppressive feeling is indescribable, only making your heart feel like it could jump out and your head feel like it could explode at any second.</p><p></p><p>Du Meng stammered, "This...this is yesterday's Ground Scraper Armor?"</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin stiffened, "No way...the design is different! I think it's the Ground Scraper Armor's dad!"</p><p></p><p>Du Meng refuted, "Its dad couldn't be this big either! At least great-grandfather level."</p><p></p><p>They had seen many source beasts, including quite a few with huge bodies. But a 100-meter tall source beast, to be honest, they had never seen or could even imagine what it would look like.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't a giant like this only exist in myths and legends?</p><p></p><p>Even Lada was stunned, muttering, "What the heck, how did this thing grow so huge? It must be some demonic source ability..."</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled woman's glasses glinted as if she found the answer, "Could it be that this is the Ground Scraper Armor we fought before? And its ability is to grow bigger after getting beaten up..."</p><p></p><p>"That's even more ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the giant lowered its head, its red-glowing eyes looking at Lada's group, "Come on, hit me!"</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others were shocked that it actually made such a request.</p><p></p><p>They exchanged glances, all seeing the puzzled look in each other's eyes. But it was undoubtedly an enemy!</p><p></p><p>Lada took the lead, clenching his fist and roaring as he fiercely punched the ground, "Take this punch, let me knock some sense into you!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew~"</p><p></p><p>A cold wind blew by with two fallen leaves, but nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>Lada looked up in disbelief at the giant's head, "Incredibly...not even the slightest effect?"</p><p></p><p>The others were instantly daunted too!</p><p></p><p>This was an insult to them! Ever since becoming Chairman, no one had dared speak to Lada like this!</p><p></p><p>The ground Lada punched was completely unharmed, as if all his attacks were transferred onto the Gundam giant's body.</p><p></p><p>However, Lada's frenzied attacks had no effect, and the Gundam giant was looking at him expectantly, even flashing a smile after a moment?</p><p></p><p>Lada's face flushed red with rising heat. He gradually stopped, staring up at the enormously huge giant in disbelief!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bespectacled woman came over and said, "Chairman Lada, could it be that this towering giant is just an empty shell, and your attacks didn't hit its real body?"</p><p></p><p>Lada's eyes lit up, "That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to the source master and said, "Afu, destroy the giant!"</p><p></p><p>Afu replied, "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, stepped forward with his right foot and stomped it down heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A crimson beam of light spread out from under his foot, quickly reaching the giant and splitting left and right into an arc, encircling the giant in the middle.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Fire Scorching Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>Within the circle, flames surged upwards like a volcanic eruption, forming a massive pillar of fire that engulfed the Crystal Gundam.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't over yet. Afu made a hollow grip with his right hand, generating a long flame spear from his palm that he grasped. He ran forward a few steps, then flung the flame spear towards the fire pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Guided Spear!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish--"</p><p></p><p>After the flame spear shot into the massive fire pillar, the pillar violently churned and its brilliance intensified until it suddenly exploded outwards!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>Impacted by the intense blast, Lada and the others instinctively shielded their eyes from the raging heat wave and sparks.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the flames and dust dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others couldn't help but look towards the Crystal Gundam.</p><p></p><p>There was now a deep crater blasted into the ground where it stood, but that crystal giant...</p><p></p><p>Was still standing in the same spot, unmoving, smiling down at them, its crystal armor shining brilliantly in the sunlight!</p><p></p><p>Just as the giant finished speaking, its figure gradually vanished from the spot until completely disappearing.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 698</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Regarding his own situation, after much contemplation, Su Hao came to a conclusion: barring any accidents, no one in this world could do anything to him. Even the powerful Ba Shou clan should not be able to affect his lifespan of five thousand years!</p><p></p><p>He settled his somewhat excited emotions and continued writing on the paper:</p><p></p><p>"Next, here are the learning goals listed in order of importance:</p><p></p><p>1. Study the engine technology of this world. This is very important, but with the appropriate technical materials, the difficulty should not be high. At most it would take two years to master. The only difficulty lies in how to obtain all the engine materials? We'll discuss this again when back on Planet Blue, or just take them by force if needed. If we can't get them, we'll take them from the Ba Shou clan.</p><p></p><p>2. Learn the interstellar communication technology of this world.</p><p></p><p>3. Learn the detection and calculation technology of this world. </p><p></p><p>4. Research the synchronized control method of the Star-Eating Bugs.</p><p></p><p>5. Research the egg mode of the bugs.</p><p></p><p>6. Research the brain consciousness of different races, perhaps finding a way for human consciousness information to match other intelligent races. In this way, my reincarnation will not be limited to humans or humanoid races after death, increasing the probability and shortening the cycle.</p><p></p><p>7. Find an opportunity to package all the technologies of this world..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao listed out many learning and research plans. As the plans became more and more complete, his future actions also became clearer.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully complete the research on these projects, then the vast distances of this universe would no longer be a factor limiting his range of activity.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that could limit him would be his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>He could come and go freely in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>He might not even need to reincarnate, just relying on his own strength to find the next civilized world.</p><p></p><p>As for the lifespan issue...</p><p></p><p>Five thousand years would be enough for now. He could worry about naturally aging to death later.</p><p></p><p>What concerned him now was another issue.</p><p></p><p>He wrote passionately on the paper:</p><p></p><p>"Finally, find a way to control the 'Wavemotion'!</p><p></p><p>I cannot stay hidden in the second-dimensional space forever. I want true freedom!"</p><p></p><p>He believed there must be a way to control the Wavemotion, to make it a part of his own power.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had not found a way to master the Wavemotion was because he did not have enough knowledge yet!</p><p></p><p>As long as he kept learning, everything would open up to him.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had gradually grown stronger, escaping the fate of dying young at three or five years old, and making it to his current level. This gave Su Hao tremendous self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>He believed that diligent study could overcome anything.</p><p></p><p>Even different races could transcend through learning!</p><p></p><p>He put down his pen, saved this draft, stood up and mused: "If there are any unchanging laws in this universe that can make a person all-knowing and all-powerful, they must be the laws of 'learning' and 'progress'."</p><p></p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to achieve both 'learning' and 'progress' simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>After all, many people did not necessarily make 'progress' despite their efforts in 'learning' - this was the cruelest part.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After exiting the Ballgame Space, Su Hao entered the small world to check on the status of the Star-Eating Bug mother bug he had been raising.</p><p></p><p>Now the mother bug's main body had grown as large as a van, and it seemed it could still continue growing.</p><p></p><p>It was curled up in the soil of the small world, doing only two things all day: eating soil and laying eggs.</p><p></p><p>From the initial calculations until now, it had already laid over three thousand eggs.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of bug eggs had successfully hatched into strong ant-like shelled bugs, squatting around the mother bug, seemingly acting as guards.</p><p></p><p>The second batch of eggs hatched into many huge digging shelled bugs with extremely strong excavation abilities, constantly expanding the underground space and moving the mother bug deeper.</p><p></p><p>So far, only the second batch had hatched, totaling over a hundred offspring.</p><p></p><p>These two batches of just over a hundred bugs had formed an orderly bug society, similar to an ant colony.</p><p></p><p>As for the issue of eating soil...</p><p></p><p>Ever since Su Hao shattered the bug eggs to activate the hatching program, he had not fed the mother bug any organic matter. All the nutrients supporting the mother bug's growth came solely from the soil and rocks that Su Hao had casually transferred in.</p><p></p><p>It was these seemingly lifeless soil and rocks that allowed the mother bug to grow to its current size and lay thousands of vigorous bug eggs.</p><p></p><p>Just like plants, it could obtain sufficient nutrients directly from the soil and rocks.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>After a period of observation and research, Su Hao figured out how the Star-Eating Bugs ate: First, they secrete a special sticky liquid to corrode the surrounding substances, decomposing them into a special colloidal form. Then they swallow it and excrete a black substance from the back end - this black substance is also an important material for building nests.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Su Hao completely understood why these bugs were called "Star-Eating Bugs".</p><p></p><p>Because whether it was soil, rocks, or other substances, the Star-Eating Bugs could use the secreted sticky liquid to decompose these materials into aggregates of various elements or compounds, then selectively absorb the substances they needed for rapid growth.</p><p></p><p>The normal food chain can be simply viewed as "energy, soil" - "plants convert organic matter" - "animals eat".</p><p></p><p>But for the Star-Eating Bugs, as animals, they possess the ability to directly absorb various elements from the soil.</p><p></p><p>This means their dependence on the ecological environment is essentially zero.</p><p></p><p>As long as there are the corresponding material elements, they can grow rapidly until they devour an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>The name "Star-Eating Bug" is well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao had another idea: "This ability has great development value. Perhaps I can load this ability onto the 'God' program, so that as long as there is soil, it can eat."</p><p></p><p>Although he could convert matter into 'source' and then into edible nutrients, it involved an extra step.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ayashan and Fengcheng could not convert matter into 'source' and then nutrients as easily as he could. Having an extra skill to ensure survival in harsh environments would be good.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao decided to leave this project for Ayashan and Fengcheng to work on, as they might develop unexpected effects.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while and seeing no abnormalities, he thought: "Then starting today, I'll try to analyze the method for the mother bug to control the other bugs. First, I'll record the consciousness information of the mother bug and the bugs together in the Ballgame Space and observe the changes in consciousness information."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, he extended a finger and a surge of blood energy crossed space directly onto the mother bug's body, invading it from within.</p><p></p><p>The plump mother bug's body stiffened and began writhing violently. The surrounding guard ant-bugs immediately swarmed onto the mother bug, wrapping her tightly.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, she was moved to another location by a large group of guard ant-bugs until Su Hao finished recording.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was very surprised: "Such a violent reaction?"</p><p></p><p>Then he noticed that the mother bug's egg-laying speed had increased.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao later recorded the consciousness information of the other bugs, the mother bug did not seem to sense it obviously and showed no abnormal behavior.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao had recorded the consciousness information of all the hatched bugs.</p><p></p><p>He transferred his consciousness into the Ballgame Space and pulled up the consciousness information of the mother bug and the bugs.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see how the mother bug transmits signals to simultaneously control so many bugs."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 759</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Xu Qingjun and the others completed the delivery to Su Hao, they immediately crowded around him.</p><p></p><p>The captain carefully asked, "Daqiang, were all these small cubes delivered to the Baxu colony planets?"</p><p></p><p>He asked this because he himself had great doubts, but just now Su Hao did say that these small cubes were to be delivered to the Baxu colony planets.</p><p></p><p>This left him feeling very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Previously it was clearly stated to just listen to whatever Xu Shiqiang said, but he couldn't understand why at the last moment, he couldn't control himself and started doubting what he saw and heard...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Yes, I used my hundred percent accuracy ability to deliver the insecticidal small cubes to the Baxu colony planets. I delivered one to each planet. There were quite a few leftovers, so I delivered those to the larger Baxu supply stations.</p><p></p><p>I imagine in a few more days, the Baxu on these colony planets will all be dead. You can just wait and see."</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>It seemed like they didn't hear clearly.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe they heard wrong?</p><p></p><p>But asking again would make them look stupid.</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun and the others looked at each other, and finally everyone turned to the captain, indicating he should speak.</p><p></p><p>The captain: "......"</p><p></p><p>He felt the pressure was also very high on him!</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the captain couldn't help but give himself a thumbs up: How clever of me.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew what these people were thinking, but he didn't care. He just laughed, "For now, you don't need to do anything. Just continue preparing the materials for the teleportation array and training the crew. Wait for my next instructions. That's it, see you later."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he flashed and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also transmitted away, leaving a group of dumbfounded human officials.</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun glanced at the now empty square and took the lead in leaving, "Let's go! We'll just follow what Xu Shiqiang said and wait a few days."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the 'Celestial Observation World' observers from the human side successively submitted detailed reports about the Baxu colony planets.</p><p></p><p>And very soon, these reports reached the hands of the human leader Xu Qingjun.</p><p></p><p>The more he read, the more shocked, excited and fearful he became!</p><p></p><p>After finishing reading all the materials in his hands, his hands trembled violently like an old sick person, almost unable to grip the thick files steadily.</p><p></p><p>No, it wasn't just his hands shaking, his whole body was shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>A strange feeling of fear mixed with excitement arose from his heart, repeatedly impacting his brain.</p><p></p><p>The goosebumps all over his body involuntarily stood up, then inexplicably subsided, and in just two breaths, his clothes were completely soaked in sweat, damp and sticky.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stand up, but found his legs felt unsteady and wobbly, so he fell back down.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting for a moment, he opened his mouth and yelled hoarsely, "Get all the ministers over here within an hour, not a minute later!"</p><p></p><p>His voice cracked, the first time it had cracked.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Qingjun's assistant heard this, he was immediately frightened, thinking some huge crisis had occurred, and hurriedly went to make the notifications.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even take an hour, just half an hour before everyone had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun slammed the table hard, his face ferocious, "You have ten minutes to read through the materials in front of you."</p><p></p><p>The ministers were also scared by Xu Qingjun's appearance, having never seen him make such an expression before.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts sank: Could it be that the Baxu had launched a surprise attack on the human homeworld...?</p><p></p><p>They forced themselves to remain calm and picked up the materials in front of them to read carefully.</p><p></p><p>The more they read, the more astounded their expressions became.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? The vast majority of Baxu on each colony planet had died?</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but turn their eyes to Xu Qingjun, and inexplicably thought back to the tall figure they saw in the square a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>They guessed in their hearts, "Could it be...Xu Shiqiang really did wipe out all the Baxu colony planets in one fell swoop?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Qingjun's suppressed voice came, "A few days ago, Xu Shiqiang delivered the insecticidal small cubes to all the Baxu colony planets in the Yuanhuan system, killing the vast majority of the Baxu.</p><p></p><p>Currently on the major colony planets, only a small number of Baxu have survived, apart from the fleets on the outskirts of the human domain."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss——"</p><p></p><p>Receiving this confirmation from Xu Qingjun himself, everyone gasped in cold air.</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed. One by one, they couldn't help cursing inwardly to vent their emotions.</p><p></p><p>The only reason they didn't shout out loud was out of fear of the ferocious look on Xu Qingjun's face.</p><p></p><p>Of those present, only the captain had a relatively high acceptance level. He quickly calmed down and, noticing Xu Qingjun's abnormal appearance, asked, "Leader, are you not feeling well? Why the expression? Shall we call a doctor to examine you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun waved his big hand and said in a deep voice, "No need! This is excitement! Excitement, can't you tell?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone shook their heads in unison, "Can't tell..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun immediately cursed loudly, "Get lost, if I say it's excitement, then it's excitement!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Qingjun's confidence was full!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it happened during his tenure as leader.</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun would get a resounding title and go down in history.</p><p></p><p>And now, he was full of confidence and fearless.</p><p></p><p>Things like the human elite interest groups or political balances became completely irrelevant in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason he dared to say something like "get out in less than an hour."</p><p></p><p>However, although Xu Qingjun was arrogant now, he still knew the reason for his arrogance - Xu Shiqiang!</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun immediately said, "Gong Liang, immediately pass this news to Daqiang, go now."</p><p></p><p>The massive captain immediately ran off, disappearing from the conference room in an instant.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When the captain entered the small world, the person he met was still Feng Cheng. After telling Feng Cheng the news, he saw a look of surprise on his face.</p><p></p><p>The captain thought to himself, "It seems what Mr. Feng Cheng said was true, even he didn't know Daqiang could do this...it's really unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading the report, Feng Cheng summarized it briefly and sent it to the group, saying, "Old Master Wei, you're simply too powerful! To be able to accurately deliver the small cubes to the Baxu colony planets from such a remote distance is inconceivable!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was quite knowledgeable, but even he couldn't comprehend how Su Hao pulled this off.</p><p></p><p>Even seeing the results with his own eyes, he still couldn't imagine how Su Hao managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>Yashan sent a question mark emoji made using Feng Cheng's avatar, "What? The Baxu colony planets were wiped out in one go? Is this news for real, Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "It was done by Old Master Wei himself, how could it be fake?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan sent a 'shocked Feng Cheng' emoji, "Damn, as expected of Old Master Wei! I wouldn't even dare imagine it..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first sent a 'side-eyeing Feng Cheng' emoji, then said, "It's very simple, I'll modify your 'Baxu God' program a bit later, and load a small software onto your omnipotent assistant, then you'll be able to do it too."</p><p></p><p>Very simple?</p><p></p><p>The two felt that while it might be very simple for Old Master Wei, it definitely wasn't simple for them.</p><p></p><p>All three were working hard to research, but somehow, Old Master Wei had once again reached an incomprehensible level.</p><p></p><p>But not understanding wasn't a problem, the important thing was that Old Master Wei said they could also master this ability!</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "If that's the case, doesn't that mean we can come and go freely throughout the entire Yuanhuan system? That's simply too awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was also excitedly beside himself, "Awesome! With such an ability, I feel like a deity from mythology."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Haha! Indeed, but I still feel like something is missing."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Who calls themselves a deity? Abilities that seem powerful to others, once you master them yourself, you realize they're nothing special. We're still far from being deities!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The captain ran back panting and reported to Xu Qingjun, "Leader, I've passed the news to Daqiang."</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun immediately asked, "What did Daqiang say? Did he ask what we should do next?"</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Not yet, he just told us to wait for their message. It probably won't be long before we get the next action."</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingjun grinned ferociously, "Don't let that one billion warships get away! No matter how great the loss, we must pin them down tightly, and then find an opportunity to wipe them out."</p>

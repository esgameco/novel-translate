        <h1>Chapter 768</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Six years later, Su Hao stopped the 'Starlight Tour'.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the degree of space-time bending around him, he said to Yashan and Feng Cheng, "Fly a little further."</p><p></p><p>Another year later, Su Hao's trio stopped.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt the spatial state around them and estimated that it should be fine, so he said, "It should be fine here. Next, use the crystal armor to build a 'gravitational formation' and bend space-time with all your might, and you'll be able to find the galaxies neighboring the Disc Serpent System in the 'planetary network'."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the crystal armor on his body surged and adjusted, switching from a 'Starlight Tour' formation to a 'Gravitational Formation'.</p><p></p><p>"Ka ka ka ka!"</p><p></p><p>In a short while, it turned into a different look.</p><p></p><p>The golden light then blazed out, drowning the entire person and forming a brilliant golden ball of light.</p><p></p><p>The golden light disappeared without a trace again in a split second, and all that was left was the dense dark golden lines on Su Hao's crystal armor, which rushed and flowed like blood.</p><p></p><p>It looked exceptionally noble and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Buzz~"</p><p></p><p>A wave of fluctuations violently erupted from Su Hao's body, radiating far in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Nearby Yashan and Feng Cheng felt it most obviously, only feeling a powerful attraction erupt from Su Hao's body, like a whirlpool sucking in water, wanting to draw the two of them toward Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng tried their best to resist this attraction and quickly reacted to move away from Su Hao, their eyes showing surprise: "What a strong power ......"</p><p></p><p>In their perception, this intensity of power had already exceeded the upper limit of what their [Eight-Handed God] could achieve, and it was impossible to reach this level with normal Spiritual Power of the Transformation God Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Boss Wei did manage to do it with an ordinary [Eight-Handed God].</p><p></p><p>Yashan muttered, "It's as if, this formation has repeatedly concentrated and purified the spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>He and Feng Cheng downloaded the formation from the Universal Assistant, and then also used the Crystal Armor to gradually build this formation, and the more they built it, the more astonished they became, "Thirty-six layers of compression structure, skillfully utilizing the gravitational effect, without destroying the structure of the spiritual energy, repeatedly compressing the spiritual energy in order to achieve that instantaneous outburst of a large amount of energy... ...</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being Boss Wei, such a thought process and structural design, I couldn't have possibly come up with it, no matter what."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was even more direct: "Crap, Boss Wei is awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Yashan and Feng Cheng, also activated their gravitational formations, and then entered the 'planetary network', and their vision shifted to the edge of the Coil Snake System.</p><p></p><p>At this time, when they looked outwards again, what they saw was no longer an endless empty void, but densely packed and differently sized orbs.</p><p></p><p>Yayama and Feng Cheng's spirits shook, "Could this be the ...... Coiled Tail System!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two of them had a realization in their hearts: as long as they crossed this empty 'river' in the middle, then the vision would be able to go to the Curly Tail System and successfully activate the 'Network Teleportation'.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they thought of it, the two of them rushed forward with a thought, and when they came to the middle of the 'river', they felt a certain amount of resistance, but it didn't make them stop.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, they broke through some sort of barrier and arrived on top of the outermost planet of the Curly Tail system.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Curly Tail System, Yayama subconsciously activated 'network teleportation' and overcame all sorts of difficulties, teleporting his [Eight-Handed God] body, above one of the planets in the Curly Tail System.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at the barren rocky planetary environment around him, and as his divine thoughts swept out, he muttered, "The teleportation location is right here, which means that I'm now in another galaxy? Simply unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>He casually sent a message to the group, "I have, like, teleported into the Curly Tail galaxy ......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time a flash appeared in space, recording the huge body of galaxies he saw in front of him and sending it to the group.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Boss Yashan you went over there this time???"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also sent up a picture, labeling his position, "I've also reached the Curly Tail galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was puzzled, "By the way, where did you get to, Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Cough...... should still be in the Coiled Snake Department, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Huh, did your teleportation fail?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "That's not true, I was more excited and thrilled after my vision entered the Curly Tail System just now, I didn't find a planet to teleport to first time, so I waited for a short while, and then I couldn't withstand the pressure of the open area, and somehow I was popped out of the Curly Tail System, and went back to the Coil Snake System ...... "</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised and asked, "Is there still pressure on that 'net river' in the middle? I didn't feel it!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "There is some pressure, but it's still within tolerance."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng sent out an expression packet that was lifeless, "......"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that it wasn't the 'Net River' that was under pressure, but that he himself was too weak.</p><p></p><p>After tossing and turning for a while longer, Feng Cheng finally managed to teleport to the Curly Tail Department and was so excited that he immediately sent his location in the group, "Boss Wei, Boss Yashan, I've also successfully teleported to the Curly Tail Department! Boss Wei, I'll teleport to you now."</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "I'll go over there as well."</p><p></p><p>In less than two minutes, Yashan and Feng Cheng had teleported and appeared beside Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>The two of them couldn't help but marvel in awe.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Then, we'll use this planet under our feet as the base location of the Curly Tail System, and from here, we'll gradually explore the Curly Tail System in search of living planets."</p><p></p><p>"Okay Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Curly Tail System was only about seventy thousand light years in diameter, making it seem very 'small' compared to other galaxies.</p><p></p><p>But it would be a mistake to really think it is small ......</p><p></p><p>After a few years of exploration, Su Hao's trio gathered again.</p><p></p><p>The result was: no life.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Coiled Serpent System, the silence was mind-numbing.</p><p></p><p>Such a result was expected of them, but it was still hard to hide the loss in their hearts when they really realized there wasn't the slightest bit of life.</p><p></p><p>They had explored two huge galaxies in a row, and surprisingly, neither of them had found a life planet.</p><p></p><p>So it seemed that the loneliness of the universe was still above what the crowd had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Continue exploring! This time, let's control multiple [Eight-Handed God] bilocations at the same time to explore separately, each setting off in a different direction, lighting up the surrounding galaxies one by one.</p><p></p><p>It's not easy to find living planets, let alone being able to find civilizations! However, we don't lack time, and as we increase the scope of our exploration, the probability of finding life will also become higher.</p><p></p><p>As long as we can find other civilizations within three thousand years, that will be a victory."</p><p></p><p>The three of them then simply assigned the galaxies they were responsible for and maneuvered their detachments to set off.</p><p></p><p>With the increase in the number of 'intergalactic network transmissions', the three teleported and became more and more skillful, and even Feng Cheng, who had the weakest mental power, was able to complete the teleportation with zero mistakes.</p><p></p><p>The time it took for one of them to explore a galaxy ranged from five to ten years, and after exploring it, flying near the black hole at the center of the galaxy would also take five to ten years.</p><p></p><p>However, these two steps could be done at the same time.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, while exploring a galaxy, one could send an [Eight-Handed God] doppelganger to the center of the galaxy to look for a teleportation point, so it would only take them five to ten years to explore a galaxy.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that such a speed of exploration was exceptionally rapid.</p><p></p><p>To put it another way, if Su Hao hadn't mastered the 'planetary teleportation' technology, then the time needed to finish exploring a galaxy ......</p><p></p><p>Even if one possessed the 'Starlight Tour' superluminal voyage, it would be countless, and one would not be able to explore much of a range for fear of consuming all five thousand years of life.</p><p></p><p>The 'Planet Network' was simply an exploration god technique for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Time passed year by year.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years later, the three of them didn't know how many large, small, and various galaxies they had explored ......</p><p></p><p>Time and time again, they were filled with hope, and time and time again, they reaped disappointment.</p><p></p><p>It was as if, in the entire universe, only the Cloud Ring System possessed life and civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao firmly believed that this was not the case, and that in countless places in the universe, there would be countless planets of life, and countless splendid civilizations would have developed.</p><p></p><p>Until this day, Feng Cheng sent a message, "Boss Wei, I found a life planet in the Bull Head System!"</p><p></p><p>It was then accompanied by a large number of pictures of the inside and outside of the planet.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao and Yashan first stabilized the message, their spirits were violently uplifted, and the feeling of surprise surged out of their hearts, quickly filling their bodies with great excitement.</p><p></p><p>They opened the photos one after another, and a wave of greenness came over them.</p><p></p><p>It was plants!</p><p></p><p>It was great to finally find a living planet!</p><p></p><p>The universe seemed silent, but in some location they didn't know about, it was bound to be very lively.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Hao could ask about the planet's location, Feng Cheng said, "But it seems like this planet is very primitive and no intelligent life exists."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's words were like a pot of cold water raining down from Su Hao and Yashan's heads.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it allowed them to slightly calm down the excitement in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, then exhaled long and asked, "Where is it?"</p>

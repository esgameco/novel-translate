        <h1>Chapter 777</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The flesh of the Sacred Lord of the Winged Serpents was indeed extremely powerful, far surpassing other winged serpents.</p><p></p><p>According to what Su Hao had heard, the Sacred Lord of the Winged Serpents possessed noble royal bloodlines, destined from birth to stand at the pinnacle of the world and rule over it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He acknowledged the claim about bloodlines, but he did not agree with the other dragons' view that these bloodlines were noble.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the essence was that the Sacred Lord's evolution was more advanced towards adapting to the purple fungi, making him more suitable for symbiosis with them.</p><p></p><p>Having such an extremely highly evolved body for Su Hao to experiment on was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually took a bucket of water saturated with purple fungi and poured it into the Sacred Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>Then he entered the bouncing realm space and pulled up the Sacred Lord's body information to observe the subsequent changes of the newly entered purple fungi.</p><p></p><p>All winged serpents invaded by the purple fungi had a network covering their entire body composed of hexagons - this network was the mark left behind after the purple fungi symbiotically combined with the winged serpents.</p><p></p><p>The winged serpents called this the magic grid, the key to their powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, after the bucket of water entered the Sacred Lord's body, the purple fungi in the water did not directly enter the magic grid, but instead combined with the Sacred Lord's blood cells.</p><p></p><p>After a period of change, they formed a completely new type of cell.</p><p></p><p>The metabolites of these cells would slowly corrode the Sacred Lord's flesh, and the traces of this corrosion were precisely the magic grids that the winged serpents viewed as treasures.</p><p></p><p>And the metabolites of these cells became the 'magic power' used by the winged serpents!</p><p></p><p>It was like taking a qi-replenishing pill.</p><p></p><p>This magic power was essentially similar to Su Hao's spiritual power, but the structures were vastly different - it could be considered another form of biological energy.</p><p></p><p>From the outward appearance, spiritual power tended towards the 'light' attribute, while magic power tended towards the 'dark' attribute.</p><p></p><p>If spiritual power is the energy cultivated by righteous cultivators, then magic power is the energy cultivated by demonic cultivators...</p><p></p><p>"I see now!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need the purple fungi to naturally generate this magic power through genetic means, though using the source would be the fastest way.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know the power level of this magic power, whether it can be used to activate runes."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao immediately extracted a sufficient amount of magic power from the Sacred Lord's body, then inscribed a 'bright light' rune and channeled the magic power into it.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a brilliant pale purple light burst forth, bathing the laboratory in pale purple.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was utterly baffled: "It works, magic power can also serve as the energy to activate formations. But why is the light purple? Could it be related to the magic power's attribute? It does seem quite suited to demonic cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, for ordinary people, cultivating spiritual power takes an exceptionally long time, and one also needs to cultivate spiritual sense to flexibly wield spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But cultivating magic power is not so troublesome - just drink a mouthful of purple fungi, let the metabolic products of the fungi and blood corrode a magic grid inside the body...</p><p></p><p>What is a shortcut to power? This is the shortcut.</p><p></p><p>No need to sit until one's butt goes numb, and immense power can be obtained.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before Su Hao obtained sufficient information from the Sacred Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not draw any conclusions yet.</p><p></p><p>"Let's bring in some other winged serpents to experiment on and collect more data to observe different variables."</p><p></p><p>Then Yuantan the Fallen God, the nominal leader of the Three Races Allied Army, was brought into Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely apprehensive, awaiting the arrival of his unknown fate.</p><p></p><p>Yet contrary to his expectations, entering Jia Wei's laboratory was not such a dangerous affair.</p><p></p><p>Just go in, sit obediently, and cooperate with whatever Jia Wei did to him.</p><p></p><p>As relaxed as visiting a friend's home.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Su Hao's laboratory, his expression was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>The three great marshals anxiously surrounded him asking, "Holy Son Yuantan, are you alright?!"</p><p></p><p>Yuantan let out a long breath and said, "I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Marshal Hongkun and said, "Jia Wei wants you to go in next."</p><p></p><p>Marshal Hongkun's expression changed drastically: "The human Jia Wei wants me to go in? This... Holy Son Yuantan, could you tell me, what exactly will happen once inside? I can't help feeling uneasy."</p><p></p><p>Yuantan looked at the three apprehensive marshals and revealed a strange smile: "Don't be nervous, you'll know once you go in. Oh, you should all get a turn. Alright, go on in!"</p><p></p><p>The three marshals looked even more anxious. The entrance to Su Hao's laboratory was like the gaping bloody maw of a beast devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>Marshal Hongkun dug in his claws, adjusting his breathing, then with the air of a martyr walked into Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon and Rock Dragon Marshals swallowed hard upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few months later, Su Hao had basically thoroughly researched magic power.</p><p></p><p>He reached the point of being able to casually convert the source into magic power.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called sacred Mother Goddess Pool revered by the dragon races, to Su Hao its value was not solely magic power.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also valued the miracle of life formed by the combination of the purple fungi and dragon races.</p><p></p><p>If he could thoroughly study this ingenious combination method, wouldn't he be able to flexibly combine different races of creatures in the future to form new, more powerful species?</p><p></p><p>He could even flexibly attach two dog heads onto one dog body, add some "magic grids", and turn it into the mythical super creature - the three-headed hound of Hades.</p><p></p><p>"As for the research on combining different creatures, let's set that aside for now. Currently, the most crucial thing is to observe how the so-called magic grid is formed."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that since magic power could form a magic grid within the body, could spiritual power also form a spiritual power grid?</p><p></p><p>He could even directly replace flesh organs with spiritual power organs.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao had never done that. He had only simply constructed another organ system to maintain the celestial being state, without completely replacing the flesh organs.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that his Anomaly abilities of [Fate Child] and [Divine] still required flesh to activate.</p><p></p><p>This seemed quite contradictory and conflicting.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, if he replaced all the organs and flesh of his body with spiritual power, he would indeed gain a longer-lived 'spiritual body', but he would lose the powers of his Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>And the ability to solidify crystal armor 'formations' was something he needed - if he lost his Anomaly powers, although he could still use formations, it would be extremely inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Now, from the winged serpents' 'magic grid', Su Hao saw the possibility of integrating flesh and spiritual power in symbiosis.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps constructing a 'spiritual power grid' within his body could grant him a longer lifespan, while allowing flesh and spiritual power to fuse together.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned his attention to those dragon races without magic power, bringing them one by one into his laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Then he poured water saturated with purple fungi into their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Soon, agonizing screams began emanating from Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>"Aarrrgghhâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The harrowing cries of pain spread throughout the small world.</p><p></p><p>Causing the dragon races' expressions to change drastically - what horrifically draconic tragedy was occurring inside?</p><p></p><p>The killing-pig-like shrieks were how appallingly shrill, how heart-shaking.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said earlier that entering the laboratory was like being a guest?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed the tyrant dragon that had been infused with purple fungi for two days - it had been shrieking miserably for two days, the screams growing weaker.</p><p></p><p>Finally, unable to withstand the purple fungi's corrosion, it died.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was astonished: "Why did it just die?"</p><p></p><p>In his view, with the tyrant dragon's powerful body, the possibility of enduring the purple fungi's corrosion and successfully forming a magic grid within was very high.</p><p></p><p>Since the tyrant dragon didn't work out, he would try a spirit dragon next.</p><p></p><p>Then a petite spirit dragon was dragged into Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>This time, the shrieks didn't even last two full days before the spirit dragon died.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's brow furrowed tightly, and he forcibly dragged in the largest, most solid rock dragon.</p><p></p><p>The rock dragon wailed miserably for a full three days, and just as Su Hao thought he had succeeded, it died too.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered, thinking to call Yuantan in to ask him about it.</p><p></p><p>Yuantan immediately felt his legs go a bit weak, his expression still looked composed, but the terror in his eyes was impossible to conceal no matter what.</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into Su Hao's laboratory, his stride was a bit unsteady.</p><p></p><p>The three great marshals watched Yuantan's back gradually disappear into the darkness, exchanging glances with each other.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Dragon said: "What do you all think, can Holy Son Yuantan still walk back out?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Dragon shook his head: "I don't think so. You guys guess how many days he can last?"</p><p></p><p>The Rock Dragon: "He should be able to last ten days, after all Holy Son Yuantan is extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant and Spirit Dragons gasped: "Ten days..."</p><p></p><p>Shrieking miserably for ten days...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it was terrifying.</p>

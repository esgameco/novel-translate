        <h1>Chapter 943</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Yashan and Fengcheng completed testing the world passage, they immediately simplified the construction method of the world passage, dividing it into simple modules so that others could complete this work through division of labor.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two of them had the same tacit understanding - to take on disciples.</p><p></p><p>Four years later, the first batch of students they mentored were about to graduate.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's course "Exploring the Power of the Human Spiritual World" was just an elective course with few credits. The key was that whether students wanted to complete it depended entirely on their own interests and hobbies.</p><p></p><p>At first, Yashan thought students must have had some interest initially, but as time passed and their curiosity waned, some students would leave, and those who remained would be his targets for future development.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after four years, the number of students attending his class not only did not decrease, but increased more and more. In the end, there were more than three hundred people attending and participating in the course each time.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was also very satisfied with these students who had studied with him for several years.</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown how many of these few hundred people would be willing to continue to study in this direction.</p><p></p><p>On this day of class, Yashan stood on the podium, looking at the familiar faces densely seated below, and couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>He did not open his laptop to display today's course as usual, but instead walked down from the podium and came in front of the students, slowly saying: "Classmates, you are about to graduate. I'm very happy to see you again in this class. This shows that you have a great interest in 'spiritual power', though of course there may also be some unrealistic fantasies, which is normal.</p><p></p><p>I even found that some students hope to gain the legendary superpowers from this course, such as 'psychokinesis', 'mind over matter', 'mind reading', and so on..."</p><p></p><p>When Yashan said this, the students below laughed softly.</p><p></p><p>Yashan continued: "Because I saw with my own eyes that some students, after class, thought they had learned something incredible from me, so they rushed to the toilet to sit on the toilet and start meditating."</p><p></p><p>The students laughed happily again. They knew what Professor Yashan was talking about: it wasn't meditation, but that they were so focused on the class that even if they needed to pee, they didn't want to ask for leave and miss the interesting lecture. After class, they couldn't hold it anymore and flocked to the toilet.</p><p></p><p>But they liked Professor Yashan's lecturing style, witty and humorous, yet the content was full of appeal.</p><p></p><p>He was the most charming teacher they had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Yashan changed the topic: "However, in four years, I have basically finished teaching the course content. For students who have paid close attention to the study of spiritual power, they must have gained profound insights. I won't talk about those basics today. Today I will say something different, which may overturn your perception of this world."</p><p></p><p>The students below widened their eyes and looked at Professor Yashan, waiting for his subsequent explanation. Their eyes were full of curiosity, believing that Professor Yashan could really bring them something different, because over the years, Professor Yashan had never let them down.</p><p></p><p>In this classroom, whether male or female students, they all admired Professor Yashan immensely, believing him to be the most knowledgeable person in this world.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "So what will this class be about? One question: Have you ever wondered if our spiritual power can indeed accomplish everything you imagine? The superpowers you yearn for, all the incredible things you've encountered in movies, novels, storybooks, etc. - is it possible that they can be realized?"</p><p></p><p>"Woah -"</p><p></p><p>The students' interest soared even higher. Although they thought Professor Yashan was just setting them up, and would then seriously deny such existence, it didn't affect them discussing this possibility with their classmates beside them.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Yashan raised his hand to quiet them down, and the students gradually fell silent, focusing their attention on Professor Yashan.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I can tell you that human spiritual power arises from the natural laws of the universe, which means it completely conforms to the laws of the universe. We can use the laws of the universe to interpret it, and conversely, we can use spiritual power to interpret the laws of the universe. Through this interaction, we can produce all kinds of incredible effects, including 'psychokinesis', 'hypnosis', 'mind reading', 'clairvoyance', and so on.</p><p></p><p>In other words, everything you can imagine can be achieved through spiritual power, as long as you find the corresponding method."</p><p></p><p>The students murmured again, with more looks of astonishment, as well as many doubts and even suspicion. They wondered if the professor was going to promote some cult or heresy.</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "What, you don't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>A student immediately raised his hand to answer: "Professor, I agree with what you said, it makes a lot of sense. But this matter cannot be proven feasible, of course, there is also no way to prove it's not possible. After all, not being able to do it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, perhaps we just haven't found the corresponding method.</p><p></p><p>But what I want to say is, this falls into the category of 'it exists if you believe, it doesn't if you don't believe'. We can't prove it, so it's not about believing or not believing."</p><p></p><p>Yashan waved to indicate he should sit down, then smiled mysteriously: "What if I could prove its existence?"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yashan flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Creak creak creak ~ bang bang bang ~"</p><p></p><p>The entire podium and the computer on it were instantly dismantled into scattered pieces, floating in mid-air. With a wave of his hand, all the pieces scattered and flew towards the students, with each student displaying a piece in front of them.</p><p></p><p>More than three hundred students in the classroom were all stunned, their mouths agape, their eyes full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed loudly: "In fact, I am the omnipotent superhero you fantasize about."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, with a wave of his hand, the pieces immediately flew back and reassembled in an orderly manner, restoring to their original appearance.</p><p></p><p>As if the scene that had just happened was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Of course, this is just the most basic application of spiritual power. There are more advanced ones, such as 'nowhere to hide'."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, a whip appeared in his hand out of thin air, and several white rats the size of cats emerged from underground. He lightly whipped them a few times.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack!"</p><p></p><p>The white rats that were whipped shuddered, and a few bloody objects crawled out of their mouths, with hands and feet running around, shouting, "So scared! I want to escape ~ Not scared, not scared! Can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly changed, and soon the classroom became chaotic, with male and female students screaming in terror.</p><p></p><p>Yashan, meanwhile, observed with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Fengcheng also smiled at the students he had mentored for several years, and said slowly, "You don't believe in my 'evolution of life and genetic engineering' technology? I can prove their existence. Students, don't blink."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Fengcheng's left and right arms suddenly swelled up, rapidly transforming into huge crab pincers that snipped the podium into pieces. Then they changed into a lion's head, roaring as it bit the pieces into its mouth, crunching them like candy, and spitting them out as a shiny ball.</p><p></p><p>The lion's head quickly transformed into eight tentacles, juggling those balls like a circus act. In no time, the tentacle tips turned into dragon heads, holding all the balls in their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled, "How about that? My genetic engineering technology is pretty good, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The students were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed, "This is just a basic transformation. Let me show you a more advanced one!"</p><p></p><p>"Creak creak creak ~"</p><p></p><p>A large amount of pink crystal formed, enveloping Fengcheng's body, and his size grew larger, transforming into the appearance of a [deity], like a dragon and a panther combined.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head towards the students below, who had collectively been 'mentally attacked' and petrified, revealing what he thought was a gentle but actually ferocious smile. He hummed, "How about it? Students, what do you think of my evolution of life and genetic engineering technology? Unexpected, isn't it? Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>When the students tried to escape, they found that the classroom door could not be opened. For a time, screams rose and fell.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 859</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After obtaining eighteen new White Dwarfs, Su Hao immediately recorded the consciousness of the White Dwarfs into the Pinball Space, attempting to parse their consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the consciousness information structure of the White Dwarfs was different from that of humans and deities, so the 'reference table' Su Hao used to parse human consciousness information was not applicable to the White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>However, he had realized this early on. After initially recording the consciousness information of the deities into the Pinball Space, he had already assigned Little Light the task of parsing the original 'information storage method' of the Ten-Colored Plates. This task was more than 50% completed two years ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was basically sufficient to parse the consciousness information of these native White Dwarfs. Any missing parts could be specifically inquired about after awakening the White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>In less than two days, the consciousness information of the White Dwarfs was basically parsed.</p><p></p><p>But he found that most of the parsed information was just about the red giant star environment. Even the communication between the White Dwarfs was extremely minimal, only relying on the 'mutual sensing' ability with their split bodies for some exceptionally simple communication.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the issue of thought dilation, their intelligence was high, but their consciousness level was only equivalent to that of a confused toddler of two or three years old.</p><p></p><p>As for thought dilation, it was probably equivalent to a normal person's thoughts being dilated by a thousand times. A thought that could be completed in one second would now take a thousand seconds, or about sixteen minutes.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine when a person greets another with "hello", it would take sixteen minutes. That gives you an idea of what the world of the White Dwarfs was like.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the consciousness information of the White Dwarfs, Su Hao fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"In the consciousness information of the White Dwarfs, there seems to be no information about naturally born new White Dwarfs. Could it be that the current White Dwarfs, like humans, all come from individual fission rather than being naturally born from the red giant star?</p><p></p><p>In other words, the current red giant star environment is no longer sufficient to give birth to White Dwarfs. If this is true, then my attempt to simulate the generation of soul force by imitating the current red giant star environment will not succeed.</p><p></p><p>Based on the lifespan of the White Dwarfs, I need to backtrack the time and trace the current red giant star environment back at least one million years..."</p><p></p><p>Since the White Dwarfs exist, it means that something must have happened on this planet in the distant past that allowed the White Dwarfs to be born.</p><p></p><p>Finding the key event that led to the birth of the White Dwarfs means finding the method to generate the core of soul force!</p><p></p><p>Backtracking like this is actually quite simple. He doesn't need to rack his brains wondering what happened to the red giant star in the past.</p><p></p><p>He just needs to find enough red giant stars in the 'Galactic Network', analyze the current stage each red giant star is in, and arrange them in chronological order. This would reveal the entire process of a star gradually shedding its outer layers and finally collapsing into a white dwarf.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao sent out a minor self to control another [Divine] avatar and immediately headed towards an area with sufficient gravitational force near the black hole of this galaxy to access the 'Galactic Network'.</p><p></p><p>However, this would probably take seven or eight years, so there was no rush.</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack time now, so I'll awaken the consciousness of these White Dwarfs first."</p><p></p><p>By 'awaken', he actually meant accelerating the thought processes of the White Dwarfs to a level where he could communicate with them normally. This process only required infusing the White Dwarfs with rich and orderly useful information.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need too much of this information, as he could easily retrieve a large amount from the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao randomly picked a White Dwarf and placed it in another small world separately.</p><p></p><p>Through the Little Black Room, he gradually released information to the White Dwarf. The amount of information was small at first and gradually increased. At the same time, based on the thought speed of the White Dwarf, he created a virtual world for it, initially guiding its obedient consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it would succeed or not, Su Hao couldn't say for sure, as he currently had no experience in this area. This first White Dwarf was the first-generation experimental subject.</p><p></p><p>Once he had mature technology, he could apply it to the other White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao recalculated the thought speed of the White Dwarf and found that its thought speed had now reached half the speed of a normal person. Not only that, under Su Hao's vast knowledge infusion, its understanding of the world was no longer as confused as before, and it had initially mastered a set of Ten-Star language.</p><p></p><p>"To further increase its thought speed and understanding of the world, the difficulty gradually increases, and mere infusion is no longer sufficient. However, this state should be enough for communication."</p><p></p><p>With this judgment, Su Hao released the consciousness of the White Dwarf from the virtual world of the Little Black Room, returning it to the body of the Ten-Colored Plate.</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf sensed the sudden change in its surroundings and seemed confused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao appeared beside the White Dwarf in a timely manner and said softly, "Hello, nice to meet you. You can call me Jia Wei."</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf was stunned for a long time, seeming to have great difficulty accepting the information conveyed by Su Hao. It then replied in a slow tone, "Hello, nice to meet you too. I'm called Ke White Dwarf. This place is very... magical..."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the White Dwarf fell into silence again, as if extremely surprised by its surroundings and seeming to have great doubts about everything it had suddenly encountered.</p><p></p><p>It wanted to think, to ask Su Hao questions and clarify the current situation. But clearly, Su Hao did not intend to give it the opportunity to ask questions. Instead, he asked his own question first: "Ke White Dwarf, where does your name come from?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf was confused for a moment. "Yeah, where does my name come from?"</p><p></p><p>It thought for a long time, then said uncertainly, "My father called me that. All White Dwarfs call me that."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked again, "Why is it called White Dwarf?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf: "???"</p><p></p><p>It indicated that the question Su Hao asked was beyond its ability to answer.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it could not answer, Su Hao manifested the scene of the 'birthplace' through the Little Black Room and asked, "Ke White Dwarf, do you still remember this place?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf looked at the scene that had suddenly appeared and said, "I remember. This is the 'Gal Pool', the legendary birthplace of all White Dwarfs. According to the memories passed down from my ancestors, he walked out of the Gal Pool."</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness of the White Dwarf, 'Gal' had the same meaning as 'life', and 'White Dwarf' meant 'the life born from the pure white land'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes lit up. "Do you still have memories passed down from your ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf said, "After each White Dwarf is born from fission of the parent body, it inherits many memories from the parent body. But the memories I inherited have become very blurred, with only a few remaining."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Which generation of White Dwarf are you? In other words, counting from your father, how many ancestors' memories have you inherited?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf: "???"</p><p></p><p>It struggled to retrieve the numerical information that had been infused recently, and then gave a number: "103."</p><p></p><p>"Then from your memories, counting from the first ancestor, after how many generations did the White Dwarfs stop coming out of the 'Gal Pool'?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked as simply and directly as possible, as he was worried the White Dwarf might not understand.</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf thought for a long time and counted many times before saying, "15."</p><p></p><p>In other words, a long time ago, the environment of the Gal Pool changed drastically, and the Gal Pool no longer gave birth to new White Dwarfs.</p><p></p><p>For Su Hao, this was bad news.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately asked, "Where is your grandfather now?"</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen my grandfather, so I don't know where he is."</p><p></p><p>"Then how many children have you fissioned in total?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf was silent for a moment, then said, "21."</p><p></p><p>In other words, including this White Dwarf, there were 125 generations.</p><p></p><p>If he could just ask one more question, Su Hao would be able to know roughly what era the White Dwarfs were born in: "Ke White Dwarf, how often do you fission a child?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dwarf was confused again.</p><p></p><p>It had no concept of the words 'how often' and had never calculated time, so it could not answer Su Hao's question at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if Su Hao asked how many orbits the red giant star had made, it probably couldn't answer.</p><p></p><p>With a change of thought, Su Hao quickly found a solution. He could calculate the age difference between two White Dwarfs by detecting the subtle aging rate of the White Dwarf's body.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as he detected the time difference between this White Dwarf's birth and that of its grandfather, father, son, etc., he could roughly estimate the era when the red giant star naturally gave birth to White Dwarfs and how long ago that was from the present.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be accurate, but a rough estimate would suffice.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said, "Ke White Dwarf, take me to find your father and your first child. I have some things to ask them."</p>

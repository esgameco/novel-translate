        <h1>Chapter 598</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of mindless screaming, the two women seemed to have understood their situation and gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Then one of the women claimed to be the 'Empress Chengdi' of the 'Liyuan District', demanding that Yahan and Feng Cheng send her back to the 'Hepao' mage headquarters in XinjiCity within one day, or else they would not escape death for their ignorance.</p><p></p><p>The other woman also corroborated that she was indeed 'Empress Chengdi'.</p><p></p><p>It turned out Feng Cheng himself did not expect to actually capture an emperor, as he thought they were just playing some role-playing game before.</p><p></p><p>However, whether she was really an empress or not did not matter much to Feng Cheng. What he cared about was what this 'Catastrophe Cannon' they mentioned was.</p><p></p><p>But when asked, the so-called Chengdi refused to reveal anything about the 'Catastrophe Cannon' and denied its existence.</p><p></p><p>So Feng Cheng handed Chengdi over to Zhi Pengxian for interrogation. Chengdi quickly became good friends with Zhi Pengxian, opening up completely.</p><p></p><p>Within just over two hours, Zhi Pengxian obtained information about the 'Catastrophe Cannon' from Chengdi.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian said in disbelief: "The Eighteen Empires actually have such a weapon that can destroy an entire city?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said indifferently: "Not a big deal! It's just destroying one city. With source pearls, it's not difficult to achieve that."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian looked terrible: "But they plan to use such a weapon to destroy a city, wiping out everything in the city, including the citizens living there!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed lightly: "Zhi Pengxian, you've been the head of the Glorious Society for so long, yet you know nothing about war. Don't look at your opponents with such 'compassionate' eyes. What's wrong with destroying a few cities to eliminate the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian suddenly found Feng Cheng's gaze unfamiliar and felt a chill all over his body.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand why these people had such a casual attitude towards life. It was a city with over 100,000 inhabitants!</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian said: "I plan to stop them before the Eighteen Empires finish building the Catastrophe Cannon."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked: "Oh? How do you plan to stop them? By destroying the Catastrophe Cannon they built, or by overthrowing the entire rule of the Eighteen Empires?"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian couldn't say a word, because he couldn't do either.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yahan appeared with a smile: "That's easy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Pengxian asked in astonishment: "How...how do we do it?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the unscrupulous Yahan, solving this problem was indeed simple.</p><p></p><p>Since they had captured an emperor and turned him into Zhi Pengxian's friend, it meant they could capture more emperors and turn them all into Zhi Pengxian's friends. Then many things would be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, according to Chengdi, the emperors of the current seventeen empires were all gathered in XinjiCity, holding meetings at the 'absolutely safe' mage headquarters 'Hepao' every so often.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be possible to capture them all at once when they were meeting?</p><p></p><p>They could also bring back those 'Harmony Mages'.</p><p></p><p>Once accomplished, the following tasks would be simple.</p><p></p><p>Through these emperors, obtain the roster of royal families around the world, then eliminate them one by one for a clean sweep.</p><p></p><p>After finalizing the plan, Yahan and Feng Cheng placed a positioning mark on Chengdi and sent her back.</p><p></p><p>From the time Chengdi was brought back to when she was sent back, it took only five hours in total.</p><p></p><p>But in those short five hours, the Zoulexiangong Palace was almost in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The moment Chengdi disappeared, her guards noticed her aura vanish. After much hesitation and knocking without response, they broke in to search, quickly causing a commotion.</p><p></p><p>They searched the entire 'Zoulexiangong Palace' but couldn't find her anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Just as the guards were thinking about how to escape punishment and save their own lives, their empress miraculously reappeared in the same room.</p><p></p><p>The guards: ????</p><p></p><p>What baffled the guards the most was that their empress claimed she had never left the room, fell asleep hugging a girl after getting tired from the commotion, and had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...an omen of a strange disaster?</p><p></p><p>All kinds of bizarre incidents occurred worldwide. Although the 'Empress Disappearance Incident' was a bit absurd, it was not unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>But who could have imagined that the mighty empress had just been captured and interrogated? And it even spanned an unknown distance.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as the empress was fine, everyone would be fine too.</p><p></p><p>A false alarm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One month later, the conference of the Eighteen Empires was held at 'Hepao' as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>Many male emperors joked with Chengdi with a strange smile: "We heard Empress Chengdi went touring 'Zoulexiangong Palace' some time ago. What an interesting hobby!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! If Empress Chengdi has such refined tastes, why not tell us so we can accompany you? I'll cover all expenses. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>They all knew about 'Zoulexiangong Palace'. During their time in XinjiCity, they had played there quite often. But what the male emperors did not expect was that the seemingly cold beauty Chengdi also enjoyed such...activities.</p><p></p><p>In their minds, since they all enjoyed it, why not pair up directly...</p><p></p><p>They were all emperors, no one would lose out.</p><p></p><p>Chengdi still had that cold look on her face, ignoring the others' jokes and saying nothing about her own experience.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't betray her friend!</p><p></p><p>Seeing her lack of reaction, the others found it uninteresting and stopped talking. Instead, they chatted idly with familiar emperors, complaining about bizarre incidents in their districts.</p><p></p><p>Soon the Harmony Mage arrived, and the formal proceedings began.</p><p></p><p>After opening the session, the Harmony Mage stopped speaking, closed his eyes to meditate, and let the emperors negotiate the use of the 'Catastrophe Cannon'.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, there were ten Catastrophe Cannons built, and they had to decide who would use them.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone was worried that once the jointly built weapons were handed over, they would become the other party's private property.</p><p></p><p>After much argument with no resolution, the emperors cursed inwardly: "If we had known this earlier, we should have built eighteen cannons! Which idiot suggested building ten?"</p><p></p><p>However, they soon didn't need to argue over this anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because after the conference began, Yahan on a remote island overseas received the precise information.</p><p></p><p>Yahan smiled and used the positioning stone placed by Feng Cheng to teleport directly to XinjiCity.</p><p></p><p>This was a sealed warehouse, where Feng Cheng had been waiting. Seeing Yahan, he said happily: "Big boss Yahan, not bad here in XinjiCity, right? After we finish the main task, I'll take you to Zoulexiangong Palace and open your eyes."</p><p></p><p>Yahan smiled: "Those women don't really interest me, you enjoy yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Then he sent out his divine sense to quickly locate the conference venue.</p><p></p><p>As the largest metropolis and headquarters of the world's mage association, XinjiCity's defenses must be formidable. He dared not underestimate it.</p><p></p><p>Turning to Feng Cheng, he said: "You start engraving the 'Source Vector Suppression Array' to cover the entire XinjiCity area. Wait until I capture everyone before releasing it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Got it!"</p><p></p><p>He transformed into his Fate Child form, and his metamorphosis armor surged out, slowly engraving a huge array formation, then channeling spiritual power into it.</p><p></p><p>The array flashed white light, then returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Yahan knew the suppression array had activated successfully. He tested his own source abilities and found them disabled, so he said: "You better maintain it well, or I'll die without knowing it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Don't worry, big boss Yahan. Would I ever betray you?"</p><p></p><p>Yahan's eyes narrowed as he locked onto the Eighteen Empires conference hall and flashed over.</p><p></p><p>The moment Feng Cheng's suppression array activated, the Harmony Mage in the conference hall suddenly opened his eyes and stood up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The seventeen emperors were startled, stopping their argument and all looking at the Harmony Mage in confusion.</p><p></p><p>When had they ever seen the Harmony Mage with such an expression?</p><p></p><p>More than half of the seventeen emperors were source mages. After calming down, they quickly noticed something was off - their abilities couldn't be used!</p><p></p><p>They immediately realized why the Harmony Mage was so unsettled - the Harmony Mage's abilities also couldn't be used!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this method of sealing source abilities was very familiar.</p><p></p><p>It was said that because of this method, their army of 100,000 mages had been instantly annihilated...</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, they stood up, looking towards the leading Harmony Mage, but out of habit, no one mentioned their own loss of abilities first.</p><p></p><p>This series of actions left the few non-source mage emperors completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>"You have been captured!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 572</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As the experiment deepened, Su Hao gained a preliminary understanding of the 'system' that could transform matter into source energy.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was 'motion'!</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao needed to do was find that mode of motion.</p><p></p><p>More precisely, he needed to find the principle behind how matter changes under that motion, and analyze that principle.</p><p></p><p>That mode of motion was merely a means to an end.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao formed a rune by his side, emitting a faint purple light that shone on the octopus. After a moment, the octopus's body went limp like a lump of mud.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a tentacle and shook it, finding that this octopus was as still as if dead.</p><p></p><p>It had not actually died, retaining faint vital signs. Su Hao could revive it at any time. He called this state 'pseudo-death', where the organism's motor functions were nearly non-existent.</p><p></p><p>In this state, it would only take one day for the octopus to disconnect from the 'system'.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao wanted to observe was the changes in the octopus after it disconnected.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the octopus perished!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "What a pity, losing a source beast!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was trying to summarize the laws of motion within source beasts' bodies, he received a message from Ya Shan: "Master Wei! I've locked onto the mental frequency segment that guides the source!"</p><p></p><p>This was an expected surprise. Su Hao abandoned his work and flashed to Ya Shan's side, asking: "How so?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was beaming: "I've locked onto the open interval of a mental frequency segment. By changing the motion patterns in this segment, I can indeed control how the source transforms into different things. For example..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan closed his eyes, holding his breath for a minute before reaching out and grabbing a nearby bottle telekinetically, making various gestures as if using psychic abilities.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining this state, Ya Shan opened his eyes and said: "For instance, by simulating Feng Cheng's motion pattern in this frequency segment, I can obtain his 'psychic power', albeit weakly. But I can indeed do it. So as long as we simulate different motion patterns in this segment, we can gain different abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan showed Su Hao his research materials: "This frequency segment is located at 'Block 32 - Column 15 - Row 103 - Segment 49'. I call it the 'Source Transformation Vector'.</p><p></p><p>I've divided the Source Transformation Vector into three modules. The red part is the 'Constant Partition', like parameters. The multiple yellow parts are the 'Start and End Points'. The green part is the 'Source Transformation Variable' - this is the main section we control to transform the source into different abilities.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the red and yellow parts need to be fixed, while changing the green 'Source Transformation Variable' part allows us to gain whatever ability we want."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reviewed the materials, growing more satisfied as he chuckled: "Well done, Ya Shan!"</p><p></p><p>A word of praise was worth more than a thousand words. Ya Shan was deeply gratified, his face full of excitement as he recorded Master Wei's praise on his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had truly helped Master Wei! Moreover, he truly felt his own progress, a joy second only to Master Wei's approval!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan took the initiative to plan next steps: "Master Wei, I will continue deeply researching the Source Transformation Variables, summarizing the different abilities produced by different variables, and finally make it into software for convenient matching and use.</p><p></p><p>In the future, we'll all be full-spectrum source mages. Want any ability? Just search for it!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan found the idea quite appealing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "Good, you'll mainly be responsible for this going forward. Need more experimental subjects?"</p><p></p><p>When it came to experimental subjects, Zhi Peng was the biggest supplier at the experimental base, providing as many as needed - a key reason for Ya Shan's rapid research progress these past couple years...</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded: "The upcoming variable tests will need a huge amount of data. Just Feng Cheng and I exploring won't be efficient enough. But with Zhi Peng around, we can get as many subjects as needed. How are your experiments going, Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "Quite smoothly. I've grasped its tail, and will gradually pull it out bit by bit. I have a feeling that in five years at most, I'll master the way to transform matter into source energy."</p><p></p><p>Once he mastered the source, his first goal upon arriving in this world would be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was about to return to his lab to read Ya Shan's experiment report, he noticed that the locator stone he gave A Xing had been activated.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, he transformed into [Destiny Child], fully armored and concealed in his 'second-level space', projecting himself to A Xing's side.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't find A Xing's call for help troublesome at all. In fact, he welcomed it, because each time meant he could collect a new source artifact to study.</p><p></p><p>And A Xing didn't feel he was in any danger either. What was wrong with calling on a comrade he could rely on?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao, A Xing was overjoyed at first, but mentioning A Wang made him bitter: "A Wang and I got separated - the kind where one second they're right beside you, then gone after just one step."</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that like talking to a wall? He wondered curiously: "What's up with this bizarre disaster?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing shook his head: "It's like a huge maze. Doesn't seem dangerous, but we just can't get out! Sometimes taking one step forward sends you somewhere else. Sometimes you walk and walk only to end up back where you started. Now I don't even know where I am - it's kind of similar to your abilities, A Yang.</p><p></p><p>We've been trapped here four days. Our food and water are gone, so I had to call you for help..."</p><p></p><p>Could it be a bizarre spatial disaster?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes, his spiritual feelers probing to sense the true nature of this space.</p><p></p><p>As always, it was twisted, undulating, chaotic, flowing, profound - colorless yet vividly colored, composed of points, lines, planes, solids and even more complex patterns constantly transforming...</p><p></p><p>But unlike regular space, this space was divided into irregular blocks by some invisible force, stacked and crammed together like... plant cells under a microscope.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's heart shook: "What is this..."</p><p></p><p>He had confirmed that this bizarre disaster was definitely related to the spatial module - the very foundation of his existence! He never imagined the source could produce spatial abilities too. That was going too far!</p><p></p><p>He had to obtain this source artifact, no matter what. It absolutely could not fall into the hands of the Source Mages Association.</p><p></p><p>But with so many years of accumulation, did the Association possess other spatial ability source artifacts?</p><p></p><p>The probability wasn't low.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao decided then and there that after grasping the principles, he would immediately deal with it!</p><p></p><p>Since there was no real danger, Su Hao decided to personally experience the effects of this bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>After leaving a marker, Su Hao said: "A Xing, you stay put for now. I'll go find A Wang first."</p><p></p><p>A Xing nodded: "Okay, be careful A Yang."</p><p></p><p>Though he said that, A Xing wasn't actually worried about Su Hao encountering danger.</p><p></p><p>He used to worry, but not anymore. He felt the disaster should be more worried about Su Hao instead.</p><p></p><p>After taking a few steps forward, Su Hao clearly felt his body pass through a spatial channel, arriving at another location, just like his teleportation flashes.</p><p></p><p>After a few more tries, Su Hao basically grasped the pattern of this bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>The space here was divided into many independent small blocks, haphazardly stacked and crammed together, with some even overlapping - just like the state of the space around him when rapidly generating 'true spatial modules'.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Su Hao actually felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, from this bizarre disaster he saw more applications of the spatial module.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao had to name this space, he could call it 'A World With Every Step'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao blurted out: "Damn, the spatial module can be used like this too? If I grasp it, couldn't I create my own miniature world?"</p><p></p><p>This bizarre disaster was invaluable to Su Hao!</p><p></p><p>If he mastered this ability, he might not even need spaceships for future interstellar travels.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre disaster was truly amazing!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 903</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A "multiple choice question" was sent to the designated group of people, giving them only sixty seconds to think and choose either 'yes' or 'no'.</p><p></p><p>To Su Hao's surprise, he originally thought it would be good if fifty percent of people chose 'yes', but unexpectedly seventy percent chose 'yes', meaning out of ten thousand people, seven thousand chose to change their current lives.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that most of these people had been bombarded by various TV shows and novels, so they must have had a vague idea of what the blue box popping up in their minds meant.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't know exactly what they would face after choosing 'yes', they could generally sense that they would likely break away from their current living conditions after making that choice.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, most people chose to abandon everything they currently had to try a new life, even though they didn't know what that new life would entail.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps better, perhaps worse.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "The results have exceeded my expectations. When making choices in a short time, people seem bolder. More people hold an optimistic attitude towards 'change'."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said: "On the Blue-Purple Planet, people's lives now are much better than the bandit era more than a hundred years ago. However, people of this era have not personally experienced the inconvenience of that life, so they are not satisfied with their current living conditions.</p><p></p><p>I guess many people are not satisfied with their own lives, but rather envy others' lives, falling into a cycle of mutual envy, desperately wanting to change or break away from their current state.</p><p></p><p>With such an opportunity presented, even if there is only one in ten thousand chance that it's real, they are willing to take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether they can endure the various inconveniences of the new life."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "I think they will adapt quickly. They may complain 'what a crappy place' verbally, but in their hearts they may actually be quite happy."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan asked in surprise: "Why do you say that?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Because no matter if it's the Cross Star or the newly developed life planets, they can enjoy a sense of superiority that cannot be experienced on the Blue-Purple Planet.</p><p></p><p>Take the Cross Star for example. Although the power levels there are much higher than the Blue-Purple Planet, their understanding of the world is far from as high as the people on the Blue-Purple Planet. In the eyes of Blue-Purple Planet people, the intelligent beings on the Cross Star are just barbarians who have mastered powerful abilities. Facing barbarians, even if they are at an absolute disadvantage in power, they can gain a psychological advantage.</p><p></p><p>This is something they cannot experience on their home planet. Even in online arguments, they usually cannot win against others. Haha."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed: "That's true. Although life may be a bit harder, the psychological pleasure should allow them to overcome the inconvenience, and addictions like phone, internet, and gaming addictions can be quickly kicked."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao grinned: "But there is one exception - those who enter primitive societies! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan exclaimed in shock: "Great Lord Wei, you mean to send these people to newly transformed worlds that have not yet developed?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "I will only select a small number of planets for transmigration, trying to let the crossers accelerate the progress of civilization. It may not necessarily succeed, but many things are not absolute, it's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also showed an amused smile: "Indeed, the crossers entering the primitive era will not have an easy time."</p><p></p><p>He then thought of his own difficult experience of being hunted when he was first reborn in the cultivation world, having many near-death experiences, and added: "I wish them luck."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's plan to transmit crossers was simple - divided into two categories. One was to directly transmit them to the Cross Star, to be taken care of by the already proficient Eighteen Deities. The other was to directly transmit them to the newly transformed planets, giving them ample favorable conditions to let them live or die on their own...</p><p></p><p>The second category was simple, just transmit them over randomly.</p><p></p><p>For the first category, they needed to be transmitted in batches, as there were too many people. It was clearly inappropriate to transmit thousands at once. Those being transmitted had to queue up too.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao planned for the first batch of crosser participants to be transmitted to the same area, for easier management - like a newbie village in a game.</p><p></p><p>As for whether there might be scenes of people chanting 'Celestial Emperors Covering the Earth, Tigers' on the streets, then a group saying together 'Treasure Pagoda Subduing River Demons', or when the second batch of crossers came over trying to show off only to find all the ways to show off had been taken...</p><p></p><p>These were not things Su Hao had to consider.</p><p></p><p>Showing off was secondary. Growing stronger and struggling hard was the real deal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would install a suitable system for each crosser to assist their growth, and could also enable a team system for them to treat the Cross Star like a game.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that they only had one chance. If they failed, that was it - unless they had some special ability that caught Su Hao's eye and gave them a few more chances.</p><p></p><p>But that probability was likely small.</p><p></p><p>After setting everything up, Su Hao brought the Eighteen Deities into Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao spoke in a light tone, letting the deities sense his good mood: "It's been a long time, Deity Lords. Have you all been well recently?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the deities also casually greeted Su Hao. It seemed their performance during this period must have been good, earning their boss's appreciation - especially the matter of rescuing the two World Wills during the great battle against the Crimson Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>They thought secretly: "Will Lord Lei An give us some special reward?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they heard Su Hao praise them: "I've seen all your hard work during this period. The two World Wills are now alive and well, becoming among the most powerful existences in the universe with some self-protection ability. Deity Lords, you are indispensable for this."</p><p></p><p>The deities felt flattered to their souls, unable to help but laugh heartily, while also trying to show a modest front: "Not at all, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "So, to thank you Deity Lords for your efforts, I racked my brains and finally thought of a reward you all will definitely like."</p><p></p><p>A reward from Lei An Oakes?</p><p></p><p>The deities gasped, then a surge of excitement rushed through their bodies as they looked at Su Hao expectantly, awaiting his next words.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "It is - the Little Deity Study Buddy!"</p><p></p><p>The deities were dumbfounded: "???"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained: "This Little Deity Study Buddy is something I specially designed and produced for you Lords. Do you still remember the question Lord Nati asked me decades ago? He asked if there was a way to increase your intelligence.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, there is! But for you, it's not very useful. Without sufficient knowledge and consciousness, too much intelligence will only cause mental confusion.</p><p></p><p>Since that time, it got me thinking: although your intelligence is very high, your wisdom is indeed lacking.</p><p></p><p>And you happen to have the desire to learn deeper knowledge, so how could I watch you have no access to education?</p><p></p><p>So after years of hard work, I finally developed a study buddy suitable for you deities to improve your wisdom - the Little Deity Study Buddy!"</p><p></p><p>Nati exclaimed excitedly: "The Little Deity Study Buddy can really improve wisdom? It can let us understand those profound mathematical and physical theories?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Of course. This study buddy can let you understand the real universe, change your backward mindset, and even become renowned scholars of the universe. When you walk out, people will be able to see the words 'Wisdom' written hugely on your forehead."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa -"</p><p></p><p>The deities' minds wavered, looking envious. If only they could be knowledgeable of everything in heaven and earth like Lord Lei An...</p><p></p><p>This reward far exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Knowledge and wisdom were exactly what they aspired for!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, 'Great Scholar' became the deities' new pursuit.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 901</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>That last strike by the Chip Daemon King terrified all eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>How could they not have thought that the Chipu Great Demon King could have mastered such a powerful force, able to sink an island with a single strike?</p><p></p><p>The earth-shattering explosion just now had even caused the soul power network they had constructed to malfunction for a moment, unable to detect the specifics of that one location.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the network was partially disconnected.</p><p></p><p>This was a phenomenon that had never been seen before since the network had been formed, so it was evident how powerful that attack was.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the God of Order-Red Light's face went black, originally thinking that this time he would be able to avenge that kick from a thousand years ago, he didn't realize that the power of the Chip Grand Demon King exceeded the imagination of all the deities.</p><p></p><p>Now that the network has not returned to normal, the whereabouts of the two world wills under their care are unknown ......</p><p></p><p>If they had known that the Chipu Daemon King was so powerful, they would not have let the two world wills take the risk.</p><p></p><p>The God of Redemption-Hundred Bodies said helplessly, "It seems like it's all for naught in the end, but fortunately, over the years, I've saved up enough points that it's not a loss overall."</p><p></p><p>The God of Ten Thousand Thunders-Gu said unhappily, "Don't be so sure, maybe the World Will got away with it? I remember seeing the two of them vanish into the ground before, the Evasion Technique can effectively resist concussive attacks from the ground, and it can also greatly reduce the power of the explosion."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God-Barry nodded and said, "I hope that's the case, now we still need to find the two World Will as soon as possible, moreover, our mission hasn't been shown to have failed, and since His Excellency Lei An hasn't sought us out for a meeting, I think there's still a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>When the other deities heard that, it was indeed true, so they connected to the newly restored network and gradually searched the waters of the island.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the God of Darkness - Eternal said, "Found it, floating in the sea, still has a breath, but if we don't rescue it, it will die soon."</p><p></p><p>The gods followed the positioning given by Winged World and saw two wretched figures floating on the sea surface, following the waves of the sea, unconscious.</p><p></p><p>The God of Resuscitation - Summer by Summer immediately said, "Quickly, control the nearby soul beasts to rescue them immediately."</p><p></p><p>The God of Bathing Light-Easy said, "On it."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a soul beast whale was seen, floating up from under the sea, just in time to lift the two siblings from the water.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, looking at the appearance of the two siblings, they were simply miserable, their legs were blown away, with a trace of blood oozing out, and their extremely defensive clothing armor was also tattered and torn, revealing skin full of scars.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an octopus climbed up from the side of the Soul Beast Whale, and searched with its tentacles on the two siblings' bodies, and managed to find a small porcelain bottle in Cong Shuling's hands.</p><p></p><p>This was a strong healing medicine, Cong Shuling noticed that she was seriously injured and subconsciously took out the injury medicine from her space, just before she had time to use it, she was drowned by the powerful impact.</p><p></p><p>It was good that her subconscious mind held on tightly and didn't let go.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the deities were relieved and controlled the octopus to feed the medicine to the two siblings.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for a moment, seeing that the two siblings were no longer in life-threatening danger and their injuries were gradually recovering, they controlled the octopus and the whale to quietly retreat, hovering around to guard the area.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the two siblings woke up.</p><p></p><p>After waking up and looking at each other's condition, they looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They first took out a large amount of recovery medicines from their space and took them in, thoroughly stabilizing their injuries before using a flight technique and floating up from the sea.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling had broken a leg and an arm, while Cong Renfei had broken two legs and looked incomparably miserable.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Sister, this time it was really rash."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Learning from the lesson, in the future we'll be a bit more careful, and resolutely not be reckless without figuring out the depths of the enemy."</p><p></p><p>As for the issue of severed limbs, they weren't worried because they had similar experiences before, and as long as they had enough points, they could buy 'Rebirth of Severed Limbs' from the mall.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, ''Let's go, let's find a safe place to heal first, and don't mess with the matter of the Red Pu Daemon King ...... for a short time. Wait for us to become stronger ......"</p><p></p><p>They believed that with the system, they could grow quickly, and in the most ten years, they would inevitably surpass the Red Pu Daemon King.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao implanted a system into the Chip Daemon King, he left the Cross Star.</p><p></p><p>This time the fluctuation of the doom system, he had already finished collecting it.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was the gods or the two siblings, they didn't know that in this explosion, it was Su Hao who had stepped in to save the two siblings, shielding the circulation of spiritual energy in both of them without collapsing, allowing them to survive a glimmer of life.</p><p></p><p>This was what led to the subsequent rescue operation.</p><p></p><p>They both still thought that they were lucky this time, and were lucky not to die under the bombardment of the destruction cannon.</p><p></p><p>Life is tenacious, but sometimes very fragile.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao returned to the base small world, he immediately entered the pinball space to analyze the data collected this time.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month's time, the anomalies in the microcosmic movement state of this event were separated out, once again confirming the previous conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"However, I still need more samples and data, and I still need stronger transport waves."</p><p></p><p>He pondered quietly for a moment, exited the pinball space, and muttered, "Then, arrange for more and stronger travelers to make the tip of the transport wave, surface."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent a message to Yashan and asked, "Yashan, what's the current situation of Blue Purple Star?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied, "Boss Wei, most of the population of Blue Purple Star has entered the information technology era, at the same time, all kinds of movie and television fiction works, have shown an outbreak, all kinds of are involved, not to mention everyone, at least one-third of the population for the travel through, sci-fi, fantasy, cultivation of immortality, horror, and other elements have a good enough understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>Basic crisis awareness and skills are still some protection, the overall inevitable than more than a hundred years ago, the world of thieves to be too much better.</p><p></p><p>But, ahem, this also depends on the person, some people get caught up in heavy fantasies and detached from reality, which in turn is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>I think that the humans in this world right now shouldn't have any problems in the short term, but in the long term, it's bound to sift out a large number of people."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's only natural, as long as there is a preliminary excess, the number is large enough, and will inevitably be able to give birth to some truly suitable talents at the place.</p><p></p><p>Yashan, during this period of time, you help me keep an eye out for some good looking seedlings on the Blue Violet Planet, I'll be using them soon."</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "About how many will be needed?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Anywhere between one thousand and ten thousand is fine."</p><p></p><p>"Understood Vee Boss."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then found Feng Cheng and asked, "Feng Cheng, how are the various different civilization planets you have transformed now? You go with me to take a look."</p><p></p><p>For so many years, Su Hao had just handed this task over to the two men and had not personally checked it out, not much was known about the details, he had nothing special to do nowadays, so he happened to take this opportunity to go around the various planets so that he could do it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng excitedly said, "Alright Wei Boss, I'll take you there."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao and Feng Cheng arrived at the first planet, named by Yashan as the 'Star of the Vermilion Acquired People'.</p><p></p><p>This was a planet that was modeled after Yashan's hometown, nowadays its vegetation covered almost three quarters of the land, the rest was wasteland and desert where plants were hard to grow, and all sorts of strange creatures survived in it, either lurking, running away, hunting, or courting, in a full of vitality manner.</p><p></p><p>And these creatures, each has a unique skills, some extremely fast, some can change color mimicry, some can become a puddle of inconspicuous liquid waiting for food to come to the door, some are good at playing holes, some can fly rapidly ......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng introduced, "Boss Yashan hoped that through natural evolution, he could replicate the look of his former hometown, so he dispersed many special gene sequences in different animals, so that many of the animals, all possessed a unique survival instinct.</p><p></p><p>He also added a 'transformation chamber' function to all the animals, so that the animals could devour and plunder each other on their own, complementing their genes while gaining great power.</p><p></p><p>When enough time passes, these genes will inevitably combine into a specific sequence by coincidence. And this time is when civilization is born."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Not a bad idea, Yashan's homeland might have evolved in exactly this way, originally there was no such thing as a level 7 Inhuman, and it was only when a wide variety of genetic fragments were integrated that those rich sequences and abilities came into being."</p><p></p><p>He also pointed downwards, "But the creatures on the planet I see are not that rich, in this state, it would be difficult to integrate them into a complete eight sequences."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said helplessly, "Indeed, the plants and animals that Boss Yashan and I put onto this planet at the beginning were not just this much that we saw, they were nearly a hundred times richer than this, unfortunately, the vast majority of the species were unable to successfully adapt to the environment of this planet and eventually died out.</p><p></p><p>The plants and animals we see now are those that have survived through hundreds of years of development and have adapted smoothly to the environment.</p><p></p><p>It can also be said that the 'nature' of this planet chose them. Boss Yashan didn't force it too much, since it was the planet's choice, let it develop naturally."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao lost his smile and said, "Every planet has its uniqueness, wanting to perfectly replicate a planet's appearance, how easy is it to talk about it, you can do this to this extent, all of you are already very good.</p><p></p><p>This place has been transformed by you guys into a good place ah! Compared to a barren planet, such a vibrant place really looks more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Go, take a look around and see what your chosen civilization carrier, the protagonist of the future heaven and earth looks like."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 860</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Under Suhao's arrangement, Yashan and Fengcheng began searching for habitable planets in the galaxy to transform them into true civilized planets.</p><p></p><p>Following the mission issued by Suhao, the eighteen deities helped Suhao capture the ancient Lao Baijiale within the red giant star, while exploring various parts of the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Suhao sent out his divine incarnation to the vicinity of the black hole, connecting to the 'galactic network' to collect a large amount of information about the red giant star, and deduce what happened during the birth period of Baijiale.</p><p></p><p>He also conducted more detailed research on Baijiale on the red giant star, collecting a large number of 'inheritance memory fragments' of Baijiale, trying to restore the ancient memories.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly, and ten years had gone by unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>And Suhao also welcomed his time of harvest.</p><p></p><p>With the completion of Baijiale's 'inheritance memory fragments', a large amount of information about the red giant star at different stages was arranged into a timeline, and various hypotheses were put forward, which were then verified or refuted through extensive experiments.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Suhao pinpointed the specific life stage of the red giant star when this peculiar creature Baijiale was born—the initial stage when a star becomes a red giant.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, when the nuclear fusion fuel inside a star decreases and the radiation energy produced is no longer sufficient to counteract the star's enormous gravitational force, the star's equilibrium is broken, causing the core to collapse and the outer core to expand.</p><p></p><p>And the life form of Baijiale was born precisely at the moment when this equilibrium was broken, a result of millions of coincidences.</p><p></p><p>"During the process of a star shedding its outer layers and becoming a red giant, extremely violent and complex changes occurred inside the star. It was precisely this change that gave birth to the special life form of Baijiale. In other words, as long as I find a large number of newly-born red giants and observe their transformation process, I can simulate the corresponding environment and obtain my own soul power."</p><p></p><p>It's not that every red giant would produce the life form of Baijiale when it was born. Rather, the initial stage of a red giant created the necessary conditions for the birth of Baijiale.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Suhao did not want to create the life form of Baijiale itself, but only the 'soul power' that could carry consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>This difficulty would be much lower.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the key points, Suhao immediately sent a message to Yashan and Fengcheng: "Yashan, Fengcheng, how is your search for habitable planets going?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "In the Hydra constellation where the Crux constellation is located, we have found 175 planets that can be transformed. Fengcheng and I have now moved to another galaxy to continue the search. So far, we have found a total of 530 planets that can be transformed."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "This number is sufficient for now. You can start the transformation process. But before that, help me find stars that are in the process of shedding their outer layers and becoming red giants. I need them for my research on soul power."</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately sent over more than a hundred red giants in the shedding process that met the requirements, and said, "While searching for planets that can be transformed, we have also been recording the states of various celestial bodies. If you need to find these types of stars, we happen to have recorded more than a hundred of them. Please take a look and see if these are what you need, Great Lord."</p><p></p><p>Suhao took a look and saw that they were indeed the newly-born red giants he was looking for. He said, "These are exactly the stars I need to find. This saves me the trouble of searching for them."</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "Great Lord, do you need to find more?"</p><p></p><p>"This many red giants is already enough. You two focus on your tasks and start transforming the planets. This is no simple matter. By the way, the assistant has the complete design and manufacturing process for the exploration micro-cubes. You can try designing a transformation micro-cube first."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Understood, Great Lord. If I have any questions, I'll ask you again."</p><p></p><p>Yashan hesitated for a moment, then asked, "Great Lord, what should I transform these planets into? I mean, can I transform them into the appearance of the Zhuohuo Human Planet, or the world of the Summoners? Oh, and Fengcheng also told me his idea. He wants to transform one of the planets into the appearance of the Cultivation Star..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "I didn't expect you two to be so nostalgic. You can transform them into whatever you like."</p><p></p><p>Yashan, having obtained Suhao's permission, was delighted and said, "Thank you, Great Lord."</p><p></p><p>Suhao understood their thoughts. They simply wanted to go back and see what their worlds had become. Especially Fengcheng, he might truly want to know if his home planet, the Cultivation Star, had survived the ordeal.</p><p></p><p>For the current Fengcheng, no matter how many countless planets he could possess if he wanted, the most precious one would always be the Cultivation Star...</p><p></p><p>Year after year, time passed. They had wandered in the universe for who knows how many years, but no matter what, they could never forget their first life, their hometowns, even if they had only lived there for a few decades or a few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>How could Suhao not want to revisit the places he had been before? It's just that he could record time and knew how vast the time distance was - everything from the past might have already turned to dust and ashes.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng didn't understand. They still thought it had been less than ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but reminisce about the scenes he had experienced in the past, sighing, "Even if I create an identical planet, what good would it do? It would only be a replica from memory."</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he knew this that it made one feel sad.</p><p></p><p>Even if one became powerful enough to conquer the entire universe, it could not make up for the regrets of the past.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Suhao put aside his jumbled thoughts and, based on the locations of the red giants provided by Yashan, entered the galactic network to observe them one by one.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After completing a day's exploration mission, the eighteen deities gathered together to discuss games.</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder, Gu Xiao, @'ed the God of Gold, Bali, and the God of Order, Hongguang, in the group: "Lord Bali, Lord Hongguang, the weather is nice. Why don't we team up for a round of 'Chaos Duel'? I've recently been practicing a new Deicider, and I'm eager to show off my skills."</p><p></p><p>Bali and Hongguang immediately agreed to Gu's invitation: "What are we waiting for? Let's do it. I've also obtained a new Deicider, and it's absolutely divine."</p><p></p><p>The God of Quaking, Nati, couldn't help but join in: "Me too, me too! Let me in."</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder, Gu, disdainfully said, "Your skills are too poor. You'll only feed them kills and hold us back. Go find the goddesses to play with."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty, Fuier, immediately sent an emoji of a hammer smashing a brain: "Lord Gu, do you have some bias against us goddesses?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the God of Quaking, Nati, sent a picture of his new Deicider: "I recently obtained the SSS-rank Deicider, Taimeng."</p><p></p><p>"Whew——"</p><p></p><p>A flurry of envious emojis flooded the group.</p><p></p><p>Gu immediately changed his tone: "Come, come, let me team up. Let's play together."</p><p></p><p>The other noble deities also clamored to join, wanting to witness the prowess of the SSS-rank Deicider, Taimeng.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a chorus of curses erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, Nati, you noob. Is this how you play Taimeng, the beast? Please don't insult the SSS-rank Deicider anymore. Go play D-rank Deiciders instead!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Nati, 500 points. How about selling me this Taimeng? It's a waste in your hands."</p><p></p><p>"I'll offer 600 points."</p><p></p><p>"Nati, take my advice and uninstall the game."</p><p></p><p>Nati was puzzled: "That doesn't make sense. I think I played pretty well..."</p><p></p><p>The deities' attempt at completing the Chaos Duel ultimately ended in failure. Nati used the most powerful Deicider but played like a complete noob, drawing criticism from all the deities.</p><p></p><p>After ten years of development, the deities gradually became addicted to the 'World Creation Assistant' loaded by Suhao, to the point where they couldn't go without it for even a moment.</p><p></p><p>When they didn't have points to draw for new games, they almost wanted to kneel before Suhao and beg him to issue them missions to earn points.</p><p></p><p>Now, points had become their lifeblood.</p><p></p><p>As for the 'Deity Worship Game' on the Crux constellation, they had long forgotten about it in some corner.</p><p></p><p>Could the lofty deities have any good games to play?</p><p></p><p>Just as the deities were engrossed in their games, they suddenly heard a "ding-dong" sound coming from somewhere, causing their hearts to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a feeling of joy welled up from within: "A new mission, we can earn points again."</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly opened the mission panel to check the new mission: "Limited Exploration Mission: Explore newly-born red giants, collect specific location information from the red giants as required; Mission Reward: 100 points for each red giant explored, plus an extra chance to draw for a new game. Note: Arrive at the red dwarf star outpost within 24 hours."</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the reward, the deities were stunned.</p><p></p><p>100 points, plus an extra draw chance. In the more than ten years they had been doing missions, they had never seen a mission with so many points as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that for their daily exploration missions on the red giant star, they only received 1 point as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, the deities immediately activated their 'Instant Transmission' and flew towards the nearest red dwarf star to the red giants.</p>

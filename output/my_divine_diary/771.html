        <h1>Chapter 771</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yuantan's forces were led by three great generals, the leaders of the Bàlóng, Jīnglóng, and Yánlóng tribes.</p><p></p><p>They were Bàlóng Hóngjūn, Jīnglóng Yuánzhào, and Yánlóng Kǒngchéng respectively.</p><p></p><p>While the allied armies were roaring madly, these four military leaders remained remarkably calm.</p><p></p><p>Bàlóng Hóngjūn thundered, "Prince Yuantan, our great army is brimming with vigor now. Why don't we march directly up the Divine Mountain? As long as we proceed step-by-step, we will surely be able to conquer the Divine Mountain."</p><p></p><p>The fallen deity Yuantan shook his head, "We must not underestimate any of the Winged Deities. Each Winged Deity commands the magic of the 'Divine Pool' and possesses formidable battle prowess. The Divine Mountain is lofty and precipitous. If we climb from the foot upwards, attacking from a lower position, no matter how many soldiers we have, we will be no match for the Winged Deities!"</p><p></p><p>Jīnglóng Yuánzhào chuckled and nodded, "Well said. After all, besides mastering the powerful magic of the 'Divine Pool', the Winged Deities can also fly freely and swiftly in the air, giving them an innate huge advantage in combat. Why should we fight against their strengths with our weaknesses?"</p><p></p><p>Yánlóng Kǒngchéng remained silent, only looking at Yuantan, awaiting his decision.</p><p></p><p>Bàlóng Hóngjūn frowned, "But if we don't take the initiative to attack and just wait here, as long as the Winged Deities hold their ground, after some time our allied forces will collapse on their own. Then, what awaits us is complete failure."</p><p></p><p>Although he accepted Yuantan's argument to unite and annihilate the Winged Deities, deep down he still had doubts and wariness towards Yuantan, a member of the Winged Deity race.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how he thought about it, he could not understand why a Winged Deity would betray his own kind and ally with foreign races to attack his sacred homeland.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Yuantan harbored resentment after failing to be elected as the Sacred Lord and wanted revenge?</p><p></p><p>Bàlóng Hóngjūn thought to himself, "This Prince Yuantan is so wicked! Once the allied forces achieve victory in this war, he will surely unite with the Jīnglóng and Yánlóng tribes to exterminate these so-called fallen deities."</p><p></p><p>Yuantan pointed behind him at the incessantly cheering allied forces with full confidence, "This is why I have the allied forces shouting all kinds of slogans - to create an impression that we are about to launch an attack, deceiving the Winged Deities into thinking we will attack today."</p><p></p><p>He paused and smiled, "Moreover, from what I know of the Sacred Lord, once informed that we are about to march up and attack, he will undoubtedly launch an offensive against us at all costs. Because to him, the Divine Mountain is everything, the glory of the Winged Deities is everything. He will not allow foreign dragon races to set foot on the land of the Divine Mountain, except as corpses.</p><p></p><p>So just wait, the Winged Deities will soon fly down from the mountain. We only need to be prepared for battle."</p><p></p><p>Just as Bàlóng was doubting Yuantan's words, a series of roars from the Winged Deities echoed endlessly from afar.</p><p></p><p>The roars were so powerful that the allied forces of the three tribes turned pale, and their shouted slogans faltered.</p><p></p><p>Bàlóng Hóngjūn muttered in astonishment, "Just as Prince Yuantan predicted, the Winged Deities really did come down. Prince Yuantan is indeed prescient..."</p><p></p><p>Yet he was also apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the allied forces behind him losing momentum due to the Winged Deities' roars, Yuantan's eyes flared with anger. He spread his wings and soared into the sky, tilting his head back to roar towards the Divine Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The fallen deities mixed among the allied forces also took flight, roaring upwards.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the three tribes' allied forces regained their vigor, straining their necks and venting their pre-battle emotions in their own ways.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"  </p><p>"Howl——"</p><p>"Screech——"</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others observed the events unfolding above and below the Divine Mountain from tens of thousands of meters away using their divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng wondered, "Are they going to fight? They all seem very excited."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "I think they're about to fight. Those flying winged dragons seem to be the common enemy of the other three dragon races, quite detested. You see those winged dragons have hidden in such a remote corner of the mountain, yet they're still being pursued relentlessly."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng found it strange, "Is that so? Then why would the winged dragons initiate an attack? If I were them, I'd run far away.</p><p></p><p>I guess this place was originally the home of the winged dragons, and then some winged dragon prince went down the mountain and flirted with a princess of another dragon race, or maybe even forced himself on her. So he incurred the siege of the other dragon races.</p><p>After all, since ancient times, grievances often arise from a woman's belly, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Feng Cheng, you're guessing way too wildly. A winged dragon prince and dragon princess? Racial conflicts wouldn't arise from something so superficial, would they? It would make more sense to say the winged dragons have some treasure at home."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed, "Well, it all sounds about the same to me!"</p><p></p><p>Then he asked Su Hao, "Old Master Wei, should we just watch them fight?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed with great interest. Hearing Feng Cheng's question, he casually replied, "Although I'm very curious about what's special about these dragons, it's clear they have something going on. Since we just arrived, it wouldn't be polite to abruptly intervene in their affairs. </p><p></p><p>Out of courtesy, we should wait until they've settled their matters before saying anything!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them were very polite, so Ya Shan and Feng Cheng nodded in agreement after hearing this, "It would be impolite to intervene directly. If we have any doubts, we can ask once they're a bit free."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "We can also observe their combat prowess in the meantime."</p><p></p><p>So the three of them remained on the sidelines, using their divine consciousness to observe the battlefield, like three spectators enjoying a show.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Below the Divine Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Led by the Winged Deity Sacred Lord, the Winged Deity tribe dove down from above, rapidly closing in on the enemy.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Deity Sacred Lord took the lead, raising his long spiked hammer glowing with dazzling purple light and radiating it outwards.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord let out a long howl, then swung his hammer violently, unleashing a massive purple beam towards the allied forces on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, an enormous figure flew out from the front of the allied forces, blocking the purple beam.</p><p></p><p>Wielding a gigantic round hammer, it swung at the purple beam.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous rumbling erupted as immense force exploded in mid-air, sending shockwaves radiating outwards. The shockwaves swept over the allied ground forces, causing many soldiers to lose their footing.</p><p></p><p>The sheer power was evident.</p><p></p><p>This massive figure was none other than Yuantan. After being blasted back by the powerful force of blocking the Sacred Lord's strike, he steadied himself and flew up again to face the Sacred Lord, roaring, "Sacred Lord, I am your opponent! Come, let me witness the strongest power of the 'Divine Grace Realm', just how formidable it truly is."</p><p></p><p>The Winged Deity Sacred Lord's eyes looked icy cold, but his pupils burned with raging flames, "Vile traitor, the fallen deity Yuantan! You have no right to stand before me. Today, you will pay a brutal price for your actions!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Sacred Lord flapped his wings and charged straight at Yuantan. His long spiked hammer emanated a massive amount of purple light, almost solidifying.</p><p></p><p>He let out a bellow and swung the hammer down at Yuantan's head, seemingly intent on killing him with one strike.</p><p></p><p>Yuantan's expression was exceptionally grave as blue-purple light radiated from the giant hammer in his hands. He swung it violently.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>An immense blast erupted as Yuantan was struck away by the Sacred Lord's hammer blow.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the Winged Deity forces entered the attack range of the allied army.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>A torrential volley of barbed arrows rained down from the allied army towards the Winged Deities in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Deities emanated blue-purple radiance, forming a protective barrier around themselves. Meanwhile, they rapidly swung their spiked hammers to deflect the endless barrage of arrows.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some unlucky Winged Deities were caught off guard and had numerous arrows pierce their bodies before plummeting from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After deflecting the first volley of arrows, the Winged Deities dove down, rapidly closing in on the allied ground forces and strafing them from above.</p><p></p><p>Their long spiked hammers glowed with purple radiance, and with each swing, many allied soldiers were torn open with gaping wounds, screaming as they collapsed to the ground, never to rise again.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Winged Deities were feeling smug, purple radiance erupted from various positions within the allied army, dragging many careless Winged Deities down from the sky to be slain in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This made the Winged Deities realize that while there were not many dragons wielding the power of the 'Divine Pool' among the allied forces, they were cleverly hidden within the densely packed army, specifically ambushing any Winged Deities who carelessly approached.</p><p></p><p>What was originally a scene of the Winged Deities massacring the allied forces became complicated.</p><p></p><p>Because the Winged Deities could not discern which of the densely packed allied soldiers possessed magic power.</p><p></p><p>One careless mistake, and they could be ambushed and killed.</p>

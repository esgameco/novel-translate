        <h1>Chapter 660</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ever since twenty years ago, whether cultivating or researching, Su Hao had maintained the state of "commanding talisman", protecting himself with a thick adamantine armor while also donning the strongest "brittle shell defense".</p><p></p><p>The purpose was to guard against any sudden disaster that might wipe him out one day.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the number of planets he had destroyed over these years was approaching eighty. If the destructive energy from the annihilation of those planets all became the operating energy for the catastrophe system and concentrated back on him, he was afraid he might instantly turn into a humanoid "source". </p><p></p><p>It couldn't be left unguarded against.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao recalled the scene of the last island's destruction, believing that this time the catastrophe was most likely an intense high-frequency vibration that converged on him from all directions, instantly shattering his physical body and completely destroying this focal point.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had researched and developed a shielding technique against "vibration" over a hundred years ago, protecting the entire spacecraft securely. At the same time, he had everyone on the ship learn this technique as a precaution.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly, and two years later, the spacecraft entered a relatively empty region of space.</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao awoke from his cultivation and wanted to dive into analyzing various cosmic rays after summarizing his thoughts. However, after a few attempts, he found he could not truly enter a focused state for research.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but let out a long sigh and muttered, "It seems that after cultivating by the 'breaking through with spiritual power' method, my mental state has been somewhat affected. If it were in the past, I definitely wouldn't have trouble entering a research state like this.</p><p></p><p>"This is, after all, an unorthodox method that goes against the natural laws of life's development.</p><p></p><p>I'll put off further cultivation for now and wait until I fully regain control over myself before attempting it again."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Su Hao got up and went for a walk outside.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he last strolled on the small island, and he almost forgot that this was the leisurely time he had fought for.</p><p></p><p>It was currently spring according to the calendar, and the spacecraft's atmospheric controls were set to "spring". The small island was lush with green grass and blooming flowers, brimming with vitality.</p><p></p><p>However, apart from the small animals originally living here, there was no other human activity.</p><p></p><p>Even Ling Baihua and the others were secluded in their own rooms, cultivating their spiritual power in hopes of soon breaking through to the highest realm of "Divine Body".</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was wandering around trying to adjust his mental state, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng sensed his leisurely manner and actually put down what they were doing to come out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but ask, "Why did you two come out?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled, "I just felt cooped up and not in the right state, so when I saw Old Master Wei out here, I came out for a walk to relieve the stuffiness."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "I saw Old Master Wei and Old Master Ya out, so I came out to take a look too."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "I'm just taking a casual stroll, nothing else."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly proposed, "Why don't we play some Chinese poker?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan looked at Feng Cheng in surprise, worried this guy had gone stir-crazy. With their powerful spiritual awareness, wouldn't they see through any hand of cards?</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan seemed quite interested and glanced at Su Hao. He had always loved playing cards and games, but got too busy with missions over the years and never had time.</p><p></p><p>After aimlessly drifting in the cosmos for so many years, he was bored out of his mind. Having someone to play cards with now was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Alright, let's go play at the pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>So at the pavilion on the small island, the three young bald men could be seen shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Straight! Three of a kind with a side card!"</p><p></p><p>"I bomb you!"  </p><p></p><p>"I bomb you too! Haha, I only have one card left!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, Feng Cheng, how come your cards are so good? Are you cheating?!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Ya, how could I cheat? The cards were dealt by the assistant."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao cleared his throat, "Bomb."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was stunned, "Old Master Wei, how do you still have a bomb?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I have the wild cards! Three, I win."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan triumphantly stuck two paper slips on Feng Cheng's forehead, then roared with laughter.</p><p></p><p>By now, Feng Cheng's forehead was completely covered in paper slips, densely packed. Of course, Ya Shan and Su Hao's foreheads also had quite a few.</p><p></p><p>For the next round, after looking at their cards, Feng Cheng beamed while Ya Shan frowned deeply. Su Hao calmly called to be the landlord.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately said, "I rob the landlord!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the entire spacecraft trembled slightly!</p><p></p><p>"Damn, particle ray flow and ultra-frequency vibration!" Su Hao's pupils constricted as he instinctively activated his spiritual tentacles, his upper body instantly phasing into the "second dimension" space.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses again...</p><p></p><p>He saw Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's surprised expressions frozen on their faces, before they weathered away like dust scattering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Not just Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, but the surrounding pavilion, plants, soil, rocks - everything weathered away into fine dust particles drifting about.  </p><p></p><p>The "simulated gravity system" that had been maintained was now collapsed, causing all objects inside the ship to float weightlessly before breaking apart piece by piece.</p><p></p><p>The water from the nearby pool also broke free from its container, floating in midair and constantly twisting and stretching.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the structure of his miniature world had shattered the instant the particle flow struck!</p><p></p><p>The small island hidden within was restored to its original tiny size, appearing in the vast empty space. In the next instant, it was swept up by the enormous particle flow and shot off at extreme speed towards the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Su Hao still had the "second dimension" space. The moment he sensed something was wrong, he used a positioning stone to take refuge in the dimensional gap, transferring his physical body away from the current space to an obscure crevice, narrowly escaping disaster.</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Hao reacted extremely quickly, his body below the chest was completely obliterated, leaving only two shoulders topped by a head...</p><p></p><p>In that fleeting moment, he only managed to create a few "negative space modules". The negative space just enveloped his head when the high-frequency particle energy swept past, taking away his body below the chest along with a large amount of his "blood energy", "spiritual power", "source", and other energies.</p><p></p><p>Even the "composite rune system" within his body instantly shattered and vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In other words, of his vast powers, only meager remnants remained, just the consciousness platform still running in his head.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, he couldn't even use his most familiar "flash step" technique. To leave this space, he could only use his spiritual tentacles to transfer via the positioning stones he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Su Hao was so speechless.</p><p></p><p>The good news was, even reduced to just two shoulders and a head, Su Hao could still survive!</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>The moment after the energy swept past, violent explosions rang out one after another. Relying on the remaining air inside the ship to transmit sound waves, the residual matter of the spacecraft was instantly blasted into cosmic dust spraying outwards.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's vision also quickly became empty space.</p><p></p><p>That was the stored "source" transforming into energy and radiating outwards in the vibration.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, all that remained in the original area was Su Hao's head!</p><p></p><p>A crystalline head encased in adamantine armor, floating in the vast expanse of space - quite an bizarre sight.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Hao quickly took action.</p><p></p><p>"Kachakachaka~"</p><p></p><p>The adamantine armor on his head flowed downwards, gradually encasing the severed area below his shoulders and extending down to construct a crystalline body, restoring his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>But it was only an appearance - he did not rush to regenerate his physical body, merely establishing a new cycle to barely sustain his life for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current situation was still unknown. In this cosmos, it would be unwise to rashly expend a huge amount of energy restoring a physical body of little use.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the second catastrophe? If I hadn't set up a defensive barrier against 'pulverization waves' outside the ship beforehand, I probably wouldn't have had time to react and would have instantly died like Ya Shan and the others, losing consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Not just Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, but also Fei Yao, Ling Baihua and the other five - in this catastrophe, they had all been shattered into dust with not a single trace left in this cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hid in the "second dimension" space, not rashly going out but only quietly observing the surroundings: Most matter had been swept away by the particle deluge. Affected by the explosion, the particle flow was surrounded by a cloud of dust too fine for the naked eye, spraying outwards in all directions...</p><p></p><p>That was the situation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the surroundings were empty void with only distant starlight twinkling densely in the deep space.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao really wanted to curse out loud, but just couldn't bring himself to do it.</p><p></p><p>One reason was to conserve energy, the other was that no one would hear it anyway.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the space tens of thousands of light years around, he was the only living being left.</p><p></p><p>This was truly...a novel experience.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Su Hao could no longer hold back and silently mouthed a curse: "Fuck!"</p>

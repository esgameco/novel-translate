        <h1>Chapter 764</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Faced with the doubts of Yashan and Fengcheng, Su Hao did not give much explanation, only asking them to each send out a spiritual clone to go to the Coiled Snake Nebula.</p><p></p><p>Yashan took the initiative to say: "Master Wei, there is also the Cotton Nebula 700 million light years further away, an irregular galaxy. Why don't I conveniently send out another clone to advance towards the Cotton Nebula?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not hesitate: "Since that's the case, we can send out a few more clones to go to the galaxies neighboring the Vortex Nebula. At most it will take over 4,000 years to arrive!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng obviously understood Su Hao's desire to explore and were also full of longing for it. </p><p></p><p>They seemed very excited: "Good, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After arranging this matter, Su Hao turned his attention back to the present.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, in order to study how consciousness and spiritual power match with the brain, Su Hao had recorded the consciousness information of over a thousand prisoners.  </p><p></p><p>The vast majority had their consciousness 'programs' messed up by Su Hao, becoming disordered. Even if uploaded into a normal human brain, they could not produce self-will, only some corpse-like beings acting on instinct.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few lucky ones whose consciousness was preserved, experiencing new sensations over and over again.</p><p></p><p>These consciousnesses that didn't get messed up were often the kind that successful traversers must possess.</p><p></p><p>When the lucky ones woke up again from their slumber, the first thing they curiously wondered was what kind of 'thing' they would become this time!</p><p></p><p>"What will I become this time? A compound eye race, an eight-armed race, or an insect queen? Or maybe become an ethereal consciousness without any sensations. In any case, this is a novel experience, really looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>"I've thought countless times that my mind was problematic, that I was going insane, but in the end I didn't go crazy after all, haha! I really am incredible."</p><p></p><p>"Same here, I always felt like a part of my psyche had been split off. The depths of my consciousness kept telling me 'you're crazy' 'you must be crazy', but miraculously, I became even more lucid than before, unbelievable."  </p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why does this feeling seem so familiar now? What have I become this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Human?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, human, you actually became human?"</p><p></p><p>"Never thought I'd have a day where I became human again, I'm so excited I'm laughing loudly and shedding tears of joy."</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, I feel that all my senses have become even better. Is this my hidden talent? Or is there some other reason causing it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not just you, I'm the same. I feel my mind is extremely clear, I speak more fluently, my thinking has become much sharper. Could it be that we've become the legendary high-IQ children?"</p><p></p><p>"High-IQ death row inmates, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I can clearly sense the differences in myself, it's as if...I'm a super genius. Is this an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how smart, I still can't figure out how Xu Shiqiang managed to do this. He's really an enigmatic person. I'm so curious, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare to have designs on Xu Shiqiang and you say you're not crazy?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Hao, who was checking the consciousness information of these prisoners in the Pinball Space, unconsciously revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The brain constructed from spiritual power has successfully allowed the consciousness information to operate normally. After years of research, I've finally obtained a satisfactory result."</p><p></p><p>According to Su Hao's estimation, the spiritually constructed brain could theoretically make up for the 'defect' of the human brain being unable to update itself. While preserving consciousness and memory, it could update the spiritual brain block by block to keep it absolutely fresh and vigorous, while ensuring the brain's learning ability...</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, its usable lifespan - as long as it is diligently updated, theoretically it could be used indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the eternal life that Su Hao pursued may have already been achieved.</p><p></p><p>So the pressing problem facing him now was: "How to transfer from the current brain to the spiritual brain?"</p><p></p><p>This seemingly simple problem stumped Su Hao, leaving him at a loss on how to proceed.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple:</p><p></p><p>But the moment his consciousness information left this physical brain, his consciousness stopped, unable to do anything more.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he would also instantly lose his connection to this world, drifting away with the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>His only connection to this world was through Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>And the only ones who could help him complete the transfer of his consciousness into the spiritual brain were Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Su Hao was willing to grant them a certain level of access, they could complete this step.</p><p></p><p>Was Su Hao willing to grant them that level of access?</p><p></p><p>For Su Hao, granting Yashan and Fengcheng that kind of access was tantamount to entrusting everything he had to his 'trust' in them.</p><p></p><p>If he made even the slightest mistake, his entire existence could become nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Trust is possible, but there needs to be a bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Unconditional trust will inevitably end up being terminated by that very trust.</p><p></p><p>On this fundamental issue, Su Hao never let his guard down from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>As powerful as he was now, he had not forgotten a single bit of the hardships he had experienced in the past.</p><p></p><p>Human nature can change when faced with challenges.</p><p></p><p>He had profound experience with this.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Let me try using 'Little Light's' autopilot program to complete this task first. But there's no rush, I still have an extremely long lifespan to spend. I'll try switching to the spiritual brain after my physical brain can no longer withstand decay. Even if I fail, it's no great loss - I can just wait for the next reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the prisoners who woke up from their slumber all died from physical dysfunction and decay.</p><p></p><p>Before dying, they all lamented the brevity of this awakening.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'm going to fall asleep again, just don't know what form I'll take when I wake up next time."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe Xu Shiqiang will turn me into an eagle that can spread its wings and fly."</p><p></p><p>"Dream on! The things Xu Shiqiang likes are all those with weird aesthetics, like tentacle monsters, insects, mushroom heads..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah~ I'm going to sleep too, this damn short awakening."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After completing this experiment, Su Hao originally intended to directly delete these bizarre consciousnesses, but then thought that perhaps they might still be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>So he just casually set them aside, setting up an autopilot program. If these consciousnesses were not needed for experiments within a hundred years, they would be permanently deleted to avoid accidents. If needed, he could record new experimental consciousness subjects.</p><p></p><p>Having completed the spiritual brain experiment, Su Hao had basically absorbed all the knowledge of this world, and his own abilities had greatly expanded - he could be said to have transformed from a planetary being to the current galactic being.</p><p></p><p>He could now come and go freely within a galaxy.</p><p></p><p>But the inevitable slow development phase had arrived.  </p><p></p><p>This world no longer had any new knowledge that could cause Su Hao's current ability system to undergo explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that in the next hundreds or thousands of years, what he could do was to deeply integrate and develop the knowledge he had learned, obtaining more complete and comprehensive abilities.</p><p></p><p>It was like having swallowed a lot of technology into his belly, but still needing an extremely long time to digest it and make it part of his body.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, Su Hao naturally turned his gaze towards the deeper reaches of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the other galaxies are like? Will they have life and civilizations?"</p><p></p><p>As long as Su Hao could enter an unfamiliar galaxy, he could quickly grasp its basic situation through the 'Planetary Network', whether it had civilizations or not, at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could open up the passages between galaxies on the 'Planetary Network'. Then I could quickly lock onto galaxies with civilizations and teleport over, saving a lot of time. The time it takes to traverse galaxies now is too long."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Su Hao couldn't help but laugh at himself: "Indeed, people are never satisfied. Before, I thought being able to sense an entire galaxy was already far beyond imagination. Now that I've truly reached this level, I feel the sensory range is too small instead..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that even if I can freely traverse galaxies in the future, I'll still want to go even further?"</p>

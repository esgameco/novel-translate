        <h1>Chapter 972</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Lü Yijiang's sparring lasted about an hour.</p><p></p><p>The result was that Lü Yijiang's attacks could not break through Suhao's defense, while Suhao just lightly tapped him and Lü Yijiang felt unwell all over, until eventually he could not continue fighting, so they stopped.</p><p></p><p>Everyone returned to a tea house in a small town and began chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the recent battle, Lü Yijiang asked with a puzzled look: "Mr. Jia, what was that invisible shield around your body? It was completely different from our qi, and no matter what method I used, I couldn't break through its defense. Instead, it made my hands ache from the impact."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "This is the brittle shell defense I developed. It's very adept at defending against force impacts, but the defensive power of the brittle shell is not invincible. Under your attacks, it would quickly shatter. The reason you couldn't break through is because while you were attacking, I was constantly replenishing and maintaining it.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, you could shatter my brittle shell defense with three strikes, but by the time of your second attack, I had already replaced it with a new layer of defense. So, if your attack power and speed exceeded my speed of maintaining the defense, with your strength you could break through my defense."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang realized: "I see, I really am still too weak. I couldn't defeat the Anming King, nor could I break through your defense!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Your strength is already very powerful. To be honest, apart from the Anming King you mentioned, you are one of the strongest beings I've encountered in over ten thousand years. Don't be so modest."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang scratched his head: "In the end, I still can't defeat the Anming King. I must defeat him to stop his wanton killing of mortals."</p><p></p><p>The detail Lü Yijiang missed was noticed by Gao Qi, who asked in confusion: "Wait, did you just say...over ten thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "Yes, about twenty thousand years, though I haven't kept an exact count. It's been a long time regardless."</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Lü Yijiang and the others reacted to what Suhao meant, their eyes nearly popping out in disbelief: "What? Almost twenty thousand years old? You must be joking!"</p><p></p><p>They even turned to look at Cong Renfei for confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed: "I don't know, since I'm only over eight thousand years old myself."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang and the others: "!!"</p><p></p><p>The three were dumbstruck, initially unwilling to believe it was true.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng's eyes bulged: "Can humans really live that long?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shook his head: "Probably not for ordinary people! But we are 'immortals', different from common people, so it's normal for us to live much longer."</p><p></p><p>They didn't want to believe it, but judging from Suhao and the others' expressions, they didn't seem to be lying.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't care whether they believed him or not, and said directly: "I'm very interested in this 'qi' of the martial arts practitioners. Can you teach me how to cultivate it? In exchange, I can teach you anything you want to learn."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang nodded: "Of course, if you want to cultivate, I can guide you through the basics. But how far you can go depends on your own efforts."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi whispered to Tai Cheng: "Didn't they just say they are martial arts practitioners? Why do they still need us to teach them?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng shook his head: "I'm not sure, maybe they practice different martial arts sects? Like the 'Longevity Sect'."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "Okay. So what would you like to learn?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked: "Mr. Jia, what areas of knowledge do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao stroked his chin: "Quite a few - some technology, physical enhancements, genetic talents, immortal cultivation, spatial transportation, rune formations, traversing the stars, astrology, luck/misfortune arts, soul possession, creating objects from nothing, mechanical constructs, using various types of energy, mental abilities, and so on. I can probably teach you some of whatever you're interested in.</p><p></p><p>However, some of this knowledge is not that easy to learn and requires certain prerequisites. Just let me know your interests first, and I'll see how to instruct you. It shouldn't be a major problem."</p><p></p><p>"Whew--" Not just Lü Yijiang and the others, even Cong Renfei gasped. This was barely distinguishable from being all-knowing and all-powerful. They had speculated before whether Master Wei was a divinely enlightened being, and now he had admitted it himself - solid proof.</p><p></p><p>While Lü Yijiang and the others didn't understand most of it, the parts they did understand already seemed inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Things like immortal cultivation, spatial transportation, traversing the stars, luck/misfortune arts, soul possession, creating objects from nothing - they understood those.</p><p></p><p>Each of those seemed like a miraculous skill to them, existing only in fantasy rather than reality.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, someone was telling them these miraculous skills could actually be learned.</p><p></p><p>With so many choices, Lü Yijiang and the others hesitated, feeling that choosing any one path was neither a gain nor a loss.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Don't rush, take your time deciding and let me know."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi still felt this whole situation was fantastical, though he didn't know what 'fantastical' meant...</p><p></p><p>He asked uncertainly: "Can we really learn anything?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "Anything, though some conditions are needed. But the issues can all be resolved if you cooperate."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang suddenly said: "I'll learn immortal cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Though Gao Qi also wanted to learn that, he still asked Lü Yijiang: "Yijiang, are you afraid of death?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang laughed: "If I live longer, won't I have more time to cultivate and grow stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi agreed: "An unassailable reason."</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "Immortal cultivation can indeed extend your lifespan, but it doesn't necessarily make your martial arts stronger."</p><p></p><p>Lü Yijiang looked surprised: "Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "I'm just not certain yet. What I said may not be accurate, so I need to confirm it first."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked: "How will you confirm it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Let me examine your bodies first."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Through communicating with Lü Yijiang, Gao Qi and the others, Suhao gained a general understanding of what these martial arts practitioners were about in this world.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the 'qi' they referred to should be called 'yuan qi' in full.</p><p></p><p>In the view of martial artists, humans are born containing 'yuan qi', and all things in nature have yuan qi - it is almost ubiquitous in the universe. Even the tiniest insect or a massive star has its own unique yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>What martial artists aim to do is expand their own yuan qi, temper their bodies, then build a bridge to connect with the yuan qi present throughout nature and the universe. They fuse with the omnipresent yuan qi, constantly breaking through their own limits, until finally reaching the stage of complete integration between physical body and yuan qi - becoming a veteran martial artist.</p><p></p><p>This process requires cultivating one's conduct, heart, and closeness to nature.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, the martial artists' cultivation is a process of unifying body, mind and heaven.</p><p></p><p>It places extremely high demands on the practitioner's physical body and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Innate talent alone can prevent someone filled with aspiration from ever entering the path.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these are just the views of the martial artists in this world. Suhao didn't know if it was truly like that, because he never let such profound and mystical cultivation methods cloud his perspective.</p><p></p><p>He believed that no matter how abstruse the skills and abilities, their essence could never escape two factors: the 'form of consciousness' and the 'material structure'.</p><p></p><p>As long as he solved those two aspects, there were few things he could not manifest.</p><p></p><p>As for their so-called cultivation, it only served as a reference point for him.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists' cultivation methods were applicable to this world, and had been summarized by them as viable ways to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>But they were not necessarily optimal.</p><p></p><p>"If it takes more than a few days to cultivate to the pinnacle even with the right form of consciousness, how can it be considered a good method?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao believed that as long as he researched the essence of yuan qi, someone with a matching consciousness could reach Lü Yijiang's level in five days at most.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao's research into yuan qi proceeded from two angles: studying the consciousness form required by martial artists, and examining the material structure of yuan qi itself.</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked on with satisfaction at Lü Yijiang and the others: "It's time to research a new system of knowledge again, it's been too long. I wonder what insights I'll gain this time?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 540</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Actually, Su Hao had not met Gu Lan many times, but for some reason, Su Hao was convinced that Gu Lan was the type of person whose eyes lit up at the sight of money.</p><p></p><p>He exuded an aura of 'no money, no energy' and 'acting like a big shot when having money'.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Su Hao had long stopped caring about money.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Lan helped Su Hao calculate clearly: "Twenty high-quality source pearls, ten thousand yuan each, two hundred thousand yuan in total. Twenty low-quality source pearls, one hundred yuan each, two thousand yuan in total. So, you can get two hundred and two thousand yuan. The association charges a five percent handling fee, which is ten thousand one hundred yuan. I'll give you one hundred and ninety-one thousand nine hundred yuan...Zi Yang, you've struck it rich!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Give me one hundred and ninety-one thousand, and keep the nine hundred as a tip for you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Lan became excited: "Really...really? That's great! With this, I can afford Awang's family heirloom whitening cream! But Zi Yang, do you want a cash voucher or cash? I can get you the voucher right away, but cash may take a few days."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked curiously: "What's a cash voucher?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Lan explained: "It's a special voucher used by the Source Masters Association. You just need to take the cash voucher, and you can exchange it for cash at any Source Masters Association hall, very convenient."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Then give me the cash voucher!"</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of being cheated. Anyone who tried to cheat him would face his retaliation, and he might even get more money out of it.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao pocketed the special voucher, he asked directly: "Where's your aunt?"</p><p></p><p>Actually, he knew Gu Yin was upstairs, but he gave a polite heads-up first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lan cleared his throat and said seriously: "You mean President Gu Yin? Wait, let me ask her."</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the tip, she was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Then she picked up a phone-like device and dialed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Lan hung up and said: "President Gu Yin is in her office on the fifth floor. She said you can just go up and find her!"</p><p></p><p>After thanking her, Su Hao went up the stairs to the fifth floor and knocked on the door.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Yin saw Su Hao, she smiled inexplicably: "I didn't expect our talented Zi Yang to be such a fearless person. You've only been an awakened Source Master for half a year, yet you dare to boldly participate in an ominous mission. How should I evaluate you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "President Gu Yin is mistaken. I'm actually very timid and wouldn't seek death myself. I just got lucky!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin said: "You were indeed lucky, probably using up all your luck for this lifetime. You won't be so fortunate next time. Take my advice, don't participate in any ominous disasters before you're certified as an intermediate-level master. You can take on natural disasters and source beast disasters instead."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "We'll see."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin continued: "For this ominous disaster, only your squad and the Bao Lei squad from Huai Shui Town participated. You're all a bunch of fearless youngsters! Other squads avoided this ominous disaster like the plague, but you guys insisted on getting involved. If everyone is like this, in two years when all the masters in Huai Shui Town are dead, we can just abolish the Huai Shui number."</p><p></p><p>As the president of Huai Shui Town, Gu Yin was very troubled by these hot-blooded young men.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, she hoped her subordinate masters would actively take on missions and clear various disasters in the vicinity. On the other hand, she didn't want them to participate in overly dangerous missions. If everyone died, she would be a lone president with no subordinates, utterly useless.</p><p></p><p>More than a year ago, during that illusion-type source beast incident, Huai Shui Town lost twenty masters. Over the past year, participating in various missions also gradually depleted three more. Just the other day, two more promising young men died...</p><p></p><p>The attrition rate far exceeded the awakening replenishment rate! How could this go on?</p><p></p><p>The more experienced masters didn't need to worry, as those old hands knew what was at stake and valued their lives above all else. But Gu Yin was concerned about these inexperienced youngsters, who were all promising seedlings but acted recklessly without considering the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin let out a long sigh: "Speak up, what did you come to see me for? Did you encounter any problems in your cultivation? Tell me."</p><p></p><p>"There's no major problem with my cultivation. It's just that I participated in this ominous disaster and had some doubts. I wanted to consult President Gu Yin and borrow some books about disasters from you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin laughed heartily: "Haha, not many people are interested in reading books these days! No problem, you can borrow whatever you want. But I'm not a big reader myself, so I don't have many books. If you like, I can call a friend to send you some from Xin Ji City."</p><p></p><p>Xin Ji City was the largest united trade metropolis in this world, extremely prosperous. Many people believed that all commodities in this world could be purchased from Xin Ji City.</p><p></p><p>Under the facilitation of the Source Masters Association, the eighteen major empires that were once independent held a round table conference in Xin Ji City and decided to form a unified economic union called the Eighteen Empire Alliance, achieving a certain degree of unification that had lasted for nearly a thousand years of peace.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen empires were now called eighteen districts, and the Huai Shui Town where Su Hao resided was within the Heng Xuan District, conveniently not too far from the world-class metropolis of Xin Ji City, just a phone call away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Although I'm very grateful to President Gu Yin, I have to say that sending just a few books may not be enough. You might as well move the entire Xin Ji City library here."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin burst into hearty laughter, clearly amused by Su Hao's ambitious 'joke'. At the same time, she envied the youthful vigor and boundless energy of the young.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't know that Su Hao wasn't joking with her. He really did want to move the entire library of Xin Ji City.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao raised some of his doubts, and Gu Yin answered them in detail without holding back any secret techniques. Finally, she took Su Hao to her study and opened up her modest book collection: "There aren't many books here, but you can borrow any you like."</p><p></p><p>Then she showed her teeth in a hearty laugh, her muscles trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>She could see that Su Hao was genuinely curious about everything around him. This scholar-like thirst for knowledge made her unable to refuse him.</p><p></p><p>Through a few interactions, she had a strange feeling about Su Hao: this young man would become an extraordinary Source Master.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao truly felt Gu Yin's favoritism towards him, treating him like her own disciple. This feeling was very familiar to him.</p><p></p><p>After recording all the books, Su Hao expressed his heartfelt gratitude and said he would be happy to help if needed in the future.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Su Hao thought for a moment and asked: "President Gu Yin, I designed a special large-scale machine that requires high precision for manufacturing pill refinement. I only have the blueprints but not the manufacturing technology. Do you know where I can get it customized?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin asked curiously: "A large-scale machine for refining pills? How big is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gestured: "When fully assembled, it would probably fit in a factory about ten meters by ten meters."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin had an expression of 'you're talking nonsense so seriously that I almost believed you'. In any case, she couldn't understand what was going on in the minds of these young people these days. It wasn't like this when she was young!</p><p></p><p>"Take this letter with the association's seal, and it should save you a lot of trouble. Go to the address on it! Oh, and do you have money?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "I just exchanged two hundred thousand yuan with source pearls."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin guffawed: "What can two hundred thousand do? Save up more first! Oh, I almost forgot, your squad still has a share of high-quality source pearls that haven't been distributed - one thousand pearls, which is ten million yuan. The Huai Shui Town association takes a thirty percent cut, three million, deducting fees. Your squad should get over six million. Counting your share, you probably have at least two million!</p><p></p><p>Tsk tsk tsk, becoming a millionaire at such a young age. But unfortunately, this amount is still far from enough to customize a large-scale machine."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's mouth twitched: "The association takes thirty percent? That's too much!"</p><p></p><p>Even after experiencing so many worlds, he had rarely seen such a steep cut.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin said nonchalantly: "Hey! That's the association's convention! How can we support such a large association without taking a cut? You can say that to me, but don't go around spouting it outside, or you'll cause trouble."</p>

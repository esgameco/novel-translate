        <h1>Chapter 825</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Winged and Barry's eyes filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They could see the headless man in the distance through the smog that was subsiding, still able to move.</p><p></p><p>This kind of scene still seemed very strange to them, the gods.</p><p></p><p>Because although deities are powerful and immortal, they can still change a body anytime, anywhere, but without a head, they will instantly lose control of their body, and definitely can't be like this person in front of them, they still have to touch their own head to check if the head is still there or not.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, it is outrageous.</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold-Barry couldn't help but ask, "Eternal, what the hell is this?"</p><p></p><p>Winged World glanced at him, not bothering with him. Asking this as if she understood.</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi didn't hesitate too much when she saw Su Hao's body abnormality, casually launching out a palm, a large amount of purple rays enveloped Su Hao's body.</p><p></p><p>She intended to completely destroy this body to prevent future problems. After seeing the rays smoothly and unhindered pass through that body, her heart was once again relieved, "The attack worked ...... not right!"</p><p></p><p>All the purple rays passed through the body, but did not explode the body into smithereens as expected, but as if they had passed through the air, and without stopping, disappeared into the spatial barrier not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>She realized something and immediately stacked layers of defense behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A large amount of purple light blasted behind her, causing her to resist being thrown forward.</p><p></p><p>Barry reacted extremely quickly, dodging forward to catch Forever.</p><p></p><p>After the two stopped, they immediately looked at the body in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Ka ka ka ka~"</p><p></p><p>A sound of colliding crystals rang out, and a large amount of pink crystals were seen emerging from the neck of that body, forming the shape of a head.</p><p></p><p>In just the blink of an eye, the crystals receded, and a large, round head with hair, as well as a handsome and compelling face, suddenly appeared before the two deities.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the two deities were a little numb, having lived for an unknown number of years, what kind of scene hadn't they seen? They had never seen such a scene.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he saw this person named Jia Wei, touching his newborn head with his hand, and said in an extremely distraught tone, ''The two of you are really powerful, you were actually able to break through my defenses and blow my head off, just now my head must have been gone, right? This kind of image is really bloody to the extreme. In the face of a deity, an ounce of carelessness won't do."</p><p></p><p>The two deities could not utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "To be honest, it's really inconvenient to have no eyes or ears, and no mouth to speak with."</p><p></p><p>Barry couldn't resist the curiosity in his heart and asked, "This doesn't even kill you, what kind of ability is this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's head suddenly split from side to side, displaying it in front of the two deities, "Of course it's because there's nothing left in my head, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi and Barry: "......"</p><p></p><p>How T-fucking outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao merged his heads together with a playful expression and said, "Well, that's it, business is next."</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi and Barry were like enemies, their whole body was covered with all kinds of defenses all of a sudden, ready to meet the upcoming attack.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Su Hao slowly raise his right hand, then snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Snap~"</p><p></p><p>The crisp sound of ringing fingers reached the ears of the two deities, and while they were uncertain, a crunching sound like fried beans came from their entire body.</p><p></p><p>"Ka-pa-pa~"</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by an unspeakably intense pain, the whole body lost its power to support itself and fell softly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>They examined themselves slightly and realized that the bones in their entire body had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi and Barry's hearts were shaken, "How is it possible ...... that with just a ring of the finger, we were rendered incapacitated through heavy defenses, how did this happen?"</p><p></p><p>The two deities hadn't completely collapsed to the ground when Su Hao, at some point, had already appeared behind them, opening his hands and grabbing the two men's heads left and right.</p><p></p><p>"What ......"</p><p></p><p>Before they had time to think about when Su Hao had appeared behind them, they felt a surge of warmth rush into their brains.</p><p></p><p>A thought popped up in Yong Shi and Barry, "Is he going to destroy my brain and kill me completely? No, his purpose is to be informed of the secrets of the gods, then he grabbed our heads, which is to ...... search our souls! Not good, we must immediately detach from the body!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, both of them subconsciously converge their whole body's soul power, wrapping their wills, and fiercely scurrying out from the top of their heads, a purple and a gold two light mists like snakes circling in midair, but unable to break away from this space.</p><p></p><p>It was also precisely at this time that Su Hao completed the record.</p><p></p><p>He let go and the two bodies collapsed one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Bang Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao tilted his head and looked at the two rays of light flying in mid-air and asked curiously, "Is this your souls going out of body?"</p><p></p><p>He checked the results of the two people's consciousness information records within the pinball space, and found that a large amount of information was indeed recorded in the small black room, but it wasn't the same structure as other consciousness information, and it wasn't in a state of motion like normal consciousness information, as if it was a dead thing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also encountered this situation for the first time, but for what reason, there was also some speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because, before completely recording the consciousness information, the consciousness of these two deities detached from their bodies, causing the recording to fail. And incomplete consciousness information will only be recorded in the pinball space without forming the same frequency as the pinball space."</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao had already recorded a large amount of consciousness information, and even if he couldn't record it completely, it was enough for him to use to decipher some basic information.</p><p></p><p>It actually didn't matter if he failed this time, Su Hao had plenty of time to study it slowly, and in this world, there were also deities that could provide him with what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just casually asked, he didn't expect the purple light snake floating in mid-air to actually answer Su Hao: "You can understand it as out-of-body, but it's much more advanced than out-of-body, this is the unique ability of our gods, you mortals can only look up to it even if you're strong."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the voice and tone, this was the God of Darkness - Eternal.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just smiled, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi asked, "What were you planning to do just now? Perform a soul search on us?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "It's similar to soul searching, since you guys aren't willing to tell me, then I can still use soul searching to get the information I want."</p><p></p><p>Barry marveled, "Javi, are you really not a deity? It's unimaginable that you, a mere mortal, have such abilities, even more powerful than a deity."</p><p></p><p>Eternal was dissatisfied, "Barry, why are you fueling the enemy's might? The might of a deity is beyond the comprehension of mortals!"</p><p></p><p>Barry said awkwardly, "Aha, it went by the tongue."</p><p></p><p>Then Yong Shi said to Su Hao, "Jia Wei, your soul search method is indeed feasible, but unfortunately, you won't get another chance. As Barry said, you are indeed very powerful, but compared to the complete power of a deity, it is still not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>You have to realize that the God of Darkness and the God of Gold that appear before you now are nothing more than a weak sub-will."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised, "Huh? You guys are actually just sub-wills? I thought it was the gods themselves."</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi asked again, "Javi, I'll ask you two last questions. Are you a red and gold dragon? Did your abilities originate from the awakening of the legendary super mutant Red Gold Gargoyle?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "That's right, I am the Red Gold Giant Dragon, and my ability is called 'Hundred Shots'."</p><p></p><p>Barry marveled once again, "I actually saw a legendary creature, it's really powerful."</p><p></p><p>Eternal seemed to sigh, then said, "Javi, if you were a deity, you might still be a friend, but it's very unfortunate that you and I aren't the same kind of creatures, so goodbye!"</p><p></p><p>She turned her head to Barry and said, "Barry, we are just a split will, do you understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>Barry nodded silently, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the eternal purple serpent of light dissolved from within, gradually drifting away as if it had turned into wind sand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Barry turned his head to Su Hao, "This is the method we use to dissipate the sub-will, known as 'Soul Dissolution', and we deities have an agreement with each other that we can't disclose each other's secrets to non-deity mortals. Therefore, the secrets you want to know about the deities are impossible. And ...... forget it, goodbye!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Barry's golden serpent of light also dissolved from within, turning into dots of golden light and drifting away.</p><p></p><p>The process of the two deities drifting away was something that Su Hao simply didn't know how to stop, nor could he stop it at all.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, ''It's a pity that the two good experimental subjects were lost. Luckily, most of their consciousness information has already been recorded successfully, so we can try to have Little Light crack it out."</p><p></p><p>Through a conversation just now, Su Hao understood that the secrets of their so-called deities were the things that the deities were most reluctant to mention.</p><p></p><p>And generally speaking, the things that were the least willing to mention and intentionally hidden were instead the ones that were remembered the most deeply.</p><p></p><p>With such information, Su Hao believed that he would definitely be able to find clues in that part of the recorded information.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what the hell a deity is!"</p><p></p><p>　Dali Bao's daily update is only three chapters, that's because he can only write three chapters per day ~ there is absolutely no stockpile. But the recent big rewards from Au Au Au Au, HACCT, Pachouqiu, and Europe 56 made Dilipo fight chicken blood and liver out 5 chapters...</p><p></p><p></p>

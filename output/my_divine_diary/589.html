        <h1>Chapter 589</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng, who were in charge of two cities, quickly resolved the battles as well.</p><p></p><p>The method Yashan used was to first activate the suppressor, restraining the abilities of all source mages. Then he openly stood in the center of the royal palace, using the Transformative Vajra Armor to surround the entire palace. He activated his 'Lightning Flame Domain', paralyzing everyone to the ground. Finally, he used the piercing attacks of the Transformative Vajra Armor to kill them all by impaling them into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then he buried the entire royal palace.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's method was much simpler.</p><p></p><p>After activating the suppressor, he directly threw down a 'Ten Thousand Explosion' bomb, clapped his hands and left.</p><p></p><p>Where the royal palace originally stood, there was only an enormously huge pit left - whether it was buried or not didn't make much difference.</p><p></p><p>In general, after experiencing the asteroid deflection incident in the previous world, Fengcheng became obsessed with the massive and round Ten Thousand Explosion bomb. In his view, true power should be like this - huge and round!</p><p></p><p>However, in this surprise attack, the Glorious Church still seized the initiative. The number of teams that successfully completed the clearing mission was far greater than the number of teams that encountered various accidents and failed the clearing mission.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng had also made preparations in advance for some teams failing their missions. Upon receiving news of mission failures, he immediately redeployed several teams that had completed their tasks to form a stronger squad, using transit spheres to continue the clearing missions.</p><p></p><p>In just one night, the vast Hengxuan region's royal families - the rulers of the extremely powerful 'Hengxuan Empire' a thousand years ago who had enjoyed the blessings of their ancestors for over 1,200 years - were nearly wiped out.</p><p></p><p>This was simply horrifying to hear.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, all kinds of messy news spread throughout the entire world.</p><p></p><p>The whole world was in an uproar, whether it was the Source Mage Association, the royal families of the other seventeen major regions, or even ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Many people were afraid!</p><p></p><p>This was an unprecedented change in a thousand years. No one knew if they would become a sacrifice in the ensuing chaos.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also many people who were indifferent and didn't care about matters that didn't concern them.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how the outside world discussed it, it did not affect Suhao's next plan.</p><p></p><p>"The first step of clearing the Hengxuan region's royal families has been achieved. Next is the second step - giving the Source Mage Association enough time to prepare, and then directly annihilating the Source Mage Association's forces all at once!</p><p></p><p>Since we want to demonstrate our power, we should do it thoroughly! Beat them until they are too afraid to have any thoughts of resistance.</p><p></p><p>If they still want to resist, then we will continue to crush all resisting forces one by one.</p><p></p><p>Strive to reach a cooperation with the Mage Association within a year."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled and said, "I'll give Zhipeng a breakdown of the tasks right away. Let him issue a formal declaration of war to the 'Eighteen Empire Alliance' and the Mage Association, clearly expressing our demands. Otherwise, I'm afraid those higher-ups have too low sensitivity to war and don't understand our intentions.</p><p></p><p>After all, this world hasn't had a war for over a thousand years. Perhaps they have forgotten the fundamental purpose of war - to fight for the sake of fighting."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "That's true, it's best to directly state our demands. Let the Association amend that rule of 'maintaining the orthodox rule of the royal families'. Make it clear that the Glorious Church only targets all royal families, not the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Mage Association insists on protecting the royal families, then let them try to organize forces to resist the Glorious Church. After a few attempts, problems will arise within their organization, and soon they will abandon the royal families."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed and said, "Leave it to me, Old Master Wei! I'm familiar with this kind of thing. Moreover, my research project is nearing completion now. It's perfect to spend six hours a day on research.</p><p></p><p>I also want to try out the various 'source conversion vectors' I've analyzed during this period, especially Lada's ability - it's very interesting. I now have some preliminary results and want to go out and experiment more."</p><p></p><p>Suhao also smiled, "Alright, I can absorb the research results from these past few years. Maybe there will be some new gains."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng sidled up to Yashan, looking eager, "Big Brother Yashan, take me with you! I'm a pro with the Ten Thousand Explosion, one bomb per target."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "It's really a waste that you didn't awaken as an Explosion Source Mage."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said matter-of-factly, "Doing housework is my main job! Throwing bombs is just my side job. Being a 'Divine Source Mage' suits me better."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Since the matter was left to Yashan, there shouldn't be much of a problem!</p><p></p><p>Because the current Yashan already had a 'goal-oriented' mindset. Although Yashan's process of doing things still had some shortcomings, he could pursue set goals like Suhao, flexibly adapting in the course of events and constantly adjusting until the predetermined goals were achieved.</p><p></p><p>So now, Suhao only needed to tell Yashan what he wanted, and Yashan would usually be able to give Suhao the corresponding results after a period of time.</p><p></p><p>This kind of mindset was very rare and not something everyone had. Many people muddle through life, and in the end, they don't understand what they really want from their short lives.</p><p></p><p>After going around in circles for most of their lives, they find they have nothing, eventually fading away from the world. When they grow old, they sit under a tree alone, boasting about their past fantasies.</p><p></p><p>As for Fengcheng, although he could also complete assigned tasks, he was far from having a 'goal-oriented' mindset. Mainly because his foundational knowledge was too lacking, his thinking and mindset were very limited. Many things that should be obvious still required him to ponder and struggle without finding the answer.</p><p></p><p>The current Fengcheng was stuck on 'philosophy'.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need to rush. With enough time for cultivation, he could become talented in one or two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>For now, just let Fengcheng run errands for him and Yashan.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had the desire to improve, with enough time he would eventually succeed.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this gap, he pulled up Yashan's research results from the past few years and carefully examined them.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's research in recent years mainly focused on the 'conversion of spiritual power into sources' and the 'direction of source conversion'. He initially only researched the changes in his own elemental system.</p><p></p><p>After achieving some results, he began researching the 'influence of spiritual qualities on source conversion' proposed by Suhao. With the unconditional cooperation of Zhipeng's friends, he quickly found the 'spiritual frequency' that controlled sources.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the elemental system, he successfully modeled various source abilities for the elemental and energy systems, finding specific patterns. He could simulate about 70-80% of the abilities, if not perfectly.</p><p></p><p>It was only when researching the illusion system that he encountered some stagnation, as he could not find any patterns for illusion system abilities.</p><p></p><p>He would collect data from one illusion system mage, and research to obtain one ability. A formula for the illusion system? There was none...</p><p></p><p>Both Suhao and Yashan believed that even the illusion system must have patterns, it was just too complex - perhaps like the relationship between integers and irrational numbers?</p><p></p><p>In ten days, Suhao absorbed all of Yashan's research results from the past few years and verified them from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>"Overall there's no problem, some minor flaws are inconsequential...but it should be possible to optimize it further, to allow the source abilities to exert even stronger effects."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's research focused on 'simulation', but Suhao would not be satisfied with just that.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was not only 'simulation', but to 'surpass' it!</p><p></p><p>"Yashan's restoration work is well done. He also summarized the correct formulas based on the data. However, these formulas are too rigid, unable to flexibly adjust the desired abilities and corresponding strengths at will.</p><p></p><p>The app he designed allows you to enter keywords for whatever ability you want, search for the specific ability, and then apply it to the formula.</p><p></p><p>But this is too troublesome. The 'action cost' of using abilities is too high, I'm afraid I'd be too lazy to even use them..."</p><p></p><p>This was like a boss choosing a street-front store to open a shop. If he chose one with steps, it would inadvertently lose some customers.</p><p></p><p>In theory, for every additional step, it increases the physical effort cost for customers to enter by one percent, so customers would subconsciously not want to go in, and business would suffer.</p><p></p><p>Suhao felt the same way - his requirements for abilities were 'flexibility, speed, and conciseness'. If these requirements were not met, no matter how powerful the ability, he would be too lazy to use it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>"So I need to break down the 'source conversion vectors' that Yashan simulated into even smaller components, find the specific combination patterns and methods, and turn it into a kind of 'language'. Through the combination of 'words', it can express specific meanings, just like the relationship between 'basic runes' and rune arrays!"</p><p></p><p>No sooner thought than done.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching a cooperation with the Mage Association that would allow them to help collect real-time data, Suhao's 'source system' research was bound to make little progress.</p>

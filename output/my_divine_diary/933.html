        <h1>Chapter 933</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The study of warp lines would be Su Hao's topic for a very long time to come. </p><p></p><p>In any case, it was not something that could be figured out in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>He himself was not sure how long it would take specifically, perhaps a thousand years, perhaps ten thousand years, or even possibly reaching a million years.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, he was not in a hurry to study it. Since he had cracked the secret of the ill-fated system, it could be said that there were not many things in the universe that could threaten his life.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the various disasters that had been chasing after him before had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the dangerous situations where he constantly faced death and the risk of long periods of hibernation had also become things of the past.</p><p></p><p>Being able to enjoy some leisure time now, he was naturally extremely happy, as this was something he had been sorely lacking on his journey.</p><p></p><p>Going to school to teach and guide students was also a relatively interesting way for him to relax. Who knows, he might even be able to use the powerful imagination and unique thinking abilities of genius students to help him solve problems.</p><p></p><p>Killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>However, the specifics still depended on how well Yashan and Fengcheng's schools were run.</p><p></p><p>If they turned into chicken universities, he had no interest in teaching a bunch of students just idling about.</p><p></p><p>Although he could help students improve their intelligence, what was the use of improving one person's intelligence?</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was the kind of 'original flavor' genius that occurred naturally. What he wanted was to interact with geniuses who had unique ways of thinking.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, a group of ordinary people whose intelligence was enhanced by soul brains was not worth even one original genius.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the Blue-Purple Planet.</p><p></p><p>After going through a period of excitement, the emotions of the two groups of forty disciples in total became a bit low.</p><p></p><p>After reading the history books, they found that more than six hundred years had passed since the time period they had time traveled from.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they had come to the future six hundred years later, while they were people from six hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>From the history books and the internet, they found some simple data on the events from more than six hundred years ago: that night, more than seven thousand people had almost simultaneously lost consciousness, causing social panic.</p><p></p><p>They confirmed that they were among those seven thousand time travelers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, out of the total of seven thousand time travelers, now less than a thousand had survived, such a survival rate was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This made them shudder: it was fortunate they made it through, otherwise they would have just become a cold statistic.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they secretly returned to their former 'homes' individually.</p><p></p><p>But people are not things, where could they still see their former 'homes'? Even the villages had changed to a completely different appearance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, their hearts felt empty, feeling like they had suddenly become people without roots.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>The disciples then realized that unknowingly, their master and surrounding fellow disciples had become their new 'family'.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around the Blue-Purple Planet, the relationship between the disciples became much closer.</p><p></p><p>The time travelers could still find traces of their former existence on the internet, but Cong Shuling and her brother were not so lucky.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were from more than eight hundred years ago, no matter how much they searched the whole world, there was not a single number or symbol left...</p><p></p><p>In other words, the two of them had completely disappeared from this world.</p><p></p><p>This world, the so-called 'hometown', was actually just an unfamiliar planet.</p><p></p><p>After cultivation, the disciples had gained extremely long lifespans, a thousand years was no longer considered very long for them.</p><p></p><p>But after returning to the Blue-Purple Planet, they realized they were wrong.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years was really, really long.</p><p></p><p>Long enough to easily erase all traces of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Since time was so merciless, then what was the meaning of an ordinary mortal living in this universe?</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling let out a long sigh: "It's no use thinking too much, we should complete the task entrusted by our master as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Luo Yanfeng said, "Master, I've collected information on the conditions for starting a university these days, and the requirements are still very strict. If we go through normal channels, we'll have to struggle for at least a few years. Just the various qualification certificates alone need a very long review time."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "What about abnormal methods?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng said, "That would be very simple, we can directly have the programming-skilled disciples hack into the systems of various countries, directly modify our qualifications and credentials from the inside, and then just throw money at it. This way, we won't be disrupting the overall pattern of the world, nor going against the Immortal Lord's intentions."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "Then let's choose the abnormal method."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she led everyone to the small town where she, Su Hao and the others had met before. After hundreds of years of development, this small town had become a huge city.</p><p></p><p>She pointed at a barren mountain outside the city and said, "It will be here, the campus of our Double Sword University!"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, no one had any objections.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Let's go back and take action."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Elf King Vari pointed at a third-rate university in the suburbs of a big city and said, "This school will do! We'll just directly buy it over and turn it into our own 'Infinity University', which will save us a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>The Sea King thought to himself, "On the contrary, this will actually cause more troubles down the line."</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't say it out loud, after all, who were they? They naturally weren't afraid of these troubles created from nothing.</p><p></p><p>The master had said to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ten years later.</p><p></p><p>In a small farm in the Southern Han Continent, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy ran while waving an admission letter, excitedly shouting, "Old man, I got admitted to Double Sword University, I received the admission letter from Double Sword University!"</p><p></p><p>Running at an extremely fast speed, his hair was blown back by the wind, not even noticing when his slippers had slipped down to his ankles.</p><p></p><p>Soon he charged into the courtyard, making a clatter of noises.</p><p></p><p>"What? Admitted to Double Sword University? You dare lie to me, see how I deal with you!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare I lie to you, old man! Are you still going to buy me an 'Emperor Motorcycle' as you said?"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, let me take a look first."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged burly man looked doubtful as he took the admission letter, opened it up, and immediately a unique golden light flashed across it, like special effects in a movie, flowing through all the words, then hiding within the words, and the words seemed to come alive, floating in the air and glowing.</p><p></p><p>Especially his son's name, 'Zhu Changdong', the three characters were particularly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”these cool special effects...it's definitely the admission letter from Double Sword University. Only Double Sword University and Infinity University have such high-end technology."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong's dark face was full of excitement: "Old man, Emperor Motorcycle."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man opened his big hand and rubbed Zhu Changdong's head vigorously: "What's an Emperor Motorcycle? When have I ever gone back on my word? But you brat are quite something, actually getting into one of the two universities known as the 'world's top elite', did your ancestors' graves emit green smoke or something?"</p><p></p><p>He felt his own head and muttered to himself, "I'm not that smart either...how did my son become so heaven-defying? Could it be that his mother fooled around when she was young?"</p><p></p><p>Double Sword University and Infinity University were the world's top elite universities that had newly emerged in the past decade. From the moment they appeared, they were unsurpassable peaks, sought after by the whole world. Almost every student of the right age wanted to get into these universities.</p><p></p><p>The reasons were simple:</p><p></p><p>Second, their academic abilities were unmatched by anyone. All the professors were well-versed in ancient and modern knowledge, knowledgeable about everything from astronomy to geography. Starting from the second year after the schools were founded, they published a large number of top-quality papers, solving long-standing problems in various fields. Most importantly, it was the students who solved them under the guidance of the professors, showing how terrifying their teaching abilities were.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, all officially admitted students had all fees waived. According to people, it was because these two schools sold so many patents every year that they didn't lack money.</p><p></p><p>Not only were these two universities the dream of every student, but even many doctoral students who were already quite old would retake the independent exams of the two schools to enroll and further their studies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the best schools were naturally also the most difficult to get into. Those who received admission letters from these two schools were undoubtedly among the top geniuses in the world.</p><p></p><p>On the highest Double Sword Peak platform of Double Sword University, Cong Shuling looked at the school she had built with her own hands and couldn't help but smile. Then she sent a message to Feng Cheng through her Double Sword Imprint: "Master, our school has completed a new round of admissions. This year we recruited five thousand people from around the world, all top geniuses. The quality is incomparably better than previous years. The opening ceremony will be held in a month, would you like to come and attend?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng did not reply directly, but turned to report the situation to Su Hao: "Old Master, this year we recruited some genius students. Would you like to go take a look together?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan also said, "We also recruited quite a few on our side. As our reputation spreads, the quality of students we recruit has been getting better and better over the years, especially this year when we monopolized almost all the top students."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao became interested: "Oh? Then we can go take a look."</p><p></p><p>After getting Su Hao's response, Feng Cheng turned to reply to Cong Shuling: "Then I'll go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>If the Old Master didn't go, Feng Cheng wouldn't be too interested either...</p>

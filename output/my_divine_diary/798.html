        <h1>Chapter 798</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>While the mother dragon was away, Su Hao searched the nest for suitable materials to transform into source gems. He finally found some ornaments hanging on the wall of the hatching chamber.</p><p></p><p>These seemed to be the mother dragon's treasured possessions, but they looked ordinary and useless.</p><p></p><p>"This skull ornament is perfect for transforming into source gems. With one less ornament on the wall, the mother dragon shouldn't notice."</p><p></p><p>Then, under the curious gaze of Dragon Brother 1 and Dragon Sister 2, he took down a huge skull hanging on the wall and placed it in a corner of the nest.</p><p></p><p>He wandered around the nest, moving and digging up various objects, gradually adjusting the focus system.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this process was not without Dragon Brother 1 causing mischief, only to be kicked away by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was ready, Su Hao stood beside the large skull and circulated his blood energy, suddenly expanding it outward.</p><p></p><p>"Huff!"</p><p></p><p>It was like a violent gale raging in the cave, causing the two young dragons to retreat in fright, squinting their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The focus system Su Hao had set up then activated.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining such a massive output of blood energy, a day later, he opened his eyes and thought, "It should be enough."</p><p></p><p>He then released control of his blood energy, causing the focus system to collapse and stop running.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flicked his tail towards the large skull.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The skull shattered, then emitted a dazzling white light that grew brighter and brighter until it completely engulfed the entire cave. When the light reached its peak, it burst open with a "whoosh".</p><p></p><p>"Rustle rustle~"</p><p></p><p>Over twenty milky-white source gems scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but laugh softly as he grabbed the source gems and carefully sensed the source energy contained within.</p><p></p><p>"They're all low-quality source gems, but enough to save my life."</p><p></p><p>With these source gems in hand, his courage instantly grew.</p><p></p><p>"I can freely use the fire source mage, lightning source mage, and explosive source mage abilities from the source mage system. The illusion and fantasy source mages are also within my grasp. My combat power has geometrically increased."</p><p></p><p>To give a simple example, the 'Deadlock Fist' ability given by the illusion source mage is basically invincible against living beings. The only condition is that it needs to be used within the range of his spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's spiritual perception itself is not weak. Now, without needing the 'Perception' rune and relying solely on his spiritual perception, he can sense up to 800 meters around him.</p><p></p><p>In other words, within 800 meters, he can take down almost anyone with a single punch now.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, as he continues cultivating the 'Starlight Guidance', his perception range will keep increasing.</p><p></p><p>He's simply invincible!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The scene in the nest left the two naive young dragons dumbstruck. The big bone emitted a white light and suddenly turned into shiny gems?</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as they reached out with their paws, Su Hao slapped them away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gathered all the source gems and cupped them in his hands. Looking down at his bare body, he realized he had nowhere to store them, so he opened his mouth wide and tossed them all in.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>He swallowed them down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's actions, Dragon Brother 1 and Dragon Sister 2 suddenly felt the shiny gems looked very delicious and couldn't help swallowing their saliva hungrily.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to eat the gems too!</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have the source gems, I'm safe. Next, I should calmly analyze the dragon clan's genes and quickly engrave the core runes to reach the Grandmaster Warrior level."</p><p></p><p>He retrieved Wind Cheng's research data on the [Divine Egg] from his previous life and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>This data contained extremely rich genetic experiment results, summarized by Wind Cheng over thousands of years through a vast number of experiments. It could basically solve the problems with the giant dragon genes.</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was focused on studying the data, the two young dragons snuck into the hatching chamber. They imitated Su Hao by taking down ornaments from the wall and hurried to place them where Su Hao had put the large skull earlier.</p><p></p><p>To get the best spot, the two young dragons even fought each other for a while.</p><p></p><p>After arranging the ornaments, they mimicked Su Hao's posture, staring at their ornaments expectantly, hoping they would turn into piles of shiny gems.</p><p></p><p>But their wishes were doomed to fail.</p><p></p><p>The clever Dragon Brother 1 even imitated Su Hao by using his tail to whip at the ornament he had placed, making loud cracking sounds. But no matter how hard he whipped it, the gems he wanted never appeared.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they were using the wrong ornaments?</p><p></p><p>So they snuck back to the hatching chamber again, each taking down another ornament to place and whip with their tails.</p><p></p><p>Still nothing.</p><p></p><p>Maybe they needed to place them somewhere else?</p><p></p><p>They kept trying...</p><p></p><p>Before long, the two young dragons had made a complete mess of the nest with their antics.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the mother dragon returned with food.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she came back, she noticed something was off - why was the nest in such disarray?</p><p></p><p>"These three little brats..."</p><p></p><p>Her anger flared up, but then she turned to see the oldest and second-oldest carelessly tossing aside her precious ornaments before running towards her.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you two little brats!"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but grab the two young dragons and bring them to her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Roar--"</p><p></p><p>The deafening roar instantly dazed the two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>After the three young dragons had eaten their fill, instead of taking away the remains as usual, the mother dragon brought them to another spacious rock chamber.</p><p></p><p>She extended one foreleg, opening her paw upwards.</p><p></p><p>A faint yellow glow appeared in the center of her paw, gradually forming a small glowing yellow orb.</p><p></p><p>The orb was only the size of a ping-pong ball and looked hazy and unreal, like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stared wide-eyed at the yellow orb, puzzled and thinking, "What is this? I've definitely never seen anything like it before."</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon shifted her gaze from the yellow light to Dragon Brother 1. She uttered a string of short syllables from her mouth, then slowly lowered herself in front of Dragon Brother 1. With a wave of her paw, the yellow orb drifted forward and entered Dragon Brother 1's forehead before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Brother 1 soon fell into a dazed state and lay down to sleep soundly.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon's paw opened slightly, and another yellow orb rose from her palm. With a gentle motion, it entered Dragon Sister 2's forehead, and she too quickly fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>Next was Su Hao's turn.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stared intently at the yellow orb drifting towards his forehead, his mind racing. "What is this thing? What is the mother dragon trying to do? Should I dodge it?"</p><p></p><p>As the yellow orb drew closer, Su Hao made a firm decision. "Don't dodge!"</p><p></p><p>First, he could confirm that the mother dragon deeply loved and cared for the three young dragons. He did not sense any malice from her. Second, he could sense that the other two young dragons had merely fallen asleep, with no danger to their lives. Finally, this might be a special ritual of the golden dragon clan, perhaps very important for the young dragons, like human children getting vaccinated.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not dodge, allowing the yellow orb to smoothly enter his brow.</p><p></p><p>However, to prevent any unknown influence on his consciousness, he silently instructed Xiao Guang: "Xiao Guang, activate protection for my consciousness and block any invasive information."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Guang received."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Hao's consciousness was isolated and shielded from external information.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a cool sensation on his brow, as if a mass of gas had struck it, but he did not suffer any harm.</p><p></p><p>After the yellow light entered his brow, it seamlessly merged into his brain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately realized, "This is a massive information packet."</p><p></p><p>Through comparison and calculation, Xiao Guang quickly concluded, "Language information fragments."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood, "This is a way to directly implant information into the brain, and the mother dragon is implanting a language information packet into the young dragons."</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, he felt delighted. "It seems this world still has some substance. I'm very interested in such technology."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then withdrew the protection over his consciousness, allowing the information from the yellow light to smoothly merge with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a flood of information fragments flashed through his mind, making him feel drowsy.</p><p></p><p>The drowsiness was not overwhelming, but he did not resist it, instead falling into a deep sleep.</p>

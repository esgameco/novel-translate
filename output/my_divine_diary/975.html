        <h1>Chapter 975</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi was suddenly surprised and said, "Lyu Yijiang and Tai Cheng, have you felt that the surrounding elemental energy has become more concentrated?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and Tai Cheng both nodded, "We've felt it, it seems like all the elemental energy is converging in this direction."</p><p></p><p>The three of them focused their gaze on Su Hao, "Is this Mr. Jia Wei's doing?"</p><p></p><p>As they were puzzled and uncertain, the concentration of elemental energy around them kept increasing, and they were absorbing it at an ever-faster rate.</p><p></p><p>Until at one point, the surroundings turned completely white and hazy, the concentration exceeded what was in their bodies, to the point where they didn't need to actively absorb it - the elemental energy was gushing into their bodies of its own accord.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two were so shocked their eyes were about to pop out.</p><p></p><p>They didn't feel happy about the increased concentration, but rather an extreme sense of danger filled their hearts. They immediately mustered their strength in defense, as if facing an extremely powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that if so much elemental energy went berserk and exploded, the force released could tear the three of them apart in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But they had never encountered this situation before and didn't know what to do.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of kilometers away,</p><p></p><p>After a momentary daze, the Heavenly King of the Clouds blinked, suddenly stood up with a look of shock on his face, and couldn't help but murmur, "This...why did the surrounding elemental energy suddenly disappear completely?"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Cong Renfei also sensed the inexplicable fluctuation around them. Looking into the distance, he extended his divine consciousness and quickly discovered Su Hao's figure. He couldn't help but laugh lightly, "It's fine, a normal phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King turned to Cong Renfei, "You know what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shook his head, "I don't know, but I have a rough idea. Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King, "..."</p><p></p><p>He sensed an unusual sign from afar and was very curious about what had happened. After thinking it over, he flew towards Su Hao's direction.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei immediately caught up and flew alongside him, advising, "Old Heavenly King, don't go! My Master is doing something, you mustn't disturb him."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King was flying when he initially didn't react, but the next moment his beard was completely disheveled and his eyes bulged, "You brat, you're not an ordinary person? How can you fly too?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Who says ordinary people can't fly?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King, "You've been fooling me all along?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei waved his hand, "No, absolutely not, I'm really not a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Lyu Yijiang and the other two didn't know what to do, suddenly there was a 'whoosh' sound, as if something had brushed past them. The dense elemental energy that had pervaded the surroundings instantly vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>It was like a person suddenly appearing in mid-air from the high-pressure depths of the ocean - that extreme contrast made the three of them feel extremely uncomfortable, and the energy within their bodies erupted outwards uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Pong!"</p><p></p><p>There was a burst, scattering shattered rocks.</p><p></p><p>After barely regaining control of their energy, they saw a huge glowing white sphere floating in mid-air not far away, shining like a second sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"That is...elemental energy!!!"</p><p></p><p>Then they saw Su Hao below the giant sphere, supporting it with one hand while seeming to mutter to himself, "Ah, that's a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two gradually opened their mouths wide, staring dumbfounded at Su Hao as their brains temporarily lost the ability to think.</p><p></p><p>Then the three of them watched as Su Hao took out a ball of elemental energy the size of a head from the giant sphere and directly stuffed it into his chest. As for the remaining giant sphere, it was sent off somewhere unknown and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi muttered, "Hey, hey, hey, won't that cause problems..."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang also said dazedly, "Is he integrating with nature?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng shook his head, "Sort of! But it's the other way around, nature is integrating with him."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said, "Should I try advising him? I have a feeling he won't be able to control his body from exploding."</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a dazzling white light suddenly flashed in the distance at an extremely fast speed, engulfing the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>A deafening roar, the world lost color.</p><p></p><p>Like an atomic bomb exploding, immense force ravaged the surroundings, destroying everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>When everything calmed down, Lyu Yijiang and the other two had their arms shielding their faces, blown far away by the powerful force. Their martial arts robes had disappeared, revealing their muscular bodies.</p><p></p><p>When they lowered their arms, their eyes were fixed intently on Su Hao's direction.</p><p></p><p>What they saw was an immense crater, and a head floating in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>They heard that floating head laughing loudly, "It's a good thing I protected my brain in advance, otherwise this body would be done for. Sure enough, the moment I released the restraints, these elemental energies went berserk and didn't fuse with my body, but instead destroyed it. It seems I can't rush it, I need to take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two exchanged glances, then immediately flashed to Su Hao's floating head, looking at his remaining head with sadness.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang said apologetically, "Mr. Jia Wei, it's our fault for not explaining the immense power of elemental energy to you beforehand, leading you to suffer such grievous injuries. We are very sorry!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi also said regretfully, "Mr. Jia Wei, to tell you the truth, you only have a head left now and will die soon. If you have any unfulfilled wishes, tell us quickly so we can try our best to help you accomplish them."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng nodded, "Yes, you only have a head left, you'll die soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's no problem, just a minor issue."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two exchanged glances, thinking Mr. Jia Wei still didn't realize the severity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The three of them huddled together, and Gao Qi leaned in to whisper to the other two, "It's fine if Mr. Jia Wei is unaware, it's better to die in ignorance than in terror."</p><p></p><p>The other two agreed with a nod, then looked at Su Hao with regret.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed and said, "Don't worry! I won't die, this bit of injury can't do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a large amount of crystal armor began emerging from the severed neck, spreading downwards and quickly forming a human shape.</p><p></p><p>When the crystal armor fell away, a complete body appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two: "..."</p><p></p><p>That's just too much! He didn't die even with just a head left? In a moment he just 'kraka kraka' regenerated back to normal?</p><p></p><p>Is he even human?</p><p></p><p>But the three of them personally experienced that violent impact, confirming that this was not an illusion, but something truly happening right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the others thought to themselves, "It's a good thing he's not an enemy, not a villain, not an evil overlord who likes to destroy and conquer the world..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three of them stark naked, Su Hao smiled, "Since I blasted your clothes off, let me make you some martial arts robes from a highly durable material!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he extended his hand and pointed.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the others felt an force envelop their bodies, rendering them immobile. In the next moment, a red light appeared in front of their chests, solidifying and spreading outwards until it enveloped their bodies.</p><p></p><p>When they regained freedom of movement and looked down, they found themselves wearing brand new, perfectly fitted martial arts robes.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two tugged at their new clothes in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They gained a new understanding of Su Hao's power, screaming in their hearts, "A god! Definitely an omnipotent god!"</p><p></p><p>After outfitting the three with clothes so they didn't look so disheveled, Su Hao waved his hand and took out another ball of elemental energy from his spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>However, this elemental energy ball was much smaller than the previous one, exerting far less pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>But when Lyu Yijiang and the others saw it, they still took a step back in unison.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate its small size - the elemental energy contained within was more than what was in all three of their bodies combined.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi pointed at the energy ball in Su Hao's hand and asked, "Mr. Jia Wei, are you going to stuff that into your body again? It still seems a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>He pinched off a tiny sliver the size of his fingernail and said, "For the first time, don't take too much, just this little bit is enough."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "I know my limits, there won't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>With that, he directly stuffed the elemental energy ball into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two turned and ran away.</p>

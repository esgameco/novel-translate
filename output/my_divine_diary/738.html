        <h1>Chapter 738</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After deciding to research 'the impact of reducing external brains on consciousness information', Su Hao asked the captain for a few prisoners to conduct experiments.</p><p></p><p>First, he recorded their consciousness information into the billiard ball space, then installed external brains and observed the expansion of these people's consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he removed the external brains in groups and observed the state of the consciousness information recorded in the billiard ball space.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao made the miraculous discovery that after the external brains were removed, the consciousness information in the billiard ball space became more concentrated, but the overall was not reduced.</p><p></p><p>Miraculously, these originally average intelligence people had a sharp drop in IQ after removing the external brains, but compared to their original intelligence, it was generally improved, and their cognitive levels also increased by several levels.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao realized a problem: "The consciousness information recorded in the billiard ball space can solidify its state under certain circumstances without undergoing drastic changes.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, even if I smash their brains, their consciousness information will at most stagnate, but not perish.</p><p></p><p>But if these people maintain a state without external brains for a long time, their consciousness information will gradually shrink..."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is, consciousness also has 'inertia'."</p><p></p><p>With this, Su Hao no longer had much burden about reducing his own external brain.</p><p></p><p>"There is still one problem to solve, which is whether my consciousness information becoming so massive will make it easier or more difficult to reincarnate into other worlds in the future?"</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze to those few prisoners: "Need to do some corresponding experiments, the easier to reincarnate the better. It would be best to study an automatic consciousness information matching pattern, so that as long as the billiard ball space encounters an intelligent life form, it can trigger the reincarnation matching mode..."</p><p></p><p>Those few high-intelligence prisoners saw Su Hao looking at them with an inexplicable gaze, and immediately trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were almost filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Previously when they had low intelligence, they did not understand their predicament, but now that their minds had become clearer, each of them was very clear about their fate - experimental subjects!</p><p></p><p>And they were even experimental subjects under the 'sacred human Xu Shiqiang'...</p><p></p><p>This discovery made them incredulous: the sacred human Xu Shiqiang was actually doing human experiments? This violated human ethics! He was worse than them. They had to get out alive, and then publicly expose the evil deeds of the sacred human Xu Shiqiang, ruin the reputation of this inhumane yet highly regarded person, and make him become a rat that everyone wants to beat...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the brains of these experimental subjects were ruined by Su Hao, with only their consciousness information remaining in the billiard ball space.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao stroked his chin and said, "Should I try matching their consciousness information into the bodies of the Eight-Armed Race? Or the Mother Bugs?"</p><p></p><p>Although it was a question, Su Hao acted very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, those high-intelligence prisoners woke up again.</p><p></p><p>They woke up feeling proud, but upon discovering they had transformed into strange creatures...</p><p></p><p>"Huh?? Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no! I've turned into a tentacle monster! What should I do? Crying fainted in the lab!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm a tentacle monster too... It's over, completely over! My life's glory, even if I get out, no one will recognize me. I don't want to live anymore, let me die!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a low voice said, "By the way... what have I turned into? I can't see my own appearance."</p><p></p><p>"Me too, I feel my body is strange, not quite the same~"</p><p></p><p>The tentacle monsters looked down and saw a few plump, white mother bugs squirming on the ground, struggling to look back at their own appearance, but unable to do so no matter what.</p><p></p><p>The tentacle monsters were shocked, and for a moment they accepted the fact that they had turned into tentacle monsters.</p><p></p><p>Compared to becoming these worms, turning into a tentacle monster was not an unacceptable thing.</p><p></p><p>The tentacle monsters looked at each other, all able to see the relief in each other's eyes, then brought the few mother bugs to the edge of a pond: "Your appearance, it's hard to say, you can see for yourselves in the water's surface!"</p><p></p><p>The mother bugs approached the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>"Ah--"  </p><p>"I don't want to live anymore!"</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to live anymore. His mind went blank, and he slowly inched forward, entering the water, intending to drown himself.</p><p></p><p>Then he was fished out by the tentacle monsters, who consoled him: "Brother, look on the bright side, being a happy bug might not be a bad thing. At least you don't have human troubles anymore, just eat and drink, look at me, I've turned into a tentacle monster but my mentality is still good?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand me..."  He turned to enter the water again.</p><p></p><p>"We understand you!" The tentacle monsters blocked him.</p><p></p><p>"No, you don't understand..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Observing from the side, Su Hao revealed a smile: "Matching successful, just lacking an automatic identification and matching mechanism. It would be best if it could automatically identify humanoid lifeforms, otherwise who knows if I might reincarnate into some other strange creature in the future?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to end up like 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime'!</p><p></p><p>The captain had become so plump that Su Hao almost didn't recognize him. It was rare for him to see Su Hao, and he was just about to take Su Hao out for a drink when he heard this and was stunned: "Other intelligent races? Why are you asking this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I thought of some interesting experiments that need the participation of intelligent races other than humans and the Eight-Armed Race. Of course, if there are Compound Eye Races, that would be best."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the captain heard Su Hao wanted to do experiments, he couldn't help clenching, with his hairs standing on end.</p><p></p><p>When he heard Su Hao planned to use the Compound Eye Race for experiments, he immediately waved his hands in panic: "The Compound Eye Race is not okay, they have nothing to do all day but stare at our blue light. If they find out we're using their tribesmen for experiments, won't they turn towards the Eight-Armed Race? We can't let the advantage we've established with such difficulty go to waste!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Of course, it's best if we have them, but if not I can find a way myself. Other intelligent races will work too."</p><p></p><p>The captain pondered: "Other races huh... In the past, after the Eight-Armed Race conquered a planet, they usually wouldn't completely exterminate the original race, but would leave a small portion to be raised like pets, breeding like cats and dogs, living on the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, we've conquered quite a few colony planets, and captured many of the remaining intelligent races from those planets.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Furry Race, Aquatic Race, Winged Race, Jumping Mouse Race, Earth Spirit Race and so on, we have quite a few of them.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, how many do you need? Too many might not be available, after all there aren't that many to begin with."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Not too many, about five from each race will suffice."</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded: "Got it, wait for my message, I'll send them over to you as soon as it's arranged."</p><p></p><p>The captain lowered his voice: "Qiang, want to grab a drink?"</p><p></p><p>If it were during a time of life and death for humanity, the captain would not have had the heart to ask Su Hao for a drink.</p><p></p><p>But the present was different from the past, there weren't many things the captain had to worry about now.</p><p></p><p>According to the current trend, human victory was inevitable, it was just a matter of time!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I'm not interested in that."  </p><p></p><p>The captain suggested again, "Then how about I take you to find some girls?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao teased, "Aren't you afraid your wife will find out?"</p><p></p><p>The captain boasted, "You misunderstand me, Qiang. How could I be the kind of man who's afraid of his wife? She can't control what a man does outside."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "Then you can go by yourself! Compared to finding girls, I prefer doing experiments on intelligent races. Oh, you can ask Feng Chenghao about that, he's quite into it."</p><p></p><p>The captain said disappointedly, "If that's the case, I'll just go drink then!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another ten years later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao finally developed a barely usable 'automatic consciousness information identification and matching mechanism'.</p><p></p><p>The principle adopted was also quite simple. Since the core of consciousness information cannot be changed, then wrap an 'omniscient consciousness simulation' information layer around it.</p><p></p><p>The 'omniscient consciousness simulation' mainly had two functions, 'identification' and 'matching'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put: When Su Hao's consciousness information was struck into the brain of an intelligent lifeform by the billiard ball space, the 'identification' function of the 'omniscient consciousness simulation' would activate, detecting the intelligence and form of that intelligent being.</p><p></p><p>If it met Su Hao's requirements, then the 'matching' function of the 'omniscient consciousness simulation' would activate, actively changing the outer consciousness structure to adapt to that intelligent lifeform, thereby forcibly awakening his main consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could not only increase the probability of being reincarnated next time, but also ensure that his reincarnation target would not deviate too much.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the ten years Su Hao spent researching the reincarnation mechanism was completely worth it.</p><p></p><p>After all, before gaining eternal life, reincarnation was his top priority, not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could continue reincarnating, he had infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if he could no longer reincarnate, then no matter how powerful he became in this life, able to destroy the entire Cloud Ring System, what did it matter?</p><p></p><p>When the time came, everything would turn to nothing.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'brilliant life' was just a joke in Su Hao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As for why Su Hao insisted on reincarnating into humanoid lifeforms...</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he was after all human, and he was uncertain whether reincarnating into a non-human form would fundamentally affect his consciousness and cognition.</p><p></p><p>Any unknown risks on the level of consciousness had to be avoided.</p>

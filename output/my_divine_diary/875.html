        <h1>Chapter 875</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The world of the Cruciform was changing quietly yet dramatically, just as Su Hao had imagined.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet because for the ordinary people living on this planet, every day was still the same - working, harvesting, eating, making trouble, having babies.</p><p></p><p>The dramatic change was from the perspective of the entire world's structure - the core and essence of the world had changed. In a few decades or a century, few would still remember what the era ruled by the Eighteen Deific Sects had looked like.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, after confirming the stable operation of the system, Su Hao returned to his own laboratory and opened the "Shopping Mall System" he had designed for the deities.</p><p></p><p>It was brimming with all kinds of products, such as games, mortal avatars, minor overlord avatars, small worlds, storage spaces, pure soul force packages, pure information packages, soul arts, skills, one-time healing items, limb regeneration, bloodline talents, source artifacts with various abilities, aircraft, electronic game consoles, all kinds of enchanted cold weapons, gunpowder firearms, energy firearms, energy cubes, and more.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao always felt something was missing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he realized what it was - it wasn't that the variety of products was incomplete, but rather their quantity was limited.</p><p></p><p>"These special items are difficult to produce, basically requiring me to make them by hand, so the output is extremely limited. But I can't be tinkering with these little toys every day! If I have time, I'd better take out the books I recorded before and study them carefully.</p><p></p><p>So, I need to find a way for these products to self-produce and test themselves, and automatically transport to the customer's side when an order is placed in the mall..."</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao thought, what if transporting directly to their side caused some accident where someone snatched the items?</p><p></p><p>After some muddled thinking, Su Hao sorted out the tasks at hand:</p><p></p><p>Secondly, research methods to directly convert source into specific products, whether source artifacts, soul force, one-time items, aircraft, electronics, weapons, firearms, energy cubes, or even flesh avatars, all could be converted directly from source;</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, build a huge "automated production miniworld" to manufacture all kinds of products, then deliver them to the customer's miniworld;</p><p></p><p>Originally when he didn't obtain eternity, he had hoped to spend more time researching the eternal life project. With limited time, delving into source wouldn't fundamentally elevate him.</p><p></p><p>What use were more bizarre powers? More powerful abilities? Playing tricks with source?</p><p></p><p>Could they let him gain eternity?</p><p></p><p>What he needed before was not greater strength - greater strength was meaningless to him.</p><p></p><p>If he died, if the slightest accident occurred while he slept, then everything he possessed would become nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Those fancy things were like a beautiful vase, only to be buried with him in his coffin.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was different!</p><p></p><p>He didn't lack time, theoretically wouldn't die this life. He had confidence to resolve any accident that occurred. In that case, he could spend time on those so-called "fancy" things.</p><p></p><p>This was his optimal choice when he couldn't gain new knowledge. While deepening all kinds of abilities, he would wait for various worlds to be constructed. Once he found a suitable "traveler's homeland", he could naturally transition to researching "wavemotion".</p><p></p><p>"If I complete the conversion of these products, can I be considered omnipotent to some degree?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was strolling through the Pot Star System when he quickly found a barren rocky planet he liked, then landed in a valley: "I'll build the product miniworld right here!</p><p></p><p>So, from easy to difficult, let's start by researching normal firearms, weapons and electronics without superpowers!"</p><p></p><p>Products with supernatural abilities and ordinary material products had vastly different conversion difficulties.</p><p></p><p>But once he made a start, Su Hao was confident he could overcome all the obstacles before him.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A year quietly passed.</p><p></p><p>Under the eager gazes of the Eighteen Deities, the first batch of ten "Soul Force Fruits" silently fell from the "Talent Soul Force Tree" and disappeared from the deities' sight, carried away by the mysterious ever-changing currents to unknown places.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Deity Bali said excitedly: "The fruits have fallen. Based on the current speed, they'll appear on the Paradise Passage in ten days. Whoever finds the fruits keeps them."</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity Red Light said excitedly: "Don't any of you try to take the 'Piercing Fruit' I reserved, I need it to deal with that stupid dragon."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Thunder Deity Gu Dao said: "Of course, I won't take yours, I reserved the 'Explosive Thunder Fruit', don't any of you take that one."</p><p></p><p>The Dark Night Deity Yongshi sneered: "Reserved? Don't joke. The fruits are obtained by luck, whoever finds them keeps them. There are eighteen deities but only ten fruits - what about the other eight if you reserve them? Just watch us enjoy them alone?"</p><p></p><p>The Salvation Deity Baishen said: "Lord Yongshi, your words are biased. There will be ten fruits every year, and more later. You only need to wait a year to get the fruit you want, why not do that? Ahem, I reserve the 'Transformation Fruit', don't any of you take that."</p><p></p><p>The Bathing Light Deity Yi said indifferently: "I agree with Lord Yongshi. Don't fight over the ten fruits, use your own methods, it's up to luck who gets them. Or do you think your luck is worse than ours?"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you're being uncooperative! Want to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"I have lots of points, not afraid to die. Bring it on!"</p><p></p><p>"See you on the Paradise Passage."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The deities got into a deadlock over who would get the fruits first and started bickering, finally deciding to leave it up to luck.</p><p></p><p>They sent out avatars and issued "divine edicts" to the remaining soul art followers of the defeated Crimson Demon King, gathering a large group to rush towards the Paradise Passage.</p><p></p><p>They had had enough of the powerless mortal avatars.</p><p></p><p>These "Soul Force Fruits" that could give them power were a must-have.</p><p></p><p>But on the long passage, finding ten scattered fruits would be extremely difficult - it wasn't as simple as wanting to find them.</p><p></p><p>Without absolute power, finding the Soul Force Fruits could only rely on luck.</p><p></p><p>The unlucky ones might even step right on one without noticing, or have it appear behind them after just passing by.</p><p></p><p>But the eighteen deities who managed to obtain a White Galactic body all considered their luck exceptional, as if the Soul Force Fruits were already in the bag.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After the deities disappeared, the soul artists and soul guards gradually declined. The pirates who once occupied the Paradise Passage dwindled without a steady influx of fresh blood. Many powerful pirate gangs even disbanded and left the passage to make a living elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people became the mainstream on the islands of this passage, with fishing villages, trading towns, crop plantations, and of course many searching for the treasures left behind by the former pirates.</p><p></p><p>It was more lively than before but with much less bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>However, with the appearance of the "Soul Force Fruits", this brief peace was about to be shattered.</p><p></p><p>Once news of "unique treasure fruits on the Paradise Passage that could grant unimaginable power" spread across the world, it was easy to imagine that all the bold and wise powerful figures would flock over, hoisting sails to search for the power that belonged to them.</p><p></p><p>The great age of exploration was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the blazing sun shone, a gentle sea breeze blew, waves crashing rhythmically on the golden sandy beach.</p><p></p><p>Four raggedly dressed children huddled under a coconut palm, one scrawny black six or seven-year-old nimbly climbing up like a monkey, using a long pole to deftly dislodge three clustered coconuts.  </p><p></p><p>They were already parched with thirst, desperately needing the coconut juice.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>The three large coconuts were skillfully knocked down by the kid, smashing hard on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The three children below swarmed over, each snatching one before scampering barefoot into the shady woods, cheering.</p><p></p><p>The little kid's eyes bulged in displeasure at his companions' "righteousness": "Hey, don't run, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Those were the last three coconuts on this tree, his buddies had run off with coconuts, what was he supposed to drink?</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>His eyesight was good, squinting to get a rough look: "Looks like some kind of fruit, let me check it out."</p><p></p><p>He slid down nimbly, scratching his itchy butt, then trotted over barefoot through the fine sand to pick up the strange fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Looks kinda like a coconut, but not really. Seems pretty tasty..."</p><p></p><p>His mouth was parched at this point. Glancing back at where his buddies had run off, they were long gone.</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth wide, about to take a big bite.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Order Deity Red Light's ordinary avatar emerged from the forest shadows and saw this scene. He immediately recognized this as one of the extremely powerful "Explosive Fruits" from the Soul Force Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Order Deity Red Light's nostrils flared as he thrust his splayed fingers forward, bellowing at the kid: "You little brat, stop!"</p><p></p><p>The kid saw someone trying to take his fruit away.</p><p></p><p>He turned and bolted, then opened his mouth wide and took a massive bite right in front of the Order Deity's bulging eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Splurt!"</p><p></p><p>Juices sprayed everywhere!</p>

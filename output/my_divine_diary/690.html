        <h1>Chapter 690</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The remaining three combat ships of the Eight-Armed Race no longer had the mind to care about the Yuanxing cruiser. With the events happening around them unresolved, let alone some human cruiser, it was even a question whether they could return safely.</p><p></p><p>Before setting out, they had envisioned various scenarios that might occur and formulated corresponding countermeasures. But when truly facing it, they found it was quite different from what they had imagined, and not a single countermeasure could be applied.</p><p></p><p>In fact, such a situation had never occurred in the history of the Eight-Armed Race before.</p><p></p><p>This really tested the commanders' ability to adapt on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, those who could become commanders did not lack adaptability.</p><p></p><p>"Temporarily move away from the mothership, no longer approach the human warship. Report the current detailed situation to the military harbor and await instructions."</p><p></p><p>Then the military harbor sent back a string of question marks, asking if they had collectively lost their minds to report such a nonsensical reason, and replied "temporarily maintain distance, await video transmission completion."</p><p></p><p>The commanders of the three combat ships felt somewhat helpless and could only maintain distance from the mothership and human cruiser, silently waiting.</p><p></p><p>The video information sent back by the combat ships was quite large, and it would take some time to fully receive it.</p><p></p><p>Without the video information as reference, the military harbor could not fully confirm the combat ships' account. As members of the Eight-Armed Race who had experienced all sorts of events, they had their own complete worldview and rigorous way of thinking, not easily convinced by a few words.</p><p></p><p>Evidence was key.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the Eight-Armed military harbor finally received the complete video. After watching it, they all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They quickly confirmed one fact: Humans had researched a new technology.</p><p></p><p>They immediately sent a message to the three combat ships: No matter what, they must find a way to intercept the human cruiser. They had to seize the humans' latest technology.</p><p></p><p>However, after a long time with no reply from the combat ships, they carefully checked the information and found that all five ships dispatched were gone.</p><p></p><p>The military harbor could still receive the ships' signals, but the signals they sent out received no response.</p><p></p><p>"What is this situation?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the remaining three combat ships, Xu Hao finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he felt an immense oppressive force all over his body, making him realize that the high frequency flashing for a long period had pushed his body to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Staying in the second-dimensional space for a long time would not cause this issue, because maintaining one state for a long period allows the body to adapt. But 'flashing' and 'teleporting' involves repeatedly going through the torment of traversing space, which is a great challenge for the body.</p><p></p><p>It's like a person staying in a cold area for a long time can quickly adapt, but if they spend ten minutes in a cold place then run to a hot place for ten minutes, repeatedly jumping between the two extremes, the body will soon be unable to take it.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his physical discomfort, flashed into one of the combat ships, sat down to rest, and casually opened the communicator to send a message to Colonel Jiang, who was in charge of liaison for this operation: "Colonel Jiang, this is Xu Shiqiang. I have completed the mission, annihilated all the Eight-Armed on the enemy ships, and occupied the enemy ships. End of message."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao was still a soldier on the Yuanxing cruiser, so unless necessary, he would still follow some rules as a soldier.</p><p></p><p>Being powerful is one thing, but it doesn't affect his dedication to his job. As the saying goes, love the job you do!</p><p></p><p>As long as he was still on duty, under permissible conditions, he would still complete the tasks of his post.</p><p></p><p>Unless he officially submitted his resignation to his superiors.</p><p></p><p>When Colonel Jiang suddenly heard Xu Hao's report, he was stunned at first, then his eyes bulged out, and without thinking too much, he shouted loudly in the command center: "What? Xu Shiqiang? You're not dead?"</p><p></p><p>The captain and other officers all turned to look at Colonel Jiang, their tragic expressions of heroic sacrifice frozen on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Colonel Jiang immediately put his communicator on speaker.</p><p></p><p>Then Xu Hao's voice came through the communicator: "I have a great life, I'm alive and well. I'm currently on the enemy's Type 3 combat ship. I've occupied all five enemy ships, come and receive them quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The captain and other officers: "......"</p><p></p><p>Happiness came so suddenly, as if in a few seconds they had gone from hell to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, this group of people had mustered the courage to fight to the death against the Eight-Armed Race, but after hearing and understanding Xu Hao's words, that courage gradually collapsed and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know since when the people on this ship had become so reliant on this soldier named Xu Shiqiang...</p><p></p><p>The one who felt it most deeply was the captain. After hearing Xu Shiqiang's voice, he could feel the courage he had just summoned to press forward fading away.</p><p></p><p>A lingering sense of horror invaded his entire mind, invading his soul.</p><p></p><p>He realized he couldn't let this happen, realized that ever since coming into contact with Xu Shiqiang, he had gradually lost the military spirit of a soldier.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't control it.</p><p></p><p>'Reliance' was so terrifying that even someone with his firm mind and resolve had been corroded in just a year or two.</p><p></p><p>The captain was caught in the torment of joy and pain as he gave the order: "Turn around! Go pick up our hero."</p><p></p><p>Using his own strength to defeat an entire Eight-Armed fleet, he couldn't think of a better word than "hero" to describe Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>The captain thought to himself: "Perhaps, if I learn 'superpowers' by following Xu Shiqiang, my confidence can return."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The five Eight-Armed warships had lost control and were soon received by the Yuanxing cruiser.</p><p></p><p>However, the sheer size of these five warships was too massive. Just the Leapfrog-class mothership was over ten times larger than the Yuanxing cruiser, so receiving the warships was an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at these five warships, drooling with regret: If only they could bring back the technology to crack the warp drive on board...</p><p></p><p>In the end, the captain decided to prioritize emptying the energy blocks from the warships, then pick out anything that looked important, and finally destroy the five warships.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao had no objection to emptying the energy blocks, but destroying them would be too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said directly: "I have a way to take these five warships away."</p><p></p><p>The captain: "???"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said: "Use Hundred Strikes to shoot them away, then retrieve them after returning to the Warp Zone."</p><p></p><p>What the hell, the captain and others just wanted to ask, was there anything Xu Shiqiang couldn't do?</p><p></p><p>For the captain, the basic requirement was just not to leave the warships to the Eight-Armed Race. As for whether they could bring them back, he had no high hopes - it would be best if possible, but no problem if not.</p><p></p><p>In the captain's view, Xu Shiqiang was far more valuable than these warships.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao's method was simple - create a small world, put all the warships into the small world, then teleport them to the planet where he had left positioning stones before, randomly placing them somewhere. Who could find them?</p><p></p><p>This way, the five warships would become his personal belongings, and the warp drives and various technologies on board would be at his disposal to study and tinker with.</p><p></p><p>So, in full view of everyone, Xu Hao stuffed the five warships into the small world...</p><p></p><p>And the people on the Yuanxing cruiser watched the whole process with an eerie gaze.</p><p></p><p>Then, without saying a word, they kept telling themselves: "Hundred Strikes, huh! Normal phenomenon!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, there was only the Yuanxing cruiser left in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>By now, the energy blocks had almost filled the entire Yuanxing cruiser, enough for them to pilot the ship and roam the Cloud Ring system for a long time without needing to take the risk of attacking the Eight-Armed military harbor to plunder resources.</p><p></p><p>The captain sorted out his messy thoughts and quickly confirmed their next itinerary: "Leave this place as soon as possible, calculate the warp route, destination the Star Devourer Domain."</p><p></p><p>He planned to go straight to the Star Devourer Domain without any stops in between, completely shaking off the signal hive's lock on them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ship reactivated its warp drive and entered superluminal flight.</p><p></p><p>The captain finally relaxed, leisurely strolling inside the Yuanxing cruiser and enjoying the respectful gazes of everyone, his clever intellect once again taking the high ground.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he suddenly thought of a question: "Oh? Xu Shiqiang can shoot away the ship with Hundred Strikes, right? I forgot to ask him if the teleported ship can avoid being locked onto by signals. If so, wouldn't we not need to take the risk of going to the Star Devourer Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately found Xu Hao, who was on vacation, and asked his question.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao asked curiously, "How does the Eight-Armed signal hive lock onto the location of ships?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 730</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>From the captain, he learned that after the previous ineffective star cannon attack, the Octopus clan's fleet had voluntarily retreated, moving away from the Blue Light system and quietly waiting for other fleets to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Now, twenty-one large fleets totaling over two thousand six hundred warships of various models had already arrived outside the Blue Light galaxy system.</p><p></p><p>Encircling the Blue Light galaxy system, watching with greedy eyes!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chuckled: "You've arrived just in time! It seems the Octopus clan's fleets have all gathered." He said, "Let's go to the command center."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the relaxed look on Su Hao's face, the captain couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, not knowing why he suddenly no longer felt anxious.</p><p></p><p>The captain followed behind Su Hao, thinking to himself: "We're stable now!"</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the command center, Su Hao inquired about various information regarding the Octopus clan's fleet, mostly about distances and positions.</p><p></p><p>Then he said nothing, directly flashing into outer space, silently calculating the positions and distances of the Octopus clan's warships: "Based on this fleet distribution, I only need to create thirty Star Light Breaks to destroy all the warships! Each one takes about four minutes...so it will take about two hours to completely resolve this!"</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand and made a grasping motion, a point of golden light appearing and gradually expanding...</p><p></p><p>In the human command center, one-third of the screens played footage of Su Hao from various angles, while the others monitored every move of the Octopus clan's warships.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's actions, someone who didn't understand asked: "What is Xu Shiqiang doing? Attacking the Octopus clan's fleet?"</p><p></p><p>With the previous example of him single-handedly firing the star cannon, no one thought Su Hao was doing something useless. They all focused intently on the screens, wanting to see what Su Hao planned to do.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although they watched Su Hao's actions throughout, they still didn't understand the purpose behind his actions.</p><p></p><p>"He plans to attack the Octopus clan's warships with that shuttle-like golden light...but it's too far away, can it even reach?"</p><p></p><p>"Can a human really reach such a level?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he will be the pinnacle that we humans can achieve!"</p><p></p><p>"Please don't overestimate the human pinnacle! If he can reach one-tenth of it, I would already find it impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"He's moving!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stopped talking and stared intently at that figure!</p><p></p><p>Then, just like before, he stretched out his palm and began constructing a second fat shuttle.</p><p></p><p>The people in the command center exclaimed in surprise: "Hey? Where did that previous fat shuttle go?"</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing now? It feels like he's repeating the previous action, could the video be replaying by mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"Wake up, how could it be replaying...I estimate the previous attack failed, so he's starting over from the beginning. After all, he's likely using an extremely powerful technique!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As everyone was discussing, the reporting officer suddenly reported a message: "Report! We've received the latest news that the Octopus clan's Eighth Fleet has been attacked, all warships instantly destroyed, end report!"</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>The reply came: "Report, there was no attack mission!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone added: "The Octopus clan's fleet is too far away, our attacks cannot reach them, and they have intentionally avoided contact with our warships.</p><p></p><p>So..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Su Hao in the video at the same time!</p><p></p><p>This was done by Xu Shiqiang, right?</p><p></p><p>It must be, right?</p><p></p><p>Within one minute, the Octopus clan's Eighth Fleet was destroyed!</p><p></p><p>Across half a galaxy system's distance!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xia Qingjun said: "Previously, Xu Shiqiang told me he was going to research methods to attack the enemy's mothership!"</p><p></p><p>With Xia Qingjun's confirmation that the Octopus clan's Eighth Fleet was taken down by Xu Shiqiang, it solidified the fact.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of officials: "Damn, he's amazing!"</p><p></p><p>The great abilities described in myths and legends are probably only at this level, huh?</p><p></p><p>They no longer had adequate language to evaluate just how formidable Xu Shiqiang was.</p><p></p><p>The people present, no matter how capable, admitted they couldn't comprehend Xu Shiqiang's level of power.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing more to say - just listen to Xu Shiqiang from now on, no mistakes there!</p><p></p><p>With a flash of golden light, the Star Light Break quickly disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the Fifth Fleet turned into specks of light, propagating in all directions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the humans were celebrating, the Octopus clan seemed a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Eighth Fleet had suddenly lost contact.</p><p></p><p>At first, they didn't notice any abnormalities, until the Fifth Fleet, Tenth Fleet, and Twelfth Fleet also lost contact in succession. Only then did the overall fleet commander finally realize something was wrong!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the warships near these out-of-contact fleets captured footage of a few warships suddenly exploding, which was then shared with all the fleets!</p><p></p><p>Seen by all the Octopuses, it appeared extremely terrifying!</p><p></p><p>As for why they lost contact, they had all understood - the warships exploded!</p><p></p><p>The overall fleet commander shouted hoarsely: "All fleets, retreat immediately!"</p><p></p><p>However, retreating takes time.</p><p></p><p>Just relying on the warships' thrusters, it would take two hours to escape Su Hao's preset attack range.</p><p></p><p>As for activating the warp drive...even without needing to calculate the flight path and destination, immediately activating the warp drive would still require at least two hours of preparation time.</p><p></p><p>In summary, by the time Su Hao decided to launch the attack, the Octopus clan's fleet could no longer escape.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Octopus clan's fleets inexplicably exploded into small cosmic fireworks, unable to stop it.</p><p></p><p>In their panic, the Octopuses frantically tried to figure out why their ships were randomly exploding, checking the ships over and over again.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how they analyzed it, the ships showed everything was normal!</p><p></p><p>This was the most bizarre situation the Octopuses had encountered in their conquest of the Yunhuan system.</p><p></p><p>The key was, they hadn't detected the humans launching any attacks!</p><p></p><p>The Octopuses on the warships kept pondering these questions, but until all their warships were destroyed and they all died, they never figured out the answer.</p><p></p><p>In the Octopus command center, the commander said indifferently: "This operation to eliminate the Blue Light humans has completely failed!"</p><p></p><p>"So what exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>This question stumped even the extremely intelligent Octopuses!</p><p></p><p>"The humans are so powerful, yet my Octopus clan has been in contact with them for many years! Then why has the threat assessment agency always rated humans as no threat?"</p><p></p><p>What the Octopuses present never expected was that the humans, who had always appeared weak, actually possessed such tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the commander concluded about this failure: "The responsibility for this failed invasion of Blue Light does not lie with us, but with the threat assessment agency!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Report! The Octopus clan's Thirteenth Fleet confirmed annihilated!"  </p><p></p><p>"Report! The Octopus clan's Fifteenth Fleet confirmed annihilated!"</p><p></p><p>"Report!..."</p><p></p><p>In the human command center, Xia Qingjun and the others watched with wide eyes as Su Hao tossed out the fat shuttles one by one, while listening to the reporting officers continuously report the status of the Octopus clan's fleets, their expressions gradually becoming dazed!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Su Hao transmitted back to the command center that they awoke as if from a dream, staring at Su Hao with bizarre looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled faintly: "You don't need to be too surprised! This is a new superpower I just developed called the Star Light Break. The first combat use, and it seems the effect is quite good!</p><p></p><p>However, there are still many limitations and a lot of room for improvement going forward."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others: "..."</p><p></p><p>As long as you, the great Lord Xu Shiqiang, say so, it must be true!</p><p></p><p>But does this have anything to do with the word "surprised"? No, right!</p><p></p><p>Although they admitted Su Hao was "supernatural", this still seemed a bit exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Good luck on your exams, students!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After arranging for Axing to take Yahan and Fengcheng with him, Suhao no longer concerned himself with others and directly returned to the small island to continue researching the properties of the Source.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had cultivated the Divine Consciousness, he had a premonition that the time to unveil the mysterious veil of the Source was not far off.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, perhaps the Source could truly help him resolve the celestial stone that would arrive in a hundred years. Of course, it could also be something else.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of the Divine Consciousness, in just a few days, Suhao had summarized some characteristics and patterns.</p><p></p><p>"First, the Source is a thing like space without gaps. It can be divided into different parts, yet has no specific smallest unit. Each division releases a certain amount of energy;</p><p></p><p>Third, the Source can be transformed into pure forms of various types of energy, and can also be transformed into unstable substances of all kinds. The transformed substances have the same properties as real substances, but are very unstable. Without the subsequent support of the Source, they will collapse in at most two hours. But after the collapse, the substances will randomly aggregate into some elements or compounds, transforming into real substances;</p><p></p><p>Fourth, substances can in turn be transformed into the Source, but only under specific conditions can a uniform Source Pearl be formed;</p><p></p><p>Sixth..."</p><p></p><p>After sorting out all his discoveries clearly, Suhao transformed into the [Destiny Child], randomly selected a positioning stone, and transmitted himself away.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had left quite a few positioning stones all over the world, which conveniently allowed him to travel freely in this world.</p><p></p><p>Now what Suhao needed to do was to search all over the world for various disasters, then resolve the disasters, and observe how the 'Catalyst' being destroyed would cause the 'Source' to transform into Source Pearls.</p><p></p><p>If he could figure this out, he could completely produce Source Pearls autonomously with the Source Apparatus.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the prevalence of Source energy technology in this world, perhaps there is already a technology to use the Source Apparatus to produce the 'Source', which would explain how the major cities and factories have a stable energy supply."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Suhao felt the urge to secretly infiltrate the palaces of the major cities and record their knowledge into the Bouncing Space.</p><p></p><p>With his current Deity Realm strength, who was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>But to be safe, he should first research how to defend against the bizarre 'Fragile Skin' defense!</p><p></p><p>With a new goal in mind, every cell in Suhao's body became excited. His flying posture became lighter, sweeping his 200,000 mile Divine Consciousness over the surroundings, perceiving all things, and then randomly choosing a direction to swiftly fly towards.</p><p></p><p>Disasters were visible almost everywhere in this world. Resolving one would lead to another emerging from an unexpected place.</p><p></p><p>With Suhao's 200,000 mile perception range, it was easy to find disasters.</p><p></p><p>Just an hour into his flight, he sensed an abnormality in a mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>The area was shrouded in thick fog. In the fog, it was deathly still. The flowers, grass and trees he perceived were withered and charred. Birds and beasts lay on the ground, gradually decaying into bones. The exposed stones and soil were pitted, as if eroded by acid rain for years.</p><p></p><p>Suhao carefully sensed it and his eyes lit up: "It should be a natural disaster. The affected area is not large, so it must have just formed and not been discovered yet. Let's go take a look first."</p><p></p><p>He flashed to the edge of the natural disaster and immediately smelled a pungent odor.</p><p></p><p>Suhao frowned and retreated: "The rotten egg smell, isn't that the smell of hydrogen sulfide?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered and casually summoned a gerbil he kept at the experimental base. After recording its consciousness, he casually tossed it into the fog.</p><p></p><p>The gerbil shrieked sharply, its short limbs flailing in midair, tracing a perfect parabola into the thick fog.</p><p></p><p>Before it even landed, its consciousness was no longer controlled by instinct, filled only with one voice: "Crawl in! Crawl in!"</p><p></p><p>After landing, ignoring the burning pain on its body, it crawled towards the depths of the fog without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>As it crawled, it gradually became immobile. Its eyes were corroded and melted, losing its sight. Its ears soon followed, losing its hearing. Its even breathing caused its lungs to corrode into charcoal-like things. Its fur gradually blackened and carbonized, its limb joints stiffened...</p><p></p><p>Finally, it lost all life force.</p><p></p><p>And Suhao had obtained what he wanted. In the end, every gerbil under Suhao's control could demonstrate a certain value and would not die in vain.</p><p></p><p>"A fog of mixed acids?"</p><p></p><p>Not only that, there were also other miscellaneous things mixed in, forming the corrosive acid fog they saw, with extremely strong corrosive power. Even a gerbil with strong vitality could not last three minutes after entering. An ordinary person would likely suffer the same fate.</p><p></p><p>However, to Suhao, this acid fog was like air - inconsequential. Just the pungent smell was a bit irritating, which could be perfectly resolved with a breath-holding technique.</p><p></p><p>After activating the 'Fragile Skin Defense', he slowly walked into the acid fog, searching for anything that could be the 'core' as he went. He soon arrived at the center of the fog.</p><p></p><p>After casually turning around, he saw a large hollow log lying horizontally on the ground, one-third buried underground. Thick acid fog was gushing out from the two hollow ends, spreading outward.</p><p></p><p>The billowing volume was even greater than the smoke from the giant chimneys he had seen by the roadside, surging out like a rocket engine nozzle.</p><p></p><p>"Found it, this hollow log must be the core!"</p><p></p><p>Focusing his Divine Consciousness on the log, he immediately perceived the scene inside the hollow log: three huge bird eggs, each the size of a washbasin.</p><p></p><p>But the eggs were covered in cracks, with one corner broken. The insides of the eggs had completely rotted, and the surrounding acid fog was emanating from these three eggs.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the parent birds had unfortunately died while foraging, unable to incubate the eggs, which eventually rotted and by chance became the core of this disaster, spewing out the highly corrosive acid fog.</p><p></p><p>Suhao slowly approached and squatted down, using his Divine Consciousness to carefully sense the hollow log and three rotten eggs.</p><p></p><p>After a full half hour, Suhao had finally sensed the 'hollow log + three eggs' core inside and out, discovering the Source fluctuations, mainly coming from the hollow log, while the eggs emitted another special frequency.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, this hollow log is the 'Source', while the eggs are the 'Catalyst'. The spoiled eggs were first infected by some force into a special substance similar to a Source Apparatus, the 'Catalyst'. It then emitted a Source field, transforming the surrounding hollow log into the Source, together forming the 'core' of the natural disaster, spewing out highly corrosive acid fog...</p><p></p><p>Now, if I just destroy the eggs, I can dispel this natural disaster, and the log will transform into Source Pearls..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered and decided to take this opportunity to experiment, such as blocking the two ends of the log to prevent the fog from billowing out, or taking the eggs out of the log without destroying either, or destroying just one of the three eggs first, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Next, Suhao tried out all the scenarios he could think of until the toy was utterly ruined.</p><p></p><p>This disaster's core, like a child's toy, could not last long either before being completely wrecked.</p><p></p><p>That hollow log gradually emanated a dazzling radiance, growing brighter and brighter...</p><p></p><p>Suhao closed his eyes, concentrating all his Divine Consciousness on the hollow log.</p><p></p><p>"Wah--"</p><p></p><p>A flash of white light, and the hollow log transformed into a small pile of Source Pearls scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened his eyes, his gaze sharp as he stared at the pile of Source Pearls, muttering: "So that's how it is?"</p>

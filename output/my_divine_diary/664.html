        <h1>Chapter 664</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>What surprised Su Hao was that after he suddenly transmitted, his field of vision and spiritual perception instantly switched, but what he didn't expect was that the 'yun bo' around him did not undergo any migration, as if Su Hao had transmitted it over together.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring spatial influence?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also created a small world, then hid inside the small world, and found that the 'yun bo' still looked the same.</p><p></p><p>He paused and frowned in thought.</p><p></p><p>For a while, a pile of questions came rushing at him: Since it ignores spatial influence, why can't the disaster accurately lock onto his position? Could it be that 'yun bo' and disaster are two sides of the same coin, one virtual and one real? What is its full picture?</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Su Hao had to admit that the way this yun bo exists might exceed the comprehension of three-dimensional space creatures...</p><p></p><p>He quickly thought of similar situations: "It's like when Yashan plays role-playing games, controlling the character after the scene is transmitted. All the scenes around the character have changed, but one thing hasn't changed, which is: Yashan's gaze staring at the character on the screen hasn't changed."</p><p></p><p>And now, Su Hao is the character in the game, and the 'yun bo' is the 'Yashan's gaze' outside the display!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly had a thought: "Could there be something mysterious that has been staring at this universe all along?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, he shook his head: "Probably not...right? The greater possibility is that it's some kind of operating rule of this universe."</p><p></p><p>"Thinking too much is pointless, I should just focus on the task at hand! Whether it exists or not, I'll know in the future. Now, let me try the impact of my movement and motion on the 'yun bo'."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't guess wrong, his movement did indeed have a corresponding impact on the yun bo.</p><p></p><p>When he was active on the ground, the 'yun bo' connected to him would spread outward in all kinds of forms, basically like the focus of the 'elliptical system' he had speculated, releasing energy outward.</p><p></p><p>Just like when a stone is thrown into a lake, ripples spread out in rings.</p><p></p><p>He set his gaze on the source star below.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try something bigger, bombard the source star with all kinds of means..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the source star was riddled with holes and looked overwhelmed, but Su Hao knew that the source star was extremely tenacious, and a little bombardment was not even an itch to it.</p><p></p><p>'Chuanxing Zhi'!</p><p>'Wanbaozhi'!</p><p>'Twenty-four Dawnsword'!</p><p></p><p>This was the liveliest the source star had been in hundreds of years, full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao got the answer he wanted, he couldn't help but exclaim: "No wonder the shockwave from the particle flow that destroyed the spacecraft was so ferocious, it's indeed related to me destroying more than eighty planets..."</p><p></p><p>He thought, if he didn't destroy those planets, perhaps Yashan and Feng Cheng could have been saved.</p><p></p><p>After fiddling around for a long time, Su Hao returned to the temporary base, entered the pinball space, and made a simple summary of his gains over the past few days. At the same time, it was also to deepen his understanding and perception of the 'yun bo'.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and ten years later, through his research on the 'yun bo', Su Hao gained a superficial understanding of this deep universe.</p><p></p><p>Let's not discuss how big the universe itself is, because in Su Hao's view, perhaps the word 'big' cannot even describe the existence of the universe.</p><p></p><p>If we liken the 'universe' to a large spherical body, this spherical body is filled with water, with all kinds of fish and aquatic plants in the water...</p><p></p><p>But no matter what is inside the sphere, let's stipulate that all matter and energy will no longer increase or decrease, and must all follow fixed rules.</p><p></p><p>Then what situation would arise?</p><p></p><p>Very simple, the movement of all matter and particles inside the sphere in the future, how they combine, was all determined at the moment the sphere was formed. Just like water in a pipe, as long as the pipe is long and sturdy enough, the water will keep flowing forward.</p><p></p><p>For example: The accidental collision and combination of two particles inside the sphere was not accidental at all, but rather they followed the 'rules' inside the sphere, no matter how complex or how long it took, they were destined to eventually collide and combine.</p><p></p><p>Another example: The fish inside the sphere thinking about a problem, it thinks it's thinking, but it doesn't know that its thinking is just following certain rules of motion, determined at the moment the sphere was formed.</p><p></p><p>Everything, at the moment the sphere was formed, had already followed specific rules, its path of motion predetermined!</p><p></p><p>No matter how violent the motion of matter inside the sphere, no matter how wildly the fish thrash about...it has all been decided!</p><p></p><p>In other words: All matter inside the sphere, regardless of its state of motion, maintains a certain 'balance', with every particle following its predetermined path forward!</p><p></p><p>Everything was determined in an instant when the universe was formed!</p><p></p><p>Even human happiness, sadness, anger, thinking, action, choice...</p><p></p><p>Has been predetermined!</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao's existence happened to break this balance!</p><p></p><p>It's like a mysterious particle suddenly appearing inside the sphere...</p><p></p><p>What would happen?</p><p></p><p>Although this change seems insignificant, it has indeed occurred!</p><p></p><p>After a period of time, when the 'change' and 'influence' accumulates to a certain degree, it will impact the real material world, and ultimately under the action of the invisible 'focus system', take the form of a disaster and return to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>It can also be understood as: The feedback of the universe's state of 'inertial' motion.</p><p></p><p>It can even be understood as 'self-restoration'.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the actual situation, Su Hao summed it up in one sentence for now: "The universe is affected by me and is autonomously adjusting to restore itself."</p><p></p><p>He carefully considered: "In this way, many things make sense. However, many new questions and unexplainable things also arise...Perhaps what I understand is only the phenomenon of its operation, and there are deeper reasons waiting for me to explore."</p><p></p><p>Now there is one problem facing Su Hao: How to shield his influence on the universe?</p><p></p><p>In other words, how to deceive the 'disaster system', so that he can act unscrupulously without considering the consequences?</p><p></p><p>Even if he sees the 'yun bo', if he cannot prevent it from continuing to transmit energy to some unknown place in the universe, and the massive energy accumulates and rebounds back time and time again, he will still die!</p><p></p><p>Seeing is one thing, achieving is another.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if I can't figure it out, let me try starting from the 'yun bo' first, and summarize the rules of my influence on it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao calmed down again, quietly staying on the source star to do his research.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, year after year.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the 'yun bo' can only passively change under my actions, and there is no way to prevent its change!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The changes to the yun bo are chaotic and disorderly, I can't find any corresponding rules at all, or perhaps with my abilities, I temporarily can't discover its rules."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my research direction was wrong from the start. I don't need to try to change the yun bo, nor do I need to try to shield the yun bo, because that is simply impossible. I should start from myself!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The yun bo is connected to me, but connected to where? My brain, or my body?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's the brain! The root of the 'yun bo' is my brain! Or rather, it's the 'motion of my consciousness'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I think I understand now, my physical body is still the original physical body, my brain is still the original brain, the material has not changed, what has changed is the mode of motion of consciousness!</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the disaster after, it has nothing to do with me..."</p><p></p><p>But changing the mode of motion of consciousness is impossible, I am who I am, an unchangeable fact! What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible to hide the motion of my consciousness? If hidden, the 'universe' may sense that something is off, but it fundamentally cannot lock onto my position! At that time, maybe I'll be causing trouble over here, but the disaster will rebound to the neighboring galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem feasible, where can the brain hide? The 'yun bo' is just like the 'Yashan's gaze', as long as Yashan is still playing the game, the character cannot escape his gaze."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One hundred years later, Su Hao's understanding of the 'yun bo' deepened, but he still could not successfully shield the outward influence of the 'yun bo'.</p><p></p><p>That day, he once again entered the pinball space to observe his research and thoughts over the past hundred-plus years, and re-organize them from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that there was something he had overlooked.</p><p></p><p>When he reviewed the analogy of 'Yashan's gaze', he couldn't help but smile and sigh that the original analogy was so vivid, instantly using the most precise scenario to describe the existence of the yun bo.</p><p></p><p>However, as he smiled, his smile froze, and his pupils suddenly contracted!</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Yashan's gaze!"</p><p></p><p>"When Yashan controls the character to transmit, there is a moment when he cannot see the character."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it during the transmission? Transmitted, but not yet completed the transmission in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, transmission is not instantaneous, but rather a process, and in this process, although Yashan stares at the screen, he loses sight of the character's figure for an extremely short time, it's just that Yashan didn't notice it!</p><p></p><p>And corresponding to Su Hao, isn't that the 'second-level space'?</p><p></p><p>"Second-level space!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Su Hao immediately entered the 'second-level space', while observing the 'yun bo'.</p><p></p><p>The moment he hid in the second-level space, the 'yun bo' connected to his brain gradually disappeared, and finally broke off all connections!</p><p></p><p>And he also regained his 'white body'!</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as he hides in the 'second-level space', no matter how reckless he is, the disaster cannot find him.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but swear: "F**k! Such a simple answer, yet I spent so long looking for it."</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the experiment, Su Hao did not notice any abnormalities in the 'yun bo' before and after transmission, and even hiding in the small world didn't work, so he subconsciously assumed that the 'yun bo' would not change due to changes in space, but he didn't think that the 'second-level space' was actually a bug exploit.</p><p></p><p>Even when Yashan plays games, he wouldn't think that his character would actually lose sight of him in the instant of transmission, right?</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao came out of the 'second-level space', he found that the 'yun bo' was instantly reconnected to his brain.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, it's back, how interesting!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't put just the 'brain' into the 'second-level space'..."</p><p></p><p>Once entering the 'second-level space', it is equivalent to completely separating from the current position. If he puts only the brain into the 'second-level space', isn't that the same as removing and storing the brain separately?</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now? I can't just hide in the 'second-level space' every time I reincarnate, can I? What would be the point then?"</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, he had an idea: "It's not impossible to completely hide my brain in the 'second-level space', as long as I can keep the brain alive and allow information exchange, everything is fine."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Su Hao entered the pinball space and started writing and drawing, making plans, writing a big title in his notebook: 'Brain Miniaturization and Concealment'.</p><p></p><p>'Second-level space', 'small world', 'biotechnology', 'information transmission technology', 'source energy conversion technology', 'rune technology'...</p><p></p><p>A series of related technologies were taken out by Su Hao and integrated to solve various problems encountered.</p><p></p><p>And so, another hundred years passed!</p><p></p><p>You could say Su Hao completed it, or you could say he didn't, because the result was not what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>What he had imagined was his brain hiding in the 'second-level space', seamlessly connected to his body, controlling his body's actions.</p><p></p><p>It would have a similar effect to his consciousness hiding in the pinball space, remotely controlling his body.</p><p></p><p>However, in reality, information could not achieve seamless connection, and during the connection process, the 'yun bo' would follow the connection point and come knocking.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he came up with a solution, albeit not the intended one - a dual body!</p><p></p><p>The first body: The reincarnation body, which would directly hide in the 'second-level space' after reincarnation, never appearing again.</p><p></p><p>The second body: Evolve a physical body into an eighth-level anomaly [God], and then use the [God]'s body to walk around in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The principle is very simple:</p><p></p><p>Even for a [God], its consciousness information can be recorded in the pinball space, and once recorded, it will be controlled by the little black room.</p><p></p><p>All Su Hao needs to do is control the [God]'s actions in the pinball space using the little black room's functions!</p><p></p><p>It's just like playing a '3D realistic simulation game'!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed proudly, a hearty laugh.</p><p></p><p>In this game of cat and mouse with the 'disaster system', he had ultimately emerged victorious.</p><p></p><p>Although the method was a bit of a workaround!</p><p></p><p>Time flowed on, year after year.</p><p></p><p>Everything was quietly still.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also spent the remaining two hundred-plus years on this desolate planet.</p><p></p><p>For others, loneliness is standing on a bustling street.</p><p></p><p>His loneliness was truly having no one...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, Su Hao put down his work and came out of the second-level space.</p><p></p><p>He went to the mountaintop where the base was located, and sat down beside the [God] he had created from his own cells, gazing quietly into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The sun had set, and the clouds were half red.</p><p></p><p>The light gradually faded from Su Hao's eyes, leaving only cold desolation.</p>

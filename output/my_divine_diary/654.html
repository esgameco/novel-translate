        <h1>Chapter 654</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Two months passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>A spaceship suddenly appeared not far from Planet Yuyi No. 10, slowly approaching the massive tenth planet.</p><p></p><p>It then flew around the planet once, while evenly deploying a type of trumpet-shaped mechanical device, aiming them remotely at the tenth planet.</p><p></p><p>This was the cosmic energy wave receiving device made by Yashan, used to detect various unperceivable force fields.</p><p></p><p>After the ship completed one orbit, Yashan's voice came through: "Master Wei, the equipment has been successfully set up. Current detection shows everything is normal, we can start the operation."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao responded first, then transformed into [Destiny Child], layering various states, and flashed out from the ship, rapidly approaching the tenth planet.</p><p></p><p>After entering the atmosphere, he extended one finger and began gathering power. </p><p></p><p>The fingertip lit up, gradually intensifying and flickering with dazzling golden light, eventually engulfing his entire body. When the golden light reached its peak, Su Hao pointed down.</p><p></p><p>'Star-Piercing Finger'!</p><p></p><p>It soon covered the planet's surface.</p><p></p><p>This technique was designed by Su Hao specifically to drill a deep hole on a planet, with the aim of burying the 'Star-Shattering Cube' as deep as possible to increase the virus's erosion efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Throwing the 'Star-Shattering Cube' onto the planet's surface would work, but much slower. If buried inside the planet, the virus could quickly spread through the entire celestial body.</p><p></p><p>As the golden light gradually dissipated, Su Hao withdrew his finger. Sensing a bottomless hole had formed below, he took out a 'Star-Shattering Cube' inlaid with a high-quality source bead, set to activate in two minutes, and shot it down accurately into the hole.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waited for a moment and saw no anomalies, so he turned and flew out from the planet.</p><p></p><p>It would take some time to detect any abnormalities after the virus activated, so there was no point in staying.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the planet, Su Hao did not return to the ship but floated silently in the void, closing his eyes and extending his 'divine consciousness' to try and sense the fluctuations in cosmic energy before the planet's destruction.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the ship's detection room, Yashan nervously watched the operation indicators of various equipment, while Feng Cheng stood by, ready for Yashan's orders at any time.</p><p></p><p>Without turning his head, Yashan asked, "Fei Yao, Master Wei's operation has begun. Any abnormalities in the 'material motion' data on your end?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao shook his head, "No changes yet, perhaps it just started, let's wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Yashan frowned, wondering if there were problems with his equipment. But in theory, the equipment was just an amplifier to 'capture' fluctuations, not the focus of this experiment.</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by second by second.</p><p></p><p>Planet No. 10 also began to react, with frequent earthquakes, ground shaking, mountain collapses, crevices opening, volcanic eruptions, and explosions of special materials...</p><p></p><p>It was like a pot of water being boiled, starting with a few bubbles and mist, gradually reaching a full boil.</p><p></p><p>The entire planet was boiling!</p><p></p><p>This was the third planet Su Hao infected with the Planet Virus, and the largest in size. The violent changes occurring caught even Su Hao somewhat by surprise.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the ship was far enough from the planet to avoid being affected.</p><p></p><p>This was also the first time for Yashan and the others to observe from such a close distance as a massive planet was invaded by the Planet Virus. The changes happening on its surface left them extraordinarily shaken.</p><p></p><p>As Master Wei said, knowledge is power, indeed.</p><p></p><p>The kind of power they had pursued before, like wielding swords and killing, was mere child's play compared to destroying planets.</p><p></p><p>In just two hours, Planet No. 10 had swelled dozens of times larger than before, its originally light blue color now flickering silver-white.</p><p></p><p>With good enough eyesight, one could see the planet's surface densely covered in elliptical metal spheres, with some spheres occasionally erupting from underground, flying up into the air, and then falling back down motionless.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly opened his eyes and sighed, "During the planet's erosion by the virus, the various energy fields were indeed extremely chaotic, but I can sense that this is not the cosmic energy of the 'Catastrophe System' I'm looking for...</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps these chaotic force fields are also part of the 'Catastrophe System'?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was considering whether to go all out and send Planet No. 10 into space with an ignition device, Yashan sent a message: "Master Wei, the violent motions of the planet have caused 256 types of materials to undergo special movements. I have ranked them by intensity and await further verification of the cause..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes lit up. 256 types of materials - this was good news.</p><p></p><p>Since there were results, he would let Planet No. 10 remain for now. If further experiments were needed, he could revisit it.</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Su Hao transmitted back onto the ship.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, the swollen planet gradually shrank, forming a silvery metallic-like substance. Its volume had shrunk significantly compared to before, like a dehydrated grape.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the ship, Su Hao participated in researching and analyzing the 256 special materials, continually screening and eliminating them until only two remained as possibly corresponding to cosmic energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>One was an iron-based multi-element special structure mixture with a larger mass, named 'Seeker One'. The other was a carbon-based special structure mixture with a lighter mass, named 'Seeker Two'.</p><p></p><p>After studying together for a period, Su Hao and the others concluded: these two substances corresponded to two different fluctuations, but they could not confirm what exactly they were, perhaps just materials that reacted to specific frequencies.</p><p></p><p>What was certain was that they were not what Su Hao was looking for.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was not disappointed by this...</p><p></p><p>If it were that simple for him to succeed, he would find it abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao stared at the two special substances in thought, then suddenly looked up and asked, "Mr. Jia Wei, why don't we use 'Seeker One' and 'Seeker Two' to construct the 'Mind's Eye'? If we can successfully perceive the specific fluctuations they correspond to, it would mean our plan is feasible.</p><p></p><p>Then one day, once we find those special materials, 'Divinity Ascension' will also succeed."</p><p></p><p>The 'Mind's Eye' was a specific plan proposed by Su Hao based on Fei Yao's ideas.</p><p></p><p>The principle was to find materials that could sense 'cosmic fluctuations', then use those materials to analyze the appearance of the 'cosmic fluctuations', and write a system to map the materials' sensory activities to brain signals for neural connection.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it would be like giving the human body a specialized eye to probe these kinds of 'cosmic fluctuations', able to clearly 'see' these waves.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these fluctuations were not obvious enough for an organ to evolve to receive them naturally. But no matter, Su Hao would create one himself.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were corresponding sensing materials, it was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course, let's try using these two materials to construct the 'Mind's Eye'! If successful, 'Divinity Ascension' will be halfway done."</p><p></p><p>The other half rested on finding those special materials.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a jolt of excitement. If the 'Mind's Eye' plan succeeded, their 'vision' would undergo a qualitative leap, observing the universe from an entirely different perspective than the limited 'naked eye' view of mortals.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the 'Mind's Eye' was that powerful. In theory, as long as there were enough installation points and complete sensing materials, they could even observe all the radiation waves in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought inwardly, "Is it possible to create a specialized 'reconnaissance-collection' machine to assist me in this search? Relying on just us few people running around different planets is too inefficient, not to mention we could easily miss the corresponding materials."</p><p></p><p>This possibility was very high. Human power was formidable, but could also be negligible at times.</p><p></p><p>The worst case would be searching endlessly without finding what was needed.</p><p></p><p>What if Su Hao missed it by not looking back? Moreover, he disliked looking back.</p>

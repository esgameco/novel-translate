        <h1>Chapter 844</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>While Suhao was making some preparations for Yashan and Fengcheng, the five dragon clan deities imprisoned in the small world began whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>They each described the suffering they had endured from Lei'an's torment and the fear of being dominated during this period.</p><p></p><p>And they vowed that one day, they would return this humiliation they had suffered a hundredfold, to regain the glory of deities.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu was resentful about arguing with his avatar: "I never thought that the separate will I created could be so vicious."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Natier laughed: "It's not that your avatar is vicious, but that you, Lord Gu, are vicious. What I didn't expect was that our separate wills could break free from our control, it's simply unimaginable. To be honest, I'm not too willing to continue creating separate wills, it's tormenting oneself with uncertainty."</p><p></p><p>The Beauty Goddess Fuler curled her lips: "My lord Natier, without an avatar, how do you plan to act? Accept the faith of your followers with your divine light? Haha! According to Lord Lei'an, as long as we maintain a constant connection with our avatars, there is no risk of them going rogue. Perhaps you could find a weakness in Lei'an's abilities, then break him, and you'll never have to worry about this again."</p><p></p><p>Natier: "Find a weakness in Lei'an Oakes? Hey, good luck to you all. Lei'an Oakes is the strongest and most mysterious golden dragon I've ever seen, unparalleled. Of course, he's also the most evil and darkest golden dragon, to even conceive of such an experiment to torment the soul. To be honest, I've developed a tinge of fear towards Lei'an Oakes, which is simply unimaginable for a deity like myself."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu sneered: "Are you sure Lord Lei'an is from your golden dragon clan? Just because he looks like a young golden dragon? You foolish golden dragons, after all these years you haven't learned even a shred of my wisdom, still utterly foolish as ever."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Natier laughed: "That's right, such an extremely intelligent Thunder God, now imprisoned in a small place, still can't win against his own avatar. So intelligent that I can't help but laugh."</p><p></p><p>As a golden dragon, the Beauty Goddess Fuler said unhappily: "Lord Gu, I have no objection to you insulting Lord Natier, but please don't lump all golden dragons together. Do you need me to remind you that you almost killed Lei'an's mother by soul searching before?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu wanted to retort, but didn't dare. Fuler had instantly grasped his weakness, and what angered him most was that Fuler knew about it and even said it in front of everyone. Now all the deities could use this to control him.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu quickly changed the subject: "Based on my guess, Lei'an may not belong to our giant dragon clan, and not only that, he may not be human or mountain spirit either. I guess he's like Baijia'er, coming from the unknown depths of the universe, a completely different race than Baijia'er."</p><p></p><p>A flash of light seemed to pass through Natier's mind: "That's right, put that way, it makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu glanced at Natier with a hint of disdain, as if saying: This old golden dragon's brain must be waterlogged.</p><p></p><p>Fuler seemed to have already considered this possibility: "Of course, I've never doubted the mystery of this universe, no matter what happens, I feel I can accept it. So we can't view Lei'an through common sense."</p><p></p><p>After making a slight hint to achieve his goal, the Thunder God Gu laughed: "So while Lei'an is studying us, it's also a great opportunity for us to understand him, which may allow us to find his weakness and escape. Now that Lei'an is not around, we should exchange opinions.</p><p></p><p>I believe that Lei'an only appears powerful because we don't understand him. If we switch roles, with us in the dark and him in the light, then we could use our soul power to control him completely."</p><p></p><p>The other deities unconsciously agreed with Gu's words.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu turned to Natier and asked: "Lord Natier, as the first guest brought here, can you tell us how you were captured? There may be a lot of overlooked information in that."</p><p></p><p>After a long explanation, Natier still didn't make clear how he was actually captured.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the other deities also spoke about their capture process and feelings.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu keenly noticed a commonality: "In other words, we were all captured within three minutes after our avatars lost connection with us."</p><p></p><p>The other deities nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu revealed a bloodthirsty smile: "I understand now, contrary to our previous guess that Lei'an could directly locate our main bodies. Lei'an cannot locate our main bodies, but has a special ability to locate our main body's position through our avatars.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as he doesn't capture our avatars, he can't find the location of our main bodies. Even if the avatar is captured, it doesn't matter, as long as we sever our soul connection at the fastest speed before he uses his soul searching ability."</p><p></p><p>Natier exclaimed excitedly: "This means that as long as we can get out, Lei'an will never be able to find me again, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The other deities looked at Natier like an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Fuler reminded him: "Lord Natier, if you're worried about Lei'an not hearing you, you can speak louder."</p><p></p><p>Natier immediately shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>However, the Thunder God Gu said: "As for escaping, the premise is that we can stay alive to have a chance... And to stay alive, we need more deities to share our risk."</p><p></p><p>The other deities paused slightly, suddenly realizing something.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu laughed slyly: "We can assist Lei'an Oakes in capturing the human and mountain spirit deities.</p><p></p><p>Think about it, if Lei'an Oakes has eighteen deities at his command for research, doesn't that mean the research risk allocated to us will be greatly reduced?</p><p></p><p>This way, our chances of survival will increase!"</p><p></p><p>Natier and the other deities looked at this black dragon in shock, never expecting him to be so...clever!</p><p></p><p>Natier couldn't help but ask: "With us few deities, does Lei'an really need to capture more?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu said: "Haven't you noticed that this guy Lei'an is essentially very greedy? As long as I tell him that the eighteen deities all have different ability attributes, he'll definitely be interested in the other deities. And we can help him too, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"How can we help?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu said: "It's simple. We five dragon clan deities have been missing for so long, the humans must already know. If avatars or envoys bearing our marks suddenly appear, do you think the human deities will send avatars to investigate?</p><p></p><p>At that time, we'll have a bunch of new prison mates, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Natier and the other deities couldn't help but praise: "Lord Gu, you are truly brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a familiar human figure appeared beside the deities, with an amused smile: "You all seem to be having a lively chat! I didn't expect you all to be so clever, I underestimated you."</p><p></p><p>The deity dragons' avatars couldn't help but clench their buttholes tightly, a chill rising from the tightened area straight to their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p>"Our perfect scheme has been seen through by Lei'an."</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the combined human and mountain spirit sect armies successfully landed on Dragon Island.</p><p></p><p>But the dragon gods that the giant dragons had hoped for did not appear to save them.</p><p></p><p>The giant dragons organized a few ambushes on their own, but with naturally low morale, they were quickly routed by the human envoy armies and retreated step by step.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the huge power gap, the anguish of the giant dragons at having their territory invaded and their kin slaughtered could not bring them victory in the war.</p><p></p><p>Until the human army was about to attack their last line of defense - the Ancestral Lands - no miracle occurred, and their gods still did not appear to save them.</p><p></p><p>Only at this moment did they realize that what could truly save them was the power they held in their own hands.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their power was not enough to repel the enemy.</p><p></p><p>What should they do?</p><p></p><p>Should they call their youngest son Lei'an and ask him?</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu was in extreme torment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the human and mountain spirit deities were also extremely troubled.</p><p></p><p>The armies they had organized were about to reach the giant dragons' ancestral home of 'Ancestral Lands', but the giant dragon gods had not shown up at all.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>If the gods came out to confront them, they could cheerfully go forward and exchange greetings, then have a hearty battle. But now, no one could say what the situation was, even the usually decisive Bathing Light God Yi was frowning.</p><p></p><p>The deities gathered in a temporary palace, sitting in a circle, each frowning.</p><p></p><p>The Resurrection God Zhuxia spoke first: "In this situation, are the giant dragon gods planning to give us a surprise? Waiting until our army enters the Ancestral Lands, then completely ambush and kill us?"</p><p></p><p>The Earth God Weila was a short, only 1.5 meter tall mountain spirit, but his surging soul power prevented the other deities from looking down on him.</p><p></p><p>The Earth God Weila shook his head: "I understand the dragon clan very well. To them, the Ancestral Lands is a sacred ground that no outsiders are allowed to set foot on, they absolutely would not allow human or mountain spirit blood to be spilled there. For the dragon clan, that would be an absolute defilement.</p><p></p><p>Including the giant dragon gods, they have the same belief, so the guess that they would lure our army in to ambush and kill us does not hold up."</p><p></p><p>The Salvation Goddess Bai, currently a seemingly carefree young girl, laughed: "What if all the giant dragon gods are dead? Of course, I'm just joking, everyone doesn't need to be so serious, with those frowning looks, an outsider would think we've lost the war. We can just slaughter all the giant dragons!"</p><p></p><p>The Order God Hongguang laughed: "I think there's no need to deliberately slow our advance. We should push forward in one go and completely wipe out all the giant dragons, thoroughly occupy the giant dragons' Ancestral Lands. If the giant dragon gods are still around, they'll inevitably jump out, then we can all mock them together. For a thousand years, they won't be able to raise their heads again, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Bathing Light God Yi frowned: "Perhaps it has something to do with that Mysterious God, and they can conceal their aura... But Hongguang is right, we should proceed normally and wait for them to appear. Once they do, the truth will be revealed."</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshi and the Golden God Bali exchanged a glance, silently pondering countermeasures.</p>

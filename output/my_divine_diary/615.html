        <h1>Chapter 615</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue quickly arrived at his workstation and displayed all the data he had organized to demonstrate to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jia Wei, as you can see, most of this data is accurate, with only a small portion having some errors, but it doesn't affect our ability to summarize the patterns. I compared the data by factors like the timing and intensity of the disasters, grouped them, and through further subdivision, these data points eventually paired up.</p><p></p><p>I analyzed the data for all the regions in the same way, and the results all showed pairings, with only a few erroneous data points that couldn't be matched.</p><p></p><p>Initially I didn't understand why this was the case, until I happened to glance at the planet model you created, Mr. Jia Wei, and it dawned on me. Look at the shape of this planet we're standing on."</p><p></p><p>In a great mood, Su Hao played along with Fei Yue's explanation, glancing at the planet model nearby and chuckling, "It's ellipsoidal!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue excitedly gesticulated, "Exactly, it's ellipsoidal, but not just any ellipsoid - I've carefully calculated that our planet is close to a perfect ellipsoid.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, a thought suddenly occurred to me: if we view these paired disaster locations as the foci of an ellipse...</p><p></p><p>So I gathered data on terrain, weather, vegetation and more, and through calculations, I found five sets of disaster data pairs that could be the traces of ellipses with those points as foci.</p><p></p><p>I only found five sets, but it's enough for us to boldly conclude about these paired points!</p><p></p><p>Next, we just need to verify them one by one following this line of thinking!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily again, extremely pleased, "No need to verify, these disasters are indeed the foci of ellipses, no doubt about it!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue was just an ordinary Source Mage, lacking Su Hao's powerful divine sense to perceive the traces of the world's energy flow.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao's powerful divine sense could perceive it. Before Fei Yue mentioned the word 'ellipse', the energy flow Su Hao sensed in the world was completely chaotic, so he hadn't considered this angle at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been reborn into many worlds, and in each one the energy flowed chaotically, so it wasn't unusual for this world.</p><p></p><p>But when Fei Yue said 'ellipse', the little light in Su Hao's bouncing realm immediately processed all the data collected over the years, and Su Hao quickly found traces in the energy flow:</p><p></p><p>The disaster locations were positioned at the foci of the elliptical energy flows.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the case was cracked.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had finally found the answer to the 'system' by which matter transforms into Source that he had been searching for so long - it was the various large and small ellipses!</p><p></p><p>The answer was that simple!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao never imagined that the ellipses he had encountered so long ago actually concealed such a secret!</p><p></p><p>But why could ellipses instantly heat particles to the extreme?</p><p></p><p>This had to do with the properties of ellipses.</p><p></p><p>Light or particles emanating from one focus of an ellipse, after reflecting off the ellipse, will converge at the other focus, reflect again, and return to the original focus, cycling repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's perspective, if the energy within the ellipse's range converged at one point after reflecting off the ellipse, it could indeed instantly heat those particles to the extreme and transform them into 'Source'!</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Hao had tried various methods to transform matter into Source, all failing. Thinking back, it would have been strange if any had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "When you don't understand, it seems as difficult as ascending to heaven, but once you know the answer, it's like plucking it from your hand."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Fei Yue curiously asked, "Mr. Jia Wei, can you tell me what use this pattern in the data has for you?"</p><p></p><p>Since the other had helped him so much, Su Hao was naturally willing to share his research findings, "It's hugely useful! This is the secret of 'Source'!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Su Hao walked out the door.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng immediately congratulated him with big smiles, "Congratulations to Master Wei on his major research breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>They almost blurted out "Congratulations to Master Wei on his great achievement!"but managed to stop themselves in time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "This is also thanks to Fei Yue's help. Otherwise, if I kept working on it alone, who knows how many more years it would take. By the way, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, go prepare a nice meal so we can celebrate. After so many years of research, we finally have a result! The road ahead for our research will be much smoother!"</p><p></p><p>A celebratory meal!!!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's favorite activity was dining with Master Wei - it gave them an inexplicable feeling of New Year's joy.</p><p></p><p>The two glanced at each other, and Ya Shan said, "Feng Cheng, you get the ingredients ready. This time I'll do the cooking myself."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng replied, "Got it! What kind of juice would you like, Elder Ya Shan?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "I'd love a super mixed fruit juice! The thicker the better!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao transformed into the [Lifechild] form - three meters tall yet exceptionally slender and agile - and teleported away from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I thought, it's the operating pattern of ellipses. But this ellipse is immense, so vast that even with my divine sense's range, I could only glimpse a portion of it. No wonder I didn't discover it before."</p><p></p><p>Circling the ellipse once, he flew upwards, quickly exiting the atmosphere. Looking down at the red, blue and white marbled planet from above, he used the 'Far Sight' glyph to collect data on the ellipse's operation.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Su Hao grinned, having fully grasped the process of how the elliptical energy 'system' operated. He teleported back to the surface, casually plucking a tree branch and holding it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he mobilized his vast spiritual power outwards, constructing a massive spiritual energy system based on the observed 'elliptical system' structure, then controlled it to accelerate its operation.</p><p></p><p>In no time, it failed to work.</p><p></p><p>"The first failure was expected. Let's try again!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao made some adjustments and tried once more.</p><p></p><p>After a few more attempts, the ellipse he constructed surprisingly began operating automatically, forming a complete heating 'system'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a leaf at one of the foci showed a reaction, and in Su Hao's divine perception, it transformed into stable 'Source'!</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly grasped the trick and used his spiritual power to construct multiple elliptical systems simultaneously, heating the branch in his hand. The speed was thousands of times faster than using a 'Source Apparatus' or natural transformation.</p><p></p><p>In just ten minutes, most of the branch had transformed into 'Source'. Su Hao gently tapped it.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Five low-quality Source pearls emerged, though few in number. But that wasn't the point - the point was, Su Hao had successfully transformed matter into Source.</p><p></p><p>It was much simpler than anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the charm of the foci!</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual power consumed was quite a lot, but no matter. It can be gradually optimized later to the point where only a sliver of energy is needed to guide the elliptical system's generation."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stored the Source pearls away, then teleported back to the base and called Ya Shan, Feng Cheng and Fei Yue to the spacious grounds.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked around, his gaze finally settling on the wok shovel in Ya Shan's hand. "Ya Shan, give me your shovel."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan handed it over obediently.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao twirled it around, saying, "I haven't tampered with this shovel beforehand. Now I'll perform a little magic trick for you all. Hahaha! Fei Yue, watch closely - the power of ellipses!"</p><p></p><p>With that, his vast spiritual power surged forth, blowing Fei Yue's curly hair backwards.</p><p></p><p>In the time it took to take a breath, the massive spiritual power elliptical system was constructed, with the focus right on the shovel in Su Hao's hand.</p><p></p><p>This time Su Hao used up most of his internal spiritual power, transforming it even faster. In just five minutes, the shovel reached the critical point of transforming into Source pearls.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he tapped the shovel.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The shovel shattered, shards emitting a brilliant white light. When the light faded, six glistening high-quality Source pearls remained.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao declared, "Ellipses can transform matter into 'Source'!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yue's jaw dropped in astonishment!</p>

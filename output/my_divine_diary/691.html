        <h1>Chapter 691</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "I'm not totally clear on the details, but human scientists speculate that the Octopus Clan has deployed a vast network of signal spheres across various star domains, forming a massive signal network capable of detecting all kinds of abnormal signals.</p><p></p><p>Our starship Yuanxing was designed specifically to deal with this signal network. Among the signal nests, we appear just like an ordinary meteorite. Before being detected, we can evade the search of the signal spheres. However, once discovered, this camouflage becomes useless, and we'll be locked onto by the signal nests, making it impossible to break free.</p><p></p><p>Our current target is the domain of the Star-Eaters, because in that region is a blind spot in the Octopus Clan's signal nest network. There we can shake off the lock from the signal nests and camouflage ourselves again. Within the Star-Eaters' domain, the signal spheres deployed by the Octopus Clan cannot survive for long before being destroyed by the Star-Eaters. </p><p></p><p>So as long as we break the lock and have enough time to camouflage again, we can completely escape the Octopus Clan's lock."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his eyebrows, "I should be able to do that, right? Why didn't you say so earlier?"</p><p></p><p>The captain thought to himself, "Who knew you were so capable?"</p><p></p><p>However, they had already engaged the warp drive, which required pre-calculating the flight path. It would be difficult to stop before reaching the destination, just like a human jump - once the destination is locked and the jump begins, the landing point cannot be changed mid-air without interference.</p><p></p><p>Now that the captain knew this, it was too late!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Thanks, but no need. I'm not interested, absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>The captain, "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't understand the captain's intentions. If he knew the captain planned to quickly take him back to the Blue Galaxy, he would not have agreed. At least before evolving into a "God", he did not plan to return to the Blue Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>After all, without a "God" avatar, it meant he was still locked by the Cosmic Waves, and returning to the Blue Galaxy recklessly might bring some inexplicable disaster.</p><p></p><p>The living conditions for humans in this world were already difficult enough. If he couldn't help, he shouldn't make things worse!</p><p></p><p>Now that the Yuanxing had entered warp flight, he had plenty of time to study the Octopus Clan's physiology, which suited Su Hao's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Through this period of research, Su Hao discovered that the Octopus mutants' bodies had low genetic compatibility with the "Xingjiaren" sequence. After evolving armor, these soft-bodied creatures became very bizarre, not only failing to increase strength but also hindering tentacle movement.</p><p></p><p>If forcibly evolving along the "Xingjiaren" sequence, the death rate would become extremely high after the fifth level "Steel Armor King", with not a single one reaching the seventh level "Minzi".</p><p></p><p>The sequences with better compatibility were "Nitiaren" and "Tusiaren", easily evolving to the seventh levels "Quanzi" and "Changzi".</p><p></p><p>But integrating all sequences to evolve into a "God" was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>After seriously studying the failed cases of "Quanzi" and "Changzi", Su Hao quickly realized how lucky he had been to successfully evolve into a "God" before.</p><p></p><p>According to the data, to evolve into a "God", the "Xingjiaren" sequence was the best choice, unmatched by any other.</p><p></p><p>The key was that the seventh level "Minzi" of the "Xingjiaren" sequence possessed incomparable vitality. During the evolution into a "God", it would encounter all kinds of dangers, but the "Minzi's" powerful vitality overcame them all.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as the vitality was strong enough, there was a high chance of evolving into a "God".</p><p></p><p>The seventh-level mutants of other sequences had vast vitality, but paled in comparison to the "Minzi", insufficient to overcome the dangers of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Now Su Hao's problem was that the Octopus mutants could hardly evolve into "Minzi", lacking the vitality needed to evolve into a "God".</p><p></p><p>As for why he had to become a "God"?</p><p></p><p>He didn't want too many constraints on his future actions, constantly having to change bodies...</p><p></p><p>If using one, might as well use the best!</p><p></p><p>So what should he do?</p><p></p><p>After a few days of thinking, Su Hao quickly found a solution: don't pursue the mutant levels too much, don't be limited to the abilities of a single gene sequence, and find a way for the Octopus mutant to gain vitality comparable to a "Minzi".</p><p></p><p>Through research, he found that the difficulty in evolving into a "God" was having unparalleled vitality to overcome various accidents and difficulties, ensuring the body's survival until fully adapting.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Su Hao properly adjusted and inserted the "Minzi" gene sequence controlling vitality into the seventh level "Quanzi" or "Changzi" genes, these two seventh-level mutants might gain immense vitality.</p><p></p><p>Just like how he, as a "Xingjiaren" sequence mutant, possessed the "Dynamic Vision" of "Sunjiaren" and "Life Perception" of "Yexingren".</p><p></p><p>"It's feasible, worth a try!"</p><p></p><p>With this attempt, countless Octopus captives shed tears of fear and regret in Su Hao's miniature world, which they called the "Octopus Hell" - the most suitable place for evil-doers to suffer in the afterlife.</p><p></p><p>To them, Su Hao was the most terrifying human imaginable.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, another year passed.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing was still in warp flight, showing no signs of stopping.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao's experiments, after the test subjects dwindled to less than a hundred, finally made a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>He successfully evolved the Octopus into a "God"!</p><p></p><p>The "God" evolved from a human form resembled a human face, tiger body, scorpion tail, a horn on the head, muscular limbs, and wings on the back - flowing and uniquely beautiful.</p><p></p><p>But the "God" evolved from the Octopus had a snake-like head, hound body, dragon tail, and four long, sharp tentacles extending from the abdomen and back. The tentacle tips glistened coldly, as if able to tear through any solid matter.</p><p></p><p>Layers of pale red hexagonal crystal armor covered the entire body.</p><p></p><p>Pale blue linear patterns etched elaborate symbols across its body.</p><p></p><p>A fresh red armor encased this monster's surface in layers, like a steamed bun fresh from the oven, emitting wisps of red mist - extremely mystical.</p><p></p><p>Like an ancient mythical beast.</p><p></p><p>Except for the long tentacles, no trace of the Octopus remained.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully admired the "God" he had evolved in his miniature world laboratory, marveling, "This is a natural masterpiece! I'm just nature's mover. I'm very satisfied with this work."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao named this "God" the "Octopus God".</p><p></p><p>The "Octopus God" had no self-awareness, merely acting on faint instincts like a newborn animal, controlled by its body.</p><p></p><p>The moment this "Octopus God" successfully evolved, Su Hao used the Black Room to control its nine brains - every move was under his control.</p><p></p><p>From now on, this "Octopus God" would be Su Hao's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"However, the 'Octopus God' is different from the human-evolved God, so I need to rewrite a whole new 'Full Simulation Control System' tailored for it, allowing my consciousness to enter its body as if it were my own."</p><p></p><p>He had completed a control system for the "Human God" in his previous world, but the "Octopus God" would require major modifications.</p><p></p><p>He entered the exploratory space and observed the "Octopus God's" unique consciousness in the Black Room. "The difficulty of the 'Octopus God' control system lies in coordinating eight sub-brains with one main brain to control the body, different from how human consciousness operates. This control system will be much more complex."</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind and quickly found a path. "No rush, take it slow. Start by matching the brain signals for controlling the limbs..."</p>

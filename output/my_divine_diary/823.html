        <h1>Chapter 823</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The main consciousness of the golden god Bali was unaware that his split consciousness had not died. After recruiting a soul cultivator from his own sect and switching bodies, he headed straight for the Zongguang Continent.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, he arrived at the mountain palace of the dark night god - Yongshi.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, he saw a brown-haired woman sitting before a tea table, having clearly been waiting for some time.</p><p></p><p>Bali knew this was the dark night god Yongshi, just in a different body.</p><p></p><p>Bali sat down opposite Yongshi and got straight to the point: "My split consciousness suddenly lost contact, without any warning, perhaps it has completely died."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi also said, "My split consciousness is the same."</p><p></p><p>After exchanging information, they found the disconnections happened simultaneously, leaving them briefly silent.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Bali said with some frustration, "What kind of thing is this new god? I've thought about it a lot but can't figure out how I died those last few times. The first two times my brain was suddenly smashed but at least the split consciousness was successfully retrieved. But this time, everything is just gone."</p><p></p><p>In the past, when had he ever been so flustered? He could cheerfully accept or easily resolve any situation.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the situation left him with an indescribable sense of frustration.</p><p></p><p>How many years had it been since he last felt this way? But he didn't want this feeling at all.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi couldn't yet understand Bali's mood, since she had only failed once. She thought she just hadn't been prepared enough, and next time she encountered the new god, it wouldn't be like this.</p><p></p><p>However, the loss of a body and a consciousness still left her slightly displeased.</p><p></p><p>She said calmly, "Before knowing the other party's abilities, it was careless of us to approach so rashly. As long as we figure out his abilities, it should be much easier to deal with him. After all, many abilities that seem complicated on the surface actually have simple principles.</p><p></p><p>What we can tell is that in the dimension of split consciousness vision, my observation ability is stronger than his, but at closer range dimensions, his perception is stronger than mine. Perhaps when we went to that island, he had already detected us and struck first."</p><p></p><p>Bali shook his head, "Seeing it this way, we are powerless against him. Once we get close, he will detect us and take us out preemptively, without any chance to probe his abilities."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi glanced at Bali as if looking at an idiot, "You've lived so many years, it's really difficult for you, Bali."</p><p></p><p>Bali was dazed, "What do you mean..."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi said, "Nothing. What I mean is, if we really want to deal with this new god, there are ways, like directly targeting that giant red golden dragon and the three young red golden dragons. That would certainly draw out the new god."</p><p></p><p>Bali's eyes lit up and he clapped his hands, "Ah yes, why didn't I think of that? Our attack range is definitely enough to reach them. But that giant red golden dragon is about to return to the Dragon Continent, we won't make it in time if we go now."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi shook her head, "That's just an example, but we can't actually do that. Even if we did, we can't be the ones to take action. Because doing so would be severely provoking the other party, causing endless future troubles. So..."</p><p></p><p>Bali laughed heartily, "So you want to pass this information to the other gods? Yongshi, you really are full of mischief, but as my main god, it suits you perfectly! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The big bearded Xibo and others all knelt down to worship their god, but as their heads bowed, the ground beneath them seemed to waver.</p><p></p><p>They knelt in worship for a long time, but saw no movement from their god, and that pressure from the depths of their souls had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo couldn't help but raise his head to look up, but the space before him was empty, with no palace, stone table or deity in sight.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>What was that? Where was their golden god? Just a moment ago he thought he was about to be saved, but in the blink of an eye, everything was gone.</p><p></p><p>Xibo stood up and looked around - this was just the area they had been living in before.</p><p></p><p>Weiyi said in astonishment, "Just now I seemed to see our golden god Bali...but he suddenly disappeared in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>The others also said they had seen the golden god, that sense of awe in their souls couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>Xibo was just as perplexed, and after thinking for a moment said, "Perhaps it was a prank by this god Jiavi, or perhaps from constantly longing for our golden god, we experienced an illusion. In any case, let's treat it as if it didn't happen and continue training!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the golden god Bali, longed for by the rich squad, was explaining speechlessly, "I only know they are my servants, but I have countless servants and can't recognize them all."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said in surprise, "Your gods just casually spread your soul seeds around without any limits?"</p><p></p><p>Bali said, "A soul seed is just a soul force imprint. As long as we have enough soul force, we can have as many as we want. What limits could there be? We spread the soul seeds out, and the servants naturally cultivate with the soul seed as the core to increase its power.</p><p></p><p>If we gods run out of soul force, we can take it back from our servants - it's all the same origin soul force, no impact using it. So as long as someone wants to become my servant, I don't mind giving them a soul seed imprint. It's all benefits, no drawbacks! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "Saying it that way, you gods really are powerful, incorporating all intelligent races into a management system with yourselves as the core."</p><p></p><p>Bali casually pointed around and asked, "Lord Jiavi, what is this place? I tried earlier, no matter which direction I go, I end up coming back from the opposite side, just like the 'inch-sky paradox', hard to imagine. Is this your ability?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said casually, "Correct, this is my 'loop space' ability, carefully designed so that apart from sound and light which can propagate normally, everything else returns to the origin point."</p><p></p><p>Bali and Yongshi exchanged a glance, able to see the surprise in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if exchanging information, it was Suhao's turn to ask, "Can those implanted with soul seeds transform into gods through cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>When Bali heard Suhao ask this question, he immediately realized the other party was completely ignorant about soul force, yet had luckily transformed into a god through some fluke.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yongshi had no response, Bali said, "How could gods be existences that arise so easily? It is absolutely impossible to transform into a god through cultivation. Otherwise, do you think in the long history of this world, why have only eighteen gods been born? Oh, now there's you too, nineteen.</p><p></p><p>The essential nature of mortals is different from that of gods. Apart from you, the only true transcendent sacred beings in this world are those eighteen. The soul cultivators and soul guards you see in daily life are just blessings we eighteen gods have bestowed upon our servants."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then asked, "Then where did you gods come from? How did you transform from ordinary people into the lofty gods?"</p><p></p><p>The air suddenly stilled.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali's hearts pounded.</p><p></p><p>It had been who knows how many years since they last heard such a question directly probing their origins, because such questions were seen as challenging a god's authority.</p><p></p><p>'Born as gods' was the common understanding of all intelligent life, including them, and no one would bring up how they transformed into gods.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi said calmly, "Lord Jiavi, you should not ask such questions. You can know it in your heart, there's no need to ask it out loud or seek verification from other gods. That would be seen as a hostile act."</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised his eyebrows - these two had suddenly turned cold, which only piqued his interest and made him more curious about the gods' affairs.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed lightly, "But the problem is, I really don't know how an ordinary person transforms into a god, so of course I'll ask to find out clearly. This is also the reason I invited you here. What, are you unwilling to answer my question?"</p>

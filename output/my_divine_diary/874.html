        <h1>Chapter 874</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After a year of observation, Su Hao finally felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>The 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System' achieved the effect Su Hao had envisioned. As long as time passed, this world would take on a different appearance.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, Su Hao transmitted out from the experimental small world and arrived at the Paradise Channel formed by the arrangement of numerous islands.</p><p></p><p>He found an area with changeable ocean currents.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place! If I plant fruit trees here, the fruits they bear will be carried by these currents to random locations along the Paradise Channel. They may drift in the ocean until someone fishes them out, or be washed ashore on the various islands by the waves...Soon, this will become a paradise for adventurers, truly living up to the name Paradise Channel."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao submerged into the sea and built a massive small world underwater. After setting up the specific environment, he planted a sapling that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p></p><p>This sapling was the 'Talent Soul Tree' that Su Hao envisioned could bear special soul fruits. The entire sapling was enormously large yet lush with branches and leaves spreading out in all directions like a banyan tree.</p><p></p><p>The sapling's species used the strongest life force tree in this world. Su Hao had corrected its genes with biotechnology and implanted it with a cluster of special structured pure soul force to cultivate this special fruit tree.</p><p></p><p>The fruits the tree bore came in various varieties, which Su Hao collectively called 'Soul Fruits'.</p><p></p><p>The main functions of the Soul Fruits were twofold: first, they contained immense and pure soul force that could allow an ordinary person to gain tremendous soul force energy in a very short time, possessing great power in every move; second, they contained an 'invisible rune array' that granted a special supernatural ability, such as lightning, fire, storm, corrosion, poison, shearing, rebounding, shielding, explosion, rotation, flight...</p><p></p><p>However, this 'invisible rune array' was different from the form of Su Hao generating a rune array within his body.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's core rune array could be activated at will using forces like blood energy, spiritual power, magic power, and soul force. But the 'invisible rune array' in the Soul Fruits could only be powered by the soul force contained within the fruits.</p><p></p><p>The reason lay in the word 'invisible'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had integrated the rune array structure into the soul force in the form of information. The soul force within the fruits naturally possessed the ability to form specific rune arrays.</p><p></p><p>Simply put: the creature that consumed a Soul Fruit would have its will fuse with the fruit's soul force, perfectly acquiring the rune information carried within. When that creature used its soul force, it would instinctively shape the force into rune patterns, manifesting all sorts of special abilities.</p><p></p><p>And the creature that ate the Soul Fruit would naturally be able to use supernatural abilities, without needing to ponder why.</p><p></p><p>Simple, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>After successfully planting the 'Talent Soul Tree', Su Hao wrote a side quest and casually issued it to the deities for a hundred merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Ding dong!"</p><p></p><p>The deities hadn't heard such a wonderful sound for nearly two years. Upon hearing it now, their souls melted, and the entire Pantheon was excited.</p><p></p><p>"A quest, a quest has come! My merit points are here."</p><p></p><p>But after opening it: "Damn, it's only a hundred merit points. I've lost all motivation."</p><p></p><p>Recently, they had been earning large amounts of merit points, making them insensitive to these 'meager scraps'.</p><p></p><p>But...no matter how little, merit points were still merit points.</p><p></p><p>They casually opened the quest panel and found it was an update patch quest. This type of patch quest would occasionally appear two years ago but had stopped recently, making them think there would be no more patches.</p><p></p><p>"Patch Update Quest: A 'Talent Soul Tree' sapling has been born in the Paradise Channel. It innately possesses pure soul force and a special structure. Research has found that this 'Talent Soul Tree' can be integrated into the 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System' constructed by the deities, thereby unlocking new system functions.</p><p></p><p>Quest: Under the system's guidance, fine-tune the Pantheon's soul force structure to integrate the 'Talent Soul Tree' into the system.</p><p></p><p>Reward: 100 merit points, unlock new system functions, gain the ability to design Soul Fruit combinations.</p><p></p><p>Time limit: One month.</p><p></p><p>Quest Note: Soul Fruits can slightly enhance the strength of mortal avatars.</p><p></p><p>Please accept the quest and complete it promptly."</p><p></p><p>After reading the quest description, the deities' eyes were glued to the 'Quest Note'.</p><p></p><p>These so-called Soul Fruits could enhance the strength of their avatars?</p><p></p><p>For over a decade, they had been bullied by that self-proclaimed 'Mighty Demon Lord Chipu' red golden dragon. They had tried every means to deal with that red golden dragon, but each ended in defeat.</p><p></p><p>How could they, the eighteen supreme deities standing at the world's pinnacle, suffer such humiliation?</p><p></p><p>But almost all of the former Soul Technique followers had been depleted, while that vile red golden dragon still swaggered around boasting, "Tremble under the shadow of the evil and mighty Demon Lord Chipu, you scum!"</p><p></p><p>The more the deities thought about it, the angrier they became!</p><p></p><p>However, their followers were too weak, and their bodies too frail. Plus, they were bound by the Lightning Pavilion, unable to take action. They were powerless against those dragons.</p><p></p><p>What was even more infuriating was that the strike forces they had organized not only failed to make that vile red golden dragon break a sweat but also helped spread its 'Mighty Demon Lord Chipu' title across the world.</p><p></p><p>It made the deities seem like the real villains.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, under the temptation of merit points from the God of Order - Red Light, the other seventeen deities had been dragged down by him. After being humiliated by the 'Mighty Demon Lord Chipu', they had risen to the level of divine dignity, no longer caring about merit points.</p><p></p><p>The dignity of deities had to be reclaimed from that 'Mighty Demon Lord Chipu'!</p><p></p><p>Now, upon hearing that these so-called Soul Fruits could break through the limitations of their mortal avatars and gain strength, the deities were instantly excited.</p><p></p><p>This was the hope for revenge!</p><p></p><p>As for where this 'Talent Soul Tree' had sprouted from, the deities couldn't be bothered. They knew it must be some new plaything concocted by the Lightning Pavilion Lord, nothing too surprising.</p><p></p><p>The deities' initial lack of motivation upon seeing the hundred merit points had vanished. Without a second thought, they accepted the quest and eagerly fine-tuned their soul force structure according to the requirements.</p><p></p><p>A month later, the deities successfully activated the new system and integrated the 'Talent Soul Tree' in the Paradise Channel's sea area.</p><p></p><p>Filled with curiosity, they opened the 'Talent Soul Tree' panel.</p><p></p><p>A game-like attribute interface popped up.</p><p></p><p>"'Talent Soul Tree';</p><p>Special Ability: Produce unique Soul Fruits;</p><p>Current Yield: 10 fruits/year (The yield will gradually increase as the 'Talent Soul Tree' grows)."</p><p></p><p>Below was a brief introduction to the Soul Fruits: "Living beings that consume Soul Fruits will gain a special ability."</p><p></p><p>Then it listed all sorts of bizarre abilities, even including "making someone unable to hold their pee", causing the deities to marvel.</p><p></p><p>They began discussing enthusiastically in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Notice there are Soul Fruit delivery rules explained later. We can select corresponding abilities and send them to the 'Talent Soul Tree' to make it bear specific Soul Fruits. Not only that, there are also 'Hybrid Ability Fruits', but we need to spend merit points to refine them."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the 'Talent Soul Tree' generates Soul Fruits with abilities determined by us deities. This is wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"If we don't actively choose the abilities to send, the system will randomly select abilities to generate the fruits.</p><p></p><p>It seems we have a lot of authority, but in reality, it's no different from the random system, just with added personal preference.</p><p></p><p>For example, if it were up to me, I would definitely choose abilities like 'feeling the urge to pee with a little force', 'stunning the target for one second after successfully calling out their name', 'sage mode increasing strength tenfold', and so on. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the Paradise Channel is bound to become very interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, those abilities are indeed not bad. I can't imagine who came up with such bizarre abilities. To be honest, I do want to try tasting one."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the God of Bathing Light - Yi of the Pantheon flickered unsteadily: "Does this mean we can customize abilities we like for our own avatars?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yi is being a bit fanciful. According to the information above, the fruits have the ability to block our perception and randomly scatter across the Paradise Channel. How could we find specific fruits?"</p><p></p><p>"Simple, as long as we control the entire Paradise Channel and have everything in our grasp, then all the produced fruits will belong to us."</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant, that's the benefit of monopolization."</p><p></p><p>Thus, the deities enthusiastically discussed how to take over the entire Paradise Channel.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed 'Mighty Demon Lord Chipu', who had already become the overlord of Dragon Continent, had repelled the Soul Technique followers' attacks many times. He was now ambitiously preparing to travel through the Paradise Channel to another continent, spreading the name of his 'Demon Lord Chipu's Army' across the entire world.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord brothers, the humans' strength can no longer obstruct the advance of our Demon Lord's Army. Follow the Mighty Demon Lord in spreading terror to every corner of the world!"</p><p></p><p>"Owoooo--"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dazed young red golden dragon asked, "Mighty Demon Lord Chipu, aren't we going to save the deities?"</p><p></p><p>The demon lords fell silent and turned to look at the dragon who spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Demon Lord Chipu didn't mind and laughed heartily. "You must be new here! Hahaha! No worries, let me reiterate our ultimate goal: saving the deities.</p><p></p><p>But our enemy is too evil and powerful. With our current strength, we cannot accomplish saving our deities yet.</p><p></p><p>So what we must do now is endure.</p><p></p><p>We must conceal our true purpose of 'saving the deities' behind the seemingly evil yet righteous goal of 'spreading terror across the world'.</p><p></p><p>We will mislead our enemies and let them become complacent.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, we will seize the chance to bolster our strength. In the moment our powerful enemy is negligent, we will strike the fatal blow and rescue the deities.</p><p></p><p>No matter what we go through, do not forget that our hearts are righteous."</p><p></p><p>The demon lord dragons were fired up.</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Demon Lord Chipu shouted loudly, "Brothers, to achieve ultimate victory, can you not even endure the humiliation of restraint? Do you have so little fortitude?</p><p></p><p>Come, brothers, demon lords, tell me loudly, do your vast hearts have the capacity to withstand the setbacks, suffering, cruelty, humiliation, bloodshed, and sacrifice on the path to victory..."</p><p></p><p>"Owoooooo--"</p><p></p><p>Watching the group of excited dragons fanning their wings before him, the Mighty Demon Lord Chipu thought to himself, "I almost believed my own words!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao, who had witnessed all this, clicked his tongue in admiration. "I didn't expect Chipu actually has some talent as a demon lord!"</p>

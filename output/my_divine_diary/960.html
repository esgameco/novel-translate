        <h1>Chapter 960</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After going through various tricks and power struggles, the two teams of reincarnators finally achieved their respective goals: king against king, general against general, soldier against soldier.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King and the Demon Prince engaged in a one-on-one duel, while the travelers from both teams hid amidst the chaos, waiting for a chance to take out the other side.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Demon Prince from the Baiutu squad was at a bit of a disadvantage, but the bald burly man from their squad had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>He believed the Demon Prince could withstand the Demon God King for a while without issue. During that time, they would use their superior numbers to swiftly eliminate the reincarnators from the Sikong squad, as well as the Demon God King's guards. Then they could focus their forces to take down the Demon God King.</p><p></p><p>There was some risk involved.</p><p></p><p>But the missions their reincarnation squad undertook were inherently full of risks.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the short-haired woman opened her eyes and messaged the group: "I've found the enemy. They're not in the city, but outside. It seems they don't dare enter and are up to something."</p><p></p><p>The bald burly man smiled and messaged back: "Let's go meet our opponents. That place will make a fine graveyard to bury them in."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Demon God King, clad in his imposing armor, looked at the young demon holding a silver spear and said in a deep voice: "Raviel, what gives you the strength to dare stand before me and challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the Demon God King, the Demon Prince Raviel appeared very composed: "Your Majesty, you have grown old and can no longer lead our demon race to glory. You have lost the honor befitting a demon ever since seven thousand years ago. Otherwise, why would so many demons challenge you?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King shook his head: "Raviel, you are mistaken. That is not the reason for you to stand before me or to defeat me. Only strength can overcome me. And you are still far from it!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Prince remained unmoved: "That remains to be seen. We shall see the truth with our own hands. Perhaps you do not know, but I have sensed your weakness. For the first time, I realize even the Demon God King will age and die.</p><p></p><p>Even if I fail, it does not matter. There will be an endless stream of demons challenging you until your complete downfall.</p><p></p><p>For this era no longer needs a decaying ruler like you. The six surrounding races are poised to invade our lands and homeland at any moment, while you still maintain that false peace with the other aging rulers.</p><p></p><p>Hah, that fragile facade cannot be trusted wholeheartedly. If this continues, you will inevitably lead our demon race to eternal abyss.</p><p></p><p>Let me tell you something - the Earth Spirit King of the Earth Spirit race is already dead. The Earth Spirits are prepared to attack the surrounding races.</p><p></p><p>And we may very well be their target, while you are completely unprepared."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King asked: "Then what do you propose?"</p><p></p><p>Raviel said solemnly: "Simple, drive out all six surrounding races and clear a large buffer zone for our demon race."</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King laughed madly: "Arrogant fool. Enough talk!" </p><p></p><p>With that, the Demon God King flashed forward, appearing beside Raviel and throwing a punch.</p><p></p><p>Raviel sneered: "Perfect timing, let me show you the power to 'create two principles from one, deflect a thousand pounds with four ounces'..."</p><p></p><p>BANG!</p><p></p><p>Raviel was sent flying, smashing through countless walls and plowing a trench into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The stunned Demon God King thought: "So fragile? Did I use too much force just now? I better not have killed him, or how will I retire?"</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Raviel did not disappoint him. He struggled back up, coughing out fresh blood: "As expected of the Demon God King...still so powerful even in old age. I'll let you off this time, but I will return..."</p><p></p><p>"Pffft--"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Raviel wanted to leave, the Demon God King immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, looking shocked: "As someone worthy of challenging me, you are indeed formidable. The mere force of your recoil has severely injured me. I feel I cannot go on."</p><p></p><p>Raviel: "......"</p><p></p><p>Is this for real or not?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The two reincarnator teams fought wits and strength outside the city. Eventually, the Baiutu squad emerged victorious while the Sikong squad failed again, with only three of their six members escaping, suffering heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>The Baiutu squad also lost two, leaving four survivors.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the remaining four from Baiutu returned to the city, rallying a large army to join Raviel's battle against the Demon God King.</p><p></p><p>The fight between the Demon God King and Raviel was utterly devastating, almost destroying the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Both appeared severely injured and on the verge of death, but they just hung on by a thread, refusing to fall.</p><p></p><p>The bald burly man frowned: "It seems Raviel can't hold on much longer. We need to join the battle and lend him a hand."</p><p></p><p>So the four remaining Baiutu reincarnators joined the battle between the two rulers.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Demon God King laughed uproariously and switched targets, knocking out all four Baiutu reincarnators one by one with his hammer.</p><p></p><p>Then he said with satisfaction: "Ah, refreshing! This is the feeling I wanted - to vent all the pent-up resentment from being bullied years ago. That vile anger in my chest is finally gone."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Raviel take the opportunity to thrust his spear forward, he made no attempt to dodge, allowing the spear to pierce his heart. He thought: "I leave the demon race to you, Raviel. If the demons fail, I will return to lead the survivors into hiding in the 'Outer Realms'."</p><p></p><p>BOOM!</p><p></p><p>The Demon God King's body exploded.</p><p></p><p>In a place unknown to all demons, the Demon God King's soul quietly slipped away and soon possessed a human body. Before long, he awoke: "This human form is pitifully weak, but I will quickly regain my peak strength. Once I recover my power, I will team up with my old classmates to find our teacher. I believe after all these years, he will accept us again."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the Soul Network's Celestial Realm, Clerk Cao reviewed the mission results of these two reincarnator teams. Scratching his head, he pulled out a handful of hair, utterly baffled: "Huh? How did this turn out so differently from what I envisioned? The Demon God King died so quickly? And I had such high hopes for the Baiutu squad, but they got wiped out just like that. This shouldn't have happened..."</p><p></p><p>"Should I use the memory modification program to give them another chance? Yeah, I'll give them one more shot since they still have a final revival opportunity left. Might as well use it since there aren't many teams I'm betting on anyway."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Bari suddenly appeared beside Clerk Cao, laughing heartily: "Little Cao, our Demon Realm is officially opening! I'm inviting you to attend our grand opening ceremony. We've even arranged an honorable position for you - Demon Realm Image Ambassador. This is the highest rank in the Demon Realm aside from the Supreme Demon King Chipu and us eighteen deities. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since the eighteen deities witnessed Clerk Cao create the second generation Deity and receive sincere praise from Lord Jia, their attitude towards him took a 180-degree turn, treating him as affectionately as their own little brother.</p><p></p><p>They stated that going forward, Clerk Cao would be fully in charge of the second generation Deity, while they only provided limited suggestions.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Clerk Cao knew these deities were just lazy, mostly indulging in various online games or coming up with all sorts of creative endeavors in the Demon Realm...</p><p></p><p>Clerk Cao asked in surprise: "But didn't you already have an opening ceremony three thousand years ago? Why another one now?"</p><p></p><p>Bari put his arm around Clerk Cao: "You don't understand. The previous environment wasn't ideal, so it didn't really count. Now the Supreme Demon King Chipu has found a brand new life-bearing planet. He's decided to relocate the Demon Realm's headquarters to that picturesque world and populate it with a large number of dragons as the core residents of the new Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>So we unanimously decided to hold another grand opening ceremony to give all new Demon Realm residents a warm, homely welcome. You don't need to worry about the details, just come."</p><p></p><p>Clerk Cao said helplessly: "Alright. But I still need to oversee the second generation Deity! There have been quite a few loopholes in the recent advanced missions that need patching..."</p><p></p><p>Bari waved dismissively: "That's not urgent. What's the harm in letting it run automatically for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Clerk Cao thought about it and agreed it didn't really matter if he watched or not most of the time. Curiously, he asked: "What kind of planet did the Supreme Demon King find? He's discovered quite a few before but never made such a big deal about holding an opening ceremony."</p><p></p><p>Bari laughed mysteriously: "It's an exceptionally rare intelligent race called the Demon Humans. Not only do they have a decent appearance and strength, they'll make a perfect core race for the new Demon Realm headquarters. Holding another grand opening is well worth it. You'll understand once you go."</p>

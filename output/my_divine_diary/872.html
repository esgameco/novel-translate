        <h1>Chapter 872</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The first phase of the task 'Transforming the New World' was 'Transforming the Ten-Colored Plates', which all the deities were able to complete smoothly within a year, before moving on to the second phase. </p><p></p><p>The content of this task was to provide business training to the deities, similar to training customer service representatives before they start their jobs. Only after the deities' business abilities reached a certain level would they be considered to have completed the task and receive rewards.</p><p></p><p>Using soul power networks to control the entire world was not a simple business, and placed very high demands on each deity.</p><p></p><p>It was not until five years later that the eighteen deities barely met the requirements, ensuring they would not make low-level mistakes.</p><p></p><p>After the World-Building Assistant announced the completion of the second phase, the deities all breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao gradually manifested and smiled, "Congratulations to you all on successfully completing the pre-job tasks. Now, you are all qualified deity service staff. Each of you is truly a fortunate child beloved by this world. None of you are slackers - very good."</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned slackers, the deities couldn't help but frequently glance at the Deity of Watchfulness - Nati, no doubt silently mocking this chief deity in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>When he was the opponent, they didn't think much of it, but once he became a teammate, they realized the terrifying nature of the Deity of Watchfulness - Nati.</p><p></p><p>Nati: "??Why is everyone looking at me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "However, deities, your challenges have only just begun. Being a qualified deity service staff is far from enough. Your goal should be to become an outstanding and great deity service staff. But to become such an excellent and great existence that brings blessings to all beings, simply staying in your own small world and practicing diligently is completely insufficient. You also need practical experience to improve your business abilities."</p><p></p><p>"So, the next is the third phase of the task. You will go to your assigned workstations and shine there, transforming this world from the bottom up."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao spoke with great passion, but the deities' emotions were exceptionally calm, because what they had to do had nothing to do with what Su Hao expressed verbally.</p><p></p><p>The task requirements they received were as follows:</p><p></p><p>Second Phase Task: The main Ten-Colored Plate bodies will be stationed at designated workstations, and according to procedural requirements, work with the other seventeen deities to build the 'Soul Power Network' enveloping the entire Ten-Cross Star, activating the 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System'. Unless under special circumstances, do not leave your workstation without permission.</p><p></p><p>Expected duration: Two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Please accept the task and promptly arrive at your designated workstation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they would have to fix their main bodies in one location, unable to move around freely. And two thousand years...</p><p></p><p>After two thousand years, they still might not gain freedom. At that time, Su Hao could easily find an excuse to add more time, and they would have to obediently accept it, unless they didn't want to live anymore.</p><p></p><p>In that case, what was the difference between them and machines?</p><p></p><p>At first, they really believed Su Hao's lies and thought the relationship between them was one of equal cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Now they realized they didn't even have the courage to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked in surprise, "Eh? You're not happy?"</p><p></p><p>The deities responded numbly, "Happy, Lord Su Hao."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's good. No need to delay then, I'll take you to your workstations right away! Oh, by the way, since you can't come back for a while after going to your workstations, do you want me to bring your 'small worlds' over for you?"</p><p></p><p>The deities' eyes finally showed a glimmer of light, "We can bring our small worlds over too?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Of course, but it's not easy. It requires five thousand points."</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>They had just received twenty thousand points, and immediately a quarter would be deducted? Lord Su Hao was really too ruthless.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's arrangements, the eighteen deities were scattered to various locations in the Ten-Cross Star world, entering a secluded small world within a Ten-Colored Plate that they could not freely enter or exit, but could still communicate with the outside.</p><p></p><p>And this would be the 'workstation' where the deities would reside for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao did allow the deities to send out avatars with suppressed abilities to go out and be active. The meaning of suppressed abilities was to restrict the deities' power, allowing them to walk around in the form of ordinary people, so as to minimally disrupt the normal processes of this world.</p><p></p><p>If an avatar happened to be killed, it was no problem - they could redeem a new one from the store for a hundred points.</p><p></p><p>Under the countdown prompts from the World-Building Assistant, the eighteen deities all prepared to activate the 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System' at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The moment the countdown reached zero, the eighteen deities simultaneously activated the system.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an invisible microscopic information radiation world, a vast network that could not be seen by anyone, enveloped the entire planet within a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>After that instant, the entire world became different.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, this vast network became more and more interconnected, denser and clearer, eventually reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>The deities felt the effects most clearly, and soon they couldn't help but exclaim in the group:</p><p></p><p>"I can actually...see the entire world, it's unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"I can see the whole planet too, vividly, and just by thinking about it, my vision can reach any location, just like opening a world map when playing games. I never imagined the 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System' would have such a function. How did Lord Su Hao manage to achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a question we should ask ourselves. We operated the entire process, and even the core of the system is our main Ten-Colored Plate bodies. We should ask, how did we manage to achieve this? But I don't know the answer to that question."</p><p></p><p>"You're just stating the obvious."</p><p></p><p>"The one with the most powerful perception abilities is the Deity of Eternity, but as far as I know, at most she can only observe the situation of a single continent, right? To be able to sense an entire continent like this is unimaginable for Lord Su Hao's power."</p><p></p><p>"No, it has nothing to do with power, it should be said that Lord Su Hao's wisdom is unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>"Are you just arguing for the sake of it?!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>This 'Automatic Soul Bestowal System' undoubtedly had an extremely strong impact on the deities. They sensed that the system's functions were not limited to what they had discovered - they found that this system could operate and gain energy to expand itself without them having to operate it manually.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Order - Red Light happened to be assigned to the northern part of Dragon Continent, which used to be the territory of the Deity of Watchfulness - Nati. He complained unhappily, "Why was my workstation arranged in this desolate place with no people at all? It's too barren."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Watchfulness - Nati couldn't help but retort, "You're occupying my old territory and you're still not happy? Consider yourself lucky. I ended up in the Heaven's Vast Grasslands, Bali's territory - it's noisy as hell every day."</p><p></p><p>Bali: "That's the Golden Land, a paradise for living beings. Your territories are the real wastelands."</p><p></p><p>More and more deities joined in the mockery. Eventually, Red Light said, "Screw this, if you're not satisfied, let's go one-on-one."</p><p></p><p>"Bring it on, I'm not afraid of anyone."</p><p></p><p>Not satisfied with just gaming, the deities all sent out their 'ordinary human' avatars, intending to find each other offline for a physical brawl.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ever since Su Hao planted a pure soul seed within him, the Crimson Demon King had been diligently hiding in his demon lair, absorbing and digesting evil power. Finally, three years later, he reached the 'Primordial Soul' realm and truly gained transcendent power.</p><p></p><p>He began practicing various powerful soul arts, and two years after that, he successfully created his own 'Demon King Soul Seed', implanting it into his underlings to spread his power. He then officially took on the identity of 'Great Demon King' and bestowed the title of 'Demon King' to his long-time dragon underling.</p><p></p><p>Thus, amid the cheers and praises of his subordinates, the 'Crimson Great Demon King's Army' was officially established.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King stood on a towering mountain peak and gazed down at his dragon underlings with fiery eyes, declaring, "Demon Kings, brothers, our 'Crimson Great Demon King's Army' is officially established today. Let's cheer for the birth of our army!"</p><p></p><p>"Owooooâ€”"</p><p></p><p>He continued, "The birth of evil is the most important moment in history. We must let all life in the world know of our arrival. In the name of evil, in the name of the Demon King, follow me in spreading our roars throughout the entire world."</p><p></p><p>"Owooooâ€”"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Crimson Demon King's soul power keenly sensed a strange fluctuation of soul power sweeping past, instantly enveloping this land in an instant. After carefully sensing it for a while and finding no other abnormalities, he ignored it, only thinking to himself, "Why do I feel like things have become a bit different...nevermind, my Demon King's ascension ceremony is more important."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, he cast aside the abnormal sensation.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King spread his dark red wings, turning his back to the sun and casting a large shadow. "Our declaration is: Let the world tremble under the shadow of evil!"</p><p></p><p>"Owooooâ€”Let the world tremble under the shadow of evil!"</p><p></p><p>Then the Crimson Great Demon King led several dozen newly promoted 'Demon Kings' on a tour of the Dragon Continent territory, shouting out their declaration at every stop to spread the name of the 'Crimson Great Demon King's Army' throughout the entire region.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Crimson Great Demon King was leisurely touring, an ordinary human with a horrified expression frantically dodged through the demon king group, but ultimately could not escape and was stomped into a meat patty by one of the fanatical dragon demon kings of the 'Crimson Great Demon King's Army'.</p><p></p><p>"Splat."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 988</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>But the joy only lasted a second. Lyu Yijiang immediately shouted loudly, "Cong Renfei, you run! The enemies ahead are formidable!" </p><p></p><p>In his view, Cong Renfei and the guys they were fighting back and forth with could definitely not be a match for the intimidating Red Light Venerable in front.</p><p></p><p>Wait, don't let them get trapped again after being rescued.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei turned to look at the God of Order - Red Light, and couldn't help but frown, thinking secretly, "Who is this person? There's actually an aura of a 'God' around him..."</p><p></p><p>That's right, in the over 8,000 years of wandering the Infinite Land, Cong Renfei had never seen the Eighteen Deities, only learning of their existence through some channels.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the Eighteen Deities were very familiar with Cong Renfei. Initially, the eighteen of them nurtured Cong Renfei's growth like nannies, their hearts pounding when he encountered danger, and cheering joyfully when he overcame it. They even designed various tasks to help him grow rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Now, the nanny and the one being nurtured met in person.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the one being nurtured didn't recognize this nanny of his.</p><p></p><p>The God of Order - Red Light sized up Cong Renfei, remaining silent for a moment, the smile on his face gradually fading away, thinking secretly, "Should I say hello or something..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei and Red Light looked at each other for a while, then Cong Renfei asked first, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He searched his memory and confirmed that he had never seen this person before, but the aura around this person was extremely powerful, indicating formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>This was unacceptable to Cong Renfei, because he had met some powerful people before.</p><p></p><p>He had met people from both the Twin Blades Sect and the Infinite Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now a strange expert suddenly appeared, which surprised him.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this person's body seemed to be that of a 'God'.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that a 'God's' body costs 200,000 points in the Shopping Mall, which he couldn't afford.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cong Renfei ask, Red Light revealed a smile and said, "Gail, no, I should call you Cong Renfei. You may not recognize me, but I'm very familiar with you. Not just you, but also your sister Cong Shurong.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that's not important. What's important is that we can formally get acquainted now. I'm the 'God of Order - Red Light', one of the Eighteen Primordial Deities in your perception."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's eyes narrowed slightly, not expecting the person in front of him to know his two identities. He asked solemnly, "You're one of the Eighteen Primordial Deities?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light chuckled, "Of course, I have no need to lie to you."</p><p></p><p>The arrogant Eighteen Deities, self-proclaimed powerful gods, were very disdainful of lying. They would either not speak or tell the truth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Red Light suddenly found it very amusing, like watching a child he had nurtured grow up. He couldn't help but burst into hearty laughter.</p><p></p><p>He recorded the current scene and casually shared it in the exclusive group of the Eighteen Deities.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei frowned, though he found it hard to believe, he still nodded in acknowledgment of Red Light's words. He also believed that such a powerful person would not stoop to lying.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had always thought the Eighteen Primordial Deities only existed in myths and legends, not actually existing.</p><p></p><p>Because when he crossed over to the Cruciform Star, the Eighteen Deities had already been imprisoned by Su Hao for over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years was enough time for everything created by the Eighteen Deities over tens of thousands of years to vanish, leaving only their existence in legends.</p><p></p><p>At least Cong Renfei didn't think the Eighteen Primordial Deities truly existed.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because the folklore about the Eighteen Primordial Deities was too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei didn't care about all that. He also didn't care who or where the Eighteen Deities were.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at Lyu Yijiang's trio and said, "God of Order - Red Light, these three are my friends. Could you release them first? If there was any offense, we can discuss it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Red Light chuckled, "These three are your friends? If so, then it's fine. I'm willing to give you face, after all... Hahaha! How amusing."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he waved his hand to release the restraints on Lyu Yijiang's trio.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's trio immediately came to Cong Renfei's side, looking at the two parties in shock and confusion. They couldn't quite grasp the situation now.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei thought secretly, "This guy who calls himself the God of Order doesn't seem that powerful. Looks like the kind I could defeat in two minutes. Didn't expect him to be so arrogant, he must have some backing."</p><p></p><p>That's right, although Cong Renfei was raised by the Eighteen Deities, in an actual fight, the Eighteen Deities were no match for Cong Renfei...</p><p></p><p>If Cong Renfei and Red Light really fought now, Red Light might not even be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>The spatial abilities the Deities relied on were completely suppressed by the 'Dual Space Suppression Rune Formation' Cong Renfei had learned.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Deities had no ability to counter space abilities, not even any such spells in the Shopping Mall.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between a true disciple and an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, up until now, the Eighteen Deities had not been beaten down by a true disciple, so they didn't realize their spatial abilities were not invincible.</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King and old Furry Tail King hid trembling in a corner after seeing Cong Renfei appear, screaming inwardly, "Oh shit, another big shot from the Infinite Land has shown up. This guy must be the second disciple of the Twin Blades Sect, 'Jade Dragon Celestial'! I've happened to see his portrait circulating in the Infinite Land, I definitely won't mistake him.</p><p></p><p>It's said that when you encounter this big shot, the best thing to do is run immediately. If you can't run, then just lie obediently on the ground. This is an existence you can't afford to offend."</p><p></p><p>Then they looked at their senior, the Venerable of Order, who was actually conversing so calmly in front of the 'Jade Dragon Celestial', occasionally bursting into laughter.</p><p></p><p>It seemed their senior's strength was so formidable that he was undoubtedly the top expert in the entire Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>The old Giant King and old Furry Tail King thought inwardly, "Damn, we're riding an extremely buff big thigh now."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lyu Yijiang's trio freed, Cong Renfei had no intention of lingering any longer. He said directly, "Since that's the case, we'll take our leave first. If my friends offended you earlier, please forgive them."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he casually took out two bottles of spirit restoring pills and tossed them to Red Light, "This is compensation, please accept it."</p><p></p><p>But Red Light didn't accept them, waving his hand to return them to Cong Renfei, "No need. You wait here for a bit, some old friends of mine want to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Your old friends want to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Red Light chuckled, "You'll know in a bit."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, seventeen Deities transmitted over one after another, smiling warmly as they greeted Cong Renfei like doting mothers seeing a filial son.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "......"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dazed, what was going on exactly?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the old Giant King and old Furry Tail King were utterly shocked by the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Venerables of the Demonic Realm had actually gathered here together...</p><p></p><p>As former students of Mount Aiya, they shouldn't be so alarmed in theory. But facing their own teachers was different from facing others.</p><p></p><p>Their teachers wouldn't eliminate them, while others might not show the same restraint.</p><p></p><p>They instinctively felt that while their teachers might be extremely powerful, almost invincible, offending their own teachers was better than offending other formidable existences.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's trio looked at the eighteen powerful ancient gods standing before them, extremely nervous. Not a single one of them could be defeated, let alone all eighteen together. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, each one seemed exceptionally formidable.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Cong Renfei off to the side, worried that his fists alone could not prevail against so many opponents...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities seemed very excited, chatting fervently in their group.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, it's been thousands of years, hasn't it? He still has that silly look, seems rather adorable."</p><p></p><p>"I prefer how he looked back on the Cruciform Star, quite nostalgic. Didn't expect time to fly by so quickly."</p><p></p><p>"That said, judging from his aura, he's quite powerful. Wonder how I compare to him in strength."</p><p></p><p>"Do we even need to ask? We're definitely stronger! We've also learned spatial abilities now, plus our experience is more extensive."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, we should find a chance to spar with the brother and sister, let them feel our power too."</p><p></p><p>"We Eighteen Deities will surely return to the pinnacle in the distant future."</p><p></p><p>"Look at Gail's confused little eyes, doesn't it feel like time travel? Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey? He seems quite uncomfortable, he wants to leave!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't let him go so soon! Let's tease him a bit more, rare to get such a good opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"He looks like he's about to attack, you don't think he wants to fight us, do you? Hahaha, with eighteen of us, I believe his rationality will prevail, after all we've seen that expression plenty when watching him do tasks before."</p><p></p><p>"Enough teasing, let's not actually fight and hurt feelings."</p>

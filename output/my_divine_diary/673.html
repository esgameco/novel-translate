        <h1>Chapter 673</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao was still asleep. During this period of his sleep, earth-shattering changes were happening inside his body. The genetic information predetermined at birth was being secretly rewritten according to his will.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, the original Xu Shiqiang would completely disappear from his body, fully transforming into Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan sat quietly in the fighter jet, which had already started preheating. He regained that familiar feeling of skillfully operating fighter jets. As long as he had the control stick in hand, he didn't put any octopus monster in his sights.</p><p></p><p>Little Chang's body trembled slightly with nervousness. His hand gripped the control stick, opening and closing repeatedly as he took deep breaths to adjust his state.</p><p></p><p>He muttered, "It's okay, I'm very capable. My dad bought me the most expensive Type 3 enhancers. My reaction speed, physical strength, and stamina are all top-notch. The Octopus Clan is no match for me. I can kill them one by one, just like..."</p><p></p><p>Scenes of Suhao invincibly wielding his godly marksmanship on the battlefield inexplicably appeared in his mind. His eyes gradually became determined. "Just like the great Qiang, kill them all. Kill!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the spacecraft pilot squad, energy block loading squad, data detection squad, fighter jet squadron, transport supply squad...</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in position, awaiting orders from above!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two spaceships flew rapidly through the vast empty space. One was flat like a stingray, the other slender like a short dagger.</p><p></p><p>There was not a sound, the cosmos was utterly silent.</p><p></p><p>The exterior of the two ships gave no hint of the deadly killing intent hidden within.</p><p></p><p>On the Yaoxing:</p><p></p><p>The captain said coldly, "Report the enemy warship's movements."</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the enemy warship is gradually approaching, probing back and forth at the edge of our maximum attack range. It's estimated to fly to our starboard side in about ten minutes."</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the enemy warship has revealed twenty side energy main cannons, fifty beam laser correction cannons, and two hundred guided tracking missile launchers..."</p><p></p><p>The captain remained completely calm, the corners of his mouth curved into a cold smile. "However many cannons they show us, we'll show them just as many - no more, no less. Tell them to bring it on."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>The captain studied the star map in front of him. After a long while, he stared intently at a rocky planet on the map, silently calculating something.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, his fist slammed onto the table, drawing everyone's attention. The captain declared, "We'll choose the final battlefield location ourselves! It will be here, Planet Tuhui-3758!"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked doubtfully, "The final battle?"</p><p></p><p>The captain's tone was exceptionally firm. "I now have a judgment: The enemy warship does not have much onboard energy and cannot sustain a prolonged engagement with us! This judgment is the decisive factor for our victory.</p><p></p><p>So I need to find a high-gravity planet as the battlefield to rapidly deplete their energy reserves. When they are truly weakened, we will counterattack."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbstruck, not understanding the captain's reasoning.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Recall the energy stockpile situation at that small supply station?"</p><p></p><p>Someone remembered, "Neatly stacked, fully loaded."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Then consider this question - why did the enemy warship appear at that small supply station?</p><p></p><p>The answer is obvious - their warship was running low on energy and planned to resupply at this station.</p><p></p><p>Based on the stockpile at the supply station, they were just arriving to resupply, not leaving after resupplying.</p><p></p><p>This means the enemy warship's energy reserves are in an extremely depleted state."</p><p></p><p>The officers present had their eyes lit up with a ray of hope.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, we need to find a way to prolong the engagement and deplete their energy as much as possible, without letting them know we're aware of their situation! And Planet Tuhui-3758 perfectly meets our requirements - it can increase their energy consumption by 20% without arousing suspicion!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone silently praised, "The captain is unparalleled!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, none of them had thought to connect the enemy warship to the energy blocks at the supply station. They were more focused on how to blast the enemy ship with their own cannons.</p><p></p><p>But now, hearing the captain's analysis, they immediately understood his plan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they inwardly chanted, "Humanity will prevail!"</p><p></p><p>This illustrated the difference between humans and the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan has extremely high scientific intelligence, and their weapons and ships are more advanced than humanity's. But over so many years, they have been unable to completely defeat humans. This is because the human race has an acute sense for warfare - even at an absolute disadvantage, they can still find a path to survival.</p><p></p><p>From a strategic perspective, humans crush the Octopus Clan by several levels.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Some time later, the reporting officer's voice sounded, "Reporting, the enemy warship is actively approaching us, entering firing range."</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately gave orders, "We have plenty of energy in our reserves! Fire! Give them everything we've got! Show them our fighting spirit! Meanwhile, turn starboard one degree, fly in an arc, take an all-out offensive stance! Circle around to adjust our heading, seize the chance to advance towards Planet Tuhui-3758!"</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the Yaoxing's starboard cannons opened fire in unison towards the enemy warship.</p><p></p><p>"Hmmm..."</p><p></p><p>The entire ship shuddered as a barrage of energy beams fired from the Yaoxing, almost instantly crossing the vast distance to the enemy warship's vicinity.</p><p></p><p>Guided missiles also spewed from the launch tubes, slowly drifting towards the enemy ship.</p><p></p><p>The previously silent space suddenly became lively.</p><p></p><p>As expected, all the energy beams went wide, passing by the warship from various angles before disappearing into the cosmic depths.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the enemy has deployed 'spatial disruptors' and is calculating trajectory curvatures."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the opposing warship returned fire, refusing to back down.</p><p></p><p>And all their attacks also went wide.</p><p></p><p>The distance was too great, and both sides had defensive countermeasures in place. Scoring a hit would be a fluke.</p><p></p><p>This exchange of fire was just the two sides exchanging greetings!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Yaoxing adjusted its flight path, beginning to fly in an arc, rotating to starboard. As they drew a bit closer, the captain decisively ordered, "Old Jiang, launch your fighter squadron immediately to attack the enemy warship."</p><p></p><p>Colonel Jiang immediately responded, "Received!"</p><p></p><p>Then he opened communication channels to all his squad leaders and roared, "Fighter squadrons, follow orders and launch for combat! Formation 353, advance on the enemy warship."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan shouted, "Little Chang, stay right behind me, don't fall behind!"</p><p></p><p>Then he pressed a button by his side, opening the outer hatch as his fighter jet blasted out.</p><p></p><p>Little Chang's eyes were bloodshot. "Received, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Octopus Clan warship also launched many small fighter craft.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus fighters had bizarre conical shapes, with eight long metal tentacles extending from the bottom. They moved swiftly and agilely in space.</p><p></p><p>And Captain Yan's opponents were these eight-tentacled fighters.</p><p></p><p>Whoever prevailed in this fighter jet engagement would gain air superiority.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Suhao groggily woke up. The first words out of his mouth were, "The gene modification was successful!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the integrated system of energy flowing through his body, he couldn't help but smile. "My radar perception is back...a 1,500 meter perception range that's still growing. It'll reach 2,000 meters soon!</p><p></p><p>"Now, let me try blinking!" Suhao thought, squinting his eyes. His form abruptly vanished from the spot, reappearing outside the door.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>After carefully checking, he finally saw the message Captain Yan had left him on his communication device: "Big Qiang, get in a fighter and kick their asses!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "???"</p><p></p><p>He immediately realized something must have happened on the Yaoxing.</p><p></p><p>He kept scrolling up through the order logs and quickly understood what was going on. He cursed, "Damn it! The Octopus Clan really has guts, launching an attack while I was asleep!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Suhao quickly made a decision. "The Yaoxing can't fall now! I'll pilot a fighter jet and take out the enemy warship!"</p><p></p><p>Although it sounded ridiculous, it wasn't impossible!</p><p></p><p>He knew that fighter jet main cannons could threaten enemy warships. If he targeted some vulnerable areas and attacked repeatedly, he could cripple the warship.</p><p></p><p>Most warship exteriors used reinforced alloys that were extremely tough and could withstand ordinary energy cannon attacks. But not every area was covered in alloy.</p><p></p><p>As long as Suhao could find an opening...</p><p></p><p>He quickly went to the armory to suit up, then to the energy chamber to load power cells. After that, he headed straight for the fighter hangar and climbed into his specialized fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had practiced these steps countless times over the past five days since waking up, so carrying them out for real felt completely natural, as if he'd done it innumerable times before.</p><p></p><p>Start up!</p><p></p><p>Suhao pressed the button to initiate the launch sequence.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's fighter jet blasted out of the Yaoxing with a "whoosh".</p><p></p><p>He contacted his squad leader, "Captain, why didn't you call me for the battle? Send me your coordinates."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan immediately replied, "The old master is here! Don't disturb me, I'm about to take on those octopus freaks!"</p><p></p><p>Trying my best to keep up the pace, but could only manage 3 updates today - so tragic!</p>

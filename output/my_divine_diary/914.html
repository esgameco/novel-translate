        <h1>Chapter 914</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After communicating well with Yashan Valley and taking away the first batch of cross-world travelers to be cultivated, Su Hao came to the Crossroads Star to observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he was slightly surprised. In just fifty years, the entire Crossroads Star had almost completely changed its appearance. </p><p></p><p>Originally, the civilization on this planet was just a slightly backward agricultural civilization. Even after he had been here for over a thousand years, there hadn't been much change. Unexpectedly, in just fifty short years, it had become a steampunk era civilization, with pipes and dense smoke visible everywhere in the world, and various crude machines chugging and shaking as they worked.</p><p></p><p>Their attire had also undergone a complete transformation - suits, boots, top hats, canes...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "This group of cross-world travelers' influence on the world is not to be underestimated. A single spark of thought can ignite the flames of civilizational progress."</p><p></p><p>But he didn't really mind. This kind of world was still acceptable. As long as one possessed extraordinary power, this world could still be a cradle for cross-world travelers.</p><p></p><p>What caught his attention were the cross-world travelers on the Crossroads Star. Including the two siblings, there were still twelve of them - not a single one had died, which made Su Hao click his tongue in admiration.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the strength of these dozen or so cross-world travelers had undergone an earth-shattering change in just fifty years, to an extent that even surprised Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>This group of cross-world travelers had all broken through to the Celestial Being realm, and even obtained Immortal bodies. Their equipment was extremely luxurious, possessing all kinds of bloodlines and skills...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Hao couldn't help but worry whether the great villain Chipu Demon King could handle them.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, the righteous heroes and the evil Demon King were holding a banquet and revelry, addressing each other as brothers in a lively scene.</p><p></p><p>"How did they manage this?"</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao pulled up the records of the two siblings and quickly browsed through them. He soon understood the key point and became speechless: "They were exploiting loopholes..."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao didn't mean to blame the two siblings. After all, exploiting loopholes was also a manifestation of their abilities. Many people wanted to exploit loopholes but didn't know where the loopholes were.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed wryly: "No matter how much I tried to prevent it, I didn't foresee them sending party invitations to exploit this loophole."</p><p></p><p>His goal was to obtain powerful spiritual energy while selecting suitable people to become future partners in exploring the universe.</p><p></p><p>If he let these cross-world travelers exploit loopholes, the spiritual energy would indeed be powerful enough, but the function of selecting talents would then lose its corresponding effect.</p><p></p><p>This was not what Su Hao wanted.</p><p></p><p>He would rather spend more time than to hastily fill the ranks.</p><p></p><p>"I need to patch this loophole. When the next batch of cross-world travelers comes, in addition to the system-assigned teammates, they are strictly prohibited from revealing the existence of the system to anyone else. Hmm...I'll have to assign them to different factions."</p><p></p><p>As for the current twelve cross-world travelers, Su Hao didn't plan to take back the power they had gained from exploiting loopholes, but accepted the power they had obtained.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao felt that these cross-world travelers had become too powerful and were no longer suitable to remain on the Crossroads Star.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he summoned Feng Cheng and said, "Feng Cheng, your two disciples and their disciples have now grown to a certain extent. You can take them under your wing as assistants and personally guide them for a period of time, which is equivalent to an internship.</p><p></p><p>If all goes well, in a few hundred years you'll be able to acquire the first batch of usable talents."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was surprised: "So soon? It hasn't even been a hundred years yet!"</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to let them be for a few hundred years until they gained sufficient strength and could control that power at will. He didn't expect that in less than a hundred years, the Venerable One would say he could take them under his wing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "This is a small accident. Although they have gained sufficient power, they don't understand the essence of that power, nor do they know how to properly use the power within their bodies. They're just using it according to the system's instructions. They're still far from truly mastering that power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, while they're skilled at destruction and fighting, when it comes to knowledge, except for the Cong sisters, they're basically illiterate. This aspect also needs to be strengthened."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng understood: "I see, Venerable One. I'll take them away and guide them right away. Recently I've had a 'Remodeling Miniature Cubes' project that needs some assistants."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and added, "Oh, and take that giant dragon Chipu Demon King with you to guide as well! His power has also become excessive. Leaving him on the Crossroads Star may disrupt the balance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng left, Su Hao went to the inner world of Paradise.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the scope of Paradise was expanding, presenting a prosperous scene.</p><p></p><p>Many people who had made great contributions to the world in their previous lives would regain their youth after death and be admitted to Paradise, assigned a position, and enjoy a perfect life, gathering every day to brag, play chess, and be happy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the people here grew tired of living, they also had the right to end their own lives and enter the Soul Network to be reincarnated. However, after reincarnation, all their memories would be erased, and they would be reborn as a new life imbued with relatively pure spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Where there was Paradise, there was also Hell...</p><p></p><p>These two special inner worlds had special arrangements from Su Hao for the future.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Su Hao entered Paradise, the eighteen deities immediately sensed him and abandoned their tasks or games, appearing in Paradise and surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Su Hao as if seeing a family member, almost crying.</p><p></p><p>Nati said with tears in his eyes: "Lord Leian, you've finally come! We've missed you so much!"</p><p></p><p>Bali also said: "Lord Leian, it's been fifty years since we last saw you. Fifty years is such a long time. Not being able to see you at all times has made us miserable."</p><p></p><p>Even the most ill-tempered deity, the Order God Red Light, softened: "Lord Leian, your arrival fills us with joy. We truly hope to see you often."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily and saw through their lies: "You're just hoping I'll let you out to enjoy the wonderful world, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately denied it: "How could that be? It's just that not being able to go out means not being able to see Lord Leian, and the longing is torturous."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Have you seen the power of the World Will and the Demon King Chipu? Let me ask you this - if you didn't have my spatial protection and went out, only to be chased and attacked by them, could you defeat them? It may seem like I'm restricting your movements, but in fact, I'm protecting you."</p><p></p><p>The deities forced a smile: "Yes, yes, Lord Leian is protecting us."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "If you want to go out, it's not impossible. But you'll have to wait until the World Will defeats the Demon King Chipu. So, has the Demon King been defeated yet?"</p><p></p><p>The deities knew the truth: These were just Lord Leian's excuses and reasons. He simply didn't want to let them out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the deities remain silent, Su Hao changed the subject: "However, apart from that, there is another way for you to go out."</p><p></p><p>The deities perked up: "What way?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Abandon your current Vaigar bodies."</p><p></p><p>The deities: "..."</p><p></p><p>They looked at Su Hao's face intently, trying to detect any hint of a joke. They possessed Vaigar bodies and enjoyed eternal life. How could they simply abandon them?</p><p></p><p>They thought to themselves: "We'll just outlive Lord Leian and see who lives longer."</p><p></p><p>Bali voiced the doubt in their minds: "Lord Leian, the Vaigar body is the key to our survival. Leaving the Vaigar body would cause us to die quickly. This isn't freedom, this is seeking death..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained, "You've misunderstood. You are still very important to me. As long as you still have value, I won't let you die. Rest assured on this point.</p><p></p><p>What I mean by abandoning the Vaigar body is for you to separate your main consciousness from the Vaigar body and enter the powerful bodies I will provide you, using those bodies to move about freely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bodies I provide, if properly maintained, will have a lifespan no shorter than Vaigar's. More importantly, the bodies I provide also possess great power, and you can customize them into any shape you desire. Later, you can also modify them according to your preferences, which is very convenient."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Salvation Deity Baishen drooled: "Able to customize into any shape? That's wonderful, that's exactly the kind of body I've dreamed of!"</p><p></p><p>When the deities heard that the new bodies not only offered longevity but also possessed great power, they were all exceptionally tempted.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, they had observed the rapid growth of the World Will and gained some understanding of the power system mastered by Su Hao. Therefore, they could tell that what Su Hao said was likely not false.</p><p></p><p>Viewed this way, their own Vaigar bodies didn't seem that great after all...</p>

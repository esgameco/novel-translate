        <h1>Chapter 817</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After punching away the two divine envoys, Su Hao cheerfully reported the situation to the dragon mother Shadu: "Mother Shadu, I've checked it out. The highest level here on this Foam Hot Spring Island is only level six - there are three level six soul cultivators and four level six soul guards. No threat. We can enjoy soaking in the springs."</p><p></p><p>As for whether Su Hao felt psychological pressure facing unfamiliar people and attacking them...</p><p></p><p>If he knew his punch could completely kill someone, Su Hao would be cautious in using it. But in this situation, he couldn't actually kill these divine envoys, so he didn't hesitate at all to attack.</p><p></p><p>These divine envoys were simply ideal punching bag targets for practice.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was determined that once he fully recovered his strength and ensured safety, he would find these divine envoys and deities to thoroughly study this world's soul power system.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the dragon mother Shadu happily said, "That's wonderful, my children! Let's recuperate properly on this island. I'll take you to experience soaking in the hot springs - I'm sure you'll love it. Moreover, this will be your first bath since being born! Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>The two little dragon cubs cheered, bouncing up and down on their mother's back. The eldest cub Chipu was so excited that he flapped his useless little wings vigorously and almost fell off.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the dragon mother Shadu flew over the Foam Island, circling above to locate the foam hot springs.</p><p></p><p>A huge dragon circling overhead terrified the pirates and people below. Sensing the dragon's aura, their legs went weak as they looked up at the sky in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Each of them thought to themselves, "This huge dragon must be passing by and getting hungry, wanting to come down for a snack."</p><p></p><p>Those who roamed the Heavenly Channel had encountered many huge dragons. But those circling above islands were usually looking for delicious food.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, they had some experience - coating themselves with chili powder that dragons hated, then sprinkling salt and special spices for a marinade could drive away most evil dragons.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the panicked people below, the dragon mother circled a few times before locating the foam hot springs - a large pool at the base of a low cliff.</p><p></p><p>The massive pool could easily accommodate three to five huge dragons. Bubbles and mist rose from the water, giving it an otherworldly aura.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu carried the three dragon cubs down and landed at the edge of the pool, letting out a roar.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The huge dragon's roar startled those soaking in the hot spring, who scrambled out of the water and fled, not even grabbing their clothes and exposing themselves as they quickly disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The two dragon cubs jumped off their mother's back and plunged into the pool with a "plop", soon surfacing on the other side and calling out excitedly to Su Hao and their mother.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao leapt up and dove into the water.</p><p></p><p>"Splash~"</p><p></p><p>The water splashed up, drenching the two little dragon cubs.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu walked into the hot spring pool with a laugh, letting out a moan of pleasure as the warm water enveloped her.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao and the others were enjoying themselves, someone else was very unhappy, extremely unhappy.</p><p></p><p>In the temple of the Golden God, a muscular blond man sat dazed on his divine throne. It was the Golden God Barry, whose consciousness had been revived into this body.</p><p></p><p>It had been several hours since his consciousness returned, but he still couldn't snap out of his daze. What had just happened that caused his sudden death?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even taken action yet!</p><p></p><p>This time he had been well-prepared and showed no hostility at all, so why was he randomly attacked?</p><p></p><p>It was quite unexpected and ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Could it be that the new deity sensed my consciousness and recognized me?"</p><p></p><p>Pondering further, he shook his head, "The chances of being recognized are slim. First, I used different bodies, and I specially disguised my aura, so there's no way I could be identified just like that..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the deeper his frown became as he couldn't figure out why he was targeted.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he died twice in a row from those inexplicable attacks, without even catching a glimpse of that red-golden dragon. He didn't get a chance to show off his powerful, extremely sexy soul cultivation techniques to his opponent...</p><p></p><p>As a deity, he could hardly maintain face like this.</p><p></p><p>"At least let me meet them once!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Barry was currently seething with pent-up anger and frustration with no outlet.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to find joy in life, not vexation. But now he hadn't found any joy, only vexation filling his heart and mind. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to slam the table in his irritation, the brown-haired man lying in a strange posture below slowly woke up. After a dazed moment, he struggled to stand and kneel before Barry.</p><p></p><p>It was the Golden God's divine envoy, Bode.</p><p></p><p>Bode looked extremely weak, barely managing to kneel and rasp out, "Respected Lord Barry, thank you for..."</p><p></p><p>Barry waved his hand irritably, "Enough! Go and rest!"</p><p></p><p>Having been revived three times in quick succession, Bode's consciousness was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>But he still cared deeply about his deity's affairs, "Respected Lord Barry, your servant Bode can still guide you to the location of the red-golden dragon."</p><p></p><p>Barry shook his head, "No need. I've grasped her movement patterns - finding that red-golden dragon will be easy. But in this situation, chasing after her again would be meaningless, just a waste of my vessel's energy."</p><p></p><p>Bode nodded, "Lord Barry is wise. But do you plan to give up investigating this red-golden dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Barry chuckled lightly, "Not at all, I have my own arrangements. You can withdraw."</p><p></p><p>Bode bowed his head to the ground, then rose and left.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Barry muttered, "I can't just let them return to the Dragon Continent. Once they go back, the dragon tribe will have three powerful principal deities, greatly expanding their forces - a huge impact on us humans. It may even affect the domains of us lesser deities...</p><p></p><p>I admit I'm no match for this new dragon deity, but that doesn't mean other deities can't handle her either. Like my principal deity, the tremendously powerful 'Night God - Eternity'."</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he couldn't be the only one taking losses. If he didn't drag the other deities down to experience that same vexing feeling, his heart would remain unsettled.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if the 'Night God - Eternity' eliminated that new 'Hidden God' deity, that would be the best outcome. But if Eternity's avatar also got taken out directly, then he would feel much better about it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the perfect solution!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, the Golden God Barry smiled faintly and headed out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the four red-golden dragons enjoyed their hot spring soak, they flew to a deserted nearby islet to rest, sleeping soundly without anyone daring to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>The next day at dawn, the dragon mother carried the three cubs and flew off into the distance again.</p><p></p><p>"My children, once we leave Foam Island, we'll enter the second half of the Heavenly Channel's route. We'll head west, then gradually turn southwest in a wide arc, passing over twenty islands before finally reaching our destination - the Dragon Continent! Based on the first half of the journey, I predict our trip will be extremely smooth.</p><p></p><p>Children, you'll be home soon."</p><p></p><p>The two cubs cheered excitedly, bouncing up and down on their mother's back.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao found a comfortable position to lie in and entered his spirit cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>He would have two hours each of spirit cultivation in the morning and afternoon, spending the rest of the time constructing his outer-brain.</p><p></p><p>The outer-brain was now over 50% complete, and he estimated it would take about half a month more to fully form and undergo metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>In his miniature world, the development of the [Divinity] was progressing normally with no abnormalities so far, just a matter of time until maturity.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt reassured and placed the other four [Divine Eggs] into the incubation formation to hatch.</p><p></p><p>He had now completed the first half of the return journey to the Dragon Continent along the Heavenly Channel, entering the second half.</p><p></p><p>While cultivating, Su Hao couldn't help but think of those two divine envoys from before. He thought to himself, "In hindsight, it was too rash to directly kill those two divine envoys in front of me. If I had a chance to capture them and bring them into my miniature world for study, that would have been better.</p><p></p><p>Next time I encounter other divine envoys, perhaps I can try capturing them if possible, and only kill them if I can't capture them. If I can capture them, it would be a pure gain."</p><p></p><p>However, how could he safely bring the opponent into his miniature world?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook off that thought, "I'll think about it if the situation arises."</p><p></p><p>After this period of development, the 'Evil Dragon Legend' had also spread throughout the entire channel.</p><p></p><p>Rumors spoke of a ferociously evil red-golden dragon leading three several-month-old red-golden dragon cubs along the Heavenly Channel back to the Dragon Continent, leaving a trail of massacres and corpses in its wake, unstoppable by anyone...</p><p></p><p>Yet such rumors did not deter the greedy pirate gangs roaming the Heavenly Channel.</p><p></p><p>They all prepared themselves, brandishing blades and chains.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to claim those three red-golden dragon cubs for myself!"</p>

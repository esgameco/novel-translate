        <h1>Chapter 957</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Counselor Cao's exceptionally high-quality spiritual brain began spinning frantically. In just an instant, he thought of many things, with fragmented scenes he had seen and experienced before flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Movies, TV shows, anime, games...In my previous life I watched a vast amount of shows and films. I can still remember some of them. I can use those shows and films as reference to build the trial world, and then based on the plot progression, set corresponding mission objectives for the crossers to complete tasks inside. There can be varying difficulties..."</p><p></p><p>The more Counselor Cao thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. It would be better to copy an existing trial world than slowly construct an entirely new one from scratch.</p><p></p><p>"Sir Jia's requirement is actually just one - to quickly screen more and stronger trial participants. There are no strict limitations on how to screen them, so the operational space left for me is very large. I could even overturn the current model for my own convenience and design a completely new screening mechanism..."</p><p></p><p>Many imaginative shows and films flashed through his mind. "So how can I quickly screen more trial participants?"</p><p></p><p>"The powerful trial participants Sir Jia wants are not just empty shells with power, but also need matching wisdom and abilities.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, they must have the full capability to control their powers and use their abilities to handle complex problems.</p><p></p><p>So the difficulty of the assigned tasks cannot be too low. It must be set at an extreme level to extract the full potential and abilities of the trial participants, forcing them to grow rapidly..."</p><p></p><p>Counselor Cao became increasingly excited, grabbing fistfuls of his hair. "Battle! Battle is what makes people grow stronger quickly! And it has to be frenzied battles, battles to the death, high-frequency battles...</p><p></p><p>Under such intense pressure, those who don't die, can still grow, and maintain rationality without going insane - their mental state will surely meet Sir Jia's requirements, and their strength will also satisfy the need.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it allows reaching Sir Jia's requirements at the fastest speed to rapidly screen a large number of qualified trial participants.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as there are enough initial trial participants, the ones who emerge from the frenzied battles will also be plentiful..."</p><p></p><p>The more Counselor Cao contemplated, the clearer his thinking became. "No, frenzied battles alone are not enough. Sir Jia needs a group of strong individuals who can think and make decisions, not just crazed killers. So I also need to design specific trial worlds to screen out those with only strength but no thinking ability. What kind of trials can filter out those killer maniacs?</p><p></p><p>He opened his hands, letting the strands of hair flutter down. "No, that's not right. Just strength and intelligence is not enough. What if after they come out, they resent me for designing this trial world and try to attack me with knives?</p><p></p><p>So I also need to design another type of trial world to screen out those ungrateful, uncooperative vicious lone wolves.</p><p></p><p>Then use war missions! Yes, to survive on the battlefield requires teamwork and cooperation. Those lone wolves will likely die on the battlefield...</p><p></p><p>Also need to arrange missions against foreign races to give them a sense of racial identity...</p><p></p><p>Also need to arrange some emotional missions to awaken their human kindness, so they hopefully won't cause me trouble...</p><p></p><p>And..."</p><p></p><p>Counselor Cao found his brain was exceptionally useful. Such a complex matter would have been impossible for his former self - he would likely get sleepy just thinking about it a little.</p><p></p><p>That was the reason he used to doze off in class and get poor grades...</p><p></p><p>But now it was different, the more he thought, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a relatively complete plan took shape in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"There's one last issue. Although my memory is extremely powerful now, in my previous life I was just an amateur. I can only vaguely remember most movies and anime, and have no ability to complete them into full trial worlds..."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered browsing the mall previously and seeing a directory of movies, TV shows, anime, games etc. He couldn't understand why the almighty Creator God's mall would have such lowly things - who with such great power would still watch movies and play games?</p><p></p><p>He immediately opened the mall, and to his surprise, all the TV shows and movies he had seen before were recorded inside, with even more he had never seen. It was simply too miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"This mall seems to have everything! As expected of the Creator God Sir Jia. Wait, all the films and anime require points?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own points balance - a huge '0' at the end.</p><p></p><p>Counselor Cao: "......"</p><p></p><p>He flipped to the games section and was stunned, cursing involuntarily, "Damn, the games are so expensive! Even the simplest small game costs 100 points. Who would be foolish enough to spend points redeeming these games?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's focus on movies and anime instead! But I don't have a single point right now, what should I do? Should I ask the seniors for some? But they value points a lot..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Counselor Cao thought to himself, "No, I can't just directly ask, they will definitely reject me. If I fail once, I won't get a second chance to inquire. So I must first design the complete plan, and go ask with the plan in hand, only then will I have a chance of getting startup funds. Just like applying for startup capital in my previous life..."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, he entered the Celestial Palace and used the first Primordial God's administrative privileges to create a small separate space, beginning to construct the structure he envisioned.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As usual, Cong Shuling reported the current project progress to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Finally summarizing, "Our over forty thousand disciples have basically left the Infinite Lands, leaving only a small portion on patrol to monitor the condition of the world passages to ensure they remain unobstructed. Based on the current situation, there are essentially no issues. Please instruct us on the next mission, Master."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "No need to rush. The disciples have been busy for over a hundred years now. With the Infinite Lands built, you can give them an eight to ten year break to travel around and enjoy a leisurely life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while idling about they must not take advantage of their powers to act wantonly. The Double Blade Sect's rules are the bottom line."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling showed a smile, "Understood, Master. Our Double Blade Sect has always acted with restraint and courtesy. We will certainly not go overboard."</p><p></p><p>Recalling what Ya Shan had said about "drawing a line and adding a lock" for the disciples, Feng Cheng said, "Though that may be so, with tens of thousands of disciples, additional supervision is still needed."</p><p></p><p>He pondered, "Call all the first, second and third generation disciples here."</p><p></p><p>The first, second and third generation disciples were the former Hundred Squads' team leaders, over three hundred of them, each commanding a portion of the Double Blade Sect's disciples.</p><p></p><p>Soon, over three hundred disciples gathered in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng first praised the disciples' efforts and achievements during this period, then said, "Next, you all will have a ten year break. However, since our Double Blade Sect's disciples possess immense power, to prevent bringing disaster to the living beings in the Infinite Lands, you need to keep your subordinate disciples restrained and ensure they do not violate our sect's rules.</p><p></p><p>Later I will activate a monitoring procedure for all of you. When a disciple violates the rules, it will immediately provide feedback, and you must swiftly handle the issue."</p><p></p><p>The disciples answered in unison, "Yes, Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng continued, "Ten years later, all disciples will return to normal duties. Distribute the traversal devices and arrange scheduled exploratory missions. You should all prepare for assigning those missions. That's all!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling, Cong Fei, Yan Feng, Zhi Bao...you twelve remain. The rest of you are dismissed!"</p><p></p><p>After the other disciples left, Feng Cheng looked at the twelve most capable disciples remaining below and couldn't help but smile. "I've kept you here to have you participate in one of my plans."</p><p></p><p>The disciples curiously asked, "What plan?"</p><p></p><p>"The City Paradise Plan."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ya Shan looked at the sixteen capable disciples below and smiled, "I have a 'Divine Demon Trial Tower' plan..."</p>

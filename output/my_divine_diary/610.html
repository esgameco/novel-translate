        <h1>Chapter 610</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao planned to seek cooperation from the Mage Association, he began to conceive how to build a global real-time disaster monitoring system.</p><p></p><p>His idea was to design a 'disaster locator device', and then deploy this device all over the world to form a massive network dedicated to collecting disaster data.</p><p></p><p>The concept for the 'disaster locator device' came from the 'disaster balancer' of the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Previously, after capturing the Fei Yue squad, Su Hao communicated with Fei Yue and learned that Fei Yue calculated the location of the base small world by detecting the reactions of 'disaster balancers' deployed at various mage branches, which indicated the convergence of a large number of source artifacts.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao take an interest in the so-called 'disaster balancer'. He went to investigate it secretly, disassembling the 'disaster balancers' in a few cities without anyone knowing, analyzing their structure and working principles, before reassembling them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also learned the working principle of the 'disaster balancer': When a disaster first occurs, it releases a special fluctuation in all directions. This special fluctuation causes a certain range of 'source stones' to react, attracting them towards the disaster.</p><p></p><p>'Source stones' are unique materials of this world, only found at sites of natural or strange disasters, as byproducts accompanying disasters.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed this unique material 'source stone' in an enlarged view within his bouncing space and found its structure similar to silicon crystals, except with a regular absence of mass, resulting in an extremely peculiar surrounding structure - perhaps one reason for reacting to 'disaster fluctuations'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao guessed the birth of these 'source stones' was related to particles being instantly heated to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>After analyzing the characteristics of 'source stones', Su Hao redesigned a 'disaster locator device' that could not only accurately sense disasters within 500 kilometers, but also function as a signal station, interconnecting and relaying signals - extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Installing a low-quality source pearl could power one 'disaster locator device' to work around the clock for six months.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as these 'disaster locator devices' blanketed the world, Su Hao could obtain the location of any disaster occurring in any corner through the central data processing center in real time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(The rest describes the rapid production and deployment of these devices across the world to form a global disaster monitoring network.)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 729</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>With Xia Qingjun's order, all kinds of combat videos and battle reports against the Eight-Armed Race were immediately compiled and then spread out.</p><p></p><p>The first moment, humans were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, they discovered that humans were actually so powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Was this still the human race that used to tremble with fear at the mere mention of the Eight-Armed Race just a few years ago?</p><p></p><p>The soft worm had suddenly turned into a steel nail!</p><p></p><p>To find a suitable reason for humans suddenly becoming so powerful, people had all kinds of guesses, no matter how absurd, someone would propose them.</p><p></p><p>Until the authorities listed one by one Su Hao's achievements over the years, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Led troops to seize the Eight-Armed Race's supply station",</p><p>"Alone piloted a Swallow-type fighter to defeat the Eight-Armed Race's Guerrilla Type II warship",</p><p>"Single-handedly captured a small Eight-Armed Race fleet", </p><p>"The first human mutant new human",</p><p>"The strongest human with superpowers",</p><p>"Independently created the 'Superpower Method' suitable for everyone to practice",</p><p>"Learned all kinds of human high-tech in one year",</p><p>"Independently established a new project, researched 'spatial transmission technology' in ten years",</p><p>"Developed a 'new weapon' to destroy the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets",</p><p>"Developed a 'new weapon' to counter the Eight-Armed Race",</p><p>"Singlehandedly confronted the Eight-Armed Race's 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' with his power",</p><p>"Brought back enough energy blocks for 20 years of blueglow usage from the Eight-Armed Race's colony planet"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The moment everyone finished reading the report, they were speechless.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the word 'stunned' was no longer enough to describe their feelings.</p><p></p><p>They had only one doubt: were these things a human could do?</p><p></p><p>The only remaining rationality told them that these were not things a human could do!</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>They always felt that Xu Shiqiang's evolutionary leap was too great, perhaps he was no longer of the same species as them...</p><p></p><p>There might even be reproductive isolation...</p><p></p><p>For this, many girls who considered themselves top beauties actually wanted to confirm with Xu Shiqiang, not only for free, but they could even pay him.</p><p></p><p>After this, Xu Shiqiang's name almost became a synonym for 'sacred'.</p><p></p><p>As for Xia Qingjun's move to spread Su Hao's achievements, whether it would cause trouble and hidden dangers...</p><p></p><p>Xu Shiqiang didn't even care about the Eight-Armed Race, let alone these?</p><p></p><p>Bring it on! Go all out!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xia Qingjun felt his soul had been elevated!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the surprise on the human side, the Eight-Armed Race seemed a bit depressed and distressed.</p><p></p><p>What about the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' they fired? Why did it inexplicably explode halfway?</p><p></p><p>It had been a very, very long time since the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' exploded halfway due to instability!</p><p></p><p>So the answer was very obvious.</p><p></p><p>Humans used some special weapon to intercept their 'Planet Destroyer Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>It was simply unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>However, in the recent period of confronting humans, there were too many impossible things happening, adding one more was nothing to be overly surprised about.</p><p></p><p>This was normal...</p><p></p><p>So the Eight-Armed Race tried firing another 'Planet Destroyer Cannon'.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it was again intercepted halfway, turning into a small firework in the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' that could have blasted a hole in blueglow just flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was confirmed!</p><p></p><p>Could there be anything more terrifying than this?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>No matter how others thought or said, it didn't concern him much. He only needed to proceed step-by-step according to his plan!</p><p></p><p>The series of events he encountered were just small episodes on his path forward.</p><p></p><p>Things that could have easily taken his life in the past were no longer worth mentioning to him now. As long as he spared a little time, he could handle everything.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao did not indulge in such powerful strength, still calmly thinking about his own problems as usual.</p><p></p><p>Now what he was thinking about was: how to launch a long-range attack on the Eight-Armed Race's mothership?</p><p></p><p>Because no matter how fast his conventional attack speed was, it could not exceed the speed of light, and as long as the warship was moving, he could not accurately hit it.</p><p></p><p>It was like eating at a table, no one knew which diner would reach out to spin the table next second.</p><p></p><p>Currently on blueglow, for Su Hao to launch an attack on the Eight-Armed Race fleet outside the star system was very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Even if his 'Disintegration Cannon' could fly that far, he had no way to accurately hit them.</p><p></p><p>Did he need to 'stargaze' or 'transmit' to attack a mothership?</p><p></p><p>So he wanted to develop a means to attack outside the star system while still on blueglow.</p><p></p><p>And he already had a feasible plan.</p><p></p><p>"First, use the energy packing technique to make a stable energy projectile;</p><p></p><p>Finally, attach a strand of space-attribute spiritual power to control the detonation..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's idea was simple: the energy packing technique could obtain a high explosive, high energy, extremely fast energy projectile;</p><p></p><p>The energy detonation wave was used to attack the energy blocks of the fleet;</p><p></p><p>Such a cannon shell was simply perfect.</p><p></p><p>It looked very difficult, but in Su Hao's eyes, it was not impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>The real difficulty was that the distance was too far away, unable to confirm whether the attack had reached the ideal killing point, too early or too late would not achieve the ideal effect.</p><p></p><p>"Try to realize it first, as for the problem of detonation timing... I can only temporarily find humans to assist with calculation and positioning for now.</p><p></p><p>But this problem will inevitably have a solution in the future. Perhaps the Mother Bug and Compound Eye Race will give me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>With a concrete plan, Su Hao took action extremely quickly, constantly trying and failing, trying and failing...</p><p></p><p>In the end, he found that controlling the energy extracted from energy blocks was more difficult and unstable, while spiritual power and source energy worked best for building the energy package.</p><p></p><p>Day by day, as Su Hao kept experimenting, the imagined energy package became more and more refined, and its size grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>During Su Hao's development of this new ability, Xia Qingjun did not send anyone to find him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the Eight-Armed Race did not want to launch meaningless attacks and waste energy, instead waiting for the other fleets to arrive before making other plans.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps Feng Cheng and Ya Shan's actions on the other colony planets had some effect...</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter!</p><p></p><p>With eyes half-closed, right hand extended and loosely clenched.</p><p></p><p>A point of golden light lit up in front of his palm, gradually expanding and growing larger, its shape also becoming clearer, like the double-headed pointed oval of the Disintegration Cannon, like a plump shuttle.</p><p></p><p>When the shuttle expanded to the size of a truck, it slowly stopped.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Su Hao suddenly opened his eyes and pushed forward with his palm: "Go!"</p><p></p><p>A brilliant golden light burst from his palm, and the shuttle shot out, instantly reaching 10,000 km away.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the space around the shuttle distorted slightly, and then it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew the energy shuttle had now entered level 8 warp state!</p><p></p><p>One minute later, a golden shuttle suddenly appeared at the other end of this star system.</p><p></p><p>With Su Hao's thought, the energy shuttle activated its built-in program, erupting violently and emitting a dazzling radiance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a special wave spread out from the explosion point.</p><p></p><p>Ten seconds later, points of light lit up in the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Those were the energy blocks Su Hao had placed in advance, exploding from the wave's influence.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's figure slowly manifested, a hint of a smile on his face: "Success! This skill will be called Starburst!"</p><p></p><p>An attack across an entire star system, let's see if you're afraid!</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the distance and impact point were calculated correctly, Starburst could attack targets 100 light-years away...</p><p></p><p>And the factors limiting Starburst's attack range were the shelf life of Su Hao's stable energy supply and whether he had enough energy to support stargazing.</p><p></p><p>"Extremely powerful!"</p><p></p><p>After completing the experiment, Su Hao had no need to stay here any longer and flashed back into his small world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the captain hurriedly entered the small world.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

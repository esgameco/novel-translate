        <h1>Chapter 725</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the colony planet of the Octopus Race was ravaged by Feng Cheng, the 'shattered star cubes' dropped by Feng Cheng completely destroyed it.</p><p></p><p>What was originally a still vibrant planet turned into a pile of collapsed black debris.</p><p></p><p>And far away on another planet in the Constant Star System, the Xing Gang mothership also could not escape Feng Cheng's clutches.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng approached it using 'Starlight Travel', then scanned it with an 'Energy Degradation Wave', causing the Xing Gang mothership to completely fall silent, with even its most critical communication functions failing.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Race on the mothership could only watch helplessly as Feng Cheng boarded, and then took the entire massive mothership to a blindingly white place.</p><p></p><p>They did not know what fate awaited them, spending every minute and second in extreme trepidation!</p><p></p><p>Of course, some of the Octopus Race thought of resisting, but in the face of the overwhelmingly powerful Crystal Demon, their resistance seemed so laughable.</p><p></p><p>After all the Octopus Race who attempted resistance were killed, none dared to struggle in vain again.</p><p></p><p>Obediently listening might allow them to live a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was said that the Crystal Demon was a human weapon, and if so, then they had been captured by humans.</p><p></p><p>And the Octopus Race's home planet Hou Yan had already issued an order to exterminate humans and not long ago had dispatched a fleet to carry out the extermination.</p><p></p><p>In other words, after the humans were exterminated, they might be rescued.</p><p></p><p>That was where their hope lay!</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of the Octopus Race had never even heard of the existence of 'humans', believing in their perception that the entire Cloud Ring System belonged to the Octopus Race.</p><p></p><p>The orthodox race of the entire universe had to take the form of tentacled monsters.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Race who knew about humans were mostly Octopus soldiers who had contact with humans, and some related Octopus officials.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - in their eyes, the fragile human race was completely unfit to be seen, unqualified to enter their society and become a topic of discussion.</p><p></p><p>But the past decade had been different.</p><p></p><p>The warships of the Octopus Race were repeatedly defeated by humans?</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Later, they even inexplicably lost a small fleet, and only then did humans officially enter the eyes of some Octopus Race, drawing a bit of their attention.</p><p></p><p>They ordered increased R&D efforts to find a way to locate the human homeworld and obtain that special human spatial technology.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>One of the Octopus Race's colony planets was completely destroyed in just a few hours.</p><p></p><p>They panicked!</p><p></p><p>And the human race formally entered the view of many Octopus Race, who then gave an evaluation - 'Level 1 threat, needs to be eliminated'.</p><p></p><p>Threat levels ranged from low to high across eight levels, with Level 1 being the lowest threat.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of many Octopus Race, being listed as a 'threat' was already a source of pride.</p><p></p><p>Then, after experiencing Feng Cheng's attack on the colony to plunder energy cubes, the Octopus Race became even more anxious, urgently raising the human threat level - 'Level 2 threat, eliminate as soon as possible'.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the colony planet was destroyed by the small cubes dropped by Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>This confirmed many things for the Octopus Race: Humans possessed wormhole spatial abilities to freely travel through space and time; the 'Crystal Demon' was a bioweapon created by humans, extremely powerful, comparable to a medium-sized fleet; humans had the ability to destroy Octopus Race colony planets by means the Octopus Race did not understand!</p><p></p><p>Then the human threat level was directly raised to Level 3: 'Eliminate immediately'!</p><p></p><p>As for why not 'borrow'?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan spent most of their time in the small world of the Star-Eating Worm, conducting in-depth research on the Mother Worm, but during breaks they would work together to dismantle the Octopus Race mothership brought back by Feng Cheng...</p><p></p><p>Most human technology was stolen from the Octopus Race by the Compound Eye Race, so the two sides' technologies highly overlapped. Su Hao and Ya Shan easily analyzed and understood the various devices on the mothership.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, they thoroughly researched the 'Planet Destruction Cannon' loaded on the mothership!</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Race used a 'Spiral Wrapping Energy Packaging Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, they used a special method to guide the energy out of the energy cubes, combining it with a unique particle to bring the energy to a critical explosion state. It was then packaged into a spiral cone structure and fired at near light-speed towards the designated location.</p><p></p><p>After the massive energy structure struck a planet, the spiral structure would deeply penetrate the planet's interior before violently exploding from within, shattering the planetary crust and triggering a planetary disaster.</p><p></p><p>The ingenuity of this energy packaging technique surpassed even Su Hao's various cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "This time analyzing the Octopus Race's Planet Destruction Cannon, our gains are not small. If we can realize this structure using spiritual power or Source energy, it could increase our technique's power by nearly tenfold!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also said, "Indeed, this energy packaging technique has no theoretical limit on the amount of energy it can package. If we use a vast amount of 'Source' as the driver, then to destroy a planet in the future, we wouldn't even need the 'Shattered Star Cubes'!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's worth a try, but I currently have no deep obsession with destroying a planet. Why would we destroy a perfectly good planet? Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said expectantly, "I just don't know what other good technologies the Octopus Race has. I need more inspiration."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Not long from now, you'll find out, Old Master. I heard the Octopus Race fleet is preparing to arrive. Really looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng continued to ravage a few more Octopus Race colony planets one after another, plundering who knows how many energy cubes.</p><p></p><p>Single-handedly, he pushed the human threat level up to Level 5 through sheer force...</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that among all the Octopus Race's opponents, none had ever reached a 'Level 5 Threat' evaluation before - this was the first time in history.</p><p></p><p>This caused some panic among the Octopus Race elite.</p><p></p><p>Before the first dispatched fleet had arrived, they successively sent more than a dozen battle groups to the Blue Light system, determined to take it over.</p><p></p><p>Even the perpetually spying Compound Eye Race noticed the anomaly and sent a message to their only ally: "Latest news, the Octopus Race has dispatched a large fleet towards Blue Light."</p><p></p><p>"For some unknown reason, several Octopus Race colony planets have been destroyed in succession. The Octopus Race seems enraged. Latest news, the Octopus Race has dispatched three large fleets..."</p><p></p><p>"Latest news...five large fleets..."</p><p></p><p>"Latest news...ten fleets..."  </p><p></p><p>"...fifteen fleets..."</p><p></p><p>"Still dispatching, twenty fleets now..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Compound Eye Race sent humans their last message: "Humans, you're finished. Farewell, my friends! Let's part ways here!"</p><p></p><p>Then they completely cut off all communication with humans...</p><p></p><p>Originally Xia Qingjun had thought that when humans were in dire straits, he could kneel and beg the Compound Eye Race to accept humans to allow their survival. He never expected them to be so decisive.</p><p></p><p>But it was within his expectations - if the roles were reversed, perhaps he would have been even more decisive than the Compound Eye Race...</p><p></p><p>"Twenty large fleets...and at this rate, the number of fleets is still increasing. What merit do we humans have to receive such attention from the Octopus Race...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, several Octopus Race colony planets were destroyed in succession? What does the destruction of their planets have to do with us humans? We just happened to take the blame."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Xia Qingjun instructed the captain to find Su Hao and explain the situation to him, to hear Su Hao's opinion on this side.</p><p></p><p>So the captain came to find Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>But upon entering the small world, he was stunned by the piles of energy cubes filling the small world.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this situation!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 728</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and two others entered the command center together.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Su Hao as if he was a savior.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun exclaimed excitedly, "Great Qiang, you came just in time!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "I always come at the right time. No more small talk, let's figure out how to wipe out the Octopus Clan completely!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun handed over various materials to Su Hao, briefly described the current situation, and said, "Now the Octopus Clan's goal is very clear - they are staying in star systems beyond our reach and using planet-destroying cannons for extremely long-range strikes, trying to completely destroy Blue Light."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, they can indeed do it. They don't need many - just twenty motherships taking turns bombarding, and Blue Light will quickly become a dead land."</p><p></p><p>"We tried sending warships close through teleportation arrays, then attacking with 'energy burst waves', but the Octopus Clan seemed to know our plan and didn't give the warships a chance to get close."</p><p></p><p>"Now the problem is, one of their motherships is charging up an attack, and the planet-destroyer cannon will fire soon. How should we respond?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand, "Don't worry! If it's just one mothership, it's not a big problem. Just wait!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun was anxious in his heart, but with everyone present, he could only forcibly remain calm. Besides, Xu Shiqiang was still here, right?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun thought to himself, "It doesn't matter if I don't believe it myself, I just need to believe Xu Shiqiang. He said he wouldn't joke around..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had no choice but to believe Su Hao. However, for him, the feeling of a life-or-death crisis relying on someone else was terrible!</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by second by second, and the others couldn't help but discuss in low voices.</p><p></p><p>Soon two hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a reporting officer said, "Report, news from the front line, the Octopus Clan's Mothership No. 5 has confirmed firing the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon', level Red Six!</p><p></p><p>Currently unable to intercept!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes widened as they looked at Su Hao, full of hopeful colors.</p><p></p><p>He was their only hope now!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao ignored them and went to the attack model, carefully comparing the attack trajectory data, then flickered and disappeared from his original spot, appearing in outer space outside Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>He mobilized a massive amount of energy and used the 'energy packing technique' of the planet destroyer cannon to construct a double-pointed conical energy package at his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>The conical energy package was as thick as a thigh. At first it was just a faint shadow emitting a dim golden glow, but gradually it solidified and the light grew brighter over time.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao appeared, he quickly attracted the attention of human space detectors, which focused their lenses on him and transmitted his image back to the ground, entering the display screens in the command center.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others curiously watched Su Hao on the screen, full of confusion: "What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>Two minutes later, Su Hao used a small light assistant to calculate the trajectory of the Octopus Clan's planet destroyer cannon, then pointed along the trajectory.</p><p></p><p>'Disintegration Cannon!'</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the energy package in Su Hao's hand instantly vanished from his fingertip, shooting out at an extremely fast speed, heading straight towards the Octopus Clan's planet destroyer cannon.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan had planet destroyer cannons, and Su Hao did too, except the Octopus Clan's were extremely large, able to cover nearly 20 kilometers, while Su Hao's looked smaller, only as thick as a thigh.</p><p></p><p>If judging power by size, then Su Hao's 'Disintegration Cannon' was insignificant, no match for the Octopus Clan's planet destroyer - like a candle flame to the bright moon, with no chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>But often, size cannot be used to judge the merits of something - the main thing is functionality!</p><p></p><p>One of the functions of Su Hao's 'Disintegration Cannon' was to internally destroy the structure of the Octopus Clan's 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' and prematurely detonate it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this Disintegration Cannon was specially designed by Su Hao to counter the Octopus Clan's planet destroyer cannon. In addition to having extremely strong penetration and explosive power, it could also disintegrate the structure of similar energy packages from within.</p><p></p><p>This was Su Hao's way of dealing with the Octopus Clan - to a certain extent it could be said to be a lower-dimensional strike. He didn't care how many warships they had or how powerful their cannons were, directly solving the problem from the source so they couldn't unleash any of their abilities.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, and about four hours later, Su Hao's 'Disintegration Cannon' and the Octopus Clan's 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' collided at an extremely fast speed!</p><p></p><p>In the vast empty space, a dazzling sphere of light burst forth, scattering outwards like a huge firework blooming in the dark night sky.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, humans were the first to observe this phenomenon, and then reported it to the command room: "Report, a burst of light suddenly appeared on the planet destroyer trajectory. Based on the timing, it is suspected that the 'Planet Destroyer Cannon' was intercepted midway."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the others widened their eyes in disbelief: "Intercepted???"</p><p></p><p>They instinctively looked at the screen, searching for Su Hao's figure, but his image had already disappeared from the display.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were puzzled, Su Hao's voice came from behind them: "That planet destroyer cannon has been intercepted by me. It seems my 'Disintegration Cannon' worked quite well!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone turned around abruptly to look at Su Hao: "The planet destroyer was intercepted by you? Just with that tiny ball of light on your fingertip? How is that possible, how did you do it? It's unbelievable..."</p><p></p><p>The way they looked at Su Hao was not like looking at a person, but like a god. Although they all knew gods couldn't possibly exist, they still couldn't help thinking in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao ignored them and said to Xia Qingjun, "The threat of the planet destroyer to Blue Light is no longer significant. I'll study a method for extremely long-range attacks on the Octopus Clan motherships later. It may take a few days. If there are any more planet destroyer attacks, send someone to find me."</p><p></p><p>With full confidence in winning this war, Xia Qingjun unhesitatingly said, "Okay! You go study, I'll take care of things here!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "Didn't I tell you before to send ships near the Octopus Clan's colony planets to secretly set up teleportation arrays? How has that task progressed?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said, "The farthest distance our warships have reached is only 800 light-years, so we've only set up teleportation arrays around colony planets within 800 light-years."</p><p></p><p>"The Octopus Clan has too many colony planets, spanning the entire Cloud Ring system. For us humans to set up teleportation arrays near all the Octopus colony planets is almost impossible in a short time period."</p><p></p><p>"To achieve that, even in the best case scenario, would take at least a few hundred years of gradual outward expansion."</p><p></p><p>Here, Xia Qingjun said excitedly, "However, if we can clear out all the Octopus Clan colony planets within 800 light-years, that will give humans a huge activity space. The pressure from the Octopus Clan will be much less."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's way of thinking still hadn't changed. If it was up to Ah Shan, he would probably say: Pressure for humans? In fact, after Grandmaster Lao took over this matter, humans no longer had any pressure!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Okay, then let's first clear out the Octopus Clan colony planets within 800 light-years. Pass the specific data to Ah Shan and Feng Cheng, and they will complete the task of destroying those colony planets."</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked towards Ah Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>At this point, they no longer doubted whether the two of them could complete such a task.</p><p></p><p>They shouted crazily in their hearts: "XXX, these three young people are so powerful it's unreasonable! They must have superpowers, right? They must, right? How do I need to train to reach their level?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, I can't wait to go home and cultivate, get stronger, get stronger! Roar! I want to get stronger too, I want to tear apart octopus monsters with my bare hands!"</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao turned to Ah Shan and Feng Cheng and said, "Ah Shan, Feng Cheng, take a large number of 'Star Shard Cubes' and go clean up the Octopus Clan's colony planets."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent a message in their group: "If conditions allow, collect some source pearls for reserves as well. But just in case, don't let the source pearls slip out and let the Octopus Clan get them. We can't be sure what might happen if they obtain them."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao and the other two left, Xia Qingjun and the others slumped into their chairs one by one.</p><p></p><p>They found that after the great fear, joy, and shock they had just experienced, their whole bodies felt soft and weak, as if all the strength had been drained from within.</p><p></p><p>Everything that happened today was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>It was a scenario they had never imagined since birth.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, reality is more bizarre than movies.</p><p></p><p>What director could film such a reversal?</p><p></p><p>Their own performance earlier was like a naive country bumpkin who had never seen the world!</p><p></p><p>The crowd pulled themselves together and looked towards their leader.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun took a deep breath and said with unusual determination, "Our battle report will be announced to all citizens!"</p><p></p><p>"In this process, every single human contributed strength, so the joy of victory should belong to everyone."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, have Xu Shiqiang, Jia Yashan, and Jia Fengcheng's achievements compiled into books, posters, and spread everywhere!"</p><p></p><p>"The three of them will become the greatest people in human history, unsurpassable!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's spirits lifted!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun revealed a strange smile: "Me? I'm bound to those three great figures."</p>

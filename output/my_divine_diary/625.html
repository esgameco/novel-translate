        <h1>Chapter 625</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the No. 1 experimental laboratory of the base's small world.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao extended his hand, separating a small spherical space in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao drew in a large amount of sources. Through the action of a special mental frequency, he gave the 'sources' a specific transformation direction, while continuously injecting them into the small space in his palm.</p><p></p><p>A white solid could be seen forming and gradually solidifying in Su Hao's palm.</p><p></p><p>After consuming a total of five low-quality source pearls, it finally reached a critical point. After waiting a little longer, Su Hao canceled the space barrier and took the white solid in his hand, placing it in the corresponding vessel.</p><p></p><p>"The compound calcium carbonate should be a success!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao recorded the creation in his bouncing space, and then observed the situation of the creation through the space.</p><p></p><p>"There's only a slight deviation, not affecting the obtained substance itself, but the mass data of the obtained substance. However, this small problem is not significant. In other words, the first source-created compound has succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>After the first success, it wouldn't be long before Su Hao could summarize and organize other compounds.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sealed the calcium carbonate and placed it on the corresponding shelf, then entered the bouncing space to organize the gains from researching source compounds during this period.</p><p></p><p>"To obtain a specific compound, four precise conditions must be met: First, the specific mental frequency, that is, the 'arrow' imposing direction on the source, must be extremely precise. If there is the slightest deviation, the final obtained substance will be different from what was envisioned.</p><p></p><p>Second, the energy coefficient...</p><p></p><p>Third, the mass and volume ratio values. If the ratio is incorrect, the product obtained will collapse into other products within two hours.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, the stabilizing force vector...</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the above four conditions are simultaneously met, Su Hao can use sources to obtain any compound he wants.</p><p></p><p>But this is only in theory. As for whether he can really obtain what he wants, it still requires a lot of experimentation. The most difficult part is measuring the data of various compounds, which Su Hao needs to complete one by one.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the summary, Su Hao casually made a follow-up plan: "The main task next is to calculate the 'mental frequency data', 'energy coefficient', 'mass-volume ratio', 'stabilizing force', etc. for all compounds one by one, and try to manifest them with sources!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao said regretfully: "It's a pity that neither Ya Shan nor Feng Cheng have learned the construction structure of the small world space, otherwise they could have helped share some of the work!"</p>

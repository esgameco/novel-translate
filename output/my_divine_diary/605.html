        <h1>Chapter 605</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Liyuan District Palace was quickly destroyed and sunk.</p><p></p><p>Then the Yangjian district, Yongping district, Yanning district ......</p><p></p><p>In the face of Su Hao's massacre, the royal family did not have any resistance or ability to resist, and were able to die suddenly and senselessly, was this Su Hao's mercy? Maybe!</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao overthrew the last Yanghe District Imperial Palace, he stayed in place in a rare moment of silence for a small moment without wanting anything, and then teleported back to the base small world, and sent a message to Yashan and Feng Cheng in the group, "My side has been resolved, I'll leave it to you guys next."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was shocked, "That fast? I've only just reached the third palace."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng sent out a snickering emoji, "I've reached the fourth palace, once the suppressor is turned on and a crater is blown up with a bomb, it's very fast!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied, "Feng Cheng, you're disturbing the people a bit."</p><p></p><p>Kazunari: "Eh! I thought that letting the citizens watch an explosion would increase their knowledge and they'd be happy for a few years! After all, sound and light effects like that aren't something you just want to see."</p><p></p><p>Yama: "...... There is some truth to that! Do you have any extra bombs, Kazunari? Lend it to me."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "It's just stacked up in my warehouse, more than enough. I like to stock up on some when I have something to do."</p><p></p><p>Yashan sent out a shocked expression, "Feng Cheng you actually stockpile bombs at the base???"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Things are often much more complicated than planned.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others followed the set goal of destroying all the royal palaces, and it seemed to go smoothly, due to the fact that the three of them held absolutely powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to the operational part of the Illuminati, it wasn't that easy.</p><p></p><p>Although there were a lot of mages in the Guang Yao Society, their strength was not as strong as imagined, and even if they had the initiative to launch a surprise attack on the royal palace from the shadows, not every squad would be able to accomplish the set goal smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Failure would mean that the squad was wiped out, and the local royal family was still alive and well, and had advanced preparations for the attack.</p><p></p><p>When the Illuminati mobilized another squad to exterminate, there were generally two results, one was an offensive and defensive war with the other side, the royal family defended and the Illuminati attacked, losing their first-mover advantage and paying a greater price to take them down; the other was that the royal family sensed the situation was not good, and ran away ahead of time, and with the world being so big, there was nowhere to find them, leaving behind a seed of destruction for the future.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of situation, all make Zhi Peng headache, ask Yashan, Yashan gave to the answer is: "Some rats ran away, can not turn a big wave, according to the plan to advance normally."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thinks that the theory is beautiful, but simply can not uproot all the royal family, a little residue is very normal, and also do not have to care, these residual remnants of the era of at most fifty years, will be washed clean by time.</p><p></p><p>Currently, just make sure that the plan follows the established direction.</p><p></p><p>The 'endless troubles' that Zhi Peng was worried about, under the absolute power of the three of them, it was just a joke!</p><p></p><p>The original plan of clearing out all the royal clans within two days had actually taken a total of five days before and after, before the goal was largely accomplished.</p><p></p><p>One of the reasons for this was because the mages whose interests were directly infringed upon stepped in, the Source Mage Association originally did not allow the association members to intervene in this matter, but when the time was delayed backward by one day, some of the mages couldn't help but step in and directly attacked the Illumination Society's squad from the sidelines, saving the royal family in the name of righteousness. This was within Asan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The second was that Yashan had overestimated the strength of the Illuminati, and now that they were in a hard fight with the royal family, their own losses were very heavy.</p><p></p><p>This made Yashan helplessly shake his head and sigh, "Rotten, occupying an absolute advantage, but there are still squads that have missed."</p><p></p><p>In any case, once these five days had passed, it basically announced the demise of the world's eighteen empire's royal family, and the world's super nobles who had enjoyed the blessings of their forefathers for more than a thousand years, officially came to an end today.</p><p></p><p>The demise of the Imperial Clan set off an uproar in the world.</p><p></p><p>In conjunction with the Illumination Society's propaganda about the 'evils of the eighteen empires', everyone realized that the sky had changed.</p><p></p><p>But what was unbelievable to them was that in just a few days, half of the power of the entire world had changed hands, and they wouldn't even dare to dream about it.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, never thought that those human-like guys from the Imperial Clan would be able to do such tragic things, they are simply devoid of humanity! This is not treating people as human beings!"</p><p></p><p>"Are such cruel means something that a human being can come up with? Just thinking about it makes me shudder."</p><p></p><p>"In vain, I used to have quite a bit of respect for the people of the Imperial Clan, but now it seems like, pah, what kind of things are they? Being killed now is considered cheap for those dogs."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's the Guangyao Society that's sitting in the emperor position?"</p><p></p><p>"Shhh! Don't talk nonsense, isn't it already said, then in the future it won't be called the Emperor, it has to be called the Speaker of the House, saying the wrong thing is going to get you in trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's still the same? I hope this Guangyao will really as they say, treat people as people, I don't have high expectations, I'm satisfied if I have enough to eat and wear."</p><p></p><p>"Hey! How is that enough? The Illuminati has said that people are not livestock, it's not enough just to be fed, clothed and warmed, they also have to have dignity!"</p><p></p><p>"Dignity ...... huh!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The Eighteen Empires ......"</p><p></p><p>"Stop! Stop it for me, no need to tell me again, I've heard it all, if you want to brag about it, find someone else."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're pretty well informed, but what I'm going to tell you is something new, you've definitely never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"What? Tell me!"</p><p></p><p>"About the Mage Association's attitude, hey! I also heard it analyzed by someone, otherwise I hadn't seen it myself."</p><p></p><p>"The Mage Association? What's that got to do with it?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems you don't know about the Eighteen Empire Agreement! There's an article that says 'maintain the orthodox rule of the Eighteen Empires', and logically speaking, when it comes to something like the Illumination Society, the Mage Association, according to the agreement, is required to come forward and purge the Illumination Society for the Imperial Family. But the truth is, in the past few days since the Imperial Family was attacked and killed, have you seen the Mage Association move? Not at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss- hearing you say that, that's really true! Yet why?"</p><p></p><p>"Why? Heh heh! I've heard people analyze that there are two scenarios, one is that the Light Flare Society was perhaps formed by the Mages Association, and that they should have had enough of the royal family's exaltation for so many years, and looked for an opportunity to take them all out. The other theory is that the Kouyoukai passed the word with the Mages Association in advance before they acted, and the Mages Association acquiesced."</p><p></p><p>"The first one is still possible, but the second one is impossible when you think about it, right? How would the Mage Association acquiesce to this happening?"</p><p></p><p>"That's something you don't understand! I've heard people analyze that the Illuminati holds the power to destroy the world, and the Mage Association is throwing in the towel and doesn't dare to make any moves!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Inside a simple room in Fort Wo, Mage Wo was sitting by the desk table, making tea with his hands, but after many tries, he couldn't make the kind of tea that Javi had asked him to drink.</p><p></p><p>After taking a sip, he helplessly put the tea down and sighed softly, "The water is different, or the tea leaves are different?"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this attempt also failed, and the mage didn't know that the tea he drank was genetically modified 'spiritual tea', only knowing that after tasting it once, he couldn't forget about it, however, no matter how he operated it, he couldn't restore that kind of deliciousness!</p><p></p><p>Mage Kazu lightly said, "How is the situation now?"</p><p></p><p>A complicated look appeared on his guardian's face, "The world-wide royal family was almost slaughtered within a few days, and the direct royal family that often resided in the main city died completely!</p><p></p><p>There are also a small number of alert, escaped with their lives, but now are dead to hide themselves, do not dare to show their heads, according to this situation, I am afraid that the night can not sleep a peaceful sleep ......</p><p></p><p>This is also equivalent to, eighteen empire turned into history!</p><p></p><p>With this imperial family was slaughtered, there are many very capable administrative ministers, now the whole world order, after the destruction of the imperial family, into a chaos, many institutions have been unable to work properly ......</p><p></p><p>and Mages, how do you feel about this matter? Is our Mage Association really just going to stand by and do nothing?"</p>

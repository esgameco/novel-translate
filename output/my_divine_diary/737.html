        <h1>Chapter 737</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly for Su Hao and Ya Shan as they went through continuous integration and transformation of external brains.</p><p></p><p>The neural networks were massive and cumbersome, occupying the space in their skulls, so they created a small world inside their skulls to house them, appearing not much different from normal humans on the outside.</p><p></p><p>One day, Ya Shan found that his mind had become 'dazed'.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had integrated over a hundred external brains, comparable to some medium-sized mother bugs.</p><p></p><p>However, after integrating over a hundred external brains, Ya Shan did not feel a huge improvement. Instead, his thinking fell into a strange 'dazed' state.</p><p></p><p>He described it to Su Hao like this: "Master Su, something doesn't feel right...With such a powerful brain now, it seems the enhancement is no longer in the same direction as before, but veering in other directions. At the same time, I can't quite control my desire to think, simply put, I'm having incessant wandering thoughts...</p><p></p><p>This causes some confusion in my self-awareness, a bit of 'dazedness' where I can't distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p></p><p>It's like my powerful imagination is creating scenarios that are suppressing the real world perceived by my eyes and 'mind'. I exist in the real world, but also in the imaginary world..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the ping-pong space to observe Ya Shan's consciousness information and found it extremely active, but with an overall sense of vastness and dispersion, with the edges showing signs of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately exited and told Ya Shan: "There's a problem! Why are you rambling on? Hurry up and disconnect from the external brains!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's powerful brain immediately began churning frantically: "There's a problem? What's the problem? This feeling is very comfortable for me. Theoretically speaking, it's not a problem, but rather my brain is too powerful. Such an immensely powerful brain has too few problems to process, leaving its tremendous computing power idle..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ya Shan hesitating, Su Hao directly slapped his forehead.</p><p></p><p>*Whack!*</p><p></p><p>He instantly removed the newly added external brains from Ya Shan and casually tossed them aside...</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's consciousness was severely impacted, leaving him dazed for a while.</p><p></p><p>He asked in a muddled way: "Master Su, what was that situation just now?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "I don't know, but I threw away the external brains you just added. Do you remember the state you were in?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately nodded: "Yes, it felt like being immersed. It was like an instinct telling me that my limbs, eyes and nose were useless, that I could instantly obtain whatever I wanted solely through my brain..."</p><p></p><p>Originally the limbs, eyes and nose served the brain, but now the brain even disdained these 'servants' serving it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned: "It seems we've reached the limit of integrating external brains. Continuing to stack more would cause problems. I now understand why the mother bugs with such high intelligence are completely unable to communicate.</p><p></p><p>The mother bugs' neural networks integrated too rapidly. Before acquiring enough knowledge to develop super-high wisdom, they had already integrated enormously large neural networks, and inevitably fell into the mental world constructed by their brains.</p><p></p><p>They have no concept of self, no ability for self-control, only able to endlessly breed according to their initial programming.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness and computing power are closely related, but not the same thing."</p><p></p><p>He said to Ya Shan: "It seems we've reached our limit. Facts prove that increasing external brains is not entirely a good thing. We still need to appropriately streamline the number of external brains and find a suitable balance point. Being able to reach this level has already exceeded our initial expectations."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan gradually recovered, quickly understanding the danger of that state, and said with lingering trepidation: "Understood, Master Su."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the ping-pong space to observe Ya Shan's consciousness information again, finding that the sense of dispersion had disappeared, condensing back into a solid form, without any damage from the removal of the newly added external brains.</p><p></p><p>"Removing them immediately upon detecting an issue after just integrating them didn't cause any impact. Then, if I remove the portion of external brains that have already been adapted to, what effect would that have on the consciousness information? This is worth experimenting with."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After stopping the integration of external brains, Su Hao and Ya Shan took a temporary break, leaving their physical bodies behind and controlling the "Eight-Armed God" back to the research base.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was overjoyed to see the two masters after such a long time.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng excitedly said: "Master Su, Master Ya Shan, what have you two been up to these past few years? It's been so long since I last saw you."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had just completed an important research task and was very relaxed, smiling rarely: "Of course, we were in secluded meditation to break through to higher realms."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also smiled: "Secluded meditation for breakthroughs? What a coincidence, I did the same!"</p><p></p><p>Then he sent his new rating to Ya Shan: "Master Ya Shan, look, after all these years of hard work and study, I've finally obtained the title of 'Junior Computer'. Haha, I'll catch up to you soon!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan then smiled and sent his own 'Junior Scholar' title to Feng Cheng, without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was instantly petrified: "This this this...Master Ya Shan, this isn't scientific! When did you get promoted from researcher to scholar?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan looked surprised: "I got promoted a long time ago! Feng Cheng, you need to put in more effort. You're only a 'Junior Computer', when will you be able to catch up to me?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was speechless as he looked up at the sky: "How can I catch up to that?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan casually mentioned: "Oh right, I've also learned advanced spatial abilities, like 'small worlds', 'second-level spaces', and the newly developed 'second-level worlds'. What about you, Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>*Crack!*</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was truly petrified, staring at Ya Shan in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan looked surprised: "Feng Cheng, what's with that expression? Don't you believe me? Come, come, let me demonstrate."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan then performed various spatial abilities in front of Feng Cheng, showing off his skills.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's earlier smugness from his own promotion was completely gone, replaced by envy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He kept exclaiming in admiration: "Master Ya Shan, how did you do that? You're so awesome! As expected of Master Ya Shan!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "It's nothing much, really. Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng moved closer and whispered: "Master Ya Shan, is there some secret to it?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Of course there is."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's eyes lit up: "What secret? Tell me, if I also master 'second-level spaces', wouldn't I be able to do your laundry, cook for you, and change your life support systems? Isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed: "You brat, you make a fair point. Alright, I'll personally upgrade your brain in a couple days!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked surprised: "Upgrade my brain? What kind of brain? How is the secret related to brains?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan stated matter-of-factly: "Of course it is. The reason you can't learn second-level spaces is because your brain is too poor."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was struck again: "..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Su Hao said: "Ya Shan, Feng Cheng's realm hasn't reached our level yet. Don't integrate too many external brains into him all at once, just enough will do, to avoid issues."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was hit with tons of damage again: "..."</p><p></p><p>He said mournfully: "Master Su, I know I was wrong. In my previous life, I shouldn't have frequented the Celestial Music Palaces so much. I should have studied properly..."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Ya Shan finished integrating the first batch of external brains into Feng Cheng, Feng Cheng was simply dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that in these past few years, the two masters had quietly developed something so incredibly powerful beyond his wildest imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Too awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Then, somehow, he also mastered advanced abilities like second-level spaces.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly realized: "Such simple abilities, why couldn't I understand them before? It turns out my previous brain really wasn't good enough!"</p><p></p><p>His brain had been upgraded three times up to this point.</p><p></p><p>The first upgrade was the "Prophet Human", making him a true 'genius'.</p><p></p><p>The second upgrade was the 'consciousness platform' built from spiritual power, giving them extremely powerful computing capabilities and high-definition memory.</p><p></p><p>The third upgrade was 'external brains', directly completing the metamorphosis, forcibly stacking all their abilities up another level.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the third upgrade that he mastered the advanced spatial abilities, showing just how dull his original brain was.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan patted Feng Cheng's shoulder: "Don't worry about it. How good your initial brain was has nothing to do with you. As Master Su said, diligent study can change everything, including your brain. Keep working hard!"</p><p></p><p>He then gave Feng Cheng his first independent research project: "Research the structure of bug eggs and gene expression in bug eggs. In other words, modify the genetic information in the 'embryonic disc' of the bug eggs to the genetic information of the 'Bug God', and try to directly hatch 'Bug Gods' from the bug eggs.</p><p></p><p>The specific requirements have been sent to you through the assistant. Do you have confidence to complete this?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng exclaimed excitedly: "I get to do independent research now? I'm so awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan couldn't help but flick his forehead: "You brat, did you become an idiot after integrating those external brains?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng proudly showed off his forehead: "Master Ya Shan, look at this brain. Haha! Doesn't it look great? Feels good to flick too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Get lost. If you can't complete it, I'll pry those external brains right off you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was alarmed and backed away a few steps, covering his forehead nervously: "No way, Master Ya Shan. I've already integrated them, you can remove them?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan grinned: "Why not? Master Su is currently researching how to uninstall external brains!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng checked his assistant and indeed found some notes from Master Su on uninstalling external brains.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, you really can uninstall them! Master Ya Shan, I promise I'll complete the task!"</p>

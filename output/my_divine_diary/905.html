        <h1>Chapter 905</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The tsunami swept through the entire town, leaving an unknown number of people homeless, or even losing their lives.</p><p></p><p>In the face of nature's cruel disasters, the miracles built by humans were no different from sand castles erected on the beach.</p><p></p><p>After the seawater completely receded, all that remained was a mess, and the original appearance of the town was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Those who miraculously survived looked at everything in front of them, with many sitting on the ground, crying uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because all the wealth they had worked for their entire lives was gone, perhaps their loved ones could not be found, or perhaps it was simply venting the fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>More and more people joined the rescue team, searching for possible survivors in the disaster area.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng exhausted himself searching and rescuing until he was completely drained and collapsed on the ground, staring at the slightly different clouds in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Those who could survive must have either woken up or been rescued by now. Those who hadn't woken up or been found...the outcome was easy to imagine.</p><p></p><p>He tried to raise his numb and powerless arms and sighed, "I've done my best. Next, I need to conserve my remaining strength to face the real survival predicament. Water and food will be the main themes. I just don't know if the surrounding towns will have corresponding relief efforts."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a 'ding' sound suddenly rang in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Life Experience System activated, Xiaoyanjing sincerely serves you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng: "......"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally came to his senses, browsed through the system, and couldn't help but complain, "This is ridiculous, is this some big shot's prank? It's almost the same as those systems described in novels..."</p><p></p><p>As he browsed further, he became more and more excited. "As long as I have points, I can obtain everything, miraculous and powerful abilities, even eternal life...It's too powerful, far more powerful than the systems in novels by who knows how many times.</p><p></p><p>Points are everything!"</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, the small flame in his heart suddenly turned into a raging, blazing fire.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists tightly, and a surge of strength seemed to flow through his body, allowing him to sit up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"It's different now. This is the true meaning of 'experiencing a different life.' I have a chance to become extraordinarily powerful. As long as I exhaust all my efforts to struggle and strive, I have a chance to obtain everything I want."</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he would ultimately succeed, but this opportunity alone was enough for him to go all out in his attempt.</p><p></p><p>In other words, what did it matter if he failed?</p><p></p><p>But none of these people shouted or clamored to be sent back due to the drastic changes in their environment.</p><p></p><p>After going through a period of collapse and adaptation, their fighting spirit was reignited, determined to earn points and go all the way.</p><p></p><p>At this time, everyone had different thoughts, but without exception, none of them revealed their situation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone did an excellent job of disguising themselves as suffering survivors, strangers to their fellow countrymen.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When the dimensional travelers saw the mall, they were filled with confidence and hope for the future, but their appearance caused concerns for the deities.</p><p></p><p>Barry said helplessly, "Carefully count them, one hundred, no more, no less. I'm already numb. Gentlemen, what do you think we should do......"</p><p></p><p>Nati said indifferently, "You all discuss first, and let me know the results. Right now, I'm studying the newly acquired 'Little Deity Learning Machine,' and I find it very interesting. Every minute and second, I can feel tremendous progress. It won't be long before I surpass Lord Leian."</p><p></p><p>Baishen said, "I don't think there's anything to discuss. The simultaneous appearance of one hundred world wills is already the most absurd thing that could happen. No matter what happens next, I can accept it."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that after we help these world wills grow, the next time the world wills are inspired, they'll awaken a thousand at once..."</p><p></p><p>"It's very possible. But by then, it will have nothing to do with us, right? At most ten or so years, the Gail siblings will definitely be able to defeat the Great Demon Lord Chipu, and we'll be liberated. By then, whoever takes my position, it won't have anything to do with me. Yeah, I'm already sick of this narrow and cramped position."</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, please don't be blindly optimistic. Does anyone have the confidence to withstand the Great Demon Lord Chipu's final strike? Not to mention ten years, even if you give me a hundred years, I'd run far away at the sight of it. So, perhaps we should cultivate more world wills, guide them all to oppose the Great Demon Lord Chipu, and then let all the world wills unite to defeat him together."</p><p></p><p>"Just like when we played games together and fought epic elite monsters, only with enough people could we slowly grind the elite monster to death. It's obvious that the Great Demon Lord Chipu is a legendary elite monster, so the more people, the better."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we shouldn't see these one hundred world wills as a burden, but as our hope for breaking free."</p><p></p><p>With this change of perspective, the deities felt much more relaxed. When they looked at the one hundred dimensional travelers again, their expressions became more serene.</p><p></p><p>"These world wills do have some use after all."</p><p></p><p>So the deities began assigning supervisory tasks.</p><p></p><p>They were unwilling to have everyone watch simultaneously in real-time, so at most, they divided into six groups, with three people per group to supervise on a two-month rotation. When a 'natural crisis' occurred, they would call upon all the deities to face it together.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the dimensional travelers sent to the reformed planet were not as fortunate as those on the Cruciform Planet.</p><p></p><p>There were all kinds of races - humans, elves, beastmen, sea tribes, winged tribes......</p><p></p><p>After they woke up, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Beastman dimensional traveler: "What is this? So the so-called 'experience a different life' means turning into a different race? The key is, I don't like reading novels about reincarnating into different races, and the thought of going into heat and finding a different race girl in the future is a bit hard to accept. What should I do now? Waiting online..."</p><p></p><p>Human dimensional traveler: "It's certainly a different life, damn, straight back to primitive humans. If I get another chance, I'll definitely choose no, no, no! What are these leaves we're wearing? Oh no, the primitive girl is giving me a flirtatious look, yuck~"</p><p></p><p>Elf dimensional traveler: "What are these elves doing? Swallowing raw animal blood and flesh? Eating that many germs and parasites will definitely cause problems, right? These elves look quite tall, sturdy, and beautiful, but I didn't expect them to be so bloody...Oh crap, sure enough, there's a problem. The elf who swallowed the blood and flesh just burped, and it's only been two hours? I didn't expect the germs and parasites of primitive times to be so vicious...The leader is looking at me with a strange gaze, he's not thinking of making me swallow that bloody flesh too, is he? No way..."</p><p></p><p>Sea tribe dimensional traveler: "The ocean, it's all water...I can't take it anymore, I feel a bit stifled, I need to surface and breathe...cough cough cough! No, this won't work either, the air is more suffocating than the water. Oh no, I've realized I can't breathe anymore. What a different life, no no no..."</p><p></p><p>Winged tribe dimensional traveler: "Ahahahaha! I have wings now, I can fly, just ask if you're awesome or not, I can fly! Watch my spiral flying stunts...ah, I can't take it, I'm getting dizzy, no good, I'm going to crash...Dad, save me!!!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Initially after being transported, there were all kinds of emotions - more worries than joy, as they were concerned about their future.</p><p></p><p>If they were given another choice at that moment, perhaps they would choose 'no' without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But alas, there was no going back.</p><p></p><p>However, such emotions only lasted for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>After the system was activated, all the dimensional travelers' emotions generally became positively elated, especially when they saw the various awesome items in the mall - their emotions reached a peak.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt they were the special one, everyone felt the items in the mall would ultimately end up in their possession.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a dimensional traveler, I'm special, I'm the protagonist, destined to usher in a great era and transcend mortality."</p>

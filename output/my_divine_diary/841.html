        <h1>Chapter 841</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Among the intelligent beings of this world, since their birth, the two words "divine beings" have always accompanied their growth. The power and majesty of the divine beings were imperceptibly rooted deep in their souls. Unless there were accidents, this would accompany them for their entire lives until death.</p><p></p><p>Birth, aging, sickness, and death, clothing, food, housing, and transportation - everything was bestowed by the great divine beings. To them, even this world was created by the divine beings.</p><p></p><p>For the living beings of this world, the divine beings high above have been sacred and inviolable since ancient times. Even pondering where the divine beings came from was a sin...</p><p></p><p>As a follower of the Heavenly Deity Nati, the dragon mother Shaduo was no exception after receiving Nati's soul seed.</p><p></p><p>In a newly established "small world nest" in the ancestral land, the dragon mother Shaduo went in and out, testing whether this new nest was truly as Leian said, "undetectable from the outside, with only you three able to freely enter and exit, ensuring safety."</p><p></p><p>"Is this nest world really created by Leian himself? It's too miraculous. From the outside, it just looks like a tiny bead, who could have imagined there's another world inside?"</p><p></p><p>This made her recall the scene from two days ago when Leian brought her into a wondrous world.</p><p></p><p>When the Heavenly Deity Nati stood before her, her mind was filled only with the deity's majestic image and awe.</p><p></p><p>Just as she thought she was about to be punished by the divine being, she saw her most revered and great deity, the Heavenly Deity Nati, actually...smiling coyly at her own young son Leian Oakes?</p><p></p><p>This stark contrast nearly stopped her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Even now, she could hardly believe that her young son had imprisoned the Heavenly Deity Nati.</p><p></p><p>"No, according to Leian, he has captured and imprisoned all five deities of the dragon race, and told me not to worry about threats from the deities..."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo felt that something was amiss, but couldn't quite put her finger on what was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since giving birth to children, everything has been off. The saying goes 'one pregnancy, three years of foolishness', so it must be my problem..."</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out, or perhaps unwilling to admit it, the dragon mother Shaduo gradually let go of this matter and turned her attention to her other two children instead.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I should focus on raising those two foolish children Chipu and Moli first!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo suddenly remembered that Leian had also given Chipu and Moli each a stone, which would be crucial for surviving future crises. She couldn't help but ask, "Chipu, Moli, where are the stones your brother Leian gave you?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu and Moli looked up at their mother, full of confusion. "Yeah, the third brother did give them some stones, but where are those stones?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After days of testing and combining the previous research results on "soul power", Su Hao gradually figured out the basic mechanisms of the Ten-Colored Plate.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was a special aggregate of energy matter, extremely pure from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had never seen this kind of energy matter before. It was so peculiar that he could hardly understand the state in which this matter existed.</p><p></p><p>The matter we usually understand is generally a round, spherical, physically existing thing.</p><p></p><p>But the matter that constitutes this energy aggregate cannot be crudely described as "round rolling particles".</p><p></p><p>It was as if it were a conceptual + functional + bizarre thing.</p><p></p><p>Hard to understand, right?</p><p></p><p>Hard to understand is precisely the point.</p><p></p><p>But we can crudely understand the existence of this energy aggregate in another way:</p><p></p><p>First, imagine what "light" looks like - whether it's particles, waves, or something else. Then imagine a beam of light shining out from a flashlight, and at that moment, the male lead in an erotic movie presses the pause button.</p><p></p><p>So what interesting thing would happen then?</p><p></p><p>Correct, this beam of "light" that was emitted would be frozen, with all the light no longer advancing at the speed of light, but statically stopped in its original position, all states completely halted.</p><p></p><p>Then, more and more "light" would be emitted, frozen again, and stacked together, accumulating more and more until finally forming a unique aggregate. When stacked to a certain degree, it would gain physicality, a slime-like viscous gel substance with information density.</p><p></p><p>And this peculiar, unimaginable aggregate is what Su Hao saw as the microscopic appearance of the Ten-Colored Plate.</p><p></p><p>The entire Ten-Colored Plate gave Su Hao the impression of an inconceivable conceptual product.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao observed the Ten-Colored Plate, it presented this special state in front of him. Perhaps when Su Hao was no longer observing it, it reverted to another more chaotic state.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao had not upgraded his own brain, he might not even be able to comprehend what kind of thing this was.</p><p></p><p>In the naming convention of this world, it is called "soul power" and described as "the power capable of carrying souls".</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this is a usable form of energy, and the energy characteristics of "soul power" are the source of the deities' power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Hao also discovered some consciousness-related characteristics of the White Galr's body.</p><p></p><p>The White Galr's body was extremely similar to the "spirit brain" Su Hao created - a unified structure that could perfectly carry the operation of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The spirit brain Su Hao prepared for achieving immortality imitated the special structure of the Mother Bug's brain and was created from "spirit", possessing great learning and thinking power, but lacking the ability to give birth to multi-dimensional spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The captured Ten-Colored Plate, on the other hand, was composed of the conceptual substance "soul power" with a different structure, yet also possessed a certain degree of learning and thinking power.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the Ten-Colored Plate might possess the multi-dimensional spiritual power that Su Hao's spirit brain lacked.</p><p></p><p>It seemed quite perfect.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed it was at least more perfect than the spirit brain he created, but exactly how, he would need to experience it himself to determine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao guessed that the Ten-Colored Plate must have some deficiency that he had not noticed.</p><p></p><p>The spirit brain could be considered Su Hao's miraculous product after integrating the knowledge he had collected, a man-made product; while the Ten-Colored Plate was a natural miracle born from the accumulation of countless coincidences in the vast universe, an innate product.</p><p></p><p>But man-made products are not necessarily inferior to innate products.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of life form, the White Galr, is extremely difficult to simply observe and understand. Wanting to thoroughly research this special gel-like aggregate would undoubtedly be even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>It needs to wait until later when I find the White Galr's home planet to say more. Perhaps many puzzles will naturally unravel once I reach the White Galr's home planet.</p><p></p><p>For now, I'll research the abilities the White Galr has demonstrated, such as the application of consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Rather than the approach of "confronting difficulties head-on", Su Hao preferred to collect more information and find better, more concise ways to solve problems. This was how he had always done things.</p><p></p><p>So when Su Hao realized that thoroughly researching the White Galr's body would not be easy, he naturally bypassed this difficulty for the time being and turned to researching the White Galr's effects on consciousness instead.</p><p></p><p>He was also very interested in the deities' division of will.</p><p></p><p>This method of dividing will to control a body was like making a copy of one's consciousness information, then having the "soul power" carry this copy into a body avatar with a brain, merging with the avatar's brain to think and control the body's movements.</p><p></p><p>And this method of the Ten-Colored Plate's main body controlling avatars was different from how Su Hao controlled his [Divine] avatars.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao controlled [Divine] avatars, he used the resonance state of the bouncing space and [Divine] consciousness information, which can be simply understood as quantum entanglement. Even separated by vast distances in different spaces, he could still control them instantly.</p><p></p><p>But the Ten-Colored Plate's method of controlling avatars can be simply understood as "using a computer to control an excavator to cook".</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Ten-Colored Plate and its avatars were constantly exchanging massive amounts of signals at every moment to achieve consciousness synchronization between them, preventing the situation where the avatar develops independent thoughts from the main body.</p><p></p><p>This was also why, after Su Hao pulled the deities' avatars into the small world and cut off the signals, they could still think independently without issue.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, after being cut off by Su Hao, the avatars had already become separate individuals. If Su Hao blocked them for long enough, perhaps one day the avatars would no longer want to return to the main body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to test this hypothesis, Su Hao conducted a simple test on a few deities.</p>

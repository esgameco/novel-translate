        <h1>Chapter 884</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After Azhi woke up, Suhao paid attention for a while, but then ignored him.</p><p></p><p>He said he couldn't keep focusing on one person all day for one or two months - that's what the deities were for.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the performance of the two deities Barry and Zhuxia, Suhao was slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>With these two deities watching over him so closely, in theory Azhi should be able to last longer.</p><p></p><p>"This time I should be able to properly observe whether the wave amplitude increases, and if it's affected by us."</p><p></p><p>Then he ignored Azhi and instead studied the wave.</p><p></p><p>A month and a half later, the wave cut off.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was stunned and entered the pinball space to find that the second traveler had already died.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "......"</p><p></p><p>This was too fast! He remembered the two deities had mobilized the masses to jointly protect the second traveler.</p><p></p><p>"Azhi seemed to be doing well, how could he be so frail."</p><p></p><p>Suhao brought the deities into heaven and directly asked: "The second will of the world has died again, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Aside from the golden deity Barry and the resurrection deity Zhuxia, the other deities didn't react at first. After hearing Suhao's words, they were all dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Dead again?"</p><p></p><p>Finally their gazes focused on Barry and Zhuxia.</p><p></p><p>Barry and Zhuxia glanced at each other, both wanting the other to speak.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was Zhuxia who spoke up: "Ahem, well, it was an accident. Everything was fine before, the will of the world somehow secretly ran out of the small town, as if something terrible was chasing him. We were very worried about his safety, so we immediately influenced through the soul network to get a few people to persuade him to come back.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the will of the world seemed very scared. Seeing people coming to find him, he ran even faster. In the end, he accidentally tripped and slammed his head into a sharp rock, dying..."</p><p></p><p>The deities: "......"</p><p></p><p>This was even more bizarre than the plots written in novels.</p><p></p><p>The deity of radiance, Yihao, asked curiously: "If life was going well, why did he run? Did you do something to him? Or did you do something?"</p><p></p><p>After Zhuxia described the protection process, he said matter-of-factly: "Barry and I provided the highest level of protection for the will of the world. If he hadn't suddenly run out of town, he could have easily lived for a few decades."</p><p></p><p>The deity of salvation, Baishen, laughed: "You two fools, you terrified the will of the world. What talents you are."</p><p></p><p>Zhuxia didn't understand: "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Baishen vividly described the 'horrific' experience from Azhi's perspective, then laughed: "If it were you, wouldn't you find this scene terrifying? What would you do?"</p><p></p><p>With Baishen's explanation, the deities suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the task failure notification sounded, and each deity lost 100 points.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "From now on, every task failure will deduct 100 points from each of you. However, the task reward for you has been adjusted - as long as you can ensure the will of the world survives for one year, you will be rewarded 5,000 points. So keep working hard!"</p><p></p><p>The deity of suppressing heaven, Natie, curiously asked: "Lord Lei'an, will the will of the world keep being reborn? Is he also from Baijia'er?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoa - awesome!" The other deities didn't expect Natie to actually ask that, and couldn't help gasping in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"This silly golden dragon is quite brave."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "The will of the world is not from Baijia'er, it is something you cannot comprehend. It will keep changing its surface will, seeking ways to grow, until it finds a suitable surface will and fully matures. For you, the sooner the will of the world matures, the greater your benefit and the faster you will gain the freedom you want.</p><p></p><p>So work hard, deities! You have to fight for your own freedom."</p><p></p><p>Suhao added: "In one to two months, the third will of the world will be born. Let's see your performance."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he left.</p><p></p><p>Through observing Azhi, he had discovered that the influence they three had created would indeed accumulate, and then be released onto the newborn traveler.</p><p></p><p>However, the energy was also gradual, not exaggerated to an unresistable degree.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "In the end, this Azhi is just too weak. On to the next one."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The third traveler was a formidable second-rate master, with exceptional martial arts skills. He died unfortunately in a feud, but woke up extremely angry, shouting that he was just a bit away from slaying his enemy with his sword.</p><p></p><p>'Just a bit away', again just a bit away!</p><p></p><p>"Since the heavens have given me another chance, I will definitely..."</p><p></p><p>Four months later, the third traveler died from overexertion after accidentally falling into a river.</p><p></p><p>The deities summarized the reason afterwards: Overwork led to leg cramps, unable to swim ashore on his own. When the deities sent a rescue, ferocious large fish happened to swim by in the river and dragged him away. Moderation in all things is key.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The fourth traveler made a brilliant debut. He had been poisoned to death by an adulterous couple. Extremely resentful towards his wife's betrayal so soon after marriage, he became completely disillusioned with so-called love and turned gloomy. He felt everyone around him was a bit off, especially loving couples - he always felt they would eventually betray each other in the end. He even developed a habit of enjoying watching couples argue.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just live this solitary life, it's quite nice. No expectations, no hurt, no betrayal."</p><p></p><p>Three months later, as he passed by a street, a couple was quarreling upstairs. He stopped to spectate, when suddenly a kitchen knife flew out the window, straight into the fourth traveler's forehead. He fell to the ground convulsing and died shortly after.</p><p></p><p>The deities summarized the reason afterwards: It's wrong to enjoy others' misfortune...they should have guided the will of the world to have a bright and brave heart.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The fifth traveler quickly descended. In his previous life he had died trying to stop a robbery. After waking up, his courage greatly increased: "Indeed, a righteous and brave person can gain the favor of the deities. My heroic act has allowed me to revive again. I've decided, from now on I will become the embodiment of justice."</p><p></p><p>When the deities heard the fifth traveler's declaration, they immediately felt something was wrong and initiated emergency measures, almost eliminating any injustice in his vicinity.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the deities looked at the harmonious small town scene, very satisfied with their masterpiece, believing no problems would occur.</p><p></p><p>Until at an intersection, the fifth traveler saw a dog assaulting a pig: "You wicked dog, let go of that sow!"</p><p></p><p>He bravely rushed in to fight the dog, chasing it for over 2,000 meters, before suffering a heart attack and dying from shock.</p><p></p><p>The deities summarized the reason afterwards: Animals can't commit incest either...no, we lacked proper guidance on the concept of courage for the will of the world. Courage needs to be used in conjunction with wisdom.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The sixth traveler was killed by a falling object from a high place.</p><p></p><p>The deities summarized: Will of the world, please persevere a bit!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The seventh traveler died from mistakenly eating cycad seeds.</p><p></p><p>The deities summarized: Please, we're out of points...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The deities said they had lived for who knows how many years, but had never seen such bizarre events.</p><p></p><p>They even changed the task name to 'The Great Battle to Protect the Will of the World', and later to 'The Great Battle to Protect Points', to motivate themselves to protect the will of the world.</p><p></p><p>But it was no use. No matter how they tried, they couldn't protect the will of the world's life - the will of the world would always die due to various coincidences.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the eighteen deities were responsible for protecting the will of the world, while another group of people were hiding elsewhere, trying their best to put it in mortal danger.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, that unknown group was a hundred times more capable than them.</p><p></p><p>The deities suddenly felt powerless, no longer knowing how to protect a single person.</p><p></p><p>The deity of order, Hongguang, couldn't help but complain: "I can't stand it anymore, even if he is the will of the world, I have to say, this group of wills of the world are simply too stupid. What qualifies them to be the will of the world? Lord Natie is far stronger than them. They're all rushing to die, it's the first time I've seen this."</p><p></p><p>Natie: "Hey hey, what do you mean Hongguang?"</p><p></p><p>Hongguang: "I'm praising you."</p><p></p><p>The deity of salvation, Baishen, suddenly said: "Why don't we send our 'heroic' believers to personally protect him!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>In their view, a powerful person who had consumed the soul fruit would definitely be able to protect the safety of a mere child.</p><p></p><p>Four months later, the hero had a nightmare while sleeping at night and beat the traveler into a meat patty.</p><p></p><p>The deities: "......"</p><p></p><p>The deity of salvation, Baishen, suggested again: "Since external protection doesn't work, why don't we send over a suitable soul fruit!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>Finally...this will of the world survived for a year!</p><p></p><p>The deities finally obtained 5,000 points, filling the previous deficit.</p><p></p><p>But the will of the world's confidence mysteriously skyrocketed after becoming stronger. At just seven years old, he went out to sea to venture into the heroic world, unstoppable despite others trying to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Another three months later, during a battle with pirates, he fell into the sea and was swallowed by a sea beast.</p><p></p><p>The deities: "What should we do? What can save you, my will of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao was also speechless: "These travelers' mentalities are too weak! I thought the Blue-Purple Planet would be the qualified hometown of travelers, but now it doesn't seem that way at all. These people look alright, but their perception of danger is too weak, and their mentalities are also immature, making it difficult for them to become qualified travelers."</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought he could find suitable companions through the travelers, but now it didn't seem so easy - whether the travelers could survive was already a problem.</p><p></p><p>After learning about this, Yashan suggested: "Old Master Wei, the people on the Blue-Purple Planet have too narrow a perspective and are innately deficient. If we switch to someone who has been heavily influenced by novels and films, their survival rate may be much higher. Why don't we modify the Blue-Purple Planet first, advance it to the information age, and cultivate a batch of usable talents?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought it made sense and nodded: "Good, leave this matter to you. I still have some other people, I'll try a few more times."</p><p></p><p>After so many failures, Suhao didn't have high expectations for the batch of travelers he had.</p><p></p><p>But he decided to try: "Let's change our approach, maybe it will work. When deploying the travelers, I'll implant them with an 'invincible system' to restrict their actions and ensure they don't die too quickly."</p>

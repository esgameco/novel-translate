        <h1>Chapter 734</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After many years of development, the sphere of human influence in the Yunhuan System gradually expanded, like a drop of red ink falling into a cup and slowly spreading outward.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they went, the Octopus Clan retreated step by step, unable to stop them.</p><p></p><p>Countless years ago, the Octopus Clan's expansion was extremely fierce, but now their retreat is equally rapid.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan relied on energy blocks to become so powerful that they could dominate the entire galaxy. But it is also because of these energy blocks that they have become so fragile, unable to even approach human warships.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when many human warships arrived at the Octopus Clan's colony planets, they found that the Octopus Clan had almost completely evacuated the entire planet, leaving only some abandoned individuals waiting to die. Humans were able to take over the entire planet with almost no effort...</p><p></p><p>How deeply they depended on the energy blocks, and how miserable they became when the energy blocks were taken away!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood this well.</p><p></p><p>"How deeply do I depend on the Ballistic Space, and how tragic would my end be if I lost the Ballistic Space? Isn't this exactly what happened to the Octopus Clan? They seemed invincible, dominating the entire Yunhuan System without any rivals.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that when they lost the energy blocks, they would become so fragile and feeble?</p><p></p><p>The Ballistic Space is my core, but...I must rid myself of this dependence.</p><p></p><p>Even if it leaves me one day, I will not lose everything I have now."</p><p></p><p>So how can he rid himself of his dependence on the Ballistic Space?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't know for now, but perhaps one day in the future he might find a way.</p><p></p><p>At least, his past self could never have imagined growing to his current level, just as he cannot imagine how powerful his future self will become.</p><p></p><p>Just focus on the present, ensuring gains at every moment, and leave the future to time itself!</p><p></p><p>As for connecting to the neural network, Su Hao planned to enter the Second Space himself to help Yashan complete the corresponding experiments.</p><p></p><p>The main bodies of the three of them were currently still in the Second Space. Unless necessary, Su Hao did not plan to move their main bodies out of the 'Second Space'.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was to avoid unnecessary risks. Facing the Erun System, Su Hao felt it was better to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent a message to Yashan through the Small Black Room: "Yashan, are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>Because Su Hao didn't fully trust 'Yashan's products', before officially connecting Yashan to a large amount of neural tissue, he had Yashan demonstrate the experimental process on a prisoner first. Sure enough, he uncovered quite a few problems, such as the subject's skull not being able to be put back on after the surgery was completed...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao made some modifications to the plan for Yashan, performed the operation himself to confirm there were no issues, and only then did he officially connect Yashan to the neural network.</p><p></p><p>After all, the brain is a precious thing, and even the slightest mistake could lead to irreversible consequences.</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied: "I have already encased my brain with the 'Identifier Array', transforming it into a 'Brain Core'. I'm ready to connect to the neural network at any time! The Identifier Array is currently running very smoothly!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Hao grabbed a huge box, entering the Second Space and arriving at the location where Yashan's main body was hiding.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Yashan could complete the connection to the neural network himself without Su Hao's help. But this was the Second Space, different from other places, so Yashan could not complete such a complex operation within the Second Space.</p><p></p><p>Being in the Second Space gave a very special feeling, like walking a tightrope high in the air, requiring constant balance at all times.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, one slight misstep could cause you to fall to one side, leaving the Second Space entirely.</p><p></p><p>Yashan lay flat on a simple metal table, eyes tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand over Yashan's head, and a complete skull cap detached from Yashan's head, which Su Hao set aside...</p><p></p><p>With the skull cap removed, the golden interior was exposed - this was the 'Brain Core' structure that Yashan had built using the 'Identifier Array'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "How does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't necessary to remove the skull cap, but the main reason for doing so was to make it easier for Su Hao to observe.</p><p></p><p>There probably weren't many people who could answer this question.</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "This...feels a bit chilly? It's a bit different."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Since there's no problem, then I'll start connecting you to the neural tissue!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Okay, Master Su, I'm really looking forward to it!"</p><p></p><p>After the experiment was completed, he would gain an unparalleled intelligent brain, so how could he not look forward to it?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes narrowed slightly, his vast spiritual sense contracting and focusing as he retrieved a single neural module and embedded it into the interface of Yashan's 'Brain Core' structure, securing it in place.</p><p></p><p>Each neural module consisted of approximately one million nerve cells, and Yashan's first-stage target was to connect one thousand such modules.</p><p></p><p>These neural modules were extracted from the 'twin insect eggs' produced by the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>The extraction method was very simple: first, perform surgery on the mother insect to destroy the structure that produces 'twin insect eggs', so that the eggs it produces no longer have the 'twin synchronization' function. Then, when the nerve system of the insect eggs develops to a certain stage, directly extract the nerve system to form a complete neural module.</p><p></p><p>These neural modules had not yet been connected to the mother insect's brain, so they were very pure. Even when connected to Yashan's brain, they would not bring any extraneous memories.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's movements were steady as he perfectly embedded one neural module after another.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Su Hao's assembly was nearing completion.</p><p></p><p>After embedding the final neural module, he used a 'fusion liquid' to bond all the neural modules together.</p><p></p><p>Only at this point did he finally exhale deeply and say, "Finally assembled!"</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't over yet. He also installed a small psychic organization life support device in a specially left vacant space. After confirming it was operating normally, he replaced Yashan's skull cap.</p><p></p><p>"Done! Yashan, first adjust the state of your head and adapt to the changes. Then gradually activate the neural network and see how it feels."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master Su! Just a moment!"</p><p></p><p>*Cracking sounds*</p><p></p><p>Yashan's head was encased in adamantine armor, and the wound quickly healed, the skull cap once again fusing with his brain. From outward appearances, there was no abnormality...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao commented, "Your head circumference has increased by a circle!"</p><p></p><p>Without opening his eyes, Yashan activated the 'Identifier Array' to connect to the external neural structure...</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Yashan opened his eyes, his expression one of utter shock.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked, "Yashan, how does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan murmured, "Master Su, I've developed split personalities!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Hm? Split personalities?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan snapped out of his immersed state, extremely excited as he said, "Master Su, I really have split personalities! But it's not like the pathological split personalities where others try to seize control of the body and consciousness from me. I'm still me..."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of perception, I've split into many smaller selves that can simultaneously think about hundreds of different issues, while I'm also clearly aware that all these issues are being thought about by myself.</p><p></p><p>If the 'Identifier Array' gave me the feeling of my spiritual sense being 'omnipresent', then adding the psychic modules gives me the feeling that my thinking is 'omnipotent'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just the most obvious change. My 'spiritual sense' also seems to have undergone a metamorphosis, but being in the 'Second Space' right now, I can't sense it very clearly...</p><p></p><p>Oh? Master Su, I think I've grasped the ability to control the 'Second Space' now. I just need to install 'angular momentum balance wheels' on my fixed spiritual tentacles!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, I was really stupid before..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Yashan's words, Su Hao felt a mix of understanding and confusion.</p><p></p><p>He understood that many personal experiences could not be fully expressed through language - to truly know, he would have to try it himself.</p><p></p><p>So he asked the most important question: "Yashan, do you feel anything amiss?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan knew what Su Hao was asking, so after carefully checking, he said, "No, I don't feel anything amiss. On the contrary, I'm really enjoying this feeling.</p><p></p><p>I can feel that my thinking space has become larger. To put it simply, the concept of 'self-awareness' used to be very vague, but now it has become very clear.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have a feeling that I can think about more complex things. It's like a very simple program being loaded into a supercomputer.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, my thinking power, associative ability, data retrieval speed, and so on have all improved to some extent, though I may need more training to truly metamorphose."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Hao closed his eyes and entered the Ballistic Space to observe Yashan's consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he was startled.</p><p></p><p>Yashan's consciousness information activity level was at least twice as high as before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his consciousness information was visibly expanding!</p><p></p><p>This was an unprecedented phenomenon!</p><p></p><p>For humans, what exactly did brain nerve cells signify?</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Master Su, I've grasped how to use the Second Space now. I can move freely within it. Do you need me to help?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Since that's the case, you can help me assemble the external brain!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan clapped his hands together enthusiastically, "Okay, Master Su! My skills are quite good!"</p>

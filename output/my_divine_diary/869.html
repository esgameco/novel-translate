        <h1>Chapter 869</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had many means to observe the universe - light, particles, rays, various spiritual eyes...</p><p></p><p>The range of the universe he could observe reached thousands of billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>But such an observation distance was meaningless for his previous life self, because observing was useless. To truly know the secrets of the distant realms, he had to go there in person.</p><p></p><p>Even at his ultimate speed, he did not have enough lifespan to complete this long journey that seemed to have no end.</p><p></p><p>Now it was different. He possessed a theoretically eternal mind that could keep exploring outwards. What could be observed could become the goal, and as long as it was the goal, he could eventually reach it.</p><p></p><p>Tens of millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, billions of years...</p><p></p><p>No matter how many years, everywhere Su Hao went would become the fertile soil for his growth, all part of his territory.</p><p></p><p>And time became the least important thing. What he had valued most suddenly became worthless.</p><p></p><p>"The journey of billions of light-years begins now. From this moment, I depart! The distant starry sky I see, I will be able to reach."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not depart alone, but would bring Ya Shan and Feng Cheng together, the three exploring in tandem to increase efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, I have completed the 'soul brain' update for all my divine avatars. Each of you will control one hundred avatars heading out in different directions. Through the 'galaxy network', travel at maximum speed to at least ten billion light-years away - the farther the better. Then from over ten billion light-years out, begin searching for intelligent life planets."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had calculated that at the extreme speed of their 'galaxy network', it would only take a few hundred years to travel ten billion light-years.</p><p></p><p>Ten billion light-years was far enough that Su Hao believed the 'dimensional travelers' passing through would produce observable ripples.</p><p></p><p>Based on this time estimate, if they successfully found a suitable 'dimensional traveler's homeland', the civilizations built by the Crux and Ya Shan, Feng Cheng and others should have matured by then, allowing the plan to proceed.</p><p></p><p>Everything was just right.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng immediately said, "Got it, Great Lord Wei."</p><p></p><p>They were already very proficient at such exploratory missions.</p><p></p><p>'Exploring the universe' was a natural imprint etched deep in their souls, which they were happy to do.</p><p></p><p>Splitting off into a hundred smaller selves put no pressure on them now that they had fully upgraded to 'soul brains'.</p><p></p><p>Even simultaneously controlling a thousand avatars to explore outward would not affect their daily 'world-creation' work.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng connected to the divine avatars at the deity base. Each controlled a hundred avatars, transporting to the nearest reachable planet by the black hole. The vast numbers set off towards the black hole using 'star travel', each avatar looking eager.</p><p></p><p>The long outward exploration journey had officially begun.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao's main consciousness remained in the small world of the Weng system, doing his own things.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to launch the plan to transform this world."</p><p></p><p>He leisurely tidied up his laboratory, then strolled out the door. As he walked, his figure gradually faded until disappearing. At the same time, a strolling figure became clear in another small world.</p><p></p><p>After attaining eternal life, Su Hao's mindset had unconsciously changed. He no longer rushed things, having a relaxed and unhurried feeling.</p><p></p><p>This change in demeanor reflected his changed mentality. In fact, his efficiency did not decrease significantly, but rather improved.</p><p></p><p>He appeared slow and leisurely, but could arrange everything properly. Research projects could quickly determine a high-quality solution, smoothly reaching the final result.</p><p></p><p>Quite abnormal. It proved the saying that the result of frantic effort is not necessarily better than a 'casual attitude' - it depends on the person.</p><p></p><p>This small world was specially created by Su Hao as the 'Divine Realm' for the eighteen deities. A large small world containing eighteen smaller worlds, each deity's absolute territory.</p><p></p><p>Each deity had the right to freely enter and exit their domain, remodeling it according to their will - an absolutely safe 'Divine Kingdom'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this so-called 'Divine Kingdom' was a high-priced product Su Hao released on the mall. The deities earned credits through hard work, then redeemed them for this.</p><p></p><p>If the deities wanted to upgrade their 'Divine Kingdom', it required massive credits. If they wanted to bring in servants, massive credits. If they wanted more kingdom privileges, massive credits...</p><p></p><p>In short, the mall's various beautiful products dangled temptingly before the deities every day: Want them? Work hard, deities!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao arrive, the eighteen deities abandoned their high-priced super avatars. Their main bodies emerged from their small 'Divine Kingdoms' to float before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>For the deities' safety, they usually operated using 'avatars', keeping their main bodies in the safer Divine Kingdoms to avoid any accidents.</p><p></p><p>It was like hiding their main bodies in various corners of the Crux decades ago.</p><p></p><p>But it was different when Su Hao came. To show utmost respect, they chose to meet him with their main bodies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there may also have been the implication of 'demonstrating absolute obedience and harmlessness to Lord Wei'.</p><p></p><p>The deities excitedly greeted him: "Lord Wei, long time no see. Why have you come in person? Do you have some highly difficult mission for us? Haha, rest assured, as long as we have enough credits, we will definitely complete the mission perfectly, no cutting corners."</p><p></p><p>There were too many good things in the mall, but they had too few credits - this was the core conflict.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Of course, I do have an extremely important mission now that only you eighteen deities can handle. Moreover, it has a long period, many credits, a light task - most crucially, your source of earning credits will be very stable. Upon completing the mission, my initial estimate is that you can earn at least one hundred thousand credits."</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The deities all gasped in unison, though it was unclear how the colorful boards could gasp.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred thousand credits? I've worked so many years and haven't even reached two thousand total. How much is that? Isn't that enough to sweep up everything in the mall?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much, exchanging seventeen or eighteen items and it'll be depleted, right?"</p><p></p><p>"But that's still a lot."</p><p></p><p>After marveling for a moment, the deities became restless with curiosity, asking, "Lord Wei, what is the mission?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao instructed them to open their world-creation assistants, then said, "Do you still remember the first world-creation game I had you play long ago? You all passed it according to the requirements back then. Now this mission is the sequel to that game."</p><p></p><p>"The sequel to the world-creation game?"</p><p></p><p>The deities were stunned. Regarding this game, they had guessed long ago - as the name 'world-creation' implied, it was a game for remodeling worlds. But since Su Hao had not initiated it for so long, they thought it was just Su Hao idly trying it out once. Who knew he would suddenly tell them the sequel had arrived now?</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu Wen asked, "Lord Wei, do you plan to transform the Crux into another form?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Indeed, similar to what I told you before. I want you to bestow 'souls' upon all the newly born intelligent life on the Crux. At the same time, create eighteen different underworld realms to handle the 'souls' of intelligent beings after death. Strive to transform the entire world into a new one with elements like 'immortals, ghosts, mortals, demons' within a thousand years. It sounds complicated, but as long as you follow the tasks arranged by the world-creation system one by one, you can complete the world's transformation."</p><p></p><p>The reason for bestowing souls upon all intelligent beings was to connect the entire world into one with a vast soul network, facilitating real-time observation of the 'dimensional travelers'' actions. It would also allow silently changing the environment and people around the travelers, continuously applying pressure to avoid 'slacker dimensional travelers' and wasting resources.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when dimensional travelers encountered ripple effects endangering them, they could be rescued in time to preserve their lives and prevent premature disposal.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao finished explaining, the deities looked at each other in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>They had thought Su Hao was just speaking casually before, never imagining he was serious.</p><p></p><p>They also never expected that the soul power they possessed had such tremendous strength to change the entire world's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Bestowing every intelligent life with a soul, creating heavens and hells for after death?</p>

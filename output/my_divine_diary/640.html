        <h1>Chapter 640</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Since he knew this was the result of Old Master Wei's meddling, after calming down a bit, Feng Cheng felt there was no need to make a big fuss about it.</p><p></p><p>This was Old Master Wei after all, what's the big deal about boiling a planet, it's no different than boiling an egg!</p><p></p><p>So Feng Cheng returned to the astronomical observation center with a calm face and said, "The Key Star incident? No problem, it's a normal phenomenon. My old master is just conducting an experiment up there, a small scene!" </p><p></p><p>Everyone at the astronomical center gasped in shock, screaming internally: "You call this a small scene? Then what counts as a big scene?"</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to question Feng Cheng's words, though they were fuming inside.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng left, everyone crowded around the monitors again, observing the images transmitted back by the satellites.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Key Star was tumbling more and more violently, as if the entire planet was under the most intense attack, roiling and boiling like a fireball.</p><p></p><p>The fireball visibly expanded, growing larger and larger, the light it radiated becoming increasingly dazzling...</p><p></p><p>"This...is really just an experiment? Why does the word 'experiment' make me think of a white indoor setting with all kinds of test tubes first?"</p><p></p><p>"Now if someone tells me this is an experiment, the first thing I'll think of is that the planet got boiled again..."</p><p></p><p>"Just who is Teacher Feng Cheng? And who is his old master?"</p><p></p><p>"Obviously they're not normal people we can imagine! Look, it's been so many years, we've gone from youthful teenagers to greasy middle-aged men, but Teacher Feng Cheng still looks the same. He'll probably still be swaggering in and out of the celestial music palace even after we're all in the ground...it's too ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, I'm getting scared just listening to you guys."</p><p></p><p>"You think maybe it's the 'Creator' himself slumming it in the human realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Shh—— that's possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe he's the 'Creator's' son!"</p><p></p><p>The people in the observation center discussed back and forth, realizing that aside from the word 'deity', there was no way to explain everything they had witnessed.</p><p></p><p>They all felt a chill down their spines and broke out in cold sweat: "Just who is Teacher Feng Cheng's master...what kind of experiment could reach this level? Could it be that all the legendary disasters have converged on Key Star? Unthinkable! You have to know, this is an entire planet!"</p><p></p><p>Another problem was: with such a huge incident, they really wanted to brag about it, but were afraid to let it slip, so what could they do? Keeping it bottled up was hard to bear!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao, who was on Key Star, showed a faint smile as he observed the chaotic scene below: "This time, it should be considered a success."</p><p></p><p>At most another ten minutes, and over half of the material on this planet would be transformed into 'virus replicators'. Excluding the small cubes that naturally 'died' from lack of source material, the remaining portion would be enough to turn the entire planet into virus replicators in a very short time!</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, if the previous Key Star was considered a fist, then the Key Star fully invaded by the virus would expand to nearly the size of a van!</p><p></p><p>How exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Poof poof poof!"</p><p></p><p>Egg-shaped planet viruses shot out from the roiling interior of the planet like insect eggs, only to fall back down under the influence of gravity.</p><p></p><p>During the planet's rampage, with all forces inside in chaos, many 'planet viruses' had just transmitted through the spatial gates when the immense pressure blasted them out, squeezing through the seething surface of the planet and launching high into the air, creating the 'spraying insect eggs' scene witnessed by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine what the interior of this planet had become, infested by the viruses.</p><p></p><p>Under the intense squeezing pressure, a large number of planet viruses must have died, losing their replication ability. But there were bound to be even more viruses, infiltrating every nook and cranny to capture the remaining material and transform it into source material, continuing their preset tasks.</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that Su Hao finally realized the terror of the 'planet virus' he had personally created.</p><p></p><p>No! Not just the planet virus, anything with the word 'virus' attached to it seemed terrifying to Su Hao!</p><p></p><p>The planet expanded faster and faster, while Su Hao retreated further and further, slowly moving away from this dying planet to observe it quietly in space.</p><p></p><p>Key Star seemed to enter a red-light-reflected struggle phase, with violent explosions erupting everywhere, the entire planet convulsing violently. But after reaching a certain peak, the planet's rampage gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao keenly sensed this and murmured, "It's entered the final stage now!"</p><p></p><p>The entire planet was gradually turning into an ocean of viruses, with the magma greatly reduced. That apocalyptic scene was fading away...</p><p></p><p>But what met the eye now was absolutely no better than the previous raging scene, and might even directly suffocate someone with a phobia of crowded spaces.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed ellipsoid replicators and metal cubes were jumbled together. Lacking enough source pearls to support them, they could only maintain their ellipsoid shapes and flow like water under the influence of various forces, emitting a harsh grating of metal against metal.</p><p></p><p>The entire planet had changed its appearance.</p><p></p><p>What was once a beautiful reddish-yellow star had turned into this shimmering silver look.</p><p></p><p>And this transformation had occurred in less than five hours.</p><p></p><p>The observers at the astronomical observation center who had watched Key Star's changes unfold were all dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation? It was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>They doubted whether the scenes they had witnessed were real or just hallucinations from staring at celestial bodies day after day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Once everything had settled, Su Hao calmly gazed at the silvery-white planet in the distance.</p><p></p><p>His emotions were too complex to put into words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he reached out and grabbed a basketball-sized metal sphere in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This metal sphere was named the 'Igniter' by Su Hao. Its function was simple - to ignite the planets invaded by the 'virus', allowing all the virus replicators in standby mode to transform back into source material, then spray high-energy rays into the depths of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the 'Igniter', Su Hao went to the polar axis of Key Star's rotation, wrapped the metal sphere in layers of indestructible armor and an array of protective spells.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the 'Igniter' in one hand, taking a throwing stance.</p><p></p><p>"Burn, planet!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he channeled most of his strength into his arm and flung it down violently.</p><p></p><p>"——"</p><p></p><p>The 'Igniter' instantly vanished from Su Hao's hand, transforming into a crimson beam of light that pierced into the roiling silver planet. When the light disappeared, the planet's surface erupted in a massive 'splash', metal fragments spraying in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous roar echoed through the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>And with the Igniter deep inside, it activated, igniting the 'virus replicators'.</p><p></p><p>Just a minute later, a blinding particle stream gushed out from where Su Hao had struck, carrying a massive amount of photons and various materials.</p><p></p><p>It was like Su Hao's 'Twenty-Four Sword Formation - Sword of Dawn'.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what would happen to anyone in the path of this particle stream's ejection, but perhaps in less than a second they would happily join the particle stream on its joyous journey through the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, this particle stream grew thicker, expanding from its initial diameter of just ten meters to several hundred meters, rapidly diffusing outwards.</p><p></p><p>It continued expanding until reaching a diameter of 100,000 meters before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would take two years to eject most of the planet's mass.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could hardly contain his excitement, giving himself a thumbs up: "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Su Hao discovered a flaw: the brilliant, dazzling particle stream gradually slowed down and finally extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slapped his forehead speechlessly: "No matter how much I calculated, I didn't account for the virus replicators only being able to operate for two hours at most before collapsing back into real matter and losing functionality..."</p><p></p><p>Not two years, not even two hours!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao watched as Key Star's volume shrank smaller and smaller at an accelerating pace, crumbling like a mountain collapsing.</p><p></p><p>He said silently, "I guess this counts as a failure? Yeah, a failure."</p><p></p><p>He had almost thought he succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Was this a case of failure leading to success?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao glanced at Key Star and suddenly felt it was all meaningless. "Let's go! I got excited for nothing."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Hao vanished from the spot, returning to his base miniworld.</p><p></p><p>However, even in failure, Key Star still had some use for Source Star.</p><p></p><p>"Next experiment, no need to choose Key Star. Any insignificant large satellite will do."</p><p></p><p>If Key Star disappeared, it would still have some impact on Source Star, potentially causing a large number of asteroids in the asteroid belt to lose the corresponding gravitational influence and crash into Source Star, bringing disaster.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to the base miniworld, Su Hao calmed himself down again to ponder how to fix the flaw that caused the 'planet virus' to fail in the final stage of operation.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that in just one day, news of Key Star's abnormality had spread all over Source Star, with all kinds of pictures and videos flooding the internet.</p><p></p><p>After a thousand words, it all boiled down to one sentence: "Holy crap, awesome!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone believed there really were 'deities' in this world.</p>

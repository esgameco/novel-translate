        <h1>Chapter 926</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Yashan's Wuqiong Gate and Fengcheng's Double Sword Gate grew larger and larger, with more and more people.</p><p></p><p>Under the accumulation of numbers, people with different talents gradually stood out.</p><p></p><p>Among them, those with strong combat power were the most numerous, followed by explorers, manufacturers, while research talents were very rare.</p><p></p><p>But it also gave birth to quite a few research talents.</p><p></p><p>This type of talent was the one that Su Hao and the other two valued the most. Usually, once discovered, they would personally take them away for guidance and keep them by their side for long-term guidance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also Su Hao's most urgent need at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Most of the research projects in Su Hao's plan were sub-field research projects, such as directly transforming a plant full of vitality with the source, transforming a body that can directly house a soul with the source, directly transforming various objects with supernatural abilities with the source...</p><p></p><p>As for these projects that were already clear but required a lot of time for experimentation, it was hard to say when they would be completed if Su Hao did it alone.</p><p></p><p>But if he had a group of research talents with certain abilities at his disposal, the result would be different.</p><p></p><p>He could subdivide various projects into hundreds or thousands of sub-projects and then assign them to different researchers to complete their respective research. After obtaining the data, he could summarize it and conduct the final combined experiments himself.</p><p></p><p>In this way, an experimental project that would require a lot of effort and time could be completed at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>And he himself could devote more energy to exploring the unknown in the universe.</p><p></p><p>At present, it was precisely because Su Hao lacked enough data talents that he could only crouch in the Ping-Pong space himself, analyzing the wave data of the Xiang Hu system alone.</p><p></p><p>The Xiang Hu system, with over a trillion stars, had an unimaginably vast amount of wave data collected.</p><p></p><p>To complete the analysis of this data, there was no shortcut, only time and waiting.</p><p></p><p>Until two hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>After classifying all the data, Su Hao re-drew an enormously large pattern in the form of another three-dimensional data diagram.</p><p></p><p>When the pattern was displayed in front of Su Hao, he took a long breath and murmured, "Finally found the pattern of the waves, it really wasn't easy. The principle is simpler than I imagined, but the analysis is more difficult than I thought."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment and gave this newly discovered wave pattern a new name: "Let's call it the 'Multi-Focus Disc Ellipsoid Linkage Feedback System,' abbreviated as the 'Multi-Focus System'!"</p><p></p><p>The principle that Su Hao initially obtained was: under the gravitational constraint of the massive black hole, the entire galaxy formed a special dynamic balance. The various massive celestial bodies interacted with each other, naturally forming a multi-focus compound curve closed-loop system encircling the entire galaxy, with the massive celestial bodies such as stars serving as focal points.</p><p></p><p>This was a massive 'special compound multi-focus ellipsoid' composed of at least one trillion focal points plus the black hole.</p><p></p><p>In this balanced system, any change in a variable would cause a corresponding change in the pattern, equivalent to the previous dynamic balance being broken, causing a change in the multi-focus compound curve.</p><p></p><p>However, the closed-loop system's curve had inertia, and most of the changes caused by the change would rebound, unless the change could instantly alter the entire galaxy's dynamic balance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the expression was very complicated. To put it simply, the entire Xiang Hu system was like an ellipse with countless focal points, forming a balance. This balance was a concept but could be materialized as a closed-loop thread encircling the galaxy, like a tangled ball of yarn permeating the entire galaxy, undulating in a fixed trend.</p><p></p><p>This undulating line was the embodiment of balance, called the 'wave line.' Once an external force broke this balance, the inertia of the wave line's undulation would cause a rebound until a new balance was reached.</p><p></p><p>This rebounding change could be good or bad, exhibiting periodic changes.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the change, the wave line closest to the 'source of change' would be affected first. As time passed, it would spread outward, with the result that the interval for the energy feedback to return would become longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>And the 'waves' that Su Hao saw with his Spiritual Eye of Seeking Zero were the undulations of the 'wave line' trying to incorporate the 'source of change' into the balanced system, like how a wolf pack would involuntarily focus its gaze on a Shiba Inu that had joined them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in reality, the operation was much more complicated than this.</p><p></p><p>The key was actually on the dynamic balance of the 'wave line.'</p><p></p><p>"In other words, if I go to a galaxy that hasn't reached dynamic balance, waves actually don't exist, like those newborn irregular galaxies or the double black hole galaxies formed by the collision of two galaxies. These types of galaxies are in a violent stage of change. According to my calculations, wave lines cannot exist...</p><p></p><p>And the reason why I'm always reborn into worlds with wave lines is that galaxies that have reached dynamic balance are more stable and more likely to give birth to life-bearing planets.</p><p></p><p>Those galaxies without wave lines are constantly undergoing violent changes. Only after an extremely long time can they possibly reach a balance and produce wave lines..."</p><p></p><p>As he thought about it, Su Hao also considered another possibility: "No, there's also a possibility that even if I go to a galaxy without 'wave lines,' waves would still exist because it's very likely that the entire galaxy is just one focal point, and outside the galaxy, there is an even larger dynamic balance and an even more massive 'wave line'."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, an experiment would reveal the truth."</p><p></p><p>After archiving his conjectures and conclusions during this period, Su Hao immediately exited the Ping-Pong space.</p><p></p><p>Then he sent a message to Yashan and Fengcheng: "Yashan, Fengcheng, send me the galaxy data you've found during this period, especially those irregular galaxies, like triangular galaxies, conical galaxies, etc."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng immediately replied, "Received!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yashan seemed very excited, saying, "Great Master Wei, you've been in seclusion for two hundred years. Did you make a major breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, "Of course, if the research goes well, perhaps in a few hundred years, we'll be completely free."</p><p></p><p>However, Yashan and Fengcheng did not understand the meaning of the 'complete freedom' that Su Hao mentioned, but this did not affect their happiness at their great master's achievement.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Congratulations to Great Master Wei on your breakthrough. I'll organize the data right away. Please wait, Great Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Yashan and Fengcheng sent a large amount of galaxy data to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>In the universe that Su Hao now saw, the vast majority were galaxies that had reached dynamic balance and had wave lines. The number of galaxies in a chaotic state was not large.</p><p></p><p>However, after so many years of exploration, they had accumulated a lot of data.</p><p></p><p>After looking through it, Su Hao directly selected ten irregular galaxies and ten regular galaxies, then asked, "Do these twenty galaxies have positioning stones left behind?"</p><p></p><p>The two of them immediately inquired with their disciples and then replied, "The galaxies we've explored all have corresponding positioning stones left behind. Not only that, but we've also established many teleportation arrays, so travel back and forth is no problem."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Good, now each of you dispatch ten disciples, take my positioning stones, and go to these galaxies. Let me know when you arrive.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, urgently produce twenty Shattered Star Cubes for me. I have a use for them."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Shattered Star Cubes?</p><p></p><p>The sudden need to destroy planets caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't ask too many questions. They just followed Great Master Wei's instructions.</p><p></p><p>So Yashan and Fengcheng each found their ten most trusted and capable disciples, gave them Su Hao's positioning stones, assigned them their tasks, and then returned to their own laboratories to begin producing the Shattered Star Cubes.</p><p></p><p>After giving out the instructions, Su Hao returned to the Ping-Pong space and began writing out the detailed plan for this experiment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he pondered a question: "If it's true as I think, and these galaxies have the dynamic balance 'wave lines,' how should I avoid this wave line's feedback on me?"</p>

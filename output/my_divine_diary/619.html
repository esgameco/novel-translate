        <h1>Chapter 619</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the two major organizations in this world, the Monk Association and the Zhi Peng, wanted to communicate with Su Hao to resolve their internal conflicts, but were stopped by Ya Shan.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan could clearly distinguish when the Great Master Su could be approached and when he could not be approached.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, both the Monk Association and Zhi Peng chose the wrong time to look for Su Hao, so naturally they could not see Su Hao himself.</p><p></p><p>After understanding their intentions, Ya Shan took the time to convey the messages to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao himself did not think too much about it. The Monk Association wanted suggestions, right? Su Hao could give them very good suggestions and resolve their concerns, but whether those were what they wanted, he did not know.</p><p></p><p>It was the same old saying - this world ultimately belonged to the Monk Association and others, to the people of this world. What kind of world they wanted was for them to decide. After completing his core objectives, Su Hao would only provide corresponding suggestions, but would not force them to do anything.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The Great Master Su had given his precious advice, yet they dared not follow it? What were they thinking!</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Monk Association and others were happy about it, Ya Shan did not want to think too much.</p><p></p><p>"This is an extremely huge project. It's a bit difficult for me to do it alone. I should communicate with Feng Cheng first, determine the general direction, and then assign him specific tasks!</p><p></p><p>Yeah, I'll be specifically responsible for designing 'magic' - first-level magic, second-level magic...hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>In this transformation process, the biggest difficulty was changing the overall pattern of the world, making the 'focus system' shift its focus target from individual objects to the ubiquitous 'air'.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the mobility of air would cause the 'source' to spread rapidly, unable to reach a certain concentration or coalesce into source pearls.</p><p></p><p>Only when mages absorbed the 'source' in the air into their bodies through 'cultivation' and 'meditation', and gathered it in one place, could it become usable 'source pearls'!</p><p></p><p>It really seemed feasible.</p><p></p><p>As for how to shift the 'focus system' target to the air, Ya Shan admitted he could not do it. But it did not matter if he could not! Since the Great Master Su had proposed this idea, he must have a solution in mind. Ya Shan just needed to consult the Great Master Su for the specific design.</p><p></p><p>Steady!</p><p></p><p>"Should I communicate with that old Monk Association leader?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan thought about it and felt it was necessary to let the other party know, but he needed to package his words a bit...</p><p></p><p>He had learned some consultation rhetoric.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan teleported to 'Monk Fortress' and quickly met with the Monk Association leader.</p><p></p><p>With a smile, he said, "Venerable Monk Association Leader, regarding the issue you raised before, we now have a preliminary solution. Once successfully implemented, it will certainly resolve the current predicament of the Mage Association."</p><p></p><p>The Monk Association leader showed some anticipation, "Oh? What is the solution?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "I call this the 'Three-Two-One' solution. Three gains, two costs, one unity."</p><p></p><p>It sounded quite impressive. The Monk Association leader could not help raising his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan continued, "There are three gains. First, the Mage Association can maintain unity without splitting;</p><p></p><p>Second, the Mage Association's control over mages at all levels under its jurisdiction will at least double from now;</p><p></p><p>The Monk Association leader nodded in satisfaction. If these three points could truly be achieved, it would far exceed his expectations. At the same time, he praised in his heart, "As expected of the super genius capable of single-handedly changing the world's pattern."</p><p></p><p>The Monk Association leader casually asked, "What are the two costs?"</p><p></p><p>To gain something, one must pay a cost. This was normal.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled, "First, the Mage Association needs to change its core positioning, from a simple task-issuing agency before to a high-end knowledge guardian;</p><p></p><p>The Monk Association leader fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan added, "Of course, the Mage Association can establish its own mage academy, or set up a 'mage' major in the academies founded by the Glory Society!"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Monk Association leader nodded slightly, "It seems... feasible!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was unaware of Ya Shan's plan and focused on his research on transforming the source into specific materials.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, Ya Shan suddenly found him and said, "Great Master, with my persuasion, the Monk Association and Zhi Peng have reluctantly agreed to our 'world transformation plan'. Of course, I used some rhetoric in the persuasion process, so they may not yet know that the difficulty of obtaining source pearls in the future will increase manifold.</p><p></p><p>But I think, as long as we solve their core problem, these things are not important..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was slightly surprised, "They all agreed? Ya Shan, your rhetoric has greatly improved!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed, "I just thought, if the Mage Association eventually splits apart, they might blame us. Why bother? Let's just be a good person to the end and help them out!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's always good to think positively. This transformation may not necessarily be a bad thing for the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>We will eliminate natural and demonic disasters, but leave the evolutionary path for source beasts. They can still obtain source pearls by hunting source beasts! The impact is not that great.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we have gained a relatively deep understanding of source artifacts. It shouldn't be long before we can produce various source artifacts to aid spell casting and enhance combat abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes lit up, "Isn't that what staves are for?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Since we're going to transform it, let's do a thorough transformation and design a reasonable and feasible plan! The process of transforming this world is also an application of the knowledge we've learned, so we're bound to gain something during the transformation process."</p><p></p><p>This is called learning by doing.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Got it, Great Master. I'll make sure the matter is handled beautifully!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "This is indeed a huge project. No need to rush, take it slow! Regarding this, I already have a plan. At most two years, and I can come up with a specific solution."</p><p></p><p>With Su Hao's words, Ya Shan was full of motivation, "Yeah! Ten years to create a new world for them!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>In a mountain range north of the Dragon Heart Region neighboring the Horizontal Region, A Xing and A Wang, relying on their advantages as 'all-system mages' and 'massive skills', successfully resolved an advanced demonic disaster.</p><p></p><p>Originally, disasters in the Dragon Heart Region should have been handled by the region's mages. It was not supposed to involve the two of them. However, this demonic disaster fully embodied the word 'demonic' - other mages were completely clueless, and many had even fallen victim to it, unable to resolve it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Dragon Heart Region's main association invited the Lucky Star Squad from the neighboring Horizontal Region, known as the 'demonic disaster experts', to help resolve this demonic disaster.</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang did not disappoint, successfully resolving the demonic disaster within two days.</p><p></p><p>But a problem arose.</p><p></p><p>Many mages from the Dragon Heart Region expressed great dissatisfaction. A disaster occurring in their own region was resolved by mages from the Horizontal Region?</p><p></p><p>Unacceptable, this was an insult to the Dragon Heart Region's mages!</p><p></p><p>So, on A Xing and A Wang's way back, they were intercepted by four source squads from the Dragon Heart Region.</p><p></p><p>A total of seventeen people, all looking quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, if you know what's good for you, leave behind the spoils you got from the Dragon Heart Region's disaster, kneel down and apologize, and vow to never set foot in the Dragon Heart Region again in this lifetime. Then I'll let you two go," said a bald, big-knife-wielding man standing before A Xing and A Wang, his eyes glaring menacingly. "Otherwise, you two 'demonic disaster experts' will be buried here!"</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang looked around at the source mages surrounding them, all emanating killing intent as if wanting to devour them alive. This left the two very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>A Xing said, "Is this really about a mere hundred source pearls?"</p><p></p><p>Another man in a red and white robe laughed loudly, "Are you kidding? Is this just about a hundred source pearls? The problem is, you mages from the Horizontal Region should not have come to our Dragon Heart Region to snatch our glory."</p><p></p><p>Someone else said, "Are you two feeling very proud of yourselves? Running to our Dragon Heart Region to resolve a demonic disaster that left us helpless, then going back to brag about it for the rest of your lives, huh? Must feel great using us as a stepping stone, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>From some unknown point, powerful disasters had become a scarce resource coveted by all, the only means for source squads to gain fame.</p><p></p><p>Thus, such scarce resources began to be divided by territory.</p><p></p><p>Disasters occurring in a certain region belonged to that region...</p><p></p><p>If the region's own mages resolved it, no one would say anything. But if mages from other regions snatched away this glory, it was a humiliation, intolerable.</p><p></p><p>And today, these enraged Dragon Heart Region mages decided to find a deserted place to take back what belonged to their Dragon Heart Region.</p><p></p><p>A Wang leaned closer to A Xing and whispered, "A Xing, it looks like there's no resolving this peacefully. But just the two of us may not be their match... What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing took out a positioning stone, "We can only ask A Yang for help!"</p>

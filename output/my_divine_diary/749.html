        <h1>Chapter 749</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>An indescribable sense of joy surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since Su Hao felt such an intense pleasure!</p><p></p><p>After the wonderful experience, it further solidified Su Hao's determination to continuously explore the unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was that same saying: as long as the universe has no end, then Su Hao's exploration will also have no end.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao left the Star Gazing World and entered the Pinball Space. </p><p></p><p>He organized and recorded his speculations and test results from the Star Gazing World one by one.</p><p></p><p>The preliminary conclusion Su Hao reached was quite simple: the Star Gazing World is an "Internet of Things" composed of the "information" of massive matter.</p><p></p><p>It sounds very convoluted...</p><p></p><p>But this is essentially what Su Hao speculated.</p><p></p><p>Many people know this basic principle: the gravitational waves of matter in space will distort spacetime to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Take the Nebula System as an example.</p><p></p><p>The supermassive black hole at the center of the Nebula System has tremendously powerful gravity that distorts spacetime covering the entire nebula galaxy. All the planets in the Nebula System are within the gravitational range of the Nebula System's black hole.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the powerful gravity of the Blue Giant Star distorts the spacetime of the entire Blue Giant Star System; the Blue Giant distorts the spacetime around its planets; its two moons...</p><p></p><p>Layer by layer, they are mutually contained, forming a huge and complex Nebula spacetime system.</p><p></p><p>But then the question arises, after matter distorts spacetime, then what? Is that the end of it?</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Hao also thought that was the end, once it's distorted, what more could happen?</p><p></p><p>However, after entering the Star Gazing World, he made a new discovery.</p><p></p><p>That is: the distorted spacetime forms a massive "material information network", and is connected together under the influence of the Nebula System's black hole.</p><p></p><p>So, let's first understand what a "material information network" is.</p><p></p><p>The definition given by Su Hao is: in space, every particle of matter participates in distorting spacetime, and the trace of the particle's distortion of spacetime is synchronized to the "spacetime network", connected together to form a massive "material information network".</p><p></p><p>This network is mapped into the brain consciousness in a special form, forming the "Star Gazing World" that Su Hao sees.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Su Hao can observe the information of matter distorting spacetime in the Nebula System through the "Dream Stone"!</p><p></p><p>Then is it possible that different massive star systems also form a huge material information network? If he could find the network cable, even while staying in the Nebula System, he could travel through consciousness to other star systems and know what is happening in those other star systems...</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao has tried but failed to break through the boundary of the Star Gazing World to explore the vast emptiness.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the Nebula System's Star Gazing World is a "local area network" centered around the Nebula System's black hole.</p><p></p><p>It can connect internally, but cannot enter the larger "internet".</p><p></p><p>Unless...he connects a network cable!</p><p></p><p>After recording all the information and reasoning through it again, Su Hao showed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>"Previously I felt my perspective was not broad enough, so I wanted to work hard to improve my spiritual power in order to expand my perceptual range. Now it seems the initial direction of my efforts was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Human spiritual power alone has limits, and it's not the case that it can keep growing endlessly through cultivation.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful, could it directly observe the entire universe?</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it, that seems impossible."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wanted to make his spiritual power become more powerful, but he himself couldn't clearly say how powerful was appropriate.</p><p></p><p>A planet? A star system? Or a nebula system...</p><p></p><p>Following that logic, as long as his spiritual sense didn't expand to cover the entire universe, it still wouldn't be enough...</p><p></p><p>Regarding this issue, it's not that Su Hao lacked confidence, but some things cannot be achieved through confidence alone.</p><p></p><p>But if viewed from another angle, then it becomes feasible.</p><p></p><p>In this universe, planets are separated from each other by vast distances, yet on another level they are interconnected, forming a massive network in a place unknown to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao doesn't need to expand his spiritual power to cover the entire universe, but only needs to connect himself as a terminal to this massive universal network.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power" is not as mystical and lofty as imagined - its essence is simply to serve the consciousness and thoughts in the brain, right?</p><p></p><p>As long as something serves consciousness, it can be called "spiritual power", such as the "eyes", "nervous system", "spiritual tentacles", "limbs", etc., which all serve consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if Su Hao connects himself to the "material information network", and this network can serve Su Hao's consciousness, then why can't it be called his "spiritual power"?</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as he can use the "material information network" anytime, anywhere to probe various planets and obtain information, he can completely say: my spiritual power covers the entire Nebula System.</p><p></p><p>No problem!</p><p></p><p>Is there a problem?</p><p></p><p>No problem at all!</p><p></p><p>"As long as I understand the mechanism, I may even be able to use the 'material information network' for 'flashing'!</p><p></p><p>And to reach the vast space, I still have 'Starbeam Travel' for faster-than-light travel."</p><p></p><p>If he could truly reach this level, the originally distant vast universe would suddenly become accessible.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao became so excited that his whole body felt feverish.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more restless he became.</p><p></p><p>In this state, he couldn't calm down to do any research.</p><p></p><p>So he directly threw his Eight-Armed Avatar aside, and his main body in the second-level world woke up from the life support pod.</p><p></p><p>Then he just strolled around in the second-level world with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng noticed Su Hao's movements, and didn't bother with the tasks at hand, crawling out of the life support pods, tidying up, and coming to Su Hao's side.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's excited expression, they found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Following the Venerable One for so many years, when had they ever seen the Venerable One in such a state?</p><p></p><p>Was this... a major research breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>The two glanced at each other, thinking to themselves: "It must be a breakthrough, otherwise nothing else could make the Venerable One so excited."</p><p></p><p>Then the two joyfully and perfectly in sync exclaimed: "Congratulations to the Venerable One on your achievement!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily and patted their shoulders, saying: "You two did well too, you deserve some credit for this achievement. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan curiously asked: "Venerable One, did you have a breakthrough in researching the Compound Eye Race's observational abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "It's still early for a breakthrough, fully mastering this observational ability is not simple. However, I made a major discovery from the Compound Eye Race and the Planetary God Star.</p><p></p><p>If I can successfully unravel its secrets and integrate it into our abilities, then the vast universe will be within reach.</p><p></p><p>Although the universe is vast, everywhere can be reached. You can imagine that after I unravel these secrets, the mysterious face of the universe will be revealed before me."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Hao explained it very clearly, they still found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Because no matter how they imagined it, they couldn't conceive of any method that could make the universe "within reach", where one could freely travel, not even "light" dares to say it's "within reach".</p><p></p><p>Each step forward the Venerable One took was too huge, to the point that Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's imagination couldn't quite keep up...</p><p></p><p>But whether they understood or not didn't matter, as long as the Venerable One made an achievement, that was the greatest joy.</p><p></p><p>At such a happy moment, there should be some activity, so Feng Cheng suggested: "Venerable One, why don't we play some Chinese poker?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 803</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Just before falling asleep, everything was fine. But when he woke up, he found that there was now a group of fully armed humans in the hatching room. Even the usually calm Suhao couldn't help his heart skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, once exposed to the cosmic waves, all sorts of inexplicable dangers would befall him in various ways...</p><p></p><p>Even if one day a torrential rain or earthquake caused the dragon's nest to collapse, burying him inside, Suhao would consider it a normal occurrence.</p><p></p><p>"There is no particularly safe place, even the dragon's nest cared for by the mother dragon is the same. The only way to ensure relative safety is to quickly develop the second world and hide one's true form within it."</p><p></p><p>He slowly rose, feeling the familiar yet different body, slowly curling his mouth into a hideous smile: "However, having successfully evolved into a [Minion], there are many things I can do now."</p><p></p><p>He turned his head towards the bearded Westborough and others, murmuring softly: "Now, let's deal with these humans first."</p><p></p><p>The bearded Westborough felt a chill run down his spine as Suhao's cold vertical pupils stared at him.</p><p></p><p>He felt that this red-golden hatchling that emerged from the crystal was not quite right, but he couldn't pinpoint what was off. Carefully looking, it didn't seem different from the two small hatchlings they had tied up, in fact, it looked even weaker.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this hatchling had been hiding in the crystal earlier?</p><p></p><p>But what about the crystal? Why had the crystal that was right before his eyes disappeared?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that what I saw was an illusion? It's very possible that this special red-golden hatchling awakened its soul power prematurely, able to create illusions to conceal itself... Hmm, in that case, this red-golden hatchling is even more valuable. And could there be other hatchlings hiding as well?"</p><p></p><p>Westborough's thoughts raced, but no matter how he thought about it, his body honestly took action.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward with the hooked chain weapon, growling: "Viya, cast another Sleep Spell."</p><p></p><p>Facing Suhao, he didn't seem too tense. After all, no matter how powerful this hatchling was, he didn't take it seriously. It would be different if the adult mother dragon returned.</p><p></p><p>Viya had already prepared her soul power spell and casually released it. A yellow mist shaped like a dragon or flood dragon burst forth from her hand, enveloping Suhao.</p><p></p><p>She was confident that one Sleep Spell could subdue this seemingly smaller red-golden hatchling.</p><p></p><p>The others were also ready. Once the hatchling was subdued, they would immediately move in and bind it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the yellow mist attack coming, Suhao remained calm. With a light step of his hind legs, he dodged the yellow mist attack from the side.</p><p></p><p>Facing this unfamiliar attack method he had never seen before, he maintained extreme vigilance. If he could dodge it, he would absolutely not recklessly take it head-on. The last thing he wanted was for things to go awry.</p><p></p><p>Viya was slightly stunned: "It dodged?"</p><p></p><p>She then continuously released two more Sleep Spell flood dragons to surround and pursue Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Westborough and the others were also slightly surprised, inwardly marveling: "This hatchling's movement speed is so fast?"</p><p></p><p>"Kaka ka~"</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly transformed into [Minion] form. A set of imposing and powerful crystal dragon armor formed, engraved with numerous rune arrays.</p><p></p><p>As his blood energy surged, the rune arrays faintly lit up, imbuing the armor with various protective effects.</p><p></p><p>Before attacking the enemy, he needed to protect himself first.</p><p></p><p>This series of changes stunned Westborough, Viya and the others. What was this hatchling doing? When have red-golden dragons been able to transform into crystal dragons? Could it be that they were affected by some soul power spell, causing them to see an illusion instead of the real scene?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Viya's Sleep Spells couldn't keep up with the erratically moving hatchling, Westborough shouted: "Surround it and block its path!"</p><p></p><p>He then drew his greatsword, switching from chopping to horizontal strikes. With a stomp of his foot, he charged towards Suhao first.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, locking onto Suhao's evasion path. Taking up a stance, the veins on his arm bulged as he roared and swung his sword in a powerful horizontal strike.</p><p></p><p>'Fierce Strike Flash'!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an inexplicable pressure descended upon everyone, as if the surrounding air was gradually turning into solidifying amber, about to freeze, greatly restricting everyone's movements.</p><p></p><p>Then a bluish-purple flash of light flickered in the spacious hatching room.</p><p></p><p>"Kachak~"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of thunder, large bluish-purple bolts of lightning suddenly erupted like a tidal wave from Suhao's body, enveloping all the humans.</p><p></p><p>Everyone shuddered, instantly freezing mid-air in various poses, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>All that could be seen were their trembling bodies, rolled back eyes, and hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>The fiery woman Viya was also struck by the lightning, her body convulsing as the Sleep Spell she had released dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's use of the divine power spell 'Mind's Desire' had restricted their movements to some degree, coupled with the 'Level 2 - Lightning' rune, instantly subduing everyone.</p><p></p><p>Suhao grinned: "Heh heh, runes are really useful, especially when I have enough blood energy. One lightning blast solved the problem. But it's still not secure enough."</p><p></p><p>He followed up with a 'Flooding' type lightning blast, zapping everyone again until they lost control of their bodies. Then golden scales spread from his feet, extending outwards and climbing up everyone's legs, tightly encasing them all, truly immobilizing them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao thoughtfully left a small air hole for breathing...</p><p></p><p>He hadn't used these outdated subjugation methods for who knows how many years, but their effectiveness couldn't be denied.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Chained Lightning was once his signature move that allowed him to reign supreme in the world. Using it now, he felt no rustiness at all.</p><p></p><p>Although Westborough and the others were numb from the lightning strikes and couldn't control their bodies, their consciousness remained relatively clear.</p><p></p><p>They realized that ever since this strange red-golden hatchling awoke, events had spiraled out of control.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a crystal dragon - what was that? And what were those faint circular patterns inside the crystal?</p><p></p><p>Even if it was an adult dragon using this soul power technique, it would be understandable. But for a hatchling that seemed to have just been born to use it, wasn't that a bit reckless...?</p><p></p><p>And the lightning...</p><p></p><p>Was this lightning ability something red-golden dragons were capable of? If they remembered correctly, the innate ability of red-golden dragons was fire. It was the black lightning dragons that controlled lightning, right?</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, dragons generally could only use their innate abilities after reaching young adulthood.</p><p></p><p>So the question was, what was the deal with this seemingly small and bizarre red-golden hatchling?</p><p></p><p>Okay, let's set those aside for now, they had seen such abilities before, it was normal.</p><p></p><p>But could someone tell them what these crystals creeping up their legs and tightly binding them were...?</p><p></p><p>They had roamed the world for many years, daring to poach even the mightiest of dragons. What hadn't they encountered?</p><p></p><p>Funnily enough, they had never encountered this situation before.</p><p></p><p>Westborough and Viya were extremely flustered, but completely unable to make any effective resistance with their bodies. They could only watch helplessly as the crystals fully engulfed them, gradually sealing their fates.</p><p></p><p>Dread filled Westborough's heart. After regaining some control from the numbing electricity, he tried unleashing all his explosive soul techniques but couldn't break through the thick outer crystal layer.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help glancing towards the sorcerer Viya behind him, clinging to a last shred of hope: "Stay calm, Viya has a way to dispel this binding technique, we just need to wait a bit..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Viya regained some sensation, she indeed used a soul technique.</p><p></p><p>'Shatter Soul'!</p><p></p><p>But to Suhao's surprise, the adamantine scales he controlled that bound Viya suddenly slipped from his grasp, gradually degrading into stone and soil. With a forceful struggle, Viya broke free.</p><p></p><p>Westborough had clearly seen the purple light and his heart leapt with joy: "She broke the binding! Next, free me from this and I can instantly cut down this bizarre hatchling with my sword."</p><p></p><p>He had already given up hope of capturing this hatchling alive, facing such an uncontrollable factor. The best solution was to kill it. Besides, there were still two normal hatchlings, right? Two would still fetch a huge sum.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was pondering his next move, a familiar bluish-purple flash appeared in the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Kachak~"</p><p></p><p>A long bluish-purple lightning bolt shot out from the hatchling's claw, striking Viya. Her body convulsed again as she fell back into paralysis, eyes rolling back.</p><p></p><p>The 'Shatter Soul' technique she had used also dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Suhao withdrew his claw, his gaze inevitably falling on the woman not far away, his heart filled with surprise: "How did she do that, actually able to degrade my adamantine scales directly into stone? The soul power and soul technique effects that Mother Shaduo spoke of? Truly wondrous."</p><p></p><p>He didn't find it strange that his crystal armor was forcibly destroyed, but having its control wrested away and degraded into stone was no ordinary feat.</p>

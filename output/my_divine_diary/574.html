        <h1>Chapter 574</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The three of them passed through a layer of spatial barrier, but did not feel themselves becoming smaller. It was like passing through a bubble of water - the inside and outside seemed no different.</p><p></p><p>Yashan exclaimed in amazement, "My divine sense perceived it as merely a small ball, but after entering, it suddenly changed. I almost thought what I sensed earlier was an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"The application of small worlds has not been fully developed yet. There will be more surprises in the future!"</p><p></p><p>After inspection, they found no major changes to the entire island. From this day on, their base would be hidden as if it never existed - no one could find it again.</p><p></p><p>Unless some inexplicable strange disaster occurred within the base again, they theoretically would not need to change bases anymore!</p><p></p><p>Suhao found a new island and casually placed the small world there, essentially hiding the base!</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly. Then one day, a five-person source team hid in mid-air, secretly flying over the former Hulu Island airspace, before flying back again not long after.</p><p></p><p>A blue-robed woman held a map, repeatedly comparing it, extremely puzzled, "Eh? The map shows there used to be a small island here, right? How did it disappear now?"</p><p></p><p>A younger curly-haired man squinted his eyes, gazing down at the sea surface below. He then took the map from the woman's hand, carefully comparing it, his brows gradually furrowing, "The map is not wrong, and our location is not wrong either. Did the sea level rise? No, it's low tide now, the sea level should be lower compared to the evening."</p><p></p><p>"Let's dive into the sea and take a look."</p><p></p><p>This curly-haired man was the youngest, but the team was willing to listen to him. With a wave of his hand, the air mage controlled the air bubble carrying them all, descending to the sea surface, then parting the seawater to dive in.</p><p></p><p>They circled around in the sea but did not find any trace of the island. Instead, they discovered a large pit.</p><p></p><p>However, the large pit had long been filled with all kinds of dust and dirt, no different from the rest of the seabed, not very noticeable. And in the complex terrain of the ocean, such large pits could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>After surfacing, the curly-haired man pondered for a moment, then asked solemnly, "Shangli, when was this map in your hand drawn? Is it the version verified by the Association?"</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman called Shangli immediately replied, "This map was published three years ago and is the latest version verified by the Association on the market. It should not be wrong!"</p><p></p><p>The curly-haired man thought for a moment and said, "You all wait here for me for a bit!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he was layered with various metals, forming a conical metal tube, then fiercely plunged into the sea.</p><p></p><p>About five minutes later, he surfaced, gasping for fresh air.</p><p></p><p>His other teammates curiously asked, "Feiyao, did you find anything?"</p><p></p><p>The curly-haired man Feiyao calmly said, "If I'm not mistaken, there used to be a huge island here that has been dug away by someone."</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman Shangli and the others seemed not to have heard clearly, "What???"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao was too lazy to explain much further. Instead, he said, "From the current situation, the screening work we did before was in the right direction. We may have already caught the target's tail - it's highly likely they were hiding on this island before.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known where the information was leaked from, so they moved ahead of time. Of course, coincidence cannot be ruled out."</p><p></p><p>Shangli exclaimed in astonishment, "Moved? Moved an entire island? Is that even possible?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao looked at the blue-robed woman like she was an idiot and said helplessly, "Sigh...How many times have I told you, why can you never learn how to think about problems properly?</p><p></p><p>It's fine to appropriately add imagination to the thought process - that's a strength. But don't use imagination as thinking itself."</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman smiled awkwardly, then asked for guidance, "Then how should I think about it?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "You need to consider this problem along two lines. One is what possibilities could exist behind the phenomenon we observed.</p><p></p><p>The second line is to comprehensively consider and rank the possibilities in order of feasibility, gradually eliminating the impossible options.</p><p></p><p>What's left is most likely the answer. It cannot guarantee being correct in all situations, but it can address eighty to ninety percent of problems.</p><p></p><p>As for the question you asked, whether it's possible to move an entire island, that's not within the scope of what we need to think about, is it?</p><p></p><p>Sigh! Why is it that no matter how many times I explain this simple principle, you all just don't understand?"</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman and others silently complained, "Yes yes, it's simple, you're the greatest!"</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman shrugged, "Then what do we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao also shrugged, "What else can we do? Go back!"</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman was surprised, "Not continue searching?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao showed a defeated expression, "So I keep saying you like adding your own imagination when thinking about problems.</p><p></p><p>Who told you we're not searching anymore just because we're going back? We're just going back to re-collect and re-organize the data, then redo the previous work."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the blue-robed woman dejectedly said, "Ah? We have to bring in those people who suddenly disappeared for questioning again? Isn't that too troublesome? You're so smart, can't you think of another way?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao didn't want to talk to her anymore and rolled his eyes at her.</p><p></p><p>The air mage made the group invisible again as they took flight. Feiyao said with a smile, "This trip wasn't a complete waste either. Since we know those who had contact with the Wulai Immortal came to this disappeared island before, it proves my guess was right. Heh heh, they can't run away."</p><p></p><p>After this source team gradually left, a short-haired young man's figure gradually appeared - it was Suhao. He muttered, "So the Mage Association has come knocking?"</p><p></p><p>He had chosen this island before because it was relatively secluded. He just didn't expect that even before he made any major moves, people had already found it.</p><p></p><p>But on second thought, he realized it was probably Zhipeng's activities that drew attention, coupled with Yashan's frantic search for Zhipeng's friends for research, so the exposure was normal.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought about it and decided to follow them to see the situation. He couldn't let others randomly raid his home.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Suhao followed this team to the main city of the Hengxuan District, Yixuan City!</p><p></p><p>Not only did he find out the corresponding information, but he also took the opportunity to pack up and take away all the various source artifacts stored in the underground warehouse of the Mage Association headquarters building in Yixuan City. A rough count showed at least two thousand pieces, which must have accumulated over many years.</p><p></p><p>With so many source artifacts, there were bound to be many with all kinds of strange abilities. To Suhao, they were too dangerous. If one day someone used these source artifacts to deal with him and he capsized, he would have no one to complain to.</p><p></p><p>Before encountering the 'One Step, One World' ability, Suhao believed his 'Second-Dimensional Space' was very secure. But after encountering it, it gave Suhao a sense of crisis. He really didn't expect that there would be a source artifact with spatial abilities that seemed to be used more profoundly than his own.</p><p></p><p>In summary, source artifacts were too dangerous. It was better for him to keep them himself...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what use were they being kept at the headquarters of the Mage Association? It was better to give them to him - he could use them for research and realize their value. After researching them, if there were no major issues, he could return them.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting back to the small world base, Suhao built a dedicated collection room and safely stored the seized source artifacts there.</p><p></p><p>Then he sent Yashan a message: "Yashan, the Source Mage Association can lock onto our location through those test subjects who stayed on the small island before, so try not to conduct further experiments in our current small world. Change to another place!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied: "Our location has been locked onto?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "It's our previous location that was locked onto. Fortunately, we moved away in advance - our luck wasn't bad. Here's what I'll do, I'll make you a new smaller small world, and you can do experiments in that new small world. Change locations periodically."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Got it, Big Bro Wei. If that's the case, Zhipeng must have been exposed, right? Will he be okay?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "He's definitely exposed, but it's unknown if anyone guessed his ability. And don't worry, he has a lot of friends. If anything happens, his friends will be affected first."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Suhao confirmed no one was around Zhipeng, then contacted him through that little parrot: "Wulai, it's Jiawei!"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng said happily: "Mr. Jiawei! It's been a long time since I've heard from you."</p><p></p><p>Suhao directly asked: "Have your friends reached the first stage goal yet?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng knew Suhao was referring to the first stage goal of ten thousand friends. He smiled and said, "If only counting source mages, it's around four thousand. Including ordinary people with various skills, I now have more than two hundred thousand friends!"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng's tone was light and happy, appearing very pleased.</p><p></p><p>This was to be expected - who wouldn't be happy with over two hundred thousand friends? Just saying it out loud would sound impressive.</p>

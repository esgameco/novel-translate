        <h1>Chapter 675</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao became more active on the battlefield, more and more pilots witnessed Su Hao's operations that could be described as miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, the Octopus fighters were blown up one after another.</p><p></p><p>One had to ask, who could achieve such a feat?</p><p></p><p>"An individual can indeed change the tide of battle, as long as they are powerful enough."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao kept roaming the battlefield, and soon combat planes consciously followed behind him, forming a small flight formation, like confused lambs instinctively following the lead sheep.</p><p></p><p>They discovered Su Hao's identity through the markings on his fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>"That's a fighter from Squad 405!"</p><p></p><p>"Squad 405, who is the pilot? Could it be the 'Explosive-Eyed Marksman'?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be him, the Explosive-Eyed Marksman Xu Shiqiang. He's amazing, he's my idol!"</p><p></p><p>"Wowâ€”in just ten minutes, he blew up ten Octopus fighters. How did he do that?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable! His precise shooting with the rail gun is one thing, but his fighter's machine guns were also that accurate!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The local area network communication devices were opened, constantly broadcasting the pilots' exclamations of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the disadvantageous situation on the battlefield had left the pilots feeling utterly hopeless and dejected. But after Su Hao joined the fight, they inexplicably regained their confidence.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Explosive-Eyed Marksman Xu Shiqiang is here, humanity will prevail!"</p><p></p><p>This was the power a hero brought them.</p><p></p><p>The fighter squadron followed behind Su Hao, and after regrouping, they rejoined the battle to annihilate the Octopus fighters with tremendous self-assurance.</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the battle escalated further.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang also heard about Su Hao's achievements through the local area network. In disbelief, Yan said, "That guy Daqiang took down ten Octopus monsters in ten minutes? Even just the flight maneuvers would take more than ten minutes, right?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling how he had struggled with all his might but failed to take down even one, needing Xiao Chang's underhanded assistance...</p><p></p><p>This reminded him of when they raided the supply station and the Octopus monster was subdued by Su Hao's single gunshot!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang excitedly said, "Roger that, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two of them changed course and flew towards Su Hao's direction.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan immediately sent a transmission to Su Hao: "Daqiang, we're coming!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Not only did the human pilots discover Su Hao's fighter, but after losing more than thirty fighters in succession, the Octopus clan also quickly realized they had encountered a formidable opponent.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to operating fighter jets and warships, the Octopus clan never feared a challenge.</p><p></p><p>They had absolute confidence in their ability to crush the humans - this was their advantage!</p><p></p><p>As for this powerful human opponent?</p><p></p><p>It was time to showcase their skills!</p><p></p><p>For them, this was a great honor.</p><p></p><p>Thus, many Octopus fighters turned and headed towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Hao smiled: "Perfect timing, saves me from having to hunt them down one by one."</p><p></p><p>This was Su Hao's first time piloting this type of fighter, but he quickly got the hang of it. Judging by his keen perception, these Octopus fighters were merely slightly larger toys that couldn't even touch him.</p><p></p><p>However, the attack power of the fighter's onboard energy cannon did not meet Su Hao's expectations. Even when hitting the Octopus fighters, it could not immediately blow them up.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao abandon the idea of a 'fair' duel with the enemy.</p><p></p><p>"It's still more efficient to use the spatial bullet delivery method. Besides, spatial abilities are part of my skills too, so it doesn't count as cheating!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao glanced left and right, spotting more than a dozen Octopus fighters approaching from various directions while firing from a distance, as if trying to take him down quickly before someone else stole the kill.</p><p></p><p>He quickly determined his next flight path. With a tilt of the control stick, he veered right, evading the lines of fire while rapidly closing in on the rightmost Octopus fighter.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus inside that fighter excitedly waved its eight tentacles, deftly maneuvering the fighter towards Su Hao. "Hahaha! It's flying right at me. The glory of the strongest pilot will be mine!"</p><p></p><p>It fixed its gaze on the ordinary human fighter ahead, its nine brains fully concentrated and operating at high speed.</p><p></p><p>It was confident it could evade any incoming projectiles!</p><p></p><p>Closer! Closer!</p><p></p><p>This lucky Octopus became excited, but before it could open fire, its Octopus fighter suddenly violently shook, immediately followed by a massive internal explosion. The raging energy ravaged the interior, and in the next moment, it tore the fighter apart, blowing it up in space.</p><p></p><p>Its armor protected it from the powerful blast, allowing it to narrowly survive. However, all eight of its tentacles were severed, leaving only its massive head flying along with the debris.</p><p></p><p>Even at this point, the bald Octopus still didn't understand what had happened, slowly forming a question mark: ??</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After blowing up the rightmost Octopus fighter with a few cannon shots, Su Hao pulled back on the control stick, turning the fighter left. The onboard cannon swiveled its barrel, taking aim at the second Octopus fighter.</p><p></p><p>Spatial delivery!</p><p></p><p>The second Octopus fighter turned into a small firework in space a second later.</p><p></p><p>Then the third, the fourth...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao piloted his fighter in a large circle, the more than a dozen Octopus fighters that had surrounded him were blown up one by one, reduced to piles of debris.</p><p></p><p>This scene left all the observing pilots gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell just happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I dreaming?"</p><p></p><p>"Even movies wouldn't dare film something like that!"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like the 'Explosive-Eyed Marksman' title doesn't do Xu Shiqiang justice anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"What should we call him then, the 'Explosive Fighter Marksman'?"</p><p></p><p>"That's... too powerful! Did humans research a fifth-type enhancer or something?"</p><p></p><p>"At least an eighth-type!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this even science anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Among them, Captain Yan and Xiao Chang cheered the loudest: "Damn, Uncle! Daqiang did an awesome job!"</p><p></p><p>The shy Xiao Chang even learned some mild profanity from Captain Yan: "Damn! So satisfying! So satisfying!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the morale of the human fighter squadron soared. Even the pilots whose fighters had been blown up but narrowly survived regained hope.</p><p></p><p>"Humanity will prevail!"</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Octopus fighter squadron suffered an equal blow.</p><p></p><p>This was almost an insult to them. When had the Octopus clan's mechanical operation skills, their specialty, ever been trampled by humans?</p><p></p><p>So more and more Octopus fighters headed towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they all exploded into fireworks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the human pilots were like they had been injected with adrenaline, launching a counterattack against the Octopus fighters and reversing the tide!</p><p></p><p>The Octopus fighters finally became afraid, scattering in all directions as Su Hao's fighter chased them down.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao soon stopped pursuing them, shifting his gaze to the distant Raider-class Battleship II.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the command bridge of the Yaoxing Carrier:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the fighter squadron has reversed the situation, blowing up more than thirty Octopus fighters in succession."</p><p></p><p>"Reporting, the fighter squadron has launched a counterattack."</p><p></p><p>As the reports came in, a large screen was broadcasting the footage of Su Hao's rampage, the camera locked onto his ordinary fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Upon hearing the report, the captain instinctively looked up at the screen, just in time to see Su Hao pilot his fighter in a large loop, blowing up more than a dozen enemy fighters one after another. He couldn't help but stare dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, but all the department heads and observers in the command center also stared dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Whose soldier was this, displaying such ferocity?</p><p></p><p>Director Jiang immediately jumped up and shouted loudly, "Damn! That's my soldier! The Explosive-Eyed Marksman Xu Shiqiang from Squad 405!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone turned to look at him involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Director Jiang said proudly, "It was my order that sent the kid charging in to kick some ass!"</p><p></p><p>The others inwardly sighed and turned their heads back, staring at the fighter jet on the display screen.</p><p></p><p>"Damn! So badass! One fighter chasing after a group of Octopus fighters!"</p><p></p><p>"When did our fighters become so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not really about the fighter, right? That kid must be something else, what enhancers is he on?"</p><p></p><p>Then suddenly someone pointed at the screen and said, "Hey? What is Xu Shiqiang trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked and saw that Su Hao's fighter had changed course, flying straight towards the enemy's Raider-class Battleship.</p><p></p><p>"Has he lost his mind?"</p>

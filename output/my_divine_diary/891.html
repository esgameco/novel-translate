        <h1>Chapter 891</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Cong Shuling and her brother Cong Renfe left the warehouse, Su Hao flashed to this location. His divine consciousness spread out, quietly sensing the energy fluctuations in this area.</p><p></p><p>Never before had he perceived the energy fluctuations before and after a catastrophe erupted so clearly as this time.</p><p></p><p>This kind of fluctuation felt extremely peculiar, yet incomparably secretive and fleeting. It was so secretive that if Su Hao had not been closely watching the siblings and investigating their surroundings, he might not have detected the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps using the word "secretive" was not accurate. The fluctuation of this energy did not seem to intend to hide from Su Hao, but rather carried out its own business openly. It's just that no one could see it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Su Hao could not see it either. He could only sense its existence through the changes in various microscopic substances in the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>It was like air to a normal person. No matter how wide one opens their eyes, they cannot possibly see "air". Only when the wind blows through one's hair, skin, and the branches in front of them can we judge from the visible phenomena that there is "air" around us.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao called "perceiving" the energy fluctuations of catastrophe was not his divine consciousness "seeing" this kind of energy, but rather detecting it through the changes in the environment around the siblings before and after they suffered the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Hao's attention was mainly focused on observing the "fortune waves" with the Seeker of Nothingness, trying to find the complete pattern of the "fortune waves", without paying too much attention to the manifestation of catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>He did not consider staring intently at the traversers for months or even years. If he had time, he would prefer to think about how to map out the complete pattern of fortune waves.</p><p></p><p>Now, under the operation of the Eighteen Deities, he could pinpoint the exact timing of when catastrophe erupted, allowing him to patiently watch the entire process of the traversers going through catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed him to perceive for the first time how the catastrophe system's energy feedback came to destroy the focal point.</p><p></p><p>"It is basically as I had guessed. Indeed, the focal point caused a disturbance on the original normal trajectory, transmitting outward in a complex wave pattern. After being reflected by a certain focal point system, it concentrated and returned at a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of energy fluctuation is different from the 'energy' I usually understand. It is not something quantifiable or visualizable like high temperature, high pressure, or impact force, but merely a fluctuation at the microscopic level.</p><p></p><p>From a macroscopic perspective, the backflow of this energy fluctuation manifests as a complete 'murder mystery' event, with a beginning, development, climax, and conclusion, not instantaneous but sustained fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>From a microscopic perspective, the energy fluctuation causes disturbances and changes in fundamental particles over an extremely wide range. The end point of these disturbances and changes all point toward the traverser locked by the fortune wave. This is also a continuous process.</p><p></p><p>It's like..." Su Hao thought for a moment, using an analogy to describe it: "It's like the traverser themselves is a magnet, naturally attracting the 'catastrophe energy fluctuation' like iron filings.</p><p></p><p>This energy fluctuation itself does not harm the traverser. But after the surrounding disturbances continue for a period of time, the resulting events cause this 'magnet' traverser to accidentally break, as if attracting not soft candy, but an explosive grenade."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Hao also observed another phenomenon: the catastrophe system seemed to only operate according to certain rules, without actively targeting the traversers or intending to eliminate them. It just so happened that the rules of the universe were full of such coincidences.</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself: "Every corner of the universe is filled with coincidences."</p><p></p><p>He recorded all the phenomena he had observed and left notes for Little Light, prompting him the next time the traversers experienced catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to observe more catastrophe phenomena and collect data..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was contemplating the possibility of "group traversing"...</p><p></p><p>After the warehouse explosion, Cong Shuling and Cong Renfe immediately dragged their injured bodies away, following the unnoticed shadows toward the outskirts of the town. Soon, they blended into the night and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the townspeople who heard the commotion came out of their homes. Seeing the shattered warehouse, they were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Was this the work of a powerful hero from the Heroic World who came back and punched it?</p><p></p><p>"Right, right, hurry and call someone to put out the fire."</p><p></p><p>"Get water, wet the surroundings first, don't let the fire spread outward."</p><p></p><p>"Right, right, wet it down!"</p><p></p><p>"Pour water on the nearby houses, move away anything that can burn around the warehouse!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, right..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfe arrived at a small pavilion outside of town, each leaning against a pillar to check their wounds.</p><p></p><p>In the mall, there was an inexpensive healing medicine, 10 points per pill. Cong Renfe redeemed two pills at once, swallowed one himself, and handed the other to Cong Shuling, saying: "Tali, this is a healing pill. After taking it, your wounds will quickly stop bleeding and heal. You're badly hurt, hurry and eat it!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling stared at the healing pill in Cong Renfe's hand, hesitated for a moment, then took out a pill herself and waved it in front of him, saying: "I also have one..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfe: "......"</p><p></p><p>The siblings fell into a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>'Regarding the fact that my brother (sister) is also a hidden expert.'</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they both communicated with their systems in their hearts: "Diligent, besides me, do other people also have systems?"</p><p></p><p>They originally thought they were special, feeling a bit smug for a while, but it turned out they were just overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>Diligent answered: "Question exceeds authority, unable to answer. Please contact the system developer."</p><p></p><p>Then they asked: "How do I contact the system developer?"</p><p></p><p>Diligent answered again: "Question exceeds authority, unable to answer. Please contact the system developer."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfe were speechless once more.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them spoke again, as they didn't know where to start. They silently tended to themselves, hiding their wounds and bloodstains, then headed home together.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, they didn't mention this matter again.</p><p></p><p>They needed more time to digest the fact that their 'brother (sister) is a hidden expert'.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't figure out why such a coincidence would occur, boldly guessing that maybe everyone around them also had a system...</p><p></p><p>After the lights were out that night, Cong Shuling opened her system panel to check her attributes:</p><p></p><p>Level: First Rank</p><p>Talent: Commoner</p><p>Bloodline: Commoner</p><p>Items: Fine Steel Dagger, Soft Silk Breastplate, Silent Cloth Shoes, Healing Medicine...</p><p>Points: 1250</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Seeing the points column, she couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief: "This mission's reward was bountiful, but it was indeed dangerous. If not for various coincidences, I would have surely met with disaster. But luck was on my side, and I finally have enough points to redeem a talent."</p><p></p><p>She quickly flipped to the 'Internal Energy Talent' section, looking at the 1000 point redemption price, but feeling a bit reluctant to part with the points.</p><p></p><p>There were so many things in the mall, all kinds of amazing introductions that almost made her lose herself.</p><p></p><p>Close to redeeming it, she became quite indecisive: "Should I really exchange for the Internal Energy Talent? 1000 points would be enough for me to get one of those powerful thermal weapons..."</p><p></p><p>"Redeem the Internal Energy Talent." In the end, she resisted the temptation and redeemed the Internal Energy Talent.</p><p></p><p>This was the talent she possessed in her previous life, the one she was most familiar with. With the Internal Energy Talent, she could pick up her martial arts from her previous life again. With the system's assistance, she could quickly reach at least the level of a second-rate expert.</p><p></p><p>Once she regained the power from her previous life, she would have more confidence surviving in this world, accumulating more points to exchange for more and stronger things.</p><p></p><p>Among all the items in the mall, this talent had the highest cost-performance for her.</p><p></p><p>After redeeming it, a syringe filled with a transparent liquid appeared in her personal space, along with usage instructions.</p><p></p><p>The final prompt: Please use the talent serum in a safe place. The talent modification process takes about five hours, during which the host will be in a defenseless sleep state.</p><p></p><p>In the deep night, Cong Shuling quietly got up and climbed out the window.</p><p></p><p>Then she saw Cong Renfe, who had also climbed out of another window...</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, the two felt a bit awkward.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 876</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After painstakingly searching for half a year, just when he finally found the long-coveted Soul Power Fruit he had been dreaming of, this fruit had already ended up in someone else's mouth. What kind of experience was that?</p><p></p><p>That huge blow made his entire world turn dark and gloomy, losing all its former vibrancy.</p><p></p><p>He could see that by eating that Soul Power Fruit, he would gain the ability to fight against those despicable Gold Dragons and trample the one calling himself the Great Demon King Chipu underfoot, avenging his past humiliation.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything was gone.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a supreme deity who had lived for who knows how many years, he could not withstand such a blow!</p><p></p><p>A nameless rage welled up from somewhere in his body, sputtering out, almost setting his whole being ablaze.</p><p></p><p>That little rabbit brat actually dared to steal and eat the fruit that belonged to him, how utterly vile.</p><p></p><p>He had called out to stop him, but the little rabbit brat still dared to keep eating, and after eating, he even dared to run away. Not only did he run, he ate faster and faster, turning back every few steps...</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the Order God - Red Light found himself disliking a 6 or 7 year old kid so much.</p><p></p><p>The anger surged a tremendous force within him. He took a step forward chasing after the little guy: "You stop right there, you bastard!"</p><p></p><p>The little guy kept turning back, his face full of terror, running like a blur. But how could he outrun a grown man?</p><p></p><p>Soon the Order God - Red Light caught up, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and lifted him up. No matter how the kid kicked his legs, it was useless. But he kept moving his hands and mouth, swallowing down that not-so-big fruit in just a couple of bites...</p><p></p><p>His belly rounded out, and finally he let out a burp, then moaned in satisfaction. Innocently raising his eyes to stare at the Order God - Red Light, he let his hands and feet dangle, no longer moving.</p><p></p><p>The Order God - Red Light pried open the little guy's mouth, then held him upside down by the feet and shook him, as if trying to make him spit out the fruit he had eaten.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was already too late, but he just couldn't control his rage. Recently, everything he did ended in misfortune, and he had unknowingly lost that divine nonchalance.</p><p></p><p>The little guy was terrified. Strangely, while hanging upside down, he seemed to grasp some peculiar power. He instinctively raised his fist and punched towards the Order God - Red Light's crotch.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosive sound came from Red Light's crotch area, flesh and blood splattering.</p><p></p><p>Red Light felt his strength rapidly draining from his body. A few minutes later, he completely lost his life force.</p><p></p><p>The little guy who fell to the ground was so scared he peed his pants, and soon ran off without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the little guy cautiously returned to this beach with his three buddies, and they eventually gathered around Red Light's fallen body.</p><p></p><p>One dirty-faced kid exclaimed in shock: "Tulu, did you really take him down?"</p><p></p><p>The little guy Tulu was covered in blood splatter, dazed: "Seems like I took him down. My strength grew, and then I punched right here, and he was done for."</p><p></p><p>"What should we do? If the adults find out, our butts will be beaten to a pulp."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of them. If they dare hit me, I'll just cry."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder we always hear you crying and sniffling, haha!"</p><p></p><p>A scholarly-looking kid said: "Let's throw him into the sea, the fish will eat him up soon."</p><p></p><p>Another immediately shook his head: "No, my dad taught me that just throwing a body into the sea won't work, the waves will soon wash it back ashore. We need to tie it to stones. But we don't have any stones or ropes here."</p><p></p><p>"Should we go back and get some? If my dad finds out I took the ropes, he'll beat me too."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we just dig a hole and bury him right here!"</p><p></p><p>The four brats looked at each other, then huffed and puffed as they dragged Red Light's body a bit further away from the shore and started digging.</p><p></p><p>Soon they had dug a big pit, and with a hard push, Red Light's body rolled into the deep hole...</p><p></p><p>After finishing the task, the four kids seemed both excited and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>"Tulu, you're not just bluffing are you? When did you get strong enough to beat a grown-up?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah Tulu, you must be bluffing. You can't possibly be that strong."</p><p></p><p>Tulu frowned, the new things in his mind leaving him confused. Happening to pass by the coconut tree they had climbed before, he felt an itch in his hands. Without much thought, he casually punched the tree trunk.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>An ear-splitting boom rang out, leaving a large dent in the coconut tree trunk, the whole tree shaking precariously.</p><p></p><p>The other three kids' eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p><p></p><p>Tulu himself was also dazed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Order God - Red Light raged abnormally, venting his emotions frantically in the gods' group chat. After who knows how long, he finally calmed down, hiding in his own small world, repeatedly calling out: "Damn rabbit brat! Damn rabbit brat!"</p><p></p><p>Not just him, the other gods weren't doing too well either. The eighteen of them had confidently entered the Heaven's Path, only to return empty-handed in the end.</p><p></p><p>What made them most helpless was that news of superhuman beings kept emerging from various places - they knew it meant the Soul Power Fruits had been eaten.</p><p></p><p>And the 'Explosion Fruit' that the Order God - Red Light had seen was the very last one.</p><p></p><p>With this, the first batch of ten Soul Power Fruits all had owners now.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we were just a step too late. No matter, we can just wait for next year's second batch of fruits. What does it matter to let that silly Gold Dragon be arrogant for a while longer?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ability Fruit Tree hasn't fully grown yet, so there will still only be ten fruits next year. But those ten may not fall into our hands either. The same thing applies - it's up to luck."</p><p></p><p>"Obviously our luck doesn't seem too good."  </p><p></p><p>"It seems we need to prepare in advance. Fellow lords, why don't we cooperate this time? Otherwise, forget ten fruits, we may not even get a single one."</p><p></p><p>"How should we cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>"Establish a massive force, offer a high bounty for the Soul Power Fruits, heavily publicize it so that anyone who obtains the fruits will obediently hand them over. We won't take them in any particular order, just until we collect all eighteen fruits, then we can split them up. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>The gods thought it over, unable to find a better solution: "I suppose we'll have to do that."</p><p></p><p>The others tagged the Order God - Red Light: "Lord Red Light, share your thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>Red Light: "Damn rabbit brat! Just you wait, I'll make sure you're dead...Damn it! So angry!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another year later, one of the Great Demon King Chipu's subordinates came to report: "Reporting to the Great Demon King Chipu, I received word that on Heaven's Path, an evil organization called the 'Eighteen Gods' is purchasing a special fruit called the 'Soul Power Fruit'. Rumor has it this Soul Power Fruit possesses unimaginable power - by eating just one, you can gain an amazing ability. Like the 'Lightning Fruit', 'Shapeshifting Fruit', and 'Piercing Fruit' that have already appeared. Extremely powerful and miraculous."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he handed the Great Demon King Chipu a sketch of the fruit.</p><p></p><p>Chipu glanced at it without much interest in this so-called 'Soul Power Fruit'. No matter how powerful it was, could it be more powerful than him?</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu suddenly stood up and roared: "Demon kings, brothers, on Heaven's Path there is actually an evil organization engaging in unforgivable atrocities and plunder.</p><p></p><p>At this very moment, they are bringing unimaginable disaster to this world. We must go and stop them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they even call themselves the 'Eighteen Gods' - utterly unforgivable. As the embodiment of justice that is the 'Great Demon King Chipu's Army', we cannot just stand idly by.</p><p></p><p>Brothers, the time has come for us to act. Follow me to destroy this evil organization, so that the name of Chipu's Great Demon King Army will once again resound throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>Shout out loud to me, what is our motto?"</p><p></p><p>"Grrrr - Let the world tremble under the shadow of evil!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a horde of giant dragons took to the skies towards Heaven's Path, causing all who saw them to flee in terror.</p><p></p><p>The gods quickly learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>"What? Those stupid dragons are flying to Heaven's Path? What are they coming here to do? Aren't they just coming to make trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Nati, you're the principal god of the Red Gold Dragons, shouldn't you go out and get them to temporarily retreat at this critical juncture?"</p><p></p><p>Nati said: "Don't look at me. My avatar went to find them before, but when I said I was the Heavenly Deity Nati, that Great Demon King Chipu killed it, wasting a hundred of my points for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"No need to say more, with those idiotic dragons around, things are bound to turn bad. Don't ask why, because it's always like this."</p><p></p><p>"We need to find a way to lure them away."</p><p></p><p>"I get it now, we must have publicized it too well, and word of the Soul Power Fruits reached his ears. He's coming for our Soul Power Fruits, to snatch them away."</p><p></p><p>The gods fell silent: "..."</p><p></p><p>The gods quickly reached a consensus: "This time, we absolutely cannot back down. Let's join forces and fight those dragons to the death!"</p>

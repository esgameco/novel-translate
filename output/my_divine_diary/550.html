        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"It really worked out well. After all, Su Hao and Ya Shan have experience teleporting an entire small asteroid out of nowhere. Moving this small factory is naturally no problem."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said again: "Moreover, if we directly move the factory away, others will definitely think some kind of special bizarre disaster occurred here. They won't associate it with us and it won't cause trouble for Huaishui Town - it's killing multiple birds with one stone."</p><p></p><p>As for the lack of workers, aren't Ya Shan and Feng Cheng the best workers? They don't need mass production of machinery, so they don't need that many workers. If really needed, they can recruit some at high pay.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan immediately gave a double thumbs up: "I think it's feasible!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng muttered: "As expected of Master Wei and Master Ya Shan, so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Ya Shan, later the two of us will go down and use transformation steel to turn the factory area into diamond armor, creating the illusion of a bizarre disaster to scare everyone away first. Then we'll work together to teleport the entire factory to Gourd Island."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan clapped his fists together: "Got it, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng pointed at himself: "Master Wei, Master Ya Shan, what about me?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan showed a ferocious grin: "Feng Cheng, you go blow up the Source Masters Association building in Huchang City. They dared to mess with us, so they need some minor punishment. At the same time, it will attract the attention of those powerful source masters, so they won't pay attention to Changqing Factory."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Then Master Ya Shan, should we leave a note or something? After all, those who occupied Changqing Factory may only be a small part."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed: "Just blow it up, why bother distinguishing good from bad? After we become invincible later, we can slowly settle the scores!"</p><p></p><p>After following Master Wei for so many years, he had long understood one principle: if you don't have absolute power, then many things won't develop as expected.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan scolded with a laugh: "You don't understand shit! Don't keep those three words on your lips, it's annoying to hear. Just do it."</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng left for a while, Su Hao and Ya Shan secretly snuck into the factory, with each taking one side. Diamond armor rapidly surged under their feet, spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire factory area below turned into a shimmering expanse, undulating unpredictably, as if standing on rolling river waters, swaying with the rise and fall of the river - utterly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This was almost exactly like the legendary bizarre disaster!</p><p></p><p>It's said bizarre disasters are extremely horrifying, a disaster that kills a huge area at once!</p><p></p><p>"Oh crap! A bizarre disaster, everyone run!"</p><p></p><p>"A bizarre disaster happened in the factory! Quick, call the masters, aren't there a few masters in the factory? Come out and protect us!"</p><p></p><p>"Protect your ass, I saw them run away first!"</p><p></p><p>"We're utterly doomed, to actually encounter a bizarre disaster, we're dead for sure!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah~ah~"</p><p></p><p>"What are you screaming for, my ears are ringing!"</p><p></p><p>"Help~help~"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, chaos erupted inside the Changqing Factory buildings, with everyone fleeing in terror, pulling at each other, some stumbling and falling to beg those around them for help.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of a bizarre disaster, everyone only wanted to escape as quickly as possible, where could they care about others? Even the source masters stationed at Changqing Factory were no exception, in fact they ran the fastest.</p><p></p><p>Many helpless factory girls fell to the ground, watching with their own eyes as those workers who swore their love abandoned them in panic, a shameful tear falling from the corners of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They'll never believe in love again! To get food and bread, they still have to rely on themselves! They wiped away their tears and nimbly got up, relying on their own strength to run away.</p><p></p><p>From then on, many girls who loved fantasizing awakened and became independent and self-reliant!</p><p></p><p>After confirming that everyone had fled, Su Hao said: "Ya Shan, start the teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>Just like before when teleporting the small asteroid, he took the lead in opening the spatial channel first, while Ya Shan stabilized it. Su Hao continued expanding it while Ya Shan kept stabilizing, until the entire factory area was enveloped.</p><p></p><p>With their previous experience, the two cooperated very smoothly without much effort to open a channel large enough.</p><p></p><p>The two's spiritual power suddenly pulled.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>The enormously vast Changqing Factory abruptly vanished from the suburbs, leaving only fresh, moist yellowish-brown soil where it originally stood.</p><p></p><p>Many people standing outside the transformation steel range to watch were so shocked their eyes nearly popped out.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, where's our factory?"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, wake up, when was it your factory? Just because you worked in it, it's yours?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a huge factory area, just gone like that? Oh my god, a bizarre disaster, it's really that horrifying! If I hadn't run fast earlier, I'd probably be dead now."</p><p></p><p>"The first time in my life seeing a bizarre disaster, it was worth it. No regrets!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, of course you have no regrets, but the boss must have suffered a huge loss."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was chattering nonstop, a huge boom came from Huchang City in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, dense smoke could be seen billowing into the sky far away.</p><p></p><p>These people immediately revealed looks of amazement, and after identifying the direction, they even seemed a little excited.</p><p></p><p>"Something happened!"</p><p></p><p>Something did indeed happen, but what was with that little excitement in their eyes?</p><p></p><p>Many people instinctively ran inwards: "Let's go see!"</p><p></p><p>More people shouted: "Go see? Do you have a death wish?"</p><p></p><p>But their feet very honestly followed and ran in.</p><p></p><p>These successive incidents seemed quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>They could foresee that after this incident, they would get the best gossip material, no longer having to worry about having nothing to brag about at the dinner table.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao and Ya Shan had teleported the entire factory back to Gourd Island and barely recovered a bit of their spirit, they received a distress signal from Feng Cheng: "Master Wei, Master Ya Shan, save me! I ran into a bizarre source master, I can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan were astonished. Feng Cheng was at least a Golden Dan cultivator with the protection of the Fate Seed. Yet he couldn't even run away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately checked the information Feng Cheng sent back and saw his life wasn't in immediate danger, just that his vision was flipped upside down in utter chaos.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, without teleportation in this world, every step was difficult.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think too much about it and flashed over, grabbing Feng Cheng's arm.</p><p></p><p>'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao released Feng Cheng and said: "Feng Cheng, you need to practice the teleportation technique more in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng staggered a few steps before gradually steadying himself. He shook his head, dazed: "I thought being at the Golden Dan realm meant you weren't invincible, but at least could still run away...Seems I thought too much."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked: "What happened just now?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng gradually recovered and said helplessly: "There was a bald guy, probably a bizarre source master. Once he got close to me, I found I completely lost my sense of direction. I was clearly trying to run away, but somehow ran backwards instead. Wanted to fly up but fell to the ground. Up, down, left, right were all messed up. I was dumbfounded in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>The ability displayed was similar to his 'Three Day Bewilderment Formation', but the principle was probably different.</p><p></p><p>Based on the nature of bizarre abilities, it was highly likely that reality's directions were directly reversed - up, down, left, right, front, back were all inverted.</p><p></p><p>For a normal person encountering this, they would definitely be confused. Even if aware of the bizarre disaster's nature, the body and brain simply couldn't react properly.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "If that's the case, the bizarre source master you encountered was indeed formidable. Even against me, I'd probably have to teleport away first before finding an opportunity to strike back."</p><p></p><p>The three of them still understood too little about bizarre source masters.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the three of them would have long stood atop the tallest place in this world's most prosperous city, announcing to the people that the era ruled by them had arrived...</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Su Hao immediately made arrangements: "Within two months, restore the production line. Then focus all efforts on breaking through to the Spirit Condensation realm, aiming to have the ability to research sources within two years.</p><p></p><p>As for you two awakening as source masters, we'll discuss that after breaking through to Spirit Condensation. As for me, I've made some interesting discoveries on source artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Next, I'll devote some effort to collecting source artifacts worldwide, and also take a trip to New Era City to see what kind of goods this world's largest metropolis has..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 709</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In Xia Qingjun's office, Su Hao handed Xia Qingjun a small metal cube about the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun took it, feeling its heaviness in his hand. He examined it repeatedly, but couldn't see anything special - it was just an ordinary small metal cube.</p><p></p><p>He asked curiously, "Is this the 'Star-Shattering Cube'? What does it do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Literally, it can shatter a planet. This is a product I obtained through study and research."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked disbelieving. Su Hao's words severely challenged his understanding of science again. "Shatter a planet? With this little thing? That can't be possible..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun shook the small cube and laughed, "If Xu Shiqiang says it can work, then it probably can? Maybe it can only shatter smaller planets though, more like asteroids."</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded in realization.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Don't doubt its power. The size of the planet doesn't matter, as long as the environment isn't so harsh that it can't function properly.</p><p></p><p>Let me put it this way - you can think of this small cube as the egg of a planet-eating insect, and that will help you understand how it works."</p><p></p><p>"A planet-eating insect egg?!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's hand trembled, almost dropping the 'small cube' to the ground. The captain was quick-eyed and reached out with the leader to steady the small cube together.</p><p></p><p>They were holding it like a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>But judging from their slightly alarmed expressions, that was not the case. They held it like a super bomb that could explode at any moment, with cold sweat dripping from their temples.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Such a small thing is so dangerous! Daqiang, will this thing suddenly explode?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took out two smaller metal cubes and placed them on the table. "This is the 'activator'. Enter the correct password on the digital keypad, and it can activate the 'Star-Shattering Cube'. This is the 'igniter', used to completely destroy a planet. Just throw it onto a planet that has been invaded by the 'Star-Shattering Cube', and it will automatically take effect."</p><p></p><p>Knowing the Star-Shattering Cube wouldn't easily explode, the two men breathed a sigh of relief for now.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said, "Xu Shiqiang, you gave me quite a scare."</p><p></p><p>If he knew the effects of the Star-Shattering Cube, it might be more than just a little scare. Su Hao smiled, "My verbal explanation may not be accurate enough. We should try it on an actual planet."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said, "We should give it a try. How do we test it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Simple, send a spacecraft to infiltrate one of the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets, then drop it off at a random location and activate it."</p><p></p><p>"That's feasible! But the distance is too far, it would take at least five years to verify its effectiveness."</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, we have plenty of time. I'll leave the 'small cube' to you then. Oh, and don't even think about trying it on Bluelight - I'm afraid I won't be able to save Bluelight then."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't mess around with something so dangerous."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After that, Su Hao stopped concerning himself with how Xia Qingjun and the others used the 'small cube'.</p><p></p><p>Once they witnessed the power of the small cube, their regard for him would undoubtedly reach the highest level, and humans would become his best assistants in learning knowledge.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the research base and gradually adjusted his mental state, thinking to himself, "Next, I'll focus all my efforts on researching 'warp travel', and then transcend the need for machinery by manifesting it with my own abilities."</p><p></p><p>He casually opened the universal assistant and unfolded the principles and design diagrams of the warp drive, reviewing them from start to finish once more.</p><p></p><p>So, how did the technology of this world achieve faster-than-light 'warp travel'?</p><p></p><p>The result was beyond Su Hao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The key point was actually in the commonly used 'energy blocks'!</p><p></p><p>The principles of warp travel were not complicated - he had recorded them long ago and had tried researching them in his previous life when planning interstellar travel, but without any results, so he had put it aside. He never expected to see this special mode of travel being used freely by the intelligent races in this world.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it involved: using powerful gravity to bend spacetime, stretching and expanding the space behind, while compressing and contracting the space in front, creating a huge spacetime differential. The spacecraft could then naturally accelerate forward through this differential to achieve faster-than-light travel.</p><p></p><p>The theory was straightforward, but how was it realized?</p><p></p><p>The reason was that the energy required to stretch and compress space was enormously vast.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>Unless one had corresponding 'psychic tentacles' that could directly pry open space like Su Hao did, as well as the ability to create artificial 'space modules'!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the people of this world did not possess psychic tentacle abilities.</p><p></p><p>How difficult must it have been for them to warp spacetime?</p><p></p><p>Very difficult, but the people of this world had achieved it!</p><p></p><p>The reason they succeeded was not because the people of this world were exceptionally intelligent, but because they happened to discover a material that could do this - the energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>Energy blocks were not produced by the Eight-Armed Race or humans, but rather naturally occurring things in the Cloud Ring system!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could only sigh, "The key factor that gave rise to this interstellar world was the energy blocks! Indeed, in the vast universe, nothing is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>As for how to use energy blocks to achieve warp travel...</p><p></p><p>Apart from being able to stably release enormous amounts of energy, energy blocks had one special property: their gravitational force would increase when releasing energy.</p><p></p><p>In other words, when releasing energy, energy blocks would emit gravitational waves that distorted the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>The faster the release rate, the greater the curvature!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, making an energy block instantly release all of its energy was unimaginably difficult.</p><p></p><p>The so-called warp drive was a mechanical device designed to guide the rapid release of energy from energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the guidance ability, the more powerful the corresponding warp drive.</p><p></p><p>And the released energy was used to resist external pressures during flight while maintaining the spacecraft's balance and stability.</p><p></p><p>The principles of the warp drive were that simple!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This world's warp drive was unexpectedly... crude, in Su Hao's view!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, environmental factors played a major role in technological development.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao determined that if this world did not have the special 'energy blocks', the Eight-Armed Race's technology might not have developed to this level, nor would their colony planets be scattered across the Cloud Ring system.</p><p></p><p>This left him feeling disappointed yet gratified.</p><p></p><p>Disappointed that he could not learn more profound spatial technology knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Gratified that it would not be difficult to manifest the effects of the warp drive using his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>As long as he thoroughly researched the principles of the energy blocks' trumpet-shaped vortex atomic structure, he could realize it through his own methods.</p><p></p><p>At that point, he, Su Hao, would have achieved another accomplishment - perhaps he could call himself the 'Interstellar Wanderer'?</p><p></p><p>...</p>

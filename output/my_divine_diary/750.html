        <h1>Chapter 750</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yahan couldn't help but reach out and tap Fengcheng's head: "Fengcheng, why are you always thinking about playing poker in that little brain of yours! For something worth celebrating, we should be throwing a banquet."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said helplessly: "I don't know! I can't forget that unfinished game from my previous life. I feel like I definitely could have won..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao also laughed and said: "You think you could beat me and Yahan at poker? Let's have a banquet instead! We'll feast and indulge ourselves - it's been over a decade since we last properly enjoyed some delicious food."</p><p></p><p>Yahan immediately said: "Old Master Wei, let me be the chef! It's been years since I've wielded my expert ladle, I don't know if I've gotten rusty."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng raised his hand: "I'll go buy juices, drinks and ingredients, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand grandly: "Then I'll prepare the venue, it's settled!"</p><p></p><p>And so, a grand dining event for the three of them was held in the second world.</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng busied themselves with their respective tasks.</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked at the simple appearance of the second world and planned to completely renovate it into a celestial paradise...</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he finalized the plan: "The second world is too small, I'll expand it first, let's say to a diameter of 500 kilometers...</p><p></p><p>Then I'll add some fertile soil and an overall environment, using the fantasy elf world style as the backdrop, let me think...</p><p></p><p>I remember seeing a colonized planet of the Eight-Armed race in the Stargazing World, its scenery matches my aesthetics perfectly, and it's not too far from human-explored regions either. I'll just dig out a piece from that planet!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao used a teleportation array combined with 'Stargating' to reach the planet. Ignoring the panicked Eight-Armed colonists, he selected the most 'paradisiacal' area and expanded his divine consciousness to cover a 400km radius.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the 'Mind's Desire' technique of the 'Divine Source Mage', he separated the soil and rocks within his consciousness' range from those outside, and forcibly lifted the 400km diameter hemisphere, sealing it into a temporary miniature world...</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone used an enormously huge spoon to scoop out part of the planet's surface, and terrifyingly, even scooped out the red molten magma underneath.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this like digging a spoonful out of a cream-filled bun, with the filling oozing out?</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Eight-Armed fleets kept retreating in defeat these years, even sparking a mass migration across half the star system... there was simply no way to fight back!</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed immediately thought of 'migrating' far away from the humans...</p><p></p><p>After digging out the materials, Suhao simply teleported back to the second world and placed them inside.</p><p></p><p>The entire second world was instantly transformed...</p><p></p><p>It was a true celestial paradise! The main colors were yellow and green, with white, red and purple accents. The longer you looked, the more celestial energy seemed to emanate from this place.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled satisfiedly: "Not bad, not bad! Let's add some mountains, waters, waterfalls, pavilions..."</p><p></p><p>With a stomp of his feet, the Golden Adamantine spread out as he freely reshaped the landscape, also setting up many large arrays below to maintain the second world's smooth operation...</p><p></p><p>The renovation was soon complete!</p><p></p><p>When Yahan and Fengcheng brought back all the ingredients and tools, they were stunned by the changes to the second world.</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>It truly looked like the blessed land where immortals reside.</p><p></p><p>They had only been gone for a little while - how did the second world transform into this?</p><p>Did they take a wrong turn somewhere?</p><p></p><p>Then they spotted that leisurely figure strolling down the stone path - wasn't that Old Master Wei?</p><p></p><p>The two set down their things and hurried over to Suhao, asking in amazement: "Old Master Wei, how did you do this? It's incredible!"</p><p></p><p>This was arguably the most paradisiacal place they had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily: "Not bad, right? I dug this out from a nearby Eight-Armed colonial planet. From now on, this will be our main base of operations!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the three worked together to build a simple yet exquisite house at the center of the second world, moving all the tools and ingredients inside and arranging them properly.</p><p></p><p>Then the grand outdoor banquet began!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Even after eating and drinking their fill, Suhao's restless mood hadn't settled, his excess energy still needing an outlet through activity.</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao said: "Fengcheng, go get some racing cars from outside, let's have a car race."</p><p></p><p>All these years later, Suhao had become immensely powerful, but he still loved the feeling of recklessly driving vehicles at high speeds.</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng's eyes lit up, that was a great idea.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng excitedly controlled his avatar to run outside.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao designed a massive elevated racetrack, he sent the blueprint to Yahan: "Yahan, let's each build half of this track!"</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Old Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>The two stomped their feet.</p><p></p><p>"Ka ka ka!"</p><p></p><p>Masses of Golden Adamantine spread out, rumbling up from deep underground towards the sky, then transforming into an extremely complex series of interconnected racetracks...</p><p></p><p>When it came to construction, Suhao and Yahan were professionals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the same applied to destruction.</p><p></p><p>Once the three sat in their respective race cars, Suhao said: "Let's set some rules - only use the cars' inherent capabilities, no cheating with abilities. And the last place finisher has to go outside and livestream singing and dancing."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Old Master Wei!" Yahan and Fengcheng nodded seriously, staring intently ahead as their vehicles roared.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Ready? Start!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, they floored the accelerators!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Long flames simultaneously burst from the three cars' rear ends as their wheels spun wildly.</p><p></p><p>"Shoooomâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The three cars took off almost simultaneously, neck and neck.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After some unknown period of time, Fengcheng left the second world and found the fleet commander: "General Gong Liang, I need to ask you something."</p><p></p><p>The commander asked curiously: "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng looked a bit awkward, took a deep breath, and said: "Well...I need to organize an online singing and dancing livestream for about an hour. Can you help arrange it and promote my livestream channel across the entire network..."</p><p></p><p>The commander was dumbfounded and blankly said: "Mr. Fengcheng, are you trying to debut as an idol?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng had a wry look: "No way, I just lost a competition to Old Master Wei and Old Master Yahan!"</p><p></p><p>The commander understood with a laugh: "I see, got it! But Mr. Fengcheng, if you really wanted to debut as an idol, with your handsome looks you'd definitely become immensely popular!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled proudly: "Of course, but I have no interest in playing those kinds of games. General Gong, please make the arrangements for me quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The commander laughed: "Rest assured, it's no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Before going live, Fengcheng quietly adjusted his mindset. </p><p></p><p>He knew Old Master Yahan used to work in livestreaming and was quite famous, so he specifically sought out Yahan's advice and gained precious experience.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng thought to himself: "I definitely won't embarrass Old Master Wei and Old Master Yahan."</p><p></p><p>After the livestream started, Fengcheng put on a terrifying mask, his whole demeanor becoming gloomy as he formally opened:</p><p></p><p>"I am the singer and dancer Jia Fengcheng, striking at your very souls. I am the nightmare in your midnight, the dawn in your nightmares, the despair in your dawn...!</p><p></p><p>Next, I will present a dance and song from the unknown reaches of the universe."</p><p></p><p>The viewers were stunned, having expected an upbeat cosmic educational program when advertised as a top human superhuman's singing and dancing livestream.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After ending the livestream, Fengcheng still had some lingering feelings.</p><p></p><p>He asked the commander who had watched the whole thing: "General Gong, how was my performance?"</p><p></p><p>The commander stroked his chin silently, unable to say a single word...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, General Xia Qingjun who had also watched felt relieved: "It's a good thing Jia Fengcheng wore a mask, otherwise the 'Three Great Human Divinities' image we've promoted for over 20 years would have completely collapsed."</p><p></p><p>However, to everyone's surprise, two days later an unexpected thing happened.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng became an internet sensation among humans!</p>

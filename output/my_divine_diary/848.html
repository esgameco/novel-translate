        <h1>Chapter 848</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Four hours later, the pirate finally woke up slowly.</p><p></p><p>And within the ball space, Su Hao observed that the soul force enveloping the consciousness information had merged with the chaotic information of the body.</p><p></p><p>That chaotic cluster of information was actually being forcibly organized by the consciousness information of the soul force, synchronizing with each other.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao asked Zhu Xia, "Can the soul force be extracted alone, while preserving his will intact? In other words, can he still transform back into an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia said, "No, not a single deity can do that. Once a soul seed is planted in someone, that person's life will be forever bound to the deity until complete death. I have tried to deprive believers of their abilities before, but without exception, those who lost their powers also lost their lives. Their wills have already merged inseparably with the deity's soul force."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's brow gradually furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia's words made him realize that once consciousness information is packaged with soul force, the information binds with the soul force. When the soul force dissipates, the consciousness information will also dissipate with it.</p><p></p><p>"Although the lifespan of soul force is very long, soul force still has a limited lifespan. Crudely manipulating soul force alone cannot grant me eternal life. I must thoroughly study soul force to perfectly solve my problem."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Ten-Colored Plate floating beside Yi Yan and thought, "These deities are cooperating, which saves me a lot of trouble. Most crucially, the deities' understanding of soul force is actually not meager. I can learn from them first while studying it myself."</p><p></p><p>After conducting many more experiments, towards the end Su Hao curiously asked, "Lord Zhu Xia, can you use your own soul force to separate out pure soul force that does not contain will information? In simple terms, separate out soul force that is not under your control."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia shook his head bluntly, "All soul force inherently contains my will information. I have never seen soul force without will information."</p><p></p><p>A flash of light streaked through Su Hao's mind as he suddenly understood something. He immediately asked, "If soul force must contain will information from the moment of its birth, then how do Bai Jia'er's information, your information, and your believers' information coexist within the same soul force?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia pondered briefly before understanding Su Hao's doubt and answering, "It is preserved in a subordinate layered manner, with both inclusive and overlapping relationships. Taking my Bai Jia'er form as an example, all soul force contains Bai Jia'er's will information. My will information is layered on top of Bai Jia'er's will, overriding Bai Jia'er's will, like pouring dye onto a white board to cover up the original white color. On the surface, what is seen is my will, which takes precedence.</p><p></p><p>As for the believers I have planted soul seeds in, they have further layered another kind of fuel on top of the soul seeds from which I have retracted my will, overriding my will. On the surface, the believers' wills appear dominant.</p><p></p><p>So the soul force we usually see from soul cultivators actually contains at least three wills."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao understood, "So it seems this soul force belongs to the soul cultivators, but in reality it is yours. You can freely shake off the outer dye coating to reclaim your soul force. And the soul force you control seems to be yours, but is actually still Bai Jia'er's, whom Bai Jia'er can also shake you off from at will to reclaim all the soul force, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia, not expecting Su Hao to grasp his words so thoroughly, smiled awkwardly, "I don't know if Bai Jia'er can shake off my consciousness, but I can shake off my believers' consciousness at any time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled slightly, "You think you've taken measures against the possibility of Bai Jia'er rebelling, and they can no longer remove you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia said, "Naturally. To be honest, a long time ago there were constantly Bai Jia'ers following the mutual resonance to our Ten-Crossed Star. It was I who created a method to block Bai Jia'er's resonance, cutting off their arrivals. I passed this method to the other deities, continuously refining it over the long years, until now I can confirm our blocking methods are impenetrable to Bai Jia'er."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, "It's good you're confident. I hope you're right."</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao tidied up and casually sent the pirate believer back before telling Zhu Xia, "Let's end today's experiment here. I'll assign you a simple task - go organize your understanding of soul force and Bai Jia'er, then hand it over to me later."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xia readily agreed, only saying, "Leiyan Aokesi, perhaps you truly are just curious about the Ten-Colored Plate and mean us no harm. I'm willing to fully cooperate and gamble my fate. Your arrival may actually be a good thing for us deities."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Perhaps! Who can say about the future."</p><p></p><p>After the Revival Deity Zhu Xia returned to the group of deities, the deities looked Zhu Xia up and down, seeing he was unharmed, and curiously asked, "Lord Zhu Xia, where did Leiyan take you just now, and what did he do?"</p><p></p><p>They were truly very curious.</p><p></p><p>But the more curious they were, the less Zhu Xia told them, only lightly smiling, "Many, many things happened, but what benefit would I get from telling you?"</p><p></p><p>The deities' Ten-Colored Plates darkened as they complained, "We were stripped naked in front of Lord Zhu Xia, yet you still want benefits? You're so greedy."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mu Ti Sakesi felt the recent period had been terrible.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that everything he did would develop in the worst possible direction, making him feel his luck had been too poor lately.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had tricked his wife Shadu into going alone to the Cloud Interval Mountains to raise their child, while he focused on taking care of Dai'an and their two other children.</p><p></p><p>The two parties wouldn't meet, which was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined Shadu would quietly bring the three young children back...</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined he would be directly caught cheating on her.</p><p></p><p>Most ridiculously, he couldn't even beat his own child.</p><p></p><p>Later, he took Dai'an and found a new secluded place to live. When the clouds of war loomed over their ancestral lands, he unintentionally got involved with a new beautiful golden dragon girl and fell into another love affair.</p><p></p><p>Hatefully, Dai'an caught him and the new golden dragon girl in the act again and beat him up - as a male dragon, he felt it was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, he still decided to take responsibility as a male dragon and protect his two wives during the war, secretly taking them to flee far away.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, even more unluckily, he ended up leading his two wives straight into the battlefield between humans and dragons, and a group of human soul cultivators targeted them.</p><p></p><p>He fell into danger, but never imagined his wives would simply abandon him and escape alone.</p><p></p><p>At that point, he recalled how good his first wife Shadu had been. He vowed to give up completely on love and never fall for another golden dragon girl again.</p><p></p><p>He fought desperately, and just as he was about to be drained of strength and fall into the vortex of death, everything around him vanished. He found himself transported to another place.</p><p></p><p>After brief confirmation, he realized he had been rescued, along with all the dragon race. He thought this was the only good news lately, but quickly dismissed that idea.</p><p></p><p>Because the one who rescued him, a human calling himself Feng Cheng, was flying in the air loudly telling them that they were now his spoils of war and would work for that human without pay from then on.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ti Sakesi felt that human had gone insane. They were the noble dragon race - even if facing death, they would never work as slaves for the evil humans. Their pride would not allow them to become human servants.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if not for currently being bound immobile by some mysterious force that even their 'Breaking Prohibitions' could not break through, he would have lost patience listening to Feng Cheng's rambling long ago.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he wanted to charge up and breathe a torrent of raging flames at him to shut him up.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng passionately chatted with the giant dragons for two hours, seeing it was about enough, he revealed a brilliant smile and loudly said, "Giant dragons, you are all my good friends now. All dragons, listen to my arrangements and form a queue..."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Feng Cheng released the spatial structure suppressing the giant dragons, awaiting their friendly response.</p><p></p><p>"Owooooâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The giant dragons couldn't help but let out excited roars from their throats, surging within the small world.</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng saw that after regaining freedom, the giant dragons did not express any goodwill towards him, but looked at him like an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Some giant dragons even flapped their wings to take flight, furiously charging at him while spewing torrents of flames from their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was startled and dodged to the side, unable to help exclaiming, "Damn, giant dragon friends, is this how you treat friends? You seem a bit too enthusiastic. I can't adapt to it for now, please be more gentle when dealing with friends."</p><p></p><p>A giant dragon loudly cursed, "Foolish human, who is your friend? You are defiling the noble dragon race, go die!"</p><p></p><p>Saying so, it exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Feng Cheng react that his unbeatable Source Ability had actually failed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the chaotic giant dragons, none of whom seemed to view him as a friend at all.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 530</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Willow Mountain was not actually a mountain, but an extremely large willow garden, located very far away from Huaishui Town.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had to cross through three counties and towns before reaching the place where Willow Mountain was located. Based on their previous traveling speed, it would take at least five days of walking.</p><p></p><p>Axing was not worried at all that by the time they arrived there after so much hardship, the strange disaster would have already been resolved by others. Because if it could be resolved so easily, it would not be called a strange disaster.</p><p></p><p>"You mean there are not just our small team going to deal with the strange disaster?"</p><p></p><p>This was unexpected for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Generally, a mission would only be issued to one place. Once a source team took it on, it would be marked until the mission was completed or failed.</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "For natural disasters and source beast disasters, they can usually be resolved independently by one source team. The ones that require multiple teams to collaborate are extremely difficult incidents.</p><p></p><p>But strange disasters are different. Sometimes no matter how many teams are sent, it's not enough. Most crucially, strange disasters will not easily disappear, but instead spread outwards with increasing intensity.</p><p></p><p>So after a strange disaster is discovered, the local source master branch will report it to the headquarters, which will then uniformly issue missions to all subordinate towns and cities under its jurisdiction, in an attempt to resolve the disaster as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Source teams interested in this will then rush to the disaster site and try to resolve the disaster. Based on past experience, at least twenty teams will participate. If it cannot be resolved for a long time, even more source teams will be deployed."</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't understand, "If that's the case, then whether our small team participates or not is actually irrelevant to resolving this strange disaster, right? Since there are so many teams involved in this incident."</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed, "You can't say that. To resolve a strange incident, strength alone is not enough, luck is even more important. Whoever resolves the strange incident will be the protagonist. Who knows, maybe the ones resolving it will be the three of us?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly realized that the official approach to resolving strange disasters was to rely on luck by throwing a large number of teams into the strange disaster. As long as one of the teams got lucky and successfully resolved the strange disaster, then this incident would be over.</p><p></p><p>It's like even if the probability of one team resolving the strange incident was only 1%, if 100 teams were deployed, then the probability of successfully resolving it would increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao still had one question, "Strange disasters are so dangerous, why are there still so many teams willing to enter them?"</p><p></p><p>Before Axing could speak, Awang interjected helplessly, "There are always people who like thrills and use this method to prove their strength. Axing is one of them."</p><p></p><p>Axing immediately refuted, "Awang, you're being too one-sided. Liking thrills is only part of it. Moreover, isn't a source master's responsibility to deal with all kinds of disasters? How can we shrink back in the face of disasters?"</p><p></p><p>Awang sighed, "But you also have to look at your own strength. How many teams have perished from recklessly joining when their strength was insufficient?"</p><p></p><p>Axing smiled, "But Awang, if we don't go out and experience more disasters, how can we grow stronger? The 'strength' I understand may be different from what you understand. The strength I aspire to is the kind where no matter what problem arises, I can find a solution - extremely reliable, able to prop up the sky. Not the usual 'destructive power'.</p><p></p><p>My father told me, to become a truly strong man, simply cowering in a safe little room will never achieve that."</p><p></p><p>Awang fell silent. He knew Axing's father was a powerful source master, but unfortunately died in a strange disaster years ago.</p><p></p><p>And Axing has always wanted to conquer all kinds of strange disasters, which may be related to this.</p><p></p><p>He could not understand Axing's obsession. His own father also died in a strange disaster, but he avoids strange disasters as much as possible, only wanting to live safely forever.</p><p></p><p>But alas! Axing was his good brother after all.</p><p></p><p>Axing didn't know what Awang was thinking, and continued explaining to Suhao, "Of course, in addition to that, the rewards from strange disasters are unimaginably great. After each strange disaster is resolved, a special 'source artifact' will be generated. This 'source artifact' will eventually be taken away by the association, but the team that resolved the disaster will receive a reward of one thousand high-quality source beads.</p><p></p><p>One thousand high-quality source beads - what a concept! You'll be rich! You won't have to worry about money for a long time and can enjoy life. The car you wanted before, you can just casually buy and drive...</p><p></p><p>Of course, money is secondary. Most crucially, the team that successfully resolves a strange incident will gain immense prestige. Whoever sees them will have to respect them."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled wryly. No matter where, no one could escape the prison of "money, prestige, and passion."</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person, these three were indeed enough to pursue for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the small town, without Suhao saying anything, Axing and Awang consciously created a crude flying device on the spot, exactly the same as the previous one. They then excitedly sat on the small benches, waiting for Suhao to get on.</p><p></p><p>Who would want to walk if they could fly?</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "If we earn money resolving the strange disaster this time, let's get a fixed flying device."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With high-speed flight, it took Suhao's trio less than a day to reach Willow Town, the closest town to Willow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Willow Town was much larger in scale than Huaishui Town, with a population dozens of times greater.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Willow Town was bustling. The streets were crowded with people coming and going. Teahouses were filled with all kinds of people, noisily discussing this strange disaster incident - some locals who lived in Willow Town, some outsiders coming to join the commotion, and of course source masters here to resolve the strange disaster.</p><p></p><p>"I noticed that willow forest was off early on, but didn't expect something would really happen!"</p><p></p><p>"Right! Thinking back now, it did seem strange every night in that forest. Over the years, the rumor is that no less than a hundred people have died in there. Tsk tsk, so scary!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll never dare go near that place again! It's been five days now and there's still no progress. Don't know when the source masters will be able to resolve it. My heart feels uneasy - if it spreads for a few more days, we might have to move houses."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, teams have been entering it successively these past few days. Maybe it'll be resolved very soon. I heard the association has even officially named this strange disaster - they're calling it 'Nowhere to Hide'. We ordinary people just need to wait for news."</p><p></p><p>"Nowhere to Hide...sheesh, I don't know why, but just hearing it gives me goosebumps all over. Hope the source masters who entered come back safely."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly! If I could awaken as a source master, I'd also charge in and resolve that disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah right, you wish!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Suhao walked, all kinds of information entered his ears, which Xiaoguan quickly organized in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>He wondered in his heart, "Nowhere to Hide? Could it be like the hide-and-seek type strange incidents from ghost stories?"</p><p></p><p>Axing was also carefully analyzing the various information. After a moment, he shook his head, "There's no useful information. Let's just go to the association hall and ask directly!"</p><p></p><p>The Willow Town association hall was larger and more spacious than Huaishui Town's, with even more people. Source masters holding all kinds of weapons and wearing strange outfits could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao's trio entered, they looked just like ordinary people on the street.</p><p></p><p>This was related to the Sunray Team's equipment. If their team had a gold-level source master, then all the team members could probably be equipped with gorgeous metal armor. Unfortunately, they didn't have one.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to inquire at the counter, Awang's eyes suddenly widened and he blurted out, "Little Sugar? How is she here too?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Axing followed Awang's gaze to see a young girl in the crowd, looking up at the latest announcement.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was surprised in his heart - wasn't this the armed girl he had encountered right after being reborn?</p><p></p><p>Axing leaned in and whispered to Suhao, "Ayang, this is the girl Awang has been pining over, his secret crush, but he hasn't dared to confess."</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked astonished, "Her face isn't pale at all! Why would he like her? Don't tell me he wants to sell her his family's heirloom whitening cream!"</p><p></p><p>Axing said in a low voice, "Who knows? Maybe he just likes that type."</p><p></p><p>Awang heard the two of them spouting nonsense from the side, his face darkening.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, when you like someone, do you still care if they're pale or not?</p><p></p><p>Axing pushed him, "What are you looking at? Hurry up and go greet her!"</p><p></p><p>Awang usually looked like a smooth operator when it came to romance, but now his hands and feet were trembling a little.</p><p></p><p>Pushed all the way over by Axing, when Little Sugar turned to look at him, he finally had a smile on his face as he stammered, "Little Sugar, that...what a coincidence, heh heh!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "Just that?"</p>

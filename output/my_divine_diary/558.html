        <h1>Chapter 558</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>What would happen if an ordinary team mixed with three great masters?</p><p></p><p>At first it was really enjoyable, enjoyable to the point of exhilaration, but after a long time, they gradually became numb.</p><p></p><p>The tension, excitement and passion of doing missions had been completely worn away. Every time they went out, they lacked a sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Besides going out for a stroll and watching the great masters show off their skills, what else could they do? What was the meaning of their existence in the small team?</p><p></p><p>Besides leading the way and dividing the money, it was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, Suhao was also present today. Axing made a difficult decision - to split into groups!</p><p></p><p>Of course, they still belonged to the same small team, but they would separate when carrying out missions and act separately. According to Axing's original words: "Although it would be very safe and reliable to follow the brothers, my goal is to become a strong and reliable person. I want to experience my own trials, step by step, to reach the peak I can reach."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Axing's words, Yashan and Fengcheng were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They never thought there would be such a foolish person in the world, who was unwilling to mix with a group of masters, but insisted on going out to work hard on his own.</p><p></p><p>You should know that as long as you serve the great Master Wei well, maybe one day he will give you a shot, and you will immediately achieve your life's goal. This is much better than relying on your own efforts for a hundred years. Most importantly, even if they struggle for a hundred years, they may not be as effective as Master Wei's single shot!</p><p></p><p>Suhao could understand Axing's words and agreed with his proposal to split into groups. He maintained his original attitude, thinking that what people want to do is their own freedom, as long as it does not affect what he wants to do. He would not subjectively think that others should do this or that, and interfere with others' choices based on assumptions.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually handed over a positioning stone and said, "If you encounter any life-threatening danger, you can input a trace of source in a semi-activated state into this stone, which has a certain probability of saving your life."</p><p></p><p>After Axing took it, they agreed on a time to meet again and then dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Up until today, the exploration of this world has come to an end.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next day, at the island experimental base.</p><p></p><p>The fantasy source mage Fengcheng used his ability 'Mind's Desire' to demonstrate its effects to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>All things within his perceptual range were freely kneaded and manipulated under his thoughts, taking on various anthropomorphic postures, jumping or dancing, or turning into powder, or forming various shapes. Even the surrounding seawater rose in streams under his control, transforming into the shape of huge dragons, dancing wildly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was very envious when he saw this, as this ability was so cool! In comparison, his own ability as a wonder source mage to create objects seemed less impressive.</p><p></p><p>Suhao approached Fengcheng and closed his eyes, carefully sensing the entire process of Fengcheng's use of 'Mind's Desire' with his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>From the extraction of the source, through the transformation of its properties, to its integration into his spiritual power, adding a certain characteristic to his spiritual power that manifested as a powerful spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>Even the final point of application of that trace of source was revealed under Suhao's divine observation.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng deliberately slowed down his pace, demonstrating his 'Mind's Desire' over and over again. He would not stop until Suhao told him to. When one source bead was used up, he would take out another and continue demonstrating.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng had now broken through to the divine realm and cultivated 'divine consciousness'. He himself clearly understood how his 'Mind's Desire' transformed from source to source ability, but due to his limited eloquence, he was unable to express what he saw clearly. The only way was to demonstrate his ability repeatedly, allowing Suhao to observe the entire process himself.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Suhao opened his eyes with a smile and said, "It's quite interesting. The source ability of the fantasy system is indeed related to spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>The 'source' itself is at a critical point, just like a small ball floating motionless in space, unaffected by any force. At this time, if it is subjected to even the slightest force, this small ball will change its stationary state and move in the same direction as the force applied.</p><p></p><p>And spiritual power happens to be the 'slight force' that can act on the source, changing its critical state and transforming it into 'ability' or 'quality', or the bizarre 'fantasy system'.</p><p></p><p>Different people possess spiritual power with different qualities. Different spiritual power is like an arrow pointing in a random direction, giving the source different directions of transformation, ultimately manifesting different effects.</p><p></p><p>These effects can be 'fire', 'high temperature', 'lightning', 'radiation', 'illumination', 'explosion', 'kinetic energy', or various unstable states of matter like water, mud, metal, air, and all kinds of strange little things. They can also be things that only exist in imagination, appearing extremely inconsistent with basic 'material theory', such as 'nowhere to hide', 'no distinction between up and down', 'infectious disease', 'self-strengthening', and so on.</p><p></p><p>If it can be imagined, it exists!</p><p></p><p>If the combined effects of countless people's spiritual power happen to be transmitted to a region of 'source' in the depths of the universe, perhaps it could evolve into a world in that corner of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Anything is possible!</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily, "This is something I also want to know. But surely there will be a day when we figure it out! Perhaps all living beings have spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>And come to think of it, what is spiritual power? Is it your thoughts, your will, or your desires?</p><p></p><p>We have cultivated spiritual power for so many years, yet we have never really studied what spiritual power actually is! This is the core of our strength, yet we have inexplicably neglected it and taken it for granted as it is.</p><p></p><p>The marvels of the world are all waiting for us to unveil one by one."</p><p></p><p>He paused and guessed, "I guess the history of this world must be very interesting. Perhaps there were not many bizarre disasters in the distant past, only increasing after humans awakened."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng quickly understood what Suhao was expressing and were amazed. If this were true, then to a certain extent, the bizarre disasters that pose the greatest threat to humans could be considered to originate from the complex spiritual world of humans.</p><p></p><p>The cycle of all things in the world is truly wondrous.</p><p></p><p>"However, this is just my guess. As for the specifics, I plan to research a barrier against fantasy system abilities first, and then go to various major cities to take a look at their hidden historical and source-related research materials. Many things become clear at a glance."</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Suhao and the other two studied how to guard against various bizarre fantasy system ability attacks.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng transformed into a humanoid source device, along with a series of bizarre source devices, serving as props for fantasy system ability attacks to facilitate experimentation. Meanwhile, Suhao and Yashan designed various defensive measures and then tried them out one by one, exhaustively testing all seemingly feasible measures.</p><p></p><p>It was not until three months later that they found a specific defensive solution, which could be considered a success, but not a complete success.</p><p></p><p>The success was that they could now resist the effects of fantasy system abilities on the body and mind. The incomplete success was that they could only resist the effects of fantasy system abilities on the body and mind.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that many bizarre abilities do not directly act on the body and mind, such as the 'no distinction between up and down' that Fengcheng had encountered before, which affected the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>The 'bizarre barrier' that Suhao researched could only isolate all bizarre effects outside the body.</p><p></p><p>However, this barely achieved Suhao's goal. At least with the 'bizarre barrier', they could go anywhere in the vast world.</p><p></p><p>With this, Suhao's 'fragile defense' took another step forward, patching the vulnerability to fantasy system abilities.</p><p></p><p>So how could the bizarre abilities be isolated?</p><p></p><p>The way bizarre abilities are transmitted and take effect is not simply through the projection of spiritual power. This had already exceeded Suhao's cognitive range, and he had tried many defensive measures to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Suhao came up with a solution that was not really a solution - projection.</p>

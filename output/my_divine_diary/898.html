        <h1>Chapter 898</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very happy that the deities had suddenly become enlightened and wanted to learn about and understand the world. However, although the deities had vast knowledge and various experiences, they were not necessarily strong when it came to learning theoretical knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This was related to their long-standing habits of thinking, and it was very difficult to reverse this in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>For them to truly get started was even more difficult than for the brother and sister. Of course, it was not impossible through years of bitter struggle, it just depended on whether the deities could persevere.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the eighteen deities and two world wills unexpectedly set off a localized learning craze.</p><p></p><p>The way they greeted each other every day changed to: "Did you study today?"</p><p></p><p>Ten years passed in the blink of an eye. Fengcheng completed the basic guidance of the two siblings, truly introducing them and cultivating them into two little apprentices who liked to think and explore. According to the evaluation given by the Omnipotent Assistant, they should be able to reach the "novice" level.</p><p></p><p>As Fengcheng was about to leave, he smiled and said to the brother and sister: "Learning is endless. It seems that in these ten years you have learned a lot, but it is only the beginning of the path of exploration.</p><p></p><p>This knowledge is only a prerequisite for you to explore the world and the universe in the future, which is secondary. For you, the most important thing is to master a complete and self-consistent dialectical logic. Any problems you encounter in the future can be solved through dialectical thinking, and any new things you learn in the future can be transformed into your own knowledge and enrich your cognition through this way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>As long as your curiosity about the universe is not shattered, as long as you do not stop your steps of exploration, all doubts will eventually have an answer.</p><p></p><p>In any case, keep going! I look forward to your growth, don't let yourselves down."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister had tears in their eyes. Cong Shuling's eyes were red as she said, "Master, are you leaving? When will we see you again?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed: "As long as you keep learning, you will see me again one day. You should know that time passes very quickly. Perhaps in the blink of an eye, you will see me again. That's it."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Fengcheng's figure gradually faded away and finally disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Parting is always so sad. Even if you believe that you will meet again in the future, who knows when that will be?</p><p></p><p>Now that Fengcheng had left, they just felt an emptiness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling took a deep breath and said firmly: "Earn points, exchange for greater power, and like the master, roam this universe."</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the sky: "It must be lively in the distance, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei nodded hard: "Yeah!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "Let's go defeat the Great Demon King Chipu. This is a main line quest, and it must earn us enough points."</p><p></p><p>"But our strength seems too weak against the Great Demon King Chipu."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said: "Slowly, start from the small monsters."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Demon King Chipu was lying in his palace, roaring loudly in dissatisfaction: "Moli, quickly take your bunch of brats away from me, they are disturbing my sleep.</p><p></p><p>Let me tell you, why do you give birth to a litter of dragon cubs every two years? My entire demon king's castle has almost been occupied by your children. Where is the majesty of me, the Great Demon King Chipu?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>This split body of Fengcheng returned to Suhao's device manufacturing small world and joined the huge manufacturing team.</p><p></p><p>The one who spent ten years guiding the brother and sister was just a small part of Fengcheng. The vast majority of his consciousness was still on the Huxi and surrounding planetary systems, transforming various civilized planets. A small part followed Suhao to produce the "Wave Data Collection Device".</p><p></p><p>This ten-year guidance made the brother and sister emotional, but Fengcheng felt nothing...</p><p></p><p>After this split body returned to the production line, Fengcheng took the time to report to Suhao: "Old Master Wei, I have guided these two siblings and introduced them. Next, I plan to let them be for a few hundred years to temper their will and become more mature. I will also observe whether they truly have the potential to become qualified experts.</p><p></p><p>However, I still have high hopes for these two. Compared to ordinary people, they have a strong initiative and drive. As long as they don't go astray in the future, they will definitely become excellent assistants."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "I think so too. I hope they can keep going until the end."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Old Master Wei, do you need me to send a split body to keep an eye on them at all times? It would be a pity if something unexpected happened."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "No need, it's okay. I have already given them opportunities and favorable conditions. If they cannot take good advantage of them, it means they are not very suitable."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued: "We don't lack time to cultivate suitable assistants, and Yashan has also finished transforming the Blue-Purple Planet, so we don't lack seedlings either. We have sown the seeds, and which ones can grow depends on whether they are suitable or not.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as long as you give someone enough chances, they will inevitably be able to grow. But in life, where are there so many chances? Having one is already very good."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Suhao had many chances to start over, but if you traced back to when his consciousness information had just entered the Pinball Space, he actually only had one chance.</p><p></p><p>If he had just driven past that place back then without crashing head-on, there would be no today.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, he also only had one chance. Fortunately, he seized it and crashed head-on.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but Yashan and Fengcheng also only had one chance each. Luckily, they both seized it.</p><p></p><p>Recalling his own experience, Fengcheng couldn't help but smile and said with a laugh: "Old Master Wei, am I the legendary protagonist from novels? The one blessed with luck, with a golden glow on my head? Otherwise, how could I have met you in the vast universe?</p><p></p><p>Even until now, I still feel like I'm in a dream. I'm just a small cultivator, how could I be so fortunate as to roam the universe with Old Master Wei and Old Master Yashan, witnessing so many colorful facets of the universe with Old Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao also smiled: "Luck? Sometimes I believe there is such a thing, sometimes I don't believe there is such a thing, it's hard to say. Now we probably don't have the qualifications to explore this question yet. Perhaps as we learn more and more, we will eventually be able to unravel the mystery of luck."</p><p></p><p>As for the "Wave" he is currently researching, it is far from being about luck. In his view, it is just the feedback effect of an energy wave fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao couldn't help but wonder: "If I master the operating rules of the 'Wave', can I actively influence whether the Wave has a 'positive feedback' or 'negative feedback'?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, after detecting the microscopic influence of the Wave on the two siblings, through this period of research and analysis, Suhao discovered more about the Catastrophe System.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the Wave also had two sides, "positive" and "negative", but previously Suhao had only seen the negative side of the Wave, thinking that the Wave could only bring harm. But that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>The Wave would cause changes to the surrounding environment, and these changes would gradually intensify as the accumulated energy increased. However, these "changes" were not necessarily bad for the crossers, they could also be good, just like simple harmonic motion, with peaks and troughs, cycling forward.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he had only seen catastrophes before was...</p><p></p><p>Who would associate the good luck they encountered with the "Catastrophe" that often killed them?</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that calling this system caused by crossers the "Catastrophe System" might not be accurate, but Suhao didn't intend to change the name after getting used to it.</p><p></p><p>If Suhao could freely control the "positive" or "negative" state of the Wave, from the perspective of ordinary people, it would be almost the same as mastering a person's "luck".</p><p></p><p>What would happen if the "positive state" was stacked to the maximum for someone?</p><p></p><p>A European Lord in the world.</p><p></p><p>And the "negative state"?</p>

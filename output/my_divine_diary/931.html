        <h1>Chapter 931</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What kind of scene would it be if a giant dragon hundreds of meters long suddenly appeared in a technological world with only low-level martial forces?</p><p></p><p>A huge, ferocious dragon was flying high in the sky, with a large number of fighter jets chasing behind, frantically attacking it. Missiles were occasionally fired from a distance, striking its body, making it even more arrogant. It laughed loudly, "Tremble under the shadow of my wings, the mighty Demon King Chipu! You puny mortals!"</p><p></p><p>Then, just as it was laughing most brilliantly, a hydrogen bomb was precisely thrown into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook this scene out of his mind and smiled at the Great Demon King Chipu, "Chipu, this has nothing to do with you. I have a unique mission for you."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu was stunned, "What mission?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Use your great power to build a massive shuttle port and transmission array connecting various galaxies in Double Sword City. At the same time, build a shuttle production line. This is a major project, and you have the privilege of imprinting your 'Golden Dragon Seal' on every shuttle. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>"What is a shuttle?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Feng Cheng curiously, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "It's a tool that will allow you to freely travel through the universe. It hasn't been unveiled yet, but you'll know later. As for how to build it, you don't need to worry. I have complete design blueprints and a full set of machine tools. You just need to modify the machine tools according to the requirements. With your abilities, you can handle this job without a problem."</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao produced the 'Wave Monitoring Device' back then, they had manufactured countless production lines. Dismantling the equipment from just one of those production lines would be enough to produce the shuttles.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the Great Demon King Chipu was entrusted with an important task by Feng Cheng. He immediately became excited and stood up, stating that he would definitely complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly looked at the five new disciples of Ji Dingcheng. He had originally planned to take them as his own disciples, but now it seemed he didn't have much time for personal guidance. It might be better to have Chipu help train them...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Feng Cheng pointed at the five and said to Chipu, "Chipu, these five are my new disciples. For the time being, you can help guide them, and they can also assist you in building the production line."</p><p></p><p>So the five disciples of Ji Dingcheng exchanged glances with the Great Demon King Chipu.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu said, "Them? They seem so weak. Can they really help?"</p><p></p><p>The five disciples of Ji Dingcheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>The other disciples looked at the five in shock: The Celestial Lord's new disciples?</p><p></p><p>After resolving the issue with the Great Demon King Chipu, Feng Cheng looked at the disciples below, who were barely containing their excitement after hearing they could return home.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng understood their feelings very well. Even he sometimes couldn't help but think of his former homeland, the Cultivation Star, not knowing if it still existed.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he estimated that he probably couldn't return there. From this perspective, these disciples were fortunate to be able to go back and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng continued, "However, for the first phase of the university I plan to establish, not too many people will be needed. Initially, only twenty people need to go back and obtain various qualifications and certificates, then set up the framework for the university. Once we've built up a reputation and recruited enough students, we can gradually send more people."</p><p></p><p>"So, who is willing to be part of the first pioneers?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the disciples below immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Me, me, me! I'm willing to go back!"</p><p>"Choose me, choose me."</p><p>"I have experience studying at a university."</p><p>"University studies? That's nothing. It's better if I'm in the first batch. I have experience teaching at a university."</p><p>"Step aside, don't fight. I have experience being a leader at a university."</p><p>......</p><p>The argument escalated to the point where even those who had delivered food to universities spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng stopped them, saying, "Since all of you disciples want to go back, then let's do this: For disciples above the Spirit Realm, we'll rank them by mission points, and they can choose first whether they want to go back or not. Zhu Ling will be in charge of this."</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling immediately stood up and bowed, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>After making detailed arrangements, Feng Cheng said, "Confirm the candidates as soon as possible. I'll take you there in two days. Remember, don't easily reveal your powers. You're going back as teachers, so remember to set a good example. Understood?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Two days later, when Feng Cheng returned, he saw that twenty disciples were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>With a quick glance, he noticed they were almost all from the first batch of students who had learned from him, including Zong Zhuling and her brother, as well as Luo Yanfeng, Lu Zhibao, and the other ten disciples from the first batch. He nodded approvingly, "Alright, I'll take you back!"</p><p></p><p>He then transmitted the twenty of them away, instantly appearing on the 'Traveler's Hometown' planet of Blue-Purple.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "We've arrived. This is your mother planetâ€”Blue-Purple. There are no extraordinary powers here, so you can act freely.</p><p></p><p>"However, you must be careful not to change the existing order of this world. Our purpose is not to bring about reforms here but simply to recruit suitable students to join us.</p><p></p><p>"This is very important. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The disciples looked around the environment in awe and immediately replied, "Understood, Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded and then transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>The twenty disciples looked at each other, their faces full of restrained excitement, but no one spoke first. They all turned their gaze toward Zong Zhuling.</p><p></p><p>She was Feng Cheng's senior disciple and a member of the Double Sword Sect, the most prestigious disciple.</p><p></p><p>They were on a mountain outside an international metropolis on Blue-Purple, from where they could vaguely see the distant skyscrapers.</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling looked at the distant cityscape, her initial excitement gradually subsiding. Although she had already realized that times had changed, she still harbored some unrealistic fantasies before returning here.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until she truly set foot on this land that a sense of inexplicable sadness welled up in her heart, with past scenes flashing rapidly through her mind.</p><p></p><p>The person she and her brother had hated the most, their father, had already passed away!</p><p></p><p>But not being able to express their hatred to him in person was an irreversible regret.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful she and her brother were now, what had happened in the past...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zong Renfei gently called out, "Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling let out a long breath and said, "Let's go. We'll explore this city first and gather basic intelligence before deciding further. I want to look into the history of this world."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng, dressed in a suit, said efficiently, "Master, you and Master Zong's attire looks a bit outdated. It would be better to change into something else, so you don't stand out too much."</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling and Zong Renfei were used to wearing flowy celestial robes, but now that they looked, apart from the two of them, the rest of the disciples were all in suits and t-shirts. Several of the female disciples were wearing ripped, tattered jeans, short skirts exposing long legs, and baseball caps with strands of blue-purple dyed hair peeking out. Some of the male disciples even had various beast tattoos on their arms...</p><p></p><p>They were dressed very fashionably.</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling's eyes twitched slightly, "Are you sure it's not your outfits that are standing out?"</p><p></p><p>The tattooed guy and the long-legged girl looked surprised, "How could that be? This was the trendiest style back then. We have to show off our best features perfectly in order to blend into the environment. You can use your divine sense to see that the wildest and most popular outfits in the city are just like this."</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling and her brother were convinced by the others.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng, Lu Zhibao, and the other male disciples took out scissors, hairdryers, aprons, and other items from their spatial rings. They pulled Zong Renfei away, and soon a handsome young man with a stylish spiky haircut emerged, dressed in a suit and tie, looking dashing in one word.</p><p></p><p>As for Zong Zhuling, she hesitated as several female disciples dragged her away.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what hair color do you prefer? Rose red? Barbie pink?"</p><p>"Blue and purple to match your queenly aura."</p><p>"Wait, let me do a queenly makeup look for you."</p><p>"How about a thorny rose tattoo on your arm?"</p><p>"Don't like revealing short skirts? No problem, we can do short shorts! Black leather tights, paired with knee-high boots and high heels, perfect!"</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Zong Zhuling looked at her unfamiliar reflection in the mirror, feeling rather awkward and uncomfortable all over.</p><p></p><p>Even when she attended the banquet with the Great Demon King Chipu, she hadn't gone to such extremes.</p><p></p><p>She asked curiously, "Are teachers in your era all like this?"</p><p></p><p>The disciples replied, "Teachers in the past definitely weren't like this, but according to the Celestial Lord, it's been a few hundred years now. The teachers a few hundred years from now must have evolved to be like this. Be more confident! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>So a group of men and women at the forefront of fashion entered this metropolis.</p><p></p><p>And they immediately became the most eye-catching people on the entire street.</p><p></p><p>While the disciples had yet to fully enjoy this feeling of being the center of attention, this place was filled with the atmosphere of their hometown.</p><p></p><p>"Master, relax a bit! We're the most beautiful ones here."</p>

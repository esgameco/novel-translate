        <h1>Chapter 765</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The older generation of human officials like Xia Qingjun and the Captain grew old one after another.</p><p></p><p>Even with the effects of enhancement drugs that extended their lifespan considerably, they were still inevitably headed towards decay and death under the erosion of time.</p><p></p><p>This was predetermined at birth for everyone, no matter how they struggled in the process, how brilliant or great they were, no one could be exempt from it.</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun and the Captain were about to pass away, what they longed for most was to see Su Hao one last time, not for any other reason, even just to pour out their grievances would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xia Qingjun did not get his wish, and until he had no choice but to close his eyes, the Xu Shiqiang he yearned for never appeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew of the deaths of Xia Qingjun and others, but he only knew, without paying much attention.</p><p></p><p>After death, everything dissipates like clouds, meaningless.</p><p></p><p>It was so for those who died, and so it was for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>It was also after Xia Qingjun's death that the human alliance, which was barely maintained, collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Earth-shattering changes occurred, all kinds of events erupted intensively, conflicts arose incessantly, appearing to be the beginning of a chaotic era.</p><p></p><p>After the major forces fought to a certain extent, they united to sign the "Treaty of Non-Use of Planet Destroyers"......</p><p></p><p>For such things, Su Hao only glanced at them and paid no more attention.</p><p></p><p>Struggle was human nature, who won or lost was unimportant, just go with the flow.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't an alien race massacring humans, Su Hao could accept it......</p><p></p><p>Among the humans, there was one special person, Hua Yonghua.</p><p></p><p>Those she knew grew old and died one by one......</p><p></p><p>She kept making new friends, but without exception, these new friends also eventually turned to dust with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>But she...still looked as young as before! Without a trace of aging.</p><p></p><p>Even she herself could not explain how long she could live.</p><p></p><p>While marveling at the wonders of immortal cultivation, she also constantly missed her granduncle and others: "Granduncle, Brother Yashan, Brother Fengcheng, you all haven't died, right? But where are you?"</p><p></p><p>She wandered in the Yuanhuan System for many years, hoping to find traces of Su Hao and the others, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, she became the "Immortal" among humans, with countless people coming to seek immortality from her.</p><p></p><p>Also inexplicably, she saw through the patterns of life, aging, sickness and death.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, at a friend's funeral, she had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"I will continue cultivating, record my experiences in immortal cultivation, take in disciples, and pass on the cultivation methods, so we can all pursue longer life together."</p><p></p><p>She immediately found a colony planet, casually built a courtyard on a mountain, named it "Yixian Gate", and accepted disciples at will.</p><p></p><p>Then Yonghua suddenly discovered that no matter how intelligent her disciples were, no one could learn her immortal cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was full of questions: "???"</p><p></p><p>She intended to impart the methods of immortal cultivation, but alas, no one could learn them!</p><p></p><p>She guessed: "Could it be that these people don't have the so-called spiritual roots? Then where did my spiritual roots come from?"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua then applied her talents as a researcher and studied spiritual energy for the first time, pondering how to enable ordinary people to cultivate immortality.</p><p></p><p>Years later, she finally found a way: use technological means to synthesize free-roaming spiritual energy and disperse it in the air of a sealed room, then modify psychic power cultivation methods to substitute for meditation......</p><p></p><p>Didn't that cover all the bases?</p><p></p><p>She believed that with more and more people participating in the future, the cultivation methods would inevitably be optimized......</p><p></p><p>And so, the first planet in the Yuanhuan System that everyone aspired to cultivate immortality was born.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this world was turning towards an extraordinary direction.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao had fully digested all the knowledge he discovered in this world, a thousand years had passed.</p><p></p><p>He no longer paid attention to how humans had developed, only occasionally checking if they had developed any new technologies.</p><p></p><p>It was very convenient for him to check technologies, just by browsing the 'Planetary Network', he would understand everything.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, a thousand years was very long for an individual, but very short for a civilization.</p><p></p><p>In a thousand years, humans had not made much progress.</p><p></p><p>There were even alliances still playing with the technologies Su Hao had left behind.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao checked the progress of his avatar heading to the Panshi System, finding that about four-fifths of the journey was complete, with about two hundred years remaining before reaching the outermost planets of the Panshi System.</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred years will pass quickly. Since that's the case, I don't need to rush, and can take this opportunity to thoroughly explore the special nature of the Yuanhuan System."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that since the Yuanhuan System contained energy blocks as an energy source, it might be a special star system.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao had not truly understood other star systems, so he didn't know if energy blocks existed in other systems.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao felt that the possibility of other star systems having energy blocks was not high.</p><p></p><p>As for why he felt that way......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao guessed.</p><p></p><p>He flashed into the vast empty space, entered the 'Planetary Network' in the blink of an eye, and randomly selected a planet relatively close to the center of the Yuanhuan System.</p><p></p><p>He directly activated the transmission program.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, Su Hao appeared on this frozen planet with a harsh environment, then made another ultra-long-range flash and returned to space, turning to look towards the center of the star system.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was an extraordinary scene - a huge shadow in the center, surrounded by countless stars rotating around it, forming layers of brilliant fiery rings.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance at such a scene could instill fear in one's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Rapidly spinning black hole..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao extended his divine consciousness and quickly discovered a large number of energy blocks being ejected from the direction of the black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the production of energy blocks is related to the black hole. Then, let me continue to explore further!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not hesitate, re-entering the 'Planetary Network' and selecting a planet very close to the black hole to initiate 'Network Transmission'.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Su Hao opened his eyes in surprise: "Huh? I can't find the corresponding spatial module..."</p><p></p><p>With a shift of his thoughts, he immediately understood why.</p><p></p><p>"The closer to the black hole, the greater the degree of space-time distortion around it. After reaching a certain level, the data I previously organized can no longer match it, so naturally I cannot transmit.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, such a powerful gravitational field may make it difficult for me to activate my spatial abilities. The environment near a black hole may be an absolute forbidden zone for any living being."</p><p></p><p>He tried the next best option, selecting a planet slightly farther away from the black hole in the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Transmission failed.</p><p></p><p>He moved farther away.</p><p></p><p>Transmission failed......</p><p></p><p>Retreated again......</p><p></p><p>Only after retreating to an extremely distant position from the black hole was Su Hao finally able to successfully initiate 'Network Transmission'.</p><p></p><p>"Getting a little closer, a great sense of dread arose out of nowhere. This must be the innate fear living beings have towards the unknown!"</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the entire Yuanhuan System, this place was already very close to the center, but the distance to the central black hole was still extremely far. Even with Su Hao's Starlight Travel, it would take nearly ten years to reach it.</p><p></p><p>Driven by curiosity, Su Hao accelerated towards the direction of the central black hole.</p><p></p><p>He knew that at this point, the gravitational pull of the black hole on him was already immense. Miraculously, if he ignored the surrounding space-time distortions, he himself did not feel any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>He only knew in his heart that far ahead was an extremely dangerous place.</p><p></p><p>Was Su Hao afraid of danger?</p><p></p><p>Not at all. If he could use 'Network Transmission' to reach the black hole directly, he might even dare to try it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was currently using the 'Control Avatar' function in the Bouncing Space to control the actions of [Eight-Armed God].</p><p></p><p>If it died, it would just be [Eight-Armed God] dying, what did it have to do with Su Hao himself?</p><p></p><p>'Starlight Travel'!</p><p></p><p>Like a moth drawn to a flame.</p><p></p><p>Except that while moths were affected by the edge of light, Su Hao was affected by his own curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, Su Hao's ultimate skill Starlight Travel collapsed and disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>But he was well prepared, successfully surviving the immense tearing force produced by the space-time chaos.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and gave himself a thumbs up: "Well done!"</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not spent this thousand years in vain.</p><p></p><p>He flew forward for another two years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's [Eight-Armed God] avatar disintegrated and died.</p><p></p><p>Cause of death: Struck down by the various rays ejected from the black hole.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 815</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the mother dragon Shaduo did not understand what those two things that had just been knocked into the sea were. They looked similar to all the enemies that had been defeated before.</p><p></p><p>So after knocking down the enemies, they did not pay much attention to those two enemies. They turned directly and headed to the next island.</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly a month since they set off from the coastal mountains. The journey so far had been very smooth. At this pace, Mother Dragon Shaduo estimated that they would reach Dragon Island in another month.</p><p></p><p>After the last gene evolution, Suhao's body had already gone through the adaptation period and he could now undergo the third gene modification.</p><p></p><p>That night, the mother dragon landed on an uninhabited island to rest. Suhao went off alone to a corner to lie down and prepare to inject himself with the cultivated gene modification liquid.</p><p></p><p>"The next modifications are in two directions. One is to evolve into a more intelligent 'Prophet', to accelerate the construction of my 'external brain' and quickly break through the 'Split Spirit Realm'. The other is to modify the neural plexus system to gain the ability to sense blue crystals and blue nodes, successfully connecting to the 'Interstellar Network'."</p><p></p><p>After completing this gene modification and excluding the influence of spiritual power, Suhao's strength would basically be restored to his peak level from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>After another month, when the 'God' in his small world matured, he would basically be invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Gene modification requires about five hours of sleep. This is my most vulnerable time. If an enemy attacks, I will be in an extremely dangerous situation..."</p><p></p><p>"Mother Dragon Shaduo is an adult red golden dragon with an innate flame ability and various soul techniques. She looks formidable, but she can't even defeat a divine messenger, so she's not very reliable."</p><p></p><p>"However, fortunately I look like a weak little dragon. Anyone who sees me will want to capture and sell me rather than kill me directly. This serves as a decent camouflage."</p><p></p><p>"It would be better to have Yashan and Fengcheng by my side. At least when I'm asleep, they can provide stronger protection and I don't have to worry about enemies suddenly attacking. After reaching Dragon Island and stabilizing temporarily, I'll awaken them to study soul power together."</p><p></p><p>As for whether to awaken them as humans or as dragons...</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "Since I've become a dragon, these two can't be exceptions and will have to obediently become dragons too. Heh!"</p><p></p><p>He put aside his wandering thoughts, glanced at Mother Dragon Shaduo, saw that she was resting and not paying attention to him. The two little dragon cubs were running around chasing butterflies and small animals. So he quietly set up a powerful protective spell on his body surface, then took out the gene modification liquid and injected himself.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully these five hours go smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao fell into a deep sleep, entering the gene modification state.</p><p></p><p>During this gene modification, the unexpected situation Suhao was worried about did not occur. Everything went normally. When he woke up, he found that Mother Dragon Shaduo was still asleep, and the two little dragon cubs had also played until they were tired and were lying beside her, snoring loudly.</p><p></p><p>"The evolution was successful! Finally rid of that feeling of a sluggish brain that wouldn't obey, the brilliant genius thinking ability is back under my full control."</p><p></p><p>He first sensed his current state and found that not only was his thinking much clearer, but his spiritual power had also exploded tremendously.</p><p></p><p>And as he continued to adapt, his thinking power and spiritual power would continue to strengthen.</p><p></p><p>This made him sigh, "A powerful brain is indeed crucial. If the brain is not strong enough, no matter how much knowledge one has or how advanced one's thinking methods are, one may not be able to recall much of it when it's needed."</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised his paw in front of him. With a thought, a bundle of neural plexuses like tentacles extended out from his palm and swayed in the air under his control.</p><p></p><p>This was the second ability Suhao gained from this evolution: controlling the neural plexus and sensing blue nodes.</p><p></p><p>In other words, once the external brain was built, he could connect to the interstellar network and fully control the situation of this world.</p><p></p><p>Suhao retracted the neural plexus, entered the Pinball Space in his consciousness, and examined the data from this evolution.</p><p></p><p>He quickly concluded, "The evolution went very smoothly. At this rate, after adapting for a few days, my thinking power and spiritual power will be greatly enhanced. By then, building the external brain will be much easier. Not long after that, I will be able to completely restore my strength."</p><p></p><p>He then opened the 'Avatar Control' function of the Small Black Room and controlled the 'tool man' to patrol the two small worlds, finding nothing unusual before exiting the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>After estimating the time, he got up and started strolling around the small island.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao got up and moved around, the mother dragon also woke up. Seeing the approaching dawn, she stood up and stretched lazily, waking up the dragon cub Chipu and the dragon sister Moli, saying, "It's time to go, children. The next island is very far from here, so we must set off before daybreak."</p><p></p><p>The three dragon cubs quickly climbed onto Mother Dragon Shaduo's back. The mother dragon spread her wings, leapt into the air, and flew higher and farther.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>What Suhao and the others did not know was that the Golden God Bali had already set his sights on them.</p><p></p><p>Two figures flew rapidly one after the other across the sky above the sea. The one behind spoke, "Respected Lord Bali, the red golden dragon's flying speed is not fast, and it has to stop and rest every so often. We are taking a shortcut now. If we maintain this speed, we will arrive at the island they must pass through in two days and intercept them."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali was pondering how to deal with that inexplicable attack when he heard the words of the divine messenger Bode. He casually asked, "Do we have influence along the Heavenly Passage?"</p><p></p><p>Bode immediately replied, "Respected Lord Bali, on the island ahead called 'Bubble Island', a gang of pirates with decent strength is entrenched. The pirate leader is called Zhozi, a level six soul technician and one of Your Majesty's believers. If he learns that you have come in person, he will offer his flesh, blood and soul to you."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bali nodded without speaking, pondering in his heart how to deal with the red golden dragon's inexplicable attack...</p>

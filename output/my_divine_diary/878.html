        <h1>Chapter 878</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This newly discovered planet had an overall bluish-purple hue, so Su Hao temporarily called it the 'Blue-Purple Planet'.</p><p></p><p>After completing the brain transplants, the spiritual consciousness of Su Hao and the other two could freely envelop an entire planet. Even if the Blue-Purple Planet was enlarged tenfold or twentyfold, they could easily observe it with their spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, after observing it with their spiritual consciousness, the three of them still had to personally incarnate as ordinary people and enter this world to view it from another perspective.</p><p></p><p>There were many details of the world that could not be perceived through spiritual observation alone.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around a small town for a day, the three of them came to a teahouse and listened to the casual chatter of the tea drinkers.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! I heard that the 'United Merchants', Mengguo's largest merchant caravan, just entered the Ceramic Road but was surrounded by a group of mountain bandits. Tsk tsk tsk, what an inauspicious start!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, but the United Merchants are still very powerful. They hired a hundred martial arts masters from the jianghu, mostly second and third-rate, but there were also a few first-rate experts well-known in the jianghu. Those mountain bandits who surrounded them got chopped up and fled in disarray. On this westward journey along the Ceramic Road, no foolish mountain bandits will dare provoke them again."</p><p></p><p>"You speak as if you witnessed it yourself. That may not necessarily be the case. Everyone knows about the lucrative profits along the Ceramic Road. A single journey can allow everyone in the merchant caravan to live a few years of an affluent life. How could the mountain bandits there let such a fat prize pass by? I think they'll suffer some losses but still try to carve out a piece from the United Merchants."</p><p></p><p>"You make sense. Rumor has it that the mountain strongholds also have quite a few first-rate experts. They may not necessarily fear the United Merchants. This time there will be a good show to watch..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao realized that the current theme of this world revolved around the conflicts between kingdoms and the scattered mountain bandits in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that mountain bandits were everywhere, even forming a certain culture. If someone in the kingdom's territory suffered injustice they could no longer tolerate, they would often take their families and flee into the mountains to become mountain bandits, either establishing their own gangs or joining existing bandit groups. Their lives would not necessarily be worse than when they were farmers...</p><p></p><p>Many of the king's local armies were either in the process of suppressing bandits or on their way to do so.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called first-rate and second-rate experts, they referred to the martial artists of this world's humans who had mastered a physical inner force that allowed their bodies to exert strength beyond ordinary levels. This innate inner force was called 'neijin'.</p><p></p><p>This neijin was a unique gift possessed by the humans of this world. Su Hao only needed to casually observe two martial artists to understand the essence of neijin. Simply put, it was a kind of physical energy substance similar to the 'inner qi' of mundane martial arts in the cultivation world he came from, but slightly weaker in power level than the blood qi he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>However, if accumulated to a profound level, it could also exert formidable power, allowing feats like wall-running and shattering rocks with iron palms.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person just starting to learn, this inner qi was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>The three of them didn't have anything urgent at the moment. Taking the opportunity for an interdimensional adventure, Su Hao proposed, "The geography of this world is quite unique. A vast mountain range divides a large continent into two worlds, connected only by the narrow and rugged Ceramic Road, while the mountains on both sides of the Ceramic Road are infested with countless mountain bandits...</p><p></p><p>Why don't we take on the identity of ordinary people and travel along that legendary Ceramic Road to see what kind of experiences we'll encounter?"</p><p></p><p>There was no other reason - Su Hao was just interested and wanted to play around a bit.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, ever since gaining the power of blood qi and experiencing so many worlds, Su Hao had never truly immersed himself in a world's order, participated in its mainstream events, and witnessed the march of history from the perspective of a tiny participant.</p><p></p><p>He had always been desperately learning and researching to strengthen himself, worried that one day he might suddenly die and bid farewell to this mysterious world, as if a ferocious giant ape was chasing him from behind.</p><p></p><p>But now his mindset was different.</p><p></p><p>It was just for fun, learning and researching while playing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's rare interest, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were also enthusiastic. "Then the three of us can form a small merchant caravan and travel along this legendary Ceramic Road."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let's go for it. But let's agree that we'll just be ordinary people and not cheat."</p><p></p><p>"Who would cheat? That would be foolish."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao used his ability to create objects from thin air to obtain some high-purity gold and silver, successfully exchanging them for a cart of goods and three unique large horses with long manes from this other world, and then set off.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl dressed like a female knight came out, accompanied by an even younger boy.</p><p></p><p>The girl approached Su Hao's group and said, "Hey, you three, are you going to the Western Kingdom via the Ceramic Road?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan glanced at her and found her quite attractive, so he patted one of the horses and said, "Of course, otherwise why would we need these horses? And don't call us 'hey'."</p><p></p><p>The girl frowned. These three handsome young men were going to their deaths? What a pity. She couldn't help but advise, "With just that one cart of goods, you won't be able to sell for much money. And there's no guarantee you'll even make it to the Western Kingdom - there are many bandits along the way. If you encounter any who rob and kill, you'll lose your lives. I advise you to abandon this unrealistic dream of getting rich quickly! If you really want to go to the Western Kingdom, you'd better join a large merchant caravan and pay them a protection fee to travel safely with them."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the girl was quite pretty, Feng Cheng responded with a laugh, "Joining a large caravan would indeed be safer. To be honest, we are a large merchant caravan. Since you seem to want to go to the Western Kingdom too, why don't you and your companion join our large caravan? Haha!"</p><p></p><p>The girl looked Feng Cheng up and down, noticing they didn't carry any weapons, and asked doubtfully, "Are you first-rate experts?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook his head, "No."</p><p></p><p>"Second-rate experts?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>The girl rolled her eyes. "Then I won't join your caravan that's obviously just a gift for the mountain bandits. You don't even know how you'll die. In a few days, there will be a 'Southern Merchants' caravan departing from here. I'll join them. Why don't you three wait and we can go together?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately refused, "That won't work. How could we possibly join someone else's caravan?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao glanced at the girl and boy, merely smiling without saying anything. He then mounted his horse, gently squeezed its belly, and headed out of the city.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed, "Miss, maybe we'll meet again if fate allows."</p><p></p><p>He then hurried after Su Hao with the horse-drawn cart.</p><p></p><p>The girl stamped her foot. "If you get robbed by bandits, don't blame me for not warning you out of kindness!"</p><p></p><p>She turned to the younger boy beside her. "Ye Zi, let's go."</p><p></p><p>The other onlookers watched Su Hao's group leave and quietly laughed. "Ah, to be young is great. They dare to think and dare to do. Haha!"</p><p></p><p>"They really just went like that? This journey will definitely end in ruin. What money can that one cart of goods be worth?"</p><p></p><p>"Those three do have rather handsome appearances though. Maybe they'll catch the eye of a female mountain bandit leader and be taken to the mountain as kept men. That could be quite a romantic tale."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, I suddenly got an idea for a good story. The inspiration is flowing. Excuse me, old friends, I must hurry home to start writing immediately."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan rode on horseback while Feng Cheng sat in the horse-drawn cart driving it. The three of them traveled at a leisurely pace along the uneven road.</p><p></p><p>The journey was slow and felt like wandering in the mountains for fun.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, they passed through a narrow path that had been blocked by felled trees.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! This is the territory of my Red-Haired Braves. Guests passing through must pay the road toll, according to the rules."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan casually asked, "How much?"</p><p></p><p>The lead bandit held up one finger. "We won't make it difficult for you. According to the rules, one tael of silver per cart."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan casually tossed a tael of silver into the lead bandit's hand. After verifying it was genuine, the bandit waved his hand. "You may pass!"</p><p></p><p>Then a few filthy bandits rushed out from the side and cleared the path obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng clicked his tongue in admiration. "These mountain bandits actually have some principles."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao's group passed, the bandits behind them muttered among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Third Leader, there were only three of them and they looked quite wealthy. Why didn't you just take them down directly?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, those three horses are impressive. They must be worth a lot."</p><p></p><p>The Third Leader chuckled, "This is precisely why you can only listen to me and can never become a leader yourself."</p><p></p><p>"But didn't you used to rob and bury the people from small merchant caravans that passed by?"</p><p></p><p>The Third Leader continued chuckling, "Exactly, which is why I became the Third Leader."</p><p></p><p>The underling fell silent, feeling their Third Leader's actions always made sense somehow.</p>

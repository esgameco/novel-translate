        <h1>Chapter 612</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What was there to hesitate about?</p><p></p><p>Awang then used his level 2 skill 'Body Double', successfully allowing the two of them to dodge the giant beast's first pounce and bite.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was designing a massive computing center at the base to receive 'positioning device' signals from all corners of the world in the future. Suddenly, he sensed his spiritual imprint being triggered.</p><p></p><p>"Axing and Awang?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately transformed into [Destiny Child], donned his crispy shell armor, and entered the 'second dimension', projecting himself beside Axing and Awang.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw a gaping maw full of sharp teeth about to bite down. Axing and Awang were wearing 'Deep Sea Titans', desperately swimming outwards.</p><p></p><p>The heavy 'Deep Sea Titans' were covered in spikes like sea urchins, but that did not deter the giant beast's determination to swallow them whole.</p><p></p><p>"A sea beast!" Suhao instinctively pointed with his hand.</p><p></p><p>The huge sea beast was immediately restrained in place, unable to move, frozen in its open-mouthed posture, while Axing and Awang looked terrified as they slowly swam out of the beast's gaping maw.</p><p></p><p>Suhao formed a blade with his vertical palm and swung it down.</p><p></p><p>"Shh!"</p><p></p><p>A bright glowing water line sliced out from between his palms, cutting through this massive sea beast, nearly cleaving the entire ocean in two.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Red blood streaks appeared on the beast's body, its two halves slightly misaligned under the chaotic currents.</p><p></p><p>With just a wave of his hand, Suhao had cleaved this enormously huge sea beast in two.</p><p></p><p>After swimming out of the beast's mouth, Axing and Awang couldn't help but turn back and immediately noticed the motionless giant sea beast, as well as the crystal armored figure by its mouth.</p><p></p><p>"It's Ayang! We're saved!" Axing rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>Awang also let out a long breath, calming his pounding heart, and couldn't help but quip: "To escape this ordeal, you really are a lucky star..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang were soon brought to the surface by Suhao.</p><p></p><p>After understanding their situation, he couldn't help but wonder: "Why are you still accumulating points to exchange for skills? If you want any skills, just tell Fengcheng and it's done, right?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang: "???"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Oh, I forgot to tell you, all those messy skills were created by Fengcheng. The points, levels and such were all his doing. If you want skills, just ask him directly, no need to come do tasks here!"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang: "???"  </p><p></p><p>Suhao thought for a moment, then casually summoned a little parrot and handed it to Axing, saying: "This parrot is called Number 17. If you want to contact Fengcheng, just tell this parrot and Fengcheng can hear it!"</p><p></p><p>Axing took the parrot in confusion, his eyes full of puzzlement: "This...what?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao demonstrated, speaking to the parrot: "Number 17, contact Fengcheng!"</p><p></p><p>Number 17 parrot opened its beak: "Okay, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Number 17 said: "Big bro Wei, you're looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>From the voice and tone, it was undoubtedly Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "I'm giving Number 17 parrot to Axing and Awang. From now on, you can talk to them through Number 17. Pay attention if there's a voice call."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "Got it Big bro Wei, leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Oh right, if Axing and Awang want points, sort that out for them."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "Want points? How about 100,000 points each, enough to spend?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang froze: "One...hundred thousand?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On their way back, Axing and Awang remained silent, their minds a jumbled mess as they tried to process today's events.</p><p></p><p>Those awesome yet "messy" skills, as Suhao called them, were actually created by that brat Afeng? And he casually gave them 100,000 points each...</p><p></p><p>For a while, the two of them couldn't figure out what exactly their three teammates were.</p><p></p><p>They knew the three were powerful, but this level of power was a bit excessive.</p><p></p><p>Just seven or eight years ago, that kid Afeng couldn't even use 'Source' properly, right?</p><p></p><p>What kind of world is this, changing so rapidly that it's hard to accept!</p><p></p><p>Axing suddenly turned to Awang: "Awang, do you think Ayang and the other two might be in charge of the 'Real-Time Monitoring System'? Otherwise, there's no way to explain how they could so casually give out 100,000 points."</p><p></p><p>Then pointing at the parrot on his shoulder, he said: "And this parrot, it's a communication-type Source Beast, right? It's even more convenient than the Association's communication equipment. I can't figure out where Ayang got this little guy."</p><p></p><p>Awang nodded: "Even if you say Ayang is the leader of the Guangyao Society, I wouldn't find it strange."</p><p></p><p>Axing said: "That can't be right? How many years has Ayang been a Source Master? When would he have had the time to build up such a massive force, not only taking out all the royal families, but even making the Mage Association submit? This is not something that can be accomplished in just a few years."</p><p></p><p>Awang said: "That guy Ayang is indescribable, just accept it! After all these years of contact, no matter what happens to Ayang, I don't find it strange.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Guangyao Society is nothing. Who knows, maybe the Mage Association isn't submitting to the Guangyao Society, but to Ayang himself! Haha, just kidding!"</p><p></p><p>Axing also laughed: "Hahaha, I've accepted the fact that our teammates are world-class bigwigs."</p><p></p><p>He sighed deeply: "If I had known Ayang and the others were so powerful, able to obtain those skills so easily, why did we bother running around earning points like this?"</p><p></p><p>Awang asked: "We each should have 100,000 points now, so should we still do tasks?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said matter-of-factly: "Of course we'll do them! This is a great thing for the benefit of humanity for millions of years to come, why wouldn't we do it? But we'll wait until we unlock the 'Diligent Little Bee' achievement first!"  </p><p></p><p>Awang shrugged: "Whatever works!"</p><p></p><p>Axing smiled: "Want me to help buy your little Sugar's skills for her?"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of little Sugar, a deep sadness flashed across Awang's eyes. He shook his head: "Forget it! Since she's not interested in me, my heart is dead too."</p><p></p><p>Axing patted his shoulder: "Don't worry, there are plenty more flowers in the world, one will belong to you eventually."</p><p></p><p>Awang nodded: "I think Afeng mentioned inviting us to the Celestial Music Palace before, not sure if he was serious."</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed heartily: "Let's go back and switch to our second talents first, then find Afeng to go."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After returning to the base small world, Suhao put aside all his current work and instead pondered the safety issues for the Source Squad executing the deep sea mission.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful Source Masters on land may become mere snacks for deep sea behemoths once underwater, unable to utilize their formidable strength at all.</p><p></p><p>And how many powerful behemoths lurked in the depths?</p><p></p><p>This showed how dangerous it was for the Source Squad to enter the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the price was high enough, there would be Source Squads willing to risk their lives to complete the deep sea missions. But Suhao had to consider the issue of efficiency.</p><p></p><p>If too many Source Squads suffered losses during the deep sea missions, subsequent deployment would become slower and slower. Eventually, no matter how high the price, some Source Squads would choose to abandon the mission.</p><p></p><p>This was not the outcome he wanted.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he first informed Yashan and Fengcheng about this matter in the group, then said: "Suspend the deep sea missions for a month first. I plan to design a sea beast deterrent device to ensure the safety of the Source Squads on their deep sea missions."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>When previously researching Source Beasts, Suhao had designed an array device to attract fish. Now, designing a device to deter sea beasts was very simple for him - he just needed to slightly modify the previous array.</p><p></p><p>The only issue was that Source Masters could not use blood energy or spiritual power, so they had no way to power the array's operation. Thus, the deterrent device Suhao designed was a bit complex and cumbersome.</p><p></p><p>First convert Source to electricity, then electricity to spiritual power, and finally use spiritual power to activate the array...</p><p></p><p>The energy conversion process wasted a huge amount, which Suhao found impractical. But since it was just a temporary solution for the deep sea missions, it was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>In just five days, the deterrent device design was broken down into countless components and rushed into production at major factories around the world. The produced components were then transferred to designated locations for final assembly into finished products, ready for deployment at any time.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month, the deep sea missions restarted.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Source Squads taking on missions were informed that in addition to accepting the mission, they also needed to retrieve a small sea beast deterrent device to ensure safety during deep sea operations.</p><p></p><p>Making the Source Squads marvel: "The Association is so considerate, actively taking our safety into account. How touching..."</p>

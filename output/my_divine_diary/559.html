        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The principle is very simple, utilizing the twin spatial property, one person appears simultaneously in two locations.</p><p></p><p>It's similar to the 'counter-spatial barrier' manifestation of Suhao's offensive ability to pass through his body.</p><p></p><p>However, the 'counter-spatial barrier' is just a barrier, while the projection uses a large number of spatial modules stacked together, covering the entire person inside and out. At the same time, the spiritual tentacles extend, constantly maintaining spatial connectivity, while Suhao's main body can remain in this 'transmitted' and 'untransmitted' critical state for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This was inspired by the 'source' of the critical point between 'mass' and 'energy' that Suhao gained.</p><p></p><p>He named this state the 'second-level space'.</p><p></p><p>As long as Suhao is in the 'second-level space' state, his silhouette can be seen, but his location cannot be locked on.</p><p></p><p>If the location is unknown, how can an attack be realized? Even illusory abilities won't work. Unless... there are curse abilities similar to the Seven Arrows Spell?</p><p></p><p>He walked around, letting Fengcheng and various source devices attack him, but to no avail, having a great time.</p><p></p><p>Making Yashan and Fengcheng very envious.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, based on their current spatial technique cultivation, they are far from reaching this level. Not only can they not reach the 'second-level space', including Yashan, they haven't even mastered the 'counter-spatial barrier'. This made Suhao exclaim that he should not have held back his 【Precognition】.</p><p></p><p>However, although Suhao taught Yashan and Fengcheng spatial techniques, each person's understanding and comprehension of space is different. Yashan and Fengcheng's perception of space cannot be exactly the same as Suhao's.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it is this difference that causes the same skill to produce different effects when used by different people.</p><p></p><p>It's like the same math book, the same formula, the same test paper - different people will get different scores.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that Yashan and Fengcheng's understanding of space is not deep enough. They only learned perfunctorily according to Suhao's methods, without in-depth analysis of the essence. Or perhaps, even if they understood the essence, they could not flexibly apply it.</p><p></p><p>From this, it seems that for Yashan and Fengcheng to master the 'second-level space' skill, they will need much more time.</p><p></p><p>However, once a celestial cultivator masters the teleportation technique, in most cases they will be able to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, on the rugged small path leading to Huaishui Town, a small convoy of three vehicles was traveling abnormally bumpy towards Huaishui Town.</p><p></p><p>The birdsong and insect chirping from the woods on both sides, accompanied by feeble curses and complaints, formed a stark contrast.</p><p></p><p>This small convoy consisted of two horse-drawn carriages and a new model small car designed by the former Changqing Factory. The exterior was lavishly decorated, carved with various ferocious and mighty beasts, and presented an overall dark golden hue, exuding a noble quality everywhere.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment it was covered in dust and mud, as if it had repeatedly waded through a muddy swamp. The unintended glimpses of gold only made it look more distinctive.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of hellish place is this, is it even inhabitable? That 'Star Squad' actually lives in a place like this?" A resigned question came from the new model small car.</p><p></p><p>Through the rear window, you could see a man with braided hair wearing a golden-white robe, following the bumpy movements of the car, shaking his head, looking miserable, constantly cursing, as if this could make him feel better.</p><p></p><p>The driver, dressed in a suit-like uniform, was not driving very smoothly either, occasionally bouncing up and hitting the roof.</p><p></p><p>Before departure, the driver had repeatedly suggested to his master, the Prince, not to take this precious small car to Huaishui Town, and that the best way would be to ride horses.</p><p></p><p>But the Prince flatly refused, saying: "This is to recruit guards, how can I win over those rural sorcerers without this fashionable and prestigious limited edition small car?"</p><p></p><p>Since the Prince said so, as a servant, he had no right to say anything more. The Prince cared greatly about face, any loss of face was something he would rather suffer than do.</p><p></p><p>Such as riding horses, having other source sorcerers use their abilities to carry him, taking an airplane... Of course, the reason the Prince was unwilling to take an airplane, because of his fear of heights, was something the driver would not mention.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Prince insisted on showing off in his newly acquired exclusive small car to display the might of a Prince.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing the Prince cursing, the driver had to suppress his disdain and try to smile and agree: "It should be around here that they live. It's a remote rural area, this road is a bit bumpy, but it's already very good that the car can pass through smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Oh, by the way, it's called the 'Fengshanyanwang Star Squad', known as the 'Lucky Star Squad'. You mustn't get the name wrong, Your Highness, otherwise we won't be able to show our respect for them."</p><p></p><p>The Prince cursed loudly: "Nonsense, me, the Prince, coming in person to this godforsaken place to recruit them, isn't that enough to show our respect? If I didn't see that they had some ability, would I come in person?"</p><p></p><p>The driver agreed: "Indeed, it is a great honor to have Your Highness come in person to recruit them. The Lucky Star Squad must be overjoyed to hear of your intentions and will undoubtedly join us without hesitation to become the noble guards of the royal household."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Prince's expression eased slightly.</p><p></p><p>The driver continued: "However, we can't say this in front of them. The young people of the Lucky Star Squad all care about face. Although they'll be delighted in their hearts, on the surface they may hesitate, so you must remember to give them a way out when you meet them."</p><p></p><p>The Prince said disdainfully: "Did I need you to tell me that? Just watch me when we get there, it won't take long for them to obey my every word. They're just some ignorant commoners after all! Besides having the luck to awaken as powerful source sorcerers, what other abilities do they have? Take away their source sorcerer status, and they're just ignorant people.</p><p></p><p>It's not like I haven't recruited sorcerers like this before. After revealing my princely title, which one of them didn't come wagging their tails like a dog, unwilling to leave? Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The driver said: "I'm just afraid these sorcerers won't recognize Your Highness's honorable title of 'Prince of the 49th Generation'!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince said: "You make a good point, Little Box. I'll have to make my identity clear when we get there."</p><p></p><p>Little Box the driver didn't say much more. He also felt that with the Prince personally recruiting them, few could resist the temptation of directly rising to the wealthy class.</p><p></p><p>Source sorcerers are also human, they too pursue wealth and glory! Given the opportunity to live the coveted 'upper class' life, few would refuse, even if it meant being somewhat restricted. Besides, who in this world doesn't live with restrictions?</p><p></p><p>The Prince fell silent for a while, unable to bear the bumps, and started cursing loudly again. When he was too tired to curse, he asked dejectedly: "About how much longer until we reach that town?"</p><p></p><p>The driver Little Box said: "At this speed, probably another day."</p><p></p><p>"Another day???" The Prince started cursing loudly again.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Prince, have never suffered such an ordeal. If those so-called Star Squad sorcerers don't meet my expectations, they'll be in for it! Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>A chill went down Little Box's back. This Prince was no kind soul - those who displeased him all became various kinds of playthings. He had played countless cruel games one could imagine.</p><p></p><p>Little Box hoped the Lucky Star Squad would be lucky this time and not make an unwise choice. Otherwise, no one could save them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, when Suhao returned home to rest, he saw Astar's letter, asking him, Yashan and Fengcheng to meet at the town entrance early the next morning to discuss an important matter.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually tossed the note, and it turned into drifting ashes disappearing into the air. The big dog sniffed and couldn't help letting out a big sneeze.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the three of them arrived at the usual spot to find Astar, Awang, Zhizhu and others already waiting.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked: "Astar, what important matter did you want to discuss, to be so solemn about it?"</p><p></p><p>Astar glanced around and gestured: "Let's go somewhere else to talk."</p>

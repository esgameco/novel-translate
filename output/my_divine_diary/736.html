        <h1>Chapter 736</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After being equipped with an 'external brain', the brain structures of Suhao and Yashan became somewhat different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Their brain structures were divided into three parts.</p><p></p><p>The innermost layer was their original brain, which was currently the main core of their thinking;</p><p></p><p>The outermost layer was the external brain, which had a special neural structure. When combined, it allowed the human brain to be greatly amplified, even breaking through the limits of being human, to a state that could no longer be described as 'genius'.</p><p></p><p>In Suhao's view, even the 'supernaturally skilled' deities in myths were no more than this.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly redundant brain structure was not redundant at all. Instead, it made them insatiable, wishing their entire body could be composed of neural networks...</p><p></p><p>However, this was reality!</p><p></p><p>For intelligence to function, it still needed the cooperation of other structures.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Yashan adapted quickly and found a way to train the 'external brain' - spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After various attempts, they found that spiritual cultivation had an even greater effect on developing the external brain than doing all kinds of mathematical thinking exercises.</p><p></p><p>Not only did spiritual cultivation have a powerful effect on developing the external brain, but it also greatly amplified their spiritual power that had been stagnant for many years.</p><p></p><p>Originally, transmitting objects of large volume required the cooperation of two people, such as when they transmitted the 'Leap' asteroid to smash a large asteroid years ago.</p><p></p><p>But now, either Suhao or Yashan could complete this task alone. If their spiritual power continued growing, perhaps Suhao could really stuff an entire planet directly into the small world in the future...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A year later, after the two had digested the amplification the external brain brought to their spiritual power, the growth of their spiritual power once again fell into a slow stagnation, approaching its current limit.</p><p></p><p>However, for Suhao, this was not really a limit. Having achieved such a tremendous amplification by connecting just one thousand neural modules was already beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>As long as he continued connecting more external brains, he could continue strengthening himself until he could no longer add more external brains - that would be the true limit.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's power had grown to a level that was difficult to quantify by any single standard.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing a planet, he could do almost anything he wanted.</p><p></p><p>There were two things constraining his abilities: one was the seemingly infinitely vast spatial distance, and the other was that the energy he could control had an upper limit.</p><p></p><p>But the more it progressed, the more Suhao had a feeling that energy might no longer be the standard for measuring strength in the future.</p><p></p><p>For example, with his current 'source' as large as a planet, he could convert it into energy at the fastest speed and control it. But so what?</p><p></p><p>Suhao had installed a stable 'small world' in the 'second-level space', called the 'second-level world'.</p><p></p><p>Inside the second-level world, Suhao asked Yashan, "Can you handle the second connection to the external brain yourself?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Yashan planned to connect two thousand neural modules of the external brain all at once, taking one thousand as a 'block' unit, so two blocks.</p><p></p><p>If this time was successful, he would add more next time.</p><p></p><p>When doing experiments, one must have the mentality of an experimenter. Without going to extremes, how could one know their limits?</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "No need to trouble you, Old Master Wei. I feel great now, 'omnipotent' is no joke! Just embedding two thousand neural modules, I can now embed a hundred at the same time effortlessly. It'll be done very soon."</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Alright then! Begin!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan then lay down and directly wrapped a large number of 'neural modules' into his body, gradually transferring them to his brain. At the same time, he controlled the embedding of one hundred neural modules without any errors, appearing very dexterous and at ease.</p><p></p><p>As he said, the embedding of the two blocks of external brain was completed soon.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "How do you feel?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan woke from his trance, excitedly saying, "Another success, Old Master Wei! All my abilities have been greatly amplified again, no less than the feeling of the first external brain connection. And this amplification is still continuing.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Wei, allow me to adapt for two days first. If there's no problem after two days, then you can connect to the external brain again."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Two days passed, and Yashan's condition became even better.</p><p></p><p>Suhao observed Yashan's consciousness information in the Pinball Space and found that compared to before connecting to the external brain, Yashan's consciousness information had now increased fivefold.</p><p></p><p>What Suhao did not expect was that merely increasing some neural components could elevate a person's intelligence to this degree - inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>It was like comparing a person with an IQ of 90 to one with 120. It seemed only a third more, but the actual gap had to be described as 'a hundredfold'...</p><p></p><p>Suhao marveled, "The Mother Bug was able to evolve this unique and miraculous brain structure, just thinking about it seems incredible.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, having so many 'small selves', my thinking ability is not only not chaotic at all, but has become even clearer...</p><p></p><p>Yashan's consciousness information is the same. Although it has become enormously massive and abnormally active, the essential operating rules are still the same as before, without much change."</p><p></p><p>In other words, this process of change was only an amplification of brain ability and did not change a person's way of perceiving the world.</p><p></p><p>"Since it doesn't change my core self, then I'll keep stacking on external brains to try out the limits of thinking!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Suhao began connecting himself to two blocks of external brain in the second-level world.</p><p></p><p>When the activation was completed, he had a whole new feeling again.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all his abilities had been amplified once more.</p><p></p><p>Judging from himself, a mature Mother Bug with nearly tens of billions of neural modules must be an extremely monstrous existence...</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "When we captured the mature Mother Bug, it probably looked at us the way one would look at the intellectually disabled...</p><p></p><p>Haha! The pity is, despite having intelligence like the Mother Bug, it lacked corresponding knowledge and could not convert its intelligence into real strength and ability, ultimately being freely trampled by a lower intelligence human like me. How pitiful."</p><p></p><p>After adapting for a few days, Suhao entered the Pinball Space and observed his consciousness information, finding that compared to before, it had now swelled to nearly ten times the previous size, an enormous presence in the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>As for Yashan's consciousness information volume, it was approaching one-fifth of his own. As for Feng Cheng...</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have one-fifth of Yashan's, looking quite pitiful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After connecting to the external brain, Suhao and Yashan entered the tedious 'spiritual cultivation' again.</p><p></p><p>For convenience, Suhao combined the 'Blood Qi Consciousness Power' method, the 'Spiritual Tentacle Cultivation Method', and 'Immortal Spirit Thought' into a single 'spiritual cultivation' method that covered all three, called the 'Starlight Guidance'.</p><p></p><p>Another year passed.</p><p></p><p>The two's spiritual power surged again to reach a relative bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, Yashan planned to go all out this time, connecting seven blocks of external brain at once!</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Yashan, don't you want to reconsider? Doing this does carry some risk."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "No problem, Old Master Wei. Don't you still trust my luck? I've always felt that I might be the second luckiest person in this universe. There'll absolutely be no issues."</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "You still believe in things like luck? I stopped believing in that a long time ago..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed foolishly, "Since Old Master Wei doesn't believe it, then I won't believe it either! Even without luck, I'm still quite confident there won't be any problems. If I sense anything wrong, I can cut the connection to the external brain at any time, so it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't persuade him further, only saying, "Alright, cut the connection immediately if you sense anything wrong."</p><p></p><p>This time there were many external brains being connected, but it didn't take Yashan much longer than before to complete the connection.</p><p></p><p>Test!</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>Yashan was entranced by the upgrade again, unable to help but murmur, "So wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Suhao finally relax, letting out a long breath of relief, thinking to himself, "Truly metamorphosing! The metamorphosis of the brain will drive the progress of my research, and the increased research progress will in turn enhance the brain's metamorphosis. This repeated cycle is a virtuous one!"</p><p></p><p>To give a simple example: Brain enhancement would give him higher wisdom and research ability, while stronger research ability would give him more ways to bring the knowledge and power gained in this world to the next.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he was still worried that without Mother Bugs in the next world, he wouldn't be able to obtain the corresponding special 'neural modules' to build an external brain.</p><p></p><p>Now he didn't need to worry anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because he was confident he could manifest anything he wanted using the 'source'.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it won't be long before I truly become a creator!"</p>

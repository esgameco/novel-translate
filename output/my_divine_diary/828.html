        <h1>Chapter 828</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao rarely procrastinated on things. Basically, as soon as he thought of something, he would immediately do it.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, as soon as he obtained the location information of the two deities, he took the opportunity to access the 'Galactic Network', dispersing a large number of his minor selves to search for the main bodies of the two deities.</p><p></p><p>As long as he found their main bodies in the 'Galactic Network', Su Hao could immediately teleport over and capture their main bodies into his small world.</p><p></p><p>After that, wouldn't he be free to study them as he pleased?</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Su Hao's numerous minor selves infiltrated the corresponding sea areas, delving deep into the trenches, almost turning the designated areas upside down.</p><p></p><p>Yet they did not find any abnormal 'Ten-Colored Plates'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's brows gradually furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's look for the main body of the Dark Night Deity - Eternal, hidden on the orbital satellites."</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how thoroughly Su Hao searched all the orbital satellites, he could not find Eternal's main body on any of them.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the 'Ten-Colored Plates' look similar to mud, and I overlooked them? That's impossible. The information shows that the Ten-Colored Plates are living beings that emit multicolored radiance, so I couldn't have missed them. Then, did I make a mistake in analyzing the consciousness information? That's not right either. Based on the reference of other consciousness information, the analysis should be accurate.</p><p></p><p>So there's only one possibility: After breaking off contact with their avatars, these two deities cautiously changed their hiding places."</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Su Hao finally gained a new understanding of the 'shrewdness' of the deities in this world. To be able to metamorphose into deities and live for so long, it wasn't solely due to luck.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said helplessly, "Forget it, let's talk about it later! They can't run away anyway. I'll wake up Yashan and Fengcheng first, and then we'll discuss it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Longzhou was not at all like what Su Hao had imagined. Initially, when the dragon mother Shadu mentioned it, he thought the so-called Longzhou was just a slightly larger island, similar to the 'Dragon Islands' described in various stories, where all the dragon clans lived crowded together on a small island, with giant dragons flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the reality was quite different.</p><p></p><p>Quite the opposite, in fact. Longzhou was an immense continent, with many dragon clans living on it. But compared to the vast expanse of the continent, they seemed extremely sparse. The dragon mother flew with the three young dragons for four days, only catching a distant glimpse of two red-golden giant dragons flying past in the distance.</p><p></p><p>According to the dragon mother Shadu, most of Longzhou was a desolate plateau, with only a few special plants and animals barely surviving, almost a dead land.</p><p></p><p>And deep within this desolate continent, there was a vast basin that the giant dragons called the Ancestral Land, a place of an entirely different world, full of lush greenery and vitality.</p><p></p><p>The terrain of the Ancestral Land was very peculiar, as if a giant had forcibly stamped out a huge pit in the plateau.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by towering, sheer cliffs that formed a massive circle, the center was a lush plain. Compared to the overall desolation of Longzhou, it was a miraculous land.</p><p></p><p>And it was on this land of cliffs and plains that the giant dragons were born and had lived and multiplied since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the dragon mother's journey was to return to this Ancestral Land, for she believed that the one she was seeking, Muti, was there.</p><p></p><p>As the dragon mother delved deeper into Longzhou, they encountered more and more giant dragons.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu flew on, explaining to the three young dragons, "Do you see, children, those giant dragons with even more massive bodies and entirely black in color? They are called Black Dragons, generally as powerful as us Golden Dragons, but not of the same clan.</p><p></p><p>Although both called the Giant Dragon Clan, our natures are different, and the relationship between our two clans is not very good either.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as we don't get too close to them, the Black Dragons won't actively provoke us, for this is the agreement made by our Heavenly Deity Lord Nati and the Black Dragon Clan's Thunder God Lord Gu. No one would dare violate the orders of the deities.</p><p></p><p>So children, what you need to be wary of are not the Black Dragons, but our own Golden Dragon clansmen, for they are the ones who may provoke us for no reason."</p><p></p><p>Just as the dragon mother Shadu finished speaking, a red-golden giant dragon flew towards them from afar, flying alongside the dragon mother.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the dragon mother Shadu tried to evade it, she could not shake it off.</p><p></p><p>The red-golden giant dragon split its mouth open in a grin and said to the dragon mother Shadu, "Hey! Beautiful lady, I feel like I've seen you somewhere before. I must have seen you. A beauty like you, I definitely wouldn't forget. Since this is our second meeting, why don't we get acquainted and become friends?"</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu said directly, "Sorry, I already have a husband. I don't need friends."</p><p></p><p>The red-golden giant dragon was unfazed, saying, "What does being friends have to do with anything? And even if the beautiful lady has a husband, I wouldn't mind. Let me introduce myself. My name is Tabo Dossen. What about you? What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu flew to the side, clearly not wanting to engage with this red-golden giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>But he clung to her like a leech, refusing to leave. "Beautiful lady, where are you hurrying off to? I can accompany you and chat. It's on my way too. Are those three little cuties on your back your children? You can tell from a young age that they're extraordinary. When they grow up, they'll definitely be as beautiful and charming as you..."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu was exasperated, but with three children in tow, she couldn't be too rough.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao opened his eyes and said to the dragon mother Shadu, "Dragon Mother Shadu, shall I punch him? Don't worry, I won't kill him."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu's eyes lit up. "Good, Leian Oakes. You've learned the secret to better survival. Go ahead and punch him far away!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young dragon on the mother's back threatening to punch him, the red-golden giant dragon burst out laughing. "Pfft—Little guy, you want to punch me? Hahaha! That's just too funny..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his paw and gently swatted to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The red-golden giant dragon's cheek was deeply caved in, its entire head knocked sideways by the tremendous force. Immediately after, the dragon's entire body tilted to the side as well, following the momentum of its head, and then tumbled down onto the yellow earth and sand dunes below.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" A huge cloud of dust billowed up.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother immediately flapped her wings faster, flying away from the area, and praised, "Well done, Leian, my child. You have mastered the essence of survival in the Ancestral Land. From now on, if any female dragon lusts after your beauty and bothers you, but you don't want to mate with her, just fiercely punch her away like that."</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the dragon mother stopped at the edge of a cliff.</p><p></p><p>The three young dragons jumped off the dragon mother's back, following her a few steps to the cliff's edge, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>This was the Ancestral Land where the dragon clans gathered and lived.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked to the edge of the cliff and looked out. A white mist swirled before his eyes, obscuring the depth of the basin below. Amidst the mist, a hint of green could be vaguely seen, full of vitality compared to the yellow earth and mud behind them.</p><p></p><p>"Woo-ooh—"</p><p>"Aahng—"</p><p></p><p>The long cries of various giant dragons echoed from afar. Following the sounds, one could see a few small black dots circling above the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's divine sense swept out, and a large number of life auras immediately mapped into his mind—giant dragons, flying birds, walking beasts...</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had entered a new world.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, the dragon mother Shadu said, "Let's go, children. Your father Muti is in a cliff nest not far from here. We'll see him very soon. He'll be overjoyed to see you."</p><p></p><p>Then the dragon mother led the three young dragons, flying along the cliff.</p><p></p><p>About three hours later, the dragon mother Shadu said, "We're here. It's down there. Let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could hear the suppressed excitement in the dragon mother's tone, clearly full of anticipation for this sudden reunion with her husband Muti.</p><p></p><p>She was probably envisioning Muti Sark's excited reaction upon seeing her.</p><p></p><p>The two dragons would surely embrace each other excitedly!</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the dragon mother dove down, arriving at the entrance of a huge cave and familiarly flying inside.</p><p></p><p>With his divine sense, Su Hao did indeed perceive the figure of a giant dragon within the cave. But it wasn't just one giant dragon—there were two, a male and a female, entangled together.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was puzzled and thought to himself, "Huh? Did Dragon Mother Shadu enter the wrong cave?"</p><p></p><p>But he quickly realized, "Could it be that Dragon Mother Shadu's husband is cheating? Damn, Dragon Mother Shadu brought the children from afar to catch him in the act, and caught him red-handed!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the dragon mother Shadu barged into the innermost part of the nestless cave and saw her long-yearned-for husband Muti Sark, as well as an unfamiliar red-golden female giant dragon, mating with her husband...</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shadu was simply stunned, unable to believe what her eyes were seeing.</p><p></p><p>The two mating red-golden giant dragons in the cave heard the commotion and turned their heads to look.</p><p></p><p>They saw a familiar red-golden dragon staring wide-eyed, dumbfounded, with three young dragons at her feet—two peeking curiously inside, and one with its paws crossed over its chest, watching them with great interest.</p><p></p><p>Muti Sark was also stunned, quickly realizing what had happened and inwardly cursing. He abruptly released his embrace, stood to the side, and rapidly thought of a solution to this situation.</p><p></p><p>The smaller female dragon that Muti had been holding turned her head unhappily and said, "What's wrong, my dear husband, Muti..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Muti took two steps forward, looking serious, and said to the dragon mother Shadu, "Shadu, let me explain."</p>

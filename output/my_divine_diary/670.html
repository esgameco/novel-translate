        <h1>Chapter 670</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The following actions proceeded unexpectedly smoothly. The octopus monster was unable to organize any formidable attacks, being gradually pushed back and wiped out one by one by the human military forces.</p><p></p><p>The entire octopus monster's base was firmly controlled by humans.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the manta ray-shaped spacecraft that Suhao had boarded earlier flew in from afar and landed on an open area surrounding the base. A large number of engineering vehicles drove out from the spacecraft and entered the base sphere, transporting the supplies stored inside back to the ship.</p><p></p><p>It was quite a huge harvest!</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, Captain Yan remained silent, obviously not in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>From the original team of twenty, only three were left after this battle...</p><p></p><p>Those familiar faces and laughter had disappeared forever.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not blame Suhao for acting recklessly. After all, in this battle, if not for Suhao's superhuman abilities, it was questionable whether they could have successfully captured this base.</p><p></p><p>One could say that in this battle, Suhao was the prime contributor! As for disobeying orders...being deaf had its consequences, they could settle that account after returning.</p><p></p><p>The loading process was swift, taking only two hours to transfer all the supplies onto the ship.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the other soldiers also boarded the ship after some reorganization.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble -- Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>The spacecraft powered up, slowly lifting off. The massive rear thruster spewed blue flames as it flew away, quickly breaking through the planet's atmosphere and entering space, leaving the planet behind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the spacecraft took off, Suhao finally heaved a temporary sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Which meant they were safe for now!</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know the destination of this spacecraft. But since they had entered space, the vast universe was immense, so they basically wouldn't encounter any more enemies.</p><p></p><p>Following the fragmented memories, Suhao removed his dirty armor and returned to the dormitory to freshen up. Standing in front of the mirror, he examined his appearance in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>His brown hair was very thick, each strand sticking straight up like a porcupine...</p><p></p><p>His face was firm with slightly raised eyebrows, like two unsheathed swords. Currently, his eyes were bloodshot but his gaze was steady and composed.</p><p></p><p>It was this profound gaze that elevated this otherwise unremarkable face!</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "I'll need to make some minor adjustments to my face in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at his physique, his muscles were well-defined and chiseled. </p><p></p><p>He nodded in satisfaction: "Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>After circling the small four-person dormitory, a wave of fatigue hit him and he fell straight into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>His mental powers were strong, but his physical body was still at an ordinary human level, unable to let him act recklessly. After today's high-intensity battle, he was utterly drained, from his flesh to his mind.</p><p></p><p>In no time, he was sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that since it was a four-person dormitory and he was the only one left, it was essentially a private single room for him now.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, he was woken up by Captain Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Daqiang, hurry up, the captain is personally awarding our 405 squad today. You might even get a promotion nomination, so don't mess this up!"</p><p></p><p>The captain's name was Yan Xiang, a sturdy young man with a gentle face, completely unlike the foul-mouthed captain who cursed elders on the battlefield - he seemed like two different people.</p><p></p><p>He looked to be in his early twenties, a few years older than the age of Suhao's current body, but slightly shorter than Suhao.</p><p></p><p>After washing up, Suhao followed Captain Yan and Xiaochang to the dining hall to find seats for breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, everyone they encountered looked at Suhao with admiration, like gazing at a celestial being, and smiled friendly gestures at him. An outsider would think he was some extraordinary figure.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan leaned in and quietly told Suhao with a smile: "Your heroic performance on the battlefield yesterday has spread throughout the ship! Everyone has seen the video of your combat."</p><p></p><p>The video was recorded in real-time by Suhao's armor - every suit had this function.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Captain Yan's perspective of Suhao was also recorded.</p><p></p><p>After watching the video, everyone exclaimed "monster genius!"</p><p></p><p>The "Blue Light" refers to the human homeworld, a common term everyone uses.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said: "That's right, the title of 'Human Hero' is inevitable for you. Countless movies with you as the lead will be made."</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "..."</p><p></p><p>Just for that, he became a human hero?</p><p></p><p>"Your godly marksmanship can boost the confidence of all humans. If that's not a hero, what is?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao just nodded without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang suddenly asked: "Captain, what's our current destination? Are we returning to Blue Light?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan lowered his voice: "Rumor is that our 'Yaoxing' ship was already planning to return a year ago, but after a series of setbacks, the ship's energy was nearly depleted, unable to support the return journey. So we had to take the risk of raiding the Octopus Clan's supply base to replenish energy.</p><p></p><p>Now that we've successfully obtained enough energy, it seems we're setting off to return."</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang became excited: "That's great!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said: "What's there to be excited about? Even if we leave now, it will take at least two years to arrive."</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang laughed: "Two years isn't that long."</p><p></p><p>The longer one drifts away from home, the deeper the longing for it grows.</p><p></p><p>"Two years?" The corners of Suhao's mouth curved up slightly - this was exactly what he needed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need two years, one year would suffice! Just give him one year, and he could basically recover his self-preservation abilities. In the vast universe, where couldn't he go?</p><p></p><p>Suhao was currently in the process of adapting to the language and grammar, so he couldn't interject. He quietly listened to the captain and Xiaochang's casual chat, trying to gather as much useful information as possible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao heard the captain and Xiaochang continuing to praise him about "what to do after returning", a hearty laughter came from afar.</p><p></p><p>Everyone turned towards the sound to see a short-haired youth in formal military attire walking into the dining hall, heading straight for Suhao's group.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Didn't expect to run into our hero squad!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan immediately stood up with Suhao and Xiaochang, saluting: "Colonel Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>Colonel Jiang was tall and imposing, looking extraordinarily valiant. He reached out and forcefully patted Captain Yan's shoulder, praising: "Yan Xiang, your 405 squad did a great job this time! Made me proud, hahaha! Well done, well done!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan's sturdy physique was actually jolted by Colonel Jiang's pats, grimacing in pain.</p><p></p><p>Then Colonel Jiang turned to Suhao curiously: "So you're the 'Explosive Eye Marksman'? Don't look like much, but that gaze ain't bad, got the air of a great general!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "..."</p><p></p><p>What did he mean by "don't look like much"? Is that how you compliment someone?</p><p></p><p>This face clearly didn't match his demeanor anymore.</p><p></p><p>Suhao decided that after cultivating to an elite martial artist, he would remold his facial features.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao not respond, Colonel Jiang thought he was just too nervous to speak in front of him. He patted Suhao's shoulder lightly: "Not bad, young man. Keep at it, the future belongs to you youngsters! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan was dumbfounded, feeling his shoulder go numb from the pat, inwardly complaining: "Why use so much force patting me? And aren't you also a youngster yourself?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, an aide came running over in a hurry and said in a low voice: "There's an anomaly with the Yaoxing's signal, suspected of being locked onto. The captain is calling you to the conference hall immediately."</p><p></p><p>Colonel Jiang's expression changed abruptly: "What?"</p><p></p><p>Then he immediately ran out.</p><p></p><p>Leaving everyone looking at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang turned to his captain, puzzled: "I was still waiting for Colonel Jiang to pat my shoulder! Why did he suddenly leave?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan's expression turned solemn. After thinking for a moment, he shook his head: "It's nothing, just continue your breakfast!"</p><p></p><p>Although the aide spoke softly, Suhao still heard about the "Yaoxing being locked onto", not knowing what it meant but feeling it didn't bode well.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought: "Is there going to be a spaceship battle with the Octopus Clan next?"</p><p></p><p>If so, once the ship explodes, he could safely reincarnate to the next world...</p><p></p><p>Only then did Suhao understand what it meant to be "in the same boat".</p><p></p><p>The award ceremony was temporarily cancelled!</p><p></p><p>No, even being cautious doesn't guarantee survival. After all, I currently have no ability to survive in space.</p><p></p><p>One year... I may not have one year left! What should I do?</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered, realizing the original step-by-step plan was no longer feasible.</p><p></p><p>"I can only take a risky shortcut!"</p><p></p><p>After making this decision, Suhao immediately formulated a "shortcut" plan: "To gain survival abilities, I need to meet three conditions: one, core composite runes and radar perception; two, psychic tentacles and spatial abilities like 'Blink', 'Teleport', 'Miniature World'; three, obtain sufficient sources for the 'Focus System'..."</p><p></p><p>"Give me one month! Just one month!"</p><p></p><p>The timeframe was reduced from the original one year to just one month - Suhao had already pushed it to the limit!</p><p></p><p>If this world didn't even want to give him one month...</p>

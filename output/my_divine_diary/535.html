        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao's sword strike had a range of over a thousand meters, which was the limit of this minor spell.</p><p></p><p>After clearing the area in front of him, it was not over yet. Suhao unleashed two more Dawn Swords, cutting down all the willow trees in a 360-degree radius around them.</p><p></p><p>Since he was experimenting, he might as well do it thoroughly, otherwise how could he collect data?</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, all the willow trees within a thousand-meter radius around the squad were cut down to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Axing murmured, "This level of power, he must at least be an advanced Source Mage!"</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "But the key is that Ayang only became an official Source Mage less than a month ago, he hasn't even been certified as a junior Source Mage yet."</p><p></p><p>"This...can a genius really achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>"Could Ayang be an Ominous Source Mage?"</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I think it's very possible."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh--"</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored his two stunned teammates, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the felled willow trees, waiting for subsequent changes while preparing to deal with any contingencies.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the fallen willows began to change. The drooping willow branches rose up, pointing towards the sky, swaying left and right like roadside weeds blowing in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually tossed out a yellow weasel, which collided with the upright willow branches, triggering the disaster. In no time, it died with its belly empty.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "It seems the willow trees are just a carrier of the disaster, not the only one. Without the willows, the disaster can still form through other means. In other words, whether this willow grove exists or not is irrelevant. To resolve the disaster, the core must be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Axing looked at the mess in front of him and cracked an ugly smile, "Still want to try?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, let's try again. I plan to clear away these fallen willows and see the result. Axing, you can blow away any willow branches that fly this way later."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two looked at Suhao in shock, not knowing what he planned to do next.</p><p></p><p>Suhao gathered a bit of power, then casually pointed with one finger.</p><p></p><p>'Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A blinding white light flashed, like the sun falling to earth, bathing the surroundings in daylight. The ground beneath the three violently shook as a powerful shockwave hit, accompanied by a deafening roar.</p><p></p><p>Countless broken branches and dirt shot out, blown away by Axing's ability.</p><p></p><p>When everything settled, Awang took out an illumination bead and had Axing send it up to get a clear view of the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The explosion site was completely transformed - the previously fallen willows were gone, leaving a 200-meter crater in the center, with all the willows around the crater cleared away by the powerful shockwave.</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's mouths hung open, unable to close them for a long time. The shock in their hearts was simply inexpressible!</p><p></p><p>If such destructive power was unleashed by an advanced Blast Source Mage, they might have thought it normal. But for it to come from the fingertips of a 14-year-old boy, it seemed inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't help wondering: "Just what kind of cultivation has Ayang undergone, and what level can he reach?"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention what the two were thinking, Suhao, whose attention was fixed on the crater, gradually furrowed his brow: "More willow trees are growing out."</p><p></p><p>Inside and outside the crater, the soil churned as tender willow seedlings broke through, swaying as they rapidly grew into towering willow trees, countless drooping branches swaying in the increasingly fierce night wind.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Axing couldn't help but ask: "Still want to try, Ayang?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head, "No need, I think I understand the principle behind this ominous disaster now."</p><p></p><p>In Suhao's view, the ominous disaster was like a noise source constantly emitting sound waves in all directions, with the range of these waves being the disaster's area of effect.</p><p></p><p>Within this special 'noise' area, once certain conditions were met, corresponding mechanisms would trigger, like people becoming vexed and going mad upon hearing the noise.</p><p></p><p>If the mechanism producing the 'noise' was understood, one could avoid being disturbed by it, like plugging one's ears!</p><p></p><p>However, rampant destruction within the noise area would not truly resolve it - the noise source itself had to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The ominous incident called 'No Escape' likely worked by activating and driving out anything 'hidden' that was struck by the willow branches.</p><p></p><p>This 'hidden' thing included but was not limited to things concealed within one's skin.</p><p></p><p>If you can't see it from the outside, doesn't that count as hidden?</p><p></p><p>Viewing the willow branches as whips lashing and driving out anything cowering in hiding out of fear made sense.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it through this way, it seemed quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Let's go! We need to quickly find the disaster's core."</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "This willow grove is too large, it won't be easy to find the core."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Since we understand the general structure of the disaster, finding the approximate location of the core isn't difficult."</p><p></p><p>Axing also nodded, "That's right, the closer we get to the core, the stronger the disaster's intensity will be. We just need to head towards where the intensity increases."</p><p></p><p>Awang looked around and said helplessly, "But how can I tell which area has a higher intensity?"</p><p></p><p>Axing confidently said, "Just now when Ayang blasted that crater, I noticed the willow trees grew fastest in one direction, and slowest in the opposite direction. So the direction of the core is obvious!"</p><p></p><p>Awang looked at Axing in amazement, "No wonder you're the team leader, you didn't just rashly come in here. Looks like you had a certain level of confidence."</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed heartily, "Of course. I'm going to become the scourge of ominous disasters in the future."</p><p></p><p>With that, he took the lead and headed in the direction he identified.</p><p></p><p>The night wind grew stronger and stronger, wildly whipping the willow branches around, leaving no place for anyone caught in it to hide.</p><p></p><p>The entire willow grove seemed to come alive, transforming into countless giant tentacle monsters, becoming extremely violent. Branches rustled everywhere with "swishing" sounds as powerful branches lashed out indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>Axing waved his palm, slicing apart all the surrounding branches which fell and were blown far away.</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "Axing, why don't we just fly up? If we get struck, it'll be bad."</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head without a thought, "No way, what if as soon as we take off, all your organs run away? Then we'll be yelling 'So high! Falling down!' one by one. I can't put them back in for you."</p><p></p><p>Awang's hair stood on end and he didn't bring it up again, sticking close behind the two.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Suhao pointed to one side, "Axing, Awang, it seems your little Tangtang is over there! Want to go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Neither of them thought twice before heading in the direction Suhao pointed.</p><p></p><p>After walking for about half an hour, the three vaguely heard crying sounds ahead and quickened their pace.</p><p></p><p>"So scared! I want to run away!"</p><p></p><p>A few bloody 'little fellows' ran past the trio in a panic. Axing and Awang were stunned, exchanging a glance as an ominous feeling welled up.</p><p></p><p>"Tangtang!" Awang called out anxiously, about to run forward when the quick-handed Axing grabbed him.</p><p></p><p>Axing angrily shouted, "Awang, have you lost your mind? Calm down."</p><p></p><p>Awang turned back, eyes red, "Axing, let's go check it out, please."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Suhao's light voice came, "It seems your Tangtang is fine, but her two teammates don't look too good."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he casually pointed with one finger.</p><p></p><p>'Minor - Dawn Sword'!</p><p>'Small Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>Explosions rang out one after another as severed willow trees were flung to the sides, opening up a wide path in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Axing also cooperated by blowing away all the remaining branches and leaves before dashing forward, "Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Awang saw his beloved Tangtang, as well as her two teammates - team leader Biqiand member Jiangji.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Biqi waved his twin greatswords, his body flickering with electric light as he swiftly maneuvered through the willow grove.</p><p></p><p>"Shshshsh!"</p><p></p><p>Azure sword arcs flashed as the surrounding willows slowly toppled over, clearing an open area in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Jiangji lay on the ground, struggling to crawl up but unable to. He could only clutch Tangtang's hand and plead, "Tangtang, please, go help me find what belongs to me! I don't want to die!"</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in Tangtang's eyes as she bit her lip, saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>Jiangji: "Why won't you help me? Aren't you my teammate? You've changed...after I was so good to you before!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he started loudly cursing with increasingly vile language, despair growing thicker in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Biqi walked back over, slapping Jiangji hard across the face, "Shut up! If you're going to die, don't embarrass yourself!"</p><p></p><p>But from Biqi's pale face and purple lips, he was clearly barely holding on himself.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Suhao's trio revealed themselves nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Tangtang!"</p><p></p><p>Biqi whipped around, shielding Tangtang and Jiangji behind him. Upon seeing it was Suhao and the others, he couldn't help but relax, his expression blank as he said, "Come to gloat?"</p><p></p><p>Axing looked at the three's state and shook his head, "Can't let those willow branches strike you, otherwise the ominous effect will trigger."</p><p></p><p>Biqi tightly gripped his greatsword, unwilling to accept it, "I know, but it's too late."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere fell into a strained silence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiangji's half-dead appearance made Axing immediately understand, and he asked, "What about you?"</p><p></p><p>Biqi was silent for a moment before replying, "Heart and lungs are still there."</p>

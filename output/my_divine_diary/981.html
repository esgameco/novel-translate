        <h1>Chapter 981</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The four people, including Cloud Celestial King, all gathered around and examined this coin.</p><p></p><p>On the front of the coin was a double-ring imprint, and on the back was a symbol of a huge gate tower.</p><p></p><p>It looked like just a very ordinary coin, with nothing particularly special about it.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang pointed at the coin and asked, "Was this used by the Goddess of Fortune?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Celestial King asked, "Is the Goddess of Fortune beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Old Cloud King, aren't you watching enough videos every day? Still want to see the Goddess of Fortune? Aren't you afraid of getting struck by lightning! Although this coin is called the 'Lost Coin of the Goddess of Fortune', it doesn't mean it's something actually lost by the real Goddess of Fortune. It means this coin possesses a miraculous power of fortune that can offset the bearer's luck or misfortune, maintaining relative peace."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said, "So you mean, as long as one possesses such a coin, one doesn't need to worry about misfortune befalling them?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Not only do you not need to worry about misfortune, you also don't need to hope for good luck to come."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang exclaimed for a while, then suddenly asked, "I remember Mr. Jia Wei seemed to have mentioned mastering a skill called the 'Law of Fortune and Misfortune'. Could this have been made by Mr. Jia Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled, "There's over an 80% chance it was made by Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>The three of Lyu Yijiang gasped, "So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>While Cloud Celestial King muttered, "It does seem quite profound."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed, "Just 'quite profound'? That's why I said your spiritual roots are shallow, unwilling to believe in others' great power. These three are much better than you in this regard."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang asked again, "Then how can we obtain the 'Coin of the Goddess of Fortune'?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei knew that thousands of years ago, many new "crossers'" systems no longer had the "mall" function, but he still asked, "Do your study machines have a mall? If there's a mall, you can directly purchase it from there, one coin for a hundred points."</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other and shook their heads, "There's only something called the Library and the Cultivation Room, nothing else."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei waved his hand, "Then there's no way, at this stage it's almost impossible for you to get a pass. Without a pass, I can't take you to the Infinite Lands, that's the rule."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's expression dropped, "Ah? Then what should we do, we want to go to the Infinite Lands to cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>Just when they looked worried, Cong Renfei suddenly showed a sunny smile, "Ah, it seems I can buy a few passes, and I have just enough money too."</p><p></p><p>The three immediately looked at Cong Renfei with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "But the passes are too expensive, I can't bear to spend that much."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang said, "Cong Renfei, can you lend them to us first? We'll pay you back."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei waved his hand, "I don't need you to borrow from me. You three fight me, if you do well, I'll give each of you a pass and take you to the Infinite Lands, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other, not understanding what "do well" meant.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked at Cloud Celestial King and asked, "Old Cloud King, do you want to go take a look at the Infinite Lands too?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Celestial King waved his hand, "No need, although this place is small, I'm used to it and don't want to move. You youngsters can go play by yourselves."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the experimental base, Su Hao casually opened his palm, and a cluster of "source" was immediately transformed into "yuan qi", floating in front of Su Hao, its faint glow illuminating his face in a pale white color.</p><p></p><p>"It took me over two years to successfully transform the source into yuan qi. Yuan qi is truly a miraculous substance. If it weren't for the inspiration I got two years ago while researching the parasitic state of yuan qi, I might still be clueless about transforming it now."</p><p></p><p>Yuan qi is an extremely special parasitic substance, not belonging to any element in the atomic sequence, as if independent from ordinary matter, similar to the soul force that cannot be directly converted from the source.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, yuan qi does not react with any substance, as if it is a loophole in the material world.</p><p></p><p>Just like...an imaginary number.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao viewed substances as numbers on a number line, with elements being integers, compounds being fractions, and mixtures being irrational numbers. He created a special reference table with different data representing different substances to facilitate converting specific substances from the source.</p><p></p><p>As long as he operated precisely, he could use the source to turn all the data on this "number line" into a specific substance.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as it was matter, he could analyze it and incorporate it into this number line for easy conversion later.</p><p></p><p>The current problem was that he found this parasitic substance "yuan qi" was not on the number line, meaning "yuan qi" was not part of the "real numbers".</p><p></p><p>If not a real number, then what is it?</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao decisively changed his perspective and stopped viewing "yuan qi" through his old lens. Two years later today, he finally succeeded in transforming the source into yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>"Then...what is this stuff?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his other hand, and soon obtained an orb of purple light, followed by cyan, blue, yellow, red...appearing one after another.</p><p></p><p>These were substances he obtained by slightly changing some variables after successfully transforming the source into "yuan qi".</p><p></p><p>Their properties were similar to yuan qi, all being parasitic substances that could perfectly integrate into various materials and coexist.</p><p></p><p>But the differences were also quite significant, like the difference between oxygen and nitrogen - although both gases, their properties were not the same.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "It seems I've discovered another incredible material world. I just don't know what use these things have. I think they definitely aren't just for strengthening the body."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while without a solution, Su Hao wasn't in a hurry, "No need to rush, I'll first try transforming all the different types of 'yuan qi', compare and study them separately. I think eventually there will be results."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao put down his experiment and called over Ya Shan and Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>"Ya Shan, Feng Cheng, do you still remember that martial arts planet we encountered over two years ago?"</p><p></p><p>The two nodded. At the time, they were just a bit curious and didn't feel that world was particularly special. But now that the Old Master was personally calling them over, they realized there might have been some special discovery.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I've successfully transformed the 'yuan qi' from the martial arts planet using the source. But after deeper research, I found that the so-called 'yuan qi' is far simpler than what we saw. This may involve deeper secrets of this universe."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao passed his research materials to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng quickly browsed through and said in surprise, "It seems the yuan qi on the martial arts planet is just one small category, and there's still a huge category of substances yet to be discovered. Just what is this stuff?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I want to introduce yuan qi to the Infinite Lands and let it develop freely. When the usage of yuan qi reaches a large enough scale, perhaps the hidden properties within yuan qi will be revealed."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng again sensed their own ignorance...</p><p></p><p>Previously, they almost thought they were almost omnipotent in the universe. Now, the arrogance that had just barely arisen in their hearts was instantly and forcefully suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng thought inwardly, "The less you understand, the easier it is to ignore your own ignorance. I didn't expect I would also be unable to break free from this mindset."</p><p></p><p>They looked at Su Hao again and couldn't help marveling inwardly, "The Old Master is still the most formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Old Master, how do we introduce yuan qi to the Infinite Lands? Shall the three of us transform it from the source?"</p><p></p><p>If so, they would probably have to work non-stop in the base. According to Ya Shan's estimate, even with all their avatars working together, it would take at least a thousand years to barely meet the demand of the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head, "No need. The black hole in the star system where the martial arts planet is located is constantly spewing out a vast amount of yuan qi. We just need to establish world passages on the surrounding planets to channel a large amount of yuan qi into the Infinite Lands. After many years, the yuan qi will naturally integrate into the Infinite Lands."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Old Master."</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing didn't require Su Hao's personal involvement. As long as he mentioned it to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, the countless disciples of the Infinite Gate and Twin Sword Sects could quickly complete the task.</p>

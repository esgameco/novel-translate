        <h1>Chapter 794</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time passes slowly.</p><p></p><p>The boundless universe seems unchanged, still dotted with stars as before.</p><p></p><p>But in the subtleties, drastic changes occur incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Countless civilizations rise and fall, countless brilliances of wisdom burst forth, even illuminating a patch of the universe.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, they inevitably extinguish, and then eternal darkness.</p><p></p><p>Almost all intelligent life explores one question: What kind of life can be eternal?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the depths of the universe, there is already an answer.</p><p></p><p>In the haze, Suhao's consciousness gradually revived.</p><p></p><p>He first perceived his own body, a warm current surging from all over into his brain, making his whole body comfortably warm.</p><p></p><p>The power of his body was also under his control.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Suhao gained enlightenment: "I have successfully reincarnated again, gradually mastering this fleshly body. Indeed, it did not disappoint me - I, Suhao, have successfully reincarnated again. This is luck, but also inevitability.</p><p></p><p>I can sense that this body is extremely powerful! Now, let me patiently wait a moment, until I fully adapt, until my mental power fully returns."</p><p></p><p>During this period just after reincarnating, Suhao was at his most vulnerable, where a slight misstep could plunge his consciousness into slumber.</p><p></p><p>"I must persevere."</p><p></p><p>Suhao remained still and quiet, maintaining his original posture until his consciousness fully awakened.</p><p></p><p>He sensed something different.</p><p></p><p>"My current bodily state...doesn't feel quite right! My current posture seems to be curled up, curled up in a narrow space, restraining my whole body. Why is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...that I'm a prisoner?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered, then cautiously opened his eyes a crack to survey the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>However, he could see nothing, only a dim yellowish glow faintly entering his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "???"</p><p></p><p>He forced his eyes fully open, constantly adjusting focus and trying to turn his head to gather more information.</p><p></p><p>A spherical space? No, more like an ellipsoid...</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a while, he gained enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems...I'm inside an egg. I've reincarnated as some kind of oviparous animal...Indeed, my automatic consciousness-matching technique has taken effect!"</p><p></p><p>Although, Suhao was still quite surprised, never expecting to truly reincarnate as a non-human being.</p><p></p><p>As for what creature he reincarnated as, he just needed to enter the Bouncing Realm to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>After realizing he was in an eggshell, Suhao temporarily set his mind at ease. For him, this was good news - at least he didn't need to worry about any imminent life-threatening danger.</p><p></p><p>If there was any danger, the mother would surely guard over him, right?</p><p></p><p>He tested the current fleshly body's strength, thinking: "The body's power is extremely formidable. I could break out of the shell at any time and take out any would-be egg roasters."</p><p></p><p>Steady!</p>

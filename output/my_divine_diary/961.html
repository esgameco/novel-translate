        <h1>Chapter 961</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This time following Barry to the new demon realm, it would take at least a year and a half, Minister Cao was really not at ease leaving behind the second generation main god that he had personally built.</p><p></p><p>After all, the main god's realm would have all sorts of strange things happen every so often, and he could never imagine what those 'sages' were thinking in their heads.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he thought about it and found a few sagely spirits full of wisdom in the Heavenly Palace. He temporarily entrusted the trial world in the Heavenly Palace to them, and promised that after returning, he would arrange an interesting 'role' for them to play freely in the trial world.</p><p></p><p>After making these arrangements, he only brought a 'lucky coin' with him and secretly followed Barry to transmit to the so-called new demon realm.</p><p></p><p>When Minister Cao arrived at the so-called new demon realm, he immediately felt that it was different.</p><p></p><p>Within his view was a dark red color everywhere. Looking closely, he realized it was the color of tall and lush vegetation, like an ancient primordial rainforest, except it appeared even taller and larger, and was dyed red.</p><p></p><p>If you didn't look carefully, you'd think you had entered the legendary blood sea.</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao marveled: "This is indeed a world full of vitality. The Great Demon King Chipu was extremely lucky to find this place."</p><p></p><p>He sent out his divine consciousness to carefully observe the plants and creatures of this world. There were all sorts of strange and bizarre forms, things never seen before, but most were just slow-moving giant insects.</p><p></p><p>He wondered curiously: "Wasn't it said there were intelligent demon beings? What do the intelligent lifeforms of this world look like?"</p><p></p><p>Barry laughed: "You definitely can't imagine what the intelligent lifeforms of this world look like. In fact, the Great Demon King Chipu discovered this world many years ago, but only recently discovered their existence.</p><p></p><p>And these intelligent lifeforms perfectly match all of the Great Demon King Chipu's fantasies and needs for demon realm lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Let me reveal one more piece of information to you - within the range of your divine consciousness right now, there are quite a few demon beings. Little brother Cao, why don't you guess what they might be?"</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao was surprised: "They're right under my nose?"</p><p></p><p>He expanded his divine consciousness again, his powerful mind carefully filtering through the many lifeforms, but found no trace of intelligent life.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head: "I can't guess, Barry, you just tell me directly!"</p><p></p><p>Barry laughed lightly, casually summoning a black and white spotted worm the thickness of a water glass into his hand, showing it to Minister Cao: "It's this."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Barry: "You think I'm joking?"</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao said: "Ahem! Barry, I believe you, but I don't believe this worm."</p><p></p><p>Barry laughed heartily: "Can't tell, can you? These worms, called demon worms by the Great Demon King Chipu, have extraordinarily miraculous powers. During their fourth metamorphic growth stage, they can transform into all sorts of forms, including humans, giants, dragons, mountain spirits and more, even composite forms of different races.</p><p></p><p>Now they don't look intelligent, because they're still in the larval first stage. But if carefully cultivated, they'll go through four stages of growth to become a semi-perfect form. At that point, we can control the direction of their growth - human, dragon or something else.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to make them evolve into humans requires feeding them human flesh and blood at a specific stage.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it incredibly miraculous?"</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao couldn't help but lean in to scrutinize this worm larva closely, but couldn't see any sign of its special nature.</p><p></p><p>Barry continued: "Initially this world had no highly intelligent lifeforms. But after the Great Demon King Chipu set foot here and brought his Great Demon King's army, intelligent lifeforms were unintentionally born - the semi-perfect forms of these worms.</p><p></p><p>Through our experiments, we found these worms can develop into any form we imagine, including the ferocious demon armies we envision."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao murmured: "Seeing it this way, it really is as Barry said - there is no demon realm more suitable than this. It perfectly matches all our fantasies, this is a clay that can freely mold any lifeform model..."</p><p></p><p>Barry laughed heartily: "Indeed it is."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao curiously asked: "Why do these demon worms have this miraculous ability to metamorphose?"</p><p></p><p>Barry shook his head: "We don't know that. We just know we can use them to create demon soldiers. And with the increasingly tense relations between races in the Infinite Lands, perhaps a large-scale war will break out before long. At that time we can secretly steal some corpses from the battlefield to feed the demon worms, and quickly obtain a large batch of powerful demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Our demon realm's opening is perfectly timed. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao: "That makes a lot of sense."</p><p></p><p>Barry lowered his voice: "Let me tell you, don't go blabbing this around. For now, this demon realm is our secret, and no one else knows about its special properties yet. We have to keep this good thing tightly under wraps. If the Twin Sword Sect and Infinite Sect find out, they'll definitely come rushing to snatch it away."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao: "Don't worry, I won't say anything."</p><p></p><p>Barry said: "Come, I'll take you to the newly built demon city."</p><p></p><p>After Minister Cao arrived, the Great Demon King Chipu led a group to welcome him, strange and bizarre forms of all kinds, each wearing a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu was now using the 'small world' ability to shrink his body, and to facilitate communication with others, had transformed into a humanoid form, though not completely - he still had a dragon's head on his neck.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu pointed at the group of smiling 'people' behind him and laughed uproariously: "Little brother Cao, what do you think of these demon soldiers of mine? They all have extremely high intelligence, and can even communicate with us in simple ways. And they're all premium goods designed by me personally."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao looked at these strangely-formed 'people' and forced a smile, saying insincerely: "Not bad, very special. The Great Demon King's aesthetics are quite exquisite."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu laughed happily, patting Minister Cao's shoulder: "That's what I think too. You're not wrong for being my demon realm's image ambassador - your eye is indeed discerning."</p><p></p><p>Then the Great Demon King's tone became conflicted: "These demon soldiers are all good, but we plan to choose one model to use as the standard frontline demon soldier for my demon realm. But they're all too outstanding, so I'm hesitating over which one to pick.</p><p></p><p>I also heard from Barry and the others that you, little brother Cao, are a top expert at modeling. They suggested having you help design an exquisite set of frontline demon soldiers for my demon realm. Now that I've summoned you here to take a look, I can indeed see that's the case."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao was very humble: "You flatter me, it's nothing..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King continued: "So I've decided, you will be my demon realm's image ambassador, specifically in charge of helping us create a suitable demon soldier model.</p><p></p><p>Little brother Cao, will you take on this task? Give me one word."</p><p></p><p>Minister Cao thought to himself: "With things having gone this far, how can I say no?"</p><p></p><p>He smiled: "It is my honor to receive the Great Demon King's invitation. I will certainly do my utmost, but I have no confidence in whether I can do a good job. If the Great Demon King is not satisfied, feel free to speak up."</p><p></p><p>With such a gap in status and strength, unless he didn't want to make it anymore, he couldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu laughed heartily: "Come, let's drink and feast!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>However, what the Great Demon King Chipu and the others didn't know was that Suhao had already arrived on this planet and begun researching these demon worms.</p><p></p><p>"The genes of these demon worms are so peculiar. Most critically, during the violent genetic changes, their flesh and blood doesn't directly collapse, but instead manifests in various forms. Compared to the genetic technology I was familiar with before, this is completely at the other extreme.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the reason they can maintain structural integrity without collapsing is because there is something inside their cells that can offset the damage caused by these changes. The universe is so vast, there really are all sorts of wonders."</p><p></p><p>Suhao suddenly remembered that Fengcheng seemed to have a research topic in the field of genetics about how to conceal power within genes, so he thought: "It wouldn't be bad to have Fengcheng come take a look, maybe it could solve his problem."</p>

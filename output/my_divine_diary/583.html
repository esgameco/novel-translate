        <h1>Chapter 583</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lada was universally acknowledged as the strongest source mage in the entire Hengxuan region, unmatched by anyone else. He was said to rank among the top five in the entire world. </p><p></p><p>However, Lada was not satisfied with just being ranked in the top five, because in his own view, his fists were invincible against living beings. As long as someone dared to enter his perceptive range, no one was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were four regional grand masters in the 'Eighteen Empire Alliance' who could attack him from outside his perceptive range, leaving him helpless! He could only rank in the top five.</p><p></p><p>So what Lada hated most were those mages whose perceptive ranges were wider than his and whose attack ranges were longer than his!</p><p></p><p>What he did not expect was that today he encountered another person who could attack him from outside his perceptive range!</p><p></p><p>In that case, wouldn't he have to be ranked sixth? When others introduced him, they would say: This is the 'Fist of Invincibility' Grand Master Lada, who can rank among the top ten in the world!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Feng Cheng, who had transformed into the [Life Seed], was surprised that the five spells he casually shot out were actually intercepted and shattered by the opponent. He was a deity-level cultivator, so even a casual spell from him possessed tremendous power. How could it be so easily intercepted halfway?</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Grand Master Lada has some skills! Let me try my 'Purple Light Flying Sun Sword'!" Feng Cheng said, instantly completing a few spell handsigns. A purple light gradually brightened above his head and expanded to the size of a basketball.</p><p></p><p>He casually pointed at Lada and the others, and a sword aura suddenly shot out from the purple ball.</p><p></p><p>"Shaa--"</p><p></p><p>This sword aura seemed to have a precision guidance system, locking onto Lada and transforming into a stream of light shooting towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>And it wasn't over yet - more and more sword auras continuously shot out from the purple ball, closely following the first one, almost forming a line like a machine gun firing.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng wanted to see how the opponent would intercept such dense attacks.</p><p></p><p>After the sword auras entered Lada's perceptive range, Lada immediately took action, heavily punching the ground again. All the sword auras within his perceptive range exploded into clusters.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could celebrate, he saw even more sword auras flying over. He couldn't help but blurt out: "Damn it, so many!"</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, spread his legs into a half-squat, with his arm muscles bulging high: "Eat my -- Infinite Punches!"</p><p></p><p>Then his fists rapidly alternated punching the ground, just a blur of afterimages.</p><p></p><p>But his fists made no sound hitting the ground, only kicking up a light dust drifting outwards.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's Purple Light Flying Sun Swords continuously exploded in mid-air, as if shattered by an invisible force.</p><p></p><p>This time, Feng Cheng was truly surprised! He knew very well the power of his own spells, never imagining they could be shattered by someone's fists like this.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and thought: "What kind of ability is this? The spells were mysteriously attacked and destroyed."</p><p></p><p>After pondering, the uncertain Feng Cheng suddenly laughed: "Heh! No matter what ability it is, it's just within a 6,000 meter range! While my effective attack range can reach 150,000 meters, I'll slowly experiment until I figure it out."</p><p></p><p>Of course, in theory Feng Cheng could attack enemies within 150,000 meters, but the farther the distance, the weaker the attack power. The closer the distance, the stronger the attack power.</p><p></p><p>This applied equally to his spells and his illusory source ability 'Mind As You Will'.</p><p></p><p>Through multiple tests, Feng Cheng found that attacking from 10,000 meters away from the enemy provided the highest cost-performance.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, at this distance his spells and 'Mind As You Will' could still exert extremely powerful force, with only a slight reduction in power.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, a 10,000 meter distance could ensure his personal safety in most situations. Source mages capable of detecting him at that range were almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try my 'Mind As You Will' - it has no flight trajectory, let's see how you deal with it!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng took out a source bead and closed his eyes to activate the ability of a divine source mage!</p><p></p><p>'Grabbing Rice with the Mind'!</p><p></p><p>One of Lada's teammates immediately reacted, straining to speak: "It's a divine source mage!"</p><p></p><p>They could not imagine which divine source mage possessed such an enormous range - it was practically unbeatable.</p><p></p><p>'Giant Mind Sledgehammer'!</p><p></p><p>Before they could think further, the five of them were struck as if by a giant sledgehammer, all blasted away, tumbling through the air before crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, so frustrating! Afu, quickly dispel it for me!"</p><p></p><p>To deal with divine source mages, they had long prepared a viable solution - the 'Dispel' spell. In theory, any source mage who wasn't too stupid could learn it.</p><p></p><p>But that was just in theory. Unfortunately, not many people actually learned it...</p><p></p><p>This spell was extremely effective against divine source mages, and could dispel the spell effects of various illusory source mages to a certain degree, making it very practical.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a man in a hat straightened his hat first, then slapped his hand on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Pong!"</p><p></p><p>A blue flame burst from the center of his palm, rapidly expanding outwards and enveloping an area of over twenty meters within the blink of an eye, encompassing Lada's group.</p><p></p><p>After the blue flames swept over them, everyone felt the ubiquitous restraints disappear from their bodies, leaving them relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada clenched his fists tightly and roared: "Quickly move and locate him! Lanxin, get ready with 'Synchronize'! Once the direction is confirmed, Dumeng use 'Directional Vision'!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lada finished speaking, the five of them swiftly moved, rushing out of the dispelled area, charging erratically in all directions without any pattern.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the long-haired woman Lanxin followed behind, slightly closing her eyes to activate the 'Synchronize' spell!</p><p></p><p>Those attacked by a mind source mage's ability would have their consciousness pulled into the illusory world created by the mind source mage. Powerful mind source mages could even directly kill people within the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>An extremely formidable ability.</p><p></p><p>'Synchronize' utilized the 'Shared Illusion' spell to share perceptions among multiple people.</p><p></p><p>And 'Directional Vision' was the ability of another teammate Dumeng, allowing him to see through obstacles and clearly perceive objects in a certain direction, with a maximum range of 20,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>This was a team personally assembled by Grand Master Lada, able to perfectly leverage his own abilities through the combination of different abilities.</p><p></p><p>Lada's personal perceptive range was only 6,000 meters, which was already extremely far, but still not the farthest. There were always people with longer ranges than him, which was why he was said to only rank in the top five.</p><p></p><p>So he came up with a solution.</p><p></p><p>He would team up with a mind source mage and an exceptionally long-range aberrant source mage. The mind source mage could use 'Synchronize' to link his perception with the aberrant source mage, achieving ultra-long-range perception!</p><p></p><p>As long as he could perceive the target, then his 'Locking Fist' could attack it. And being struck by his fists meant death!</p><p></p><p>In this way, the perceptive range would no longer be a limiting factor for his ability.</p><p></p><p>In summary: An invincible team!</p><p></p><p>So this 'invincible' combination had to be unveiled ahead of time!</p><p></p><p>The five of them constantly moved around, quickly testing the varying strength of Feng Cheng's 'Mind As You Will' at different positions. As long as they perceived even the slightest difference in strength, they could rapidly calculate and determine the approximate direction and distance of the divine source mage's location.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a bespectacled woman closed a small notebook, snapped her fingers, adjusted her glasses, and pointed in a direction: "The general direction has been determined, about 10,000 meters that way."</p><p></p><p>'Synchronize'!</p><p></p><p>Lada grinned ferociously: "Dumeng, start now!"</p><p></p><p>Dumeng abruptly stopped, opening his previously closed eyes as two red cone-shaped beams shot out, illuminating the distance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless scenes entered his perception, shared with Lada through 'Synchronize'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an armored figure encased in a transparent crystal armor appeared in their shared perception.</p><p></p><p>This armored figure was huge, its entire body crystalline and translucent, with an elegant yet imposing design. It was currently floating in the air, seemingly contemplating its strategy.</p><p></p><p>Lada roared with laughter: "Found you! Armor of Stripping the Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his right fist high, muscles bulging and veins protruding, and smashed it down fiercely: "Go die! I'll hammer your brain! Hammer your guts!"</p>

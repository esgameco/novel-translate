        <h1>Chapter 977</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>With the cooperation of Lv Yijiang and the other two, Su Hao's experiments progressed very rapidly.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of 'yuan qi' deepened quickly, while also allowing him to make new discoveries about the material of this universe.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the 'yuan qi' of martial artists is a kind of material.</p><p></p><p>But this material is quite different from all the materials he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao were to give 'yuan qi' a fitting name, it should be called a 'parasitic material'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, 'yuan qi' does not have its own atomic sequence, but is something that depends on and attaches to other materials to exist.</p><p></p><p>Just like bacteria parasitizing in the human body, vines parasitizing on large trees, fish lice replacing fish tongues...</p><p></p><p>The difference is that the existence of yuan qi does not affect the properties of the material. Only when certain conditions are met will they display corresponding characteristics.</p><p></p><p>And these 'conditions' are precisely what martial artists pursue, the ultimate goal of their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's eyes, the 'martial arts' that martial artists cultivate is merely a way for the human body to activate and use 'yuan qi'.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the essence of martial artists, Su Hao could immediately skip the long cultivation process of martial artists and directly become a powerful martial artist himself.</p><p></p><p>So, not long after, Lv Yijiang and the others saw Mr. Jia Wei, just like them, with a harmonious and vast qi surging through his whole body. He could even casually release powerful yuan qi projectiles for attacks, and various martial arts skills came naturally to him.</p><p></p><p>What was most unbelievable to them was that Mr. Jia Wei could spar with them in close combat. Crucially, the surging qi he possessed was stronger than the three of them combined, even surpassing King Anming's peak state.</p><p></p><p>How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>Even King Anming had quieted down a lot during this period.</p><p></p><p>After Lv Yijiang and the others completed their mind cultivation according to plan, they had a period of rest, during which the three of them sparred on the open ground.</p><p></p><p>After the exceptionally intense battle ended, Gao Qi looked at his fists, deeply doubting: "Yijiang, Taicheng, is our cultivation correct? Are we pursuing a higher realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang said as a matter of course: "Of course, this is what our master told us, and we've been doing it all along, breaking through ourselves and making progress every day."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng also looked at his fists, a little dejected: "But I feel our cultivation method is wrong..."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang: "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng shook his head: "I don't know, but seeing Mr. Jia Wei's cultivation achievements, I feel that my own cultivation is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said: "I've been cultivating martial arts for twenty years, yet I was surpassed by you, Yijiang, who has only cultivated for fifteen years. Before this, I had always envied your talent, thinking your talent was better than mine, and your cultivation progress was faster than mine, so no matter what, I could never surpass you...</p><p></p><p>But after seeing Mr. Jia Wei's 'cultivation', I realized that martial arts cultivation doesn't seem to have much to do with talent. My twenty years of bitter cultivation is no match for Mr. Jia Wei's one month of cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, their determination was shattered, and they doubted themselves.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang said: "But our years of cultivation have been fulfilling, haven't they? We've always been striving for our goals and constantly breaking through ourselves, becoming better than before. Isn't that enough?</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, I never wanted to compare myself to anyone. I won't compare myself to the master, or to you two, and especially not to Mr. Jia Wei.</p><p></p><p>I just want to surpass myself. I just want to experience what a higher realm is like. I'll be happy if I can stand at a higher place and see scenery that I couldn't see before. If others stand higher than me, I won't be unhappy.</p><p></p><p>So I don't think my past is negated by Mr. Jia Wei's progress.</p><p></p><p>If you feel your martial arts cultivation is wrong and want to become stronger like Mr. Jia Wei, you can just ask Mr. Jia Wei for guidance."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng were slightly stunned: "Will Mr. Jia Wei teach us?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang shook his head: "I don't know, you have to ask him. That's what I'm thinking too. When Mr. Jia Wei comes out, I'll go ask him for guidance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao was recording the properties of yuan qi in the Bouncing Realm and summarizing another set of yuan qi cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>This set of yuan qi cultivation methods was an improvement based on the cultivation methods of Lv Yijiang and the others, making the transformation from an ordinary person into a martial artist more 'scientific'.</p><p></p><p>However, this set of cultivation methods could not allow one to reach the level of the strongest martial artist in just one month like Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, not everyone had the same conditions as Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Is it difficult for an ordinary person to become a top-tier martial artist?</p><p></p><p>For Gao Qi and the others, it was very difficult.</p><p></p><p>But for Su Hao, it was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that Su Hao's powerful spiritual force, capable of enveloping an entire planet, made almost everything exposed under his spiritual awareness, including the parasitic material yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>As long as Su Hao made some adjustments to his spiritual force to achieve the spiritual state of a martial artist, then all the yuan qi on the entire planet would merely be his tool.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could reach this level, but ordinary people could not.</p><p></p><p>So it was a mistake for Gao Qi to compare himself to Su Hao, as there was no basis for comparison between them.</p><p></p><p>After completing the summary of the cultivation method, Su Hao found Lv Yijiang and the others and inquired about their progress in cultivating the mind method of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only Lv Yijiang answered: "Mr. Jia Wei, I seem to be able to vaguely sense a special fluctuation, but it's not very clear. I don't know if it's the 'force field' you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng looked at Lv Yijiang in shock. The three of them had been cultivating together, but while the other two had no reaction, Lv Yijiang could already sense it. No matter what, they wouldn't believe it was because of talent.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Keep cultivating for a while longer, and you'll know. After you complete the first step, I'll pass on the subsequent cultivation methods to you."</p><p></p><p>He had an idea, which was to have the yuan qi parasitize on the spirit, which might allow the spirit to undergo a fundamental metamorphosis and form a brand new 'yuan spirit', achieving a qualitative breakthrough in the level of the yuan spirit.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's imagination, the yuan spirit had many advantages. The most important point was that it made up for the fragility of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Now he was using his [Divine] body to conduct yuan spirit experiments. Once the yuan spirit experiment succeeded, Lv Yijiang and the other two would become the first beneficiaries of the yuan spirit, and help Su Hao test the control and reliability of the yuan spirit.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, Lv Yijiang and the others were unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>What they were more concerned about at the moment was how Su Hao had become such a powerful martial artist in just one month.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang asked, "Mr. Jia Wei, how did you become such a powerful martial artist in just one month?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "There are two reasons. First, my spiritual force was already strong enough from the beginning to sense and control yuan qi. Second, I figured out the structure of qi inside the human body.</p><p></p><p>Based on these two points, I was able to construct the same yuan qi structure as a top-tier martial artist, which is what you see now."</p><p></p><p>He then pointed to the martial arts robes they were wearing and said, "Just like the martial arts robes you're wearing, as long as you know the corresponding structure, you can build it out of thin air."</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at each other, seeing the big question marks in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It sounded impressive, but they just didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "If you also want to gain powerful strength as quickly as I did, you probably can't do it in a short period of time, at least not within two thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two: "Two thousand years..."</p><p></p><p>They weren't even sure if they could live to be a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "However, based on your cultivation method, I have summarized a new set of martial arts cultivation methods. You can try cultivating it, but as for whether it can speed up your cultivation, I haven't tested it."</p><p></p><p>He then sent the newly summarized martial arts cultivation method to their learning machines.</p>

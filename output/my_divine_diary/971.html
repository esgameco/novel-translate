        <h1>Chapter 971</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang first carefully observed Su Hao, then shook his head and said, "You are not a martial artist. I don't fight with those who are not martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Shh——"</p><p></p><p>Everyone saw a flash of bright light, followed by a violent tremor from the ground beneath them.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>There was a huge explosion in the distance, and soon after a mushroom cloud rose up.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao lowered his finger and said, "I am."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang, Gao Qi and the others' pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>They had not sensed an overly powerful aura from Su Hao, nor had they seen him exert force for an attack, yet he was able to unleash such a formidable strike so effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be some special martial arts technique?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang sensed an intense threat from Su Hao, and his fighting spirit immediately heightened. He stared intently at Su Hao and said, "This place is too close to the town, let's go somewhere else to spar."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he took off into the air and flew towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng looked at each other, then glanced at Ya Shan and the others before also flying off to watch the fight.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng quietly asked Ya Shan, "Big Brother Ya Shan, why does Big Brother Wei suddenly want to fight someone? Is it because he's been researching too long and got restless?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed heartily, "He probably just wants to test him out. It's rare to come across such an interesting and powerful individual. To be honest, I haven't had a real fight in a long time. If Big Brother Wei hadn't gone first, I might have gone up there to exchange a few moves with them too."</p><p></p><p>They had become so powerful that apart from cosmic disasters, they couldn't think of anything that could pose a serious threat to them.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had encountered a top martial artist from a completely different system of power, it was hard not to get excited.</p><p></p><p>Before fully understanding their power system, it would be fun to have a good fight and learn about their abilities through combat, while also relaxing a bit.</p><p></p><p>Once they thoroughly researched it, there wouldn't be that kind of enjoyment anymore.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao floated in mid-air, looking at Lyu Yijiang across from him. He beckoned with his finger, "Come on, don't worry about me getting hurt. I'm very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang nodded, "Be careful, I'm coming at you."</p><p></p><p>Although he only sensed a faint aura from Su Hao, about the same as an ordinary person, this seemingly frail body still gave him an intense sense of crisis, no weaker than facing the fully powered An Mingwang.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lyu Yijiang moved. His figure vanished from the spot, reappearing in front of Su Hao and throwing a straight punch.</p><p></p><p>He didn't use his full strength, instead cautiously probing Su Hao's defenses first.</p><p></p><p>This punch carried tremendous force, yet he could control its release at will. If he sensed anything amiss, he could instantly retract his power.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his hand, steadily blocking Lyu Yijiang's fist.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Their fists collided.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's punch was firmly blocked by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't use any special abilities to defend, only his innate physical strength - his divine power, blood energy, spirit body, and some body reinforcement techniques.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao evaluated, "Not bad power."</p><p></p><p>The force was indeed very strong. After taking that punch, he could feel his entire arm vibrating. Lyu Yijiang's fist contained immense explosive power that erupted like a bomb upon impact.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao forcefully pushed back.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang was pushed back a great distance, then fired back a few energy blasts, still probing.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>'Wind Blast!'</p><p></p><p>The energy blasts were precisely intercepted mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Before the explosions dissipated, Su Hao suddenly charged forward, flickering to Lyu Yijiang's side and viciously kicking out.</p><p></p><p>"Bang——"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang blocked with both hands, getting kicked away.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought inwardly, "I actually struck his arms, but my perception was that I hit his entire body. My attack force was dispersed throughout his body, so he took no damage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his body is extremely tough, like a solid rubber ball. Immense striking power may not affect him."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered this, Lyu Yijiang suddenly appeared at Su Hao's side, throwing a punch with an excited look, clearly putting great force into this strike.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao remained calm, once again raising an open palm to block Lyu Yijiang's fist, wanting to test his power with his divine body.</p><p></p><p>"Bang——"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Hao's entire arm exploded into a cloud of blood mist and vanished into the air.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's eyes widened in shock as he pulled his fist back.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng also stared in astonishment at Su Hao's empty arm socket, thinking, "He's that frail?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang said, "Oh no, I got too excited and didn't hold back my strength. I'm so sorry I destroyed your arm..."</p><p></p><p>He never imagined the seemingly powerful Mr. Jia Wei could have such a fragile body that one arm could be blown off just like that...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's no problem, my body can't be damaged."</p><p></p><p>"Krrkrkr~"</p><p></p><p>A mass of pink crystal burst forth from the severed arm, forming into the shape of an arm.</p><p></p><p>The crystal then shattered and dissipated, and a new arm simply regenerated from nothing.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Lyu Yijiang's group gaping in astonishment.  </p><p></p><p>Limb regeneration?</p><p></p><p>Was that limb regeneration? Can humans reach that level?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao clenched his fist and smiled, "Let's continue, now I'll counterattack."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of this world were indeed formidable. Purely from the perspective of physical toughness and strength, even Su Hao's divine body and spirit form were no match for top-tier martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao's fighting style was never about comparing whose flesh was stronger. Combined with his abilities, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao focused his mind, enveloping his body in a rotating golden light - a simplified version of the 'Fragile Armor Defense' to block various attacks.</p><p></p><p>He thought, "Through fighting Lyu Yijiang, I can test his various physical attributes. This power called 'qi' does have its unique aspects."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang stared wide-eyed at Su Hao's newly regenerated arm, then laughed heartily and regained his fighting spirit, "Since that's the case, then I'll attack with full power!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly charged at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang——"</p><p></p><p>The two rapidly exchanged blows in mid-air, the sounds of impact extremely dense, almost merging into one continuous roar.</p><p></p><p>The intensity grew until they could only be heard and not seen.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lyu Yijiang suddenly realized that his attacks seemed to have no effect on Jia Wei. No matter how ferocious and swift his strikes, they were firmly blocked by some unseen force around Su Hao's body. Apart from the recoiling force numbing his fists, he gained no advantage.</p><p></p><p>Instead, when he wasn't paying attention, Su Hao would lightly poke him with a finger, causing that area to go numb for a long time.</p><p></p><p>For him, this was too bizarre. It looked like Su Hao used little force, but getting hit felt more uncomfortable than An Yangwang's punch.</p><p></p><p>He grew more and more excited, "Why is this happening? It must be some new martial art, it's amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah da da da~"</p><p></p><p>He frantically unleashed a flurry of strikes on Su Hao. Finding an opening, he even fired one of his signature Shock Cannons.</p><p></p><p>However, it had no effect on Su Hao's Fragile Armor Defense.</p><p></p><p>The observing Gao Qi exclaimed in amazement, "I never expected this Jia Wei to be so powerful, able to trade blows evenly with Lyu Yijiang."</p><p></p><p>The explosive-haired Tai Cheng clenched his fists, "One day, I'll reach their level too."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Cong Renfei chuckled, "Master Wei is not just what you see. As for how powerful Master Wei truly is, no one knows. Just know he's extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked, "Cong Renfei, are you and your masters really martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei replied, "Didn't you hear Master Wei say it himself? Master Wei said we're martial artists, so we must be martial artists, no mistake."</p><p></p><p>But Gao Qi still looked very doubtful.</p><p></p><p>What he had just witnessed with the arm regeneration was incomprehensible to him. No matter how he racked his brain, he couldn't think of any martial arts sect in this world capable of such a feat.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the even more bizarre instantaneous movement abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of place is the Infinite Lands..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was a coincidence that Master Yuan, who was also from Huaishui Town, encountered them here - it was like "meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land."</p><p></p><p>When Little Sugar saw Axing and Awang, her eyes lit up and she excitedly said, "Axing and Awang, you guys came too? Because of this disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Axing pointed at the message board and said, "Of course!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he pushed Awang, gesturing for him to hurry up and speak to show his manly demeanor, but Awang couldn't fart a thing.</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar exclaimed happily, "Then our two small teams can form a team and enter the strange disaster together!"</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed, "I think that's feasible, right Awang!"</p><p></p><p>Awang immediately nodded, "That's right, let's team up, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Axing pulled Suhao over and introduced him, "Little Sugar, let me introduce our new team member, Ayang."</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar was stunned when she saw Suhao, immediately recognizing him. Her little face wrinkled as she said, "It's you, this coward?"</p><p></p><p>"You two know each other?"</p><p></p><p>Instead of answering, Little Sugar said, "Axing, how could you let such a coward join our team?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang looked at each other, puzzled. Axing said, "Is there some misunderstanding?"</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar snorted, "It's not a misunderstanding at all! More than a year ago, during the fantasy-type source beast attack on Huaishui Town, he, as a source master, shamefully ran away. I don't want to team up with you guys!"</p><p></p><p>Axing was astonished, "A year and a half ago? Ayang only became a source master less than a month ago!"</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar immediately said, "Impossible, a year and a half ago, I saw him kill the 'illusion beast' with a fork with my own eyes. Don't let him fool you."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Suhao explained, "I've been training my body since I was young, so I'm quite strong."</p><p></p><p>He explained this out of consideration for Awang's crush, otherwise he couldn't be bothered to say anything - he didn't really care how others saw him.</p><p></p><p>"Liar......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After much persuasion from Axing and Awang, Little Sugar was half-convinced, "Really? He was really just an ordinary person before?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "No need to lie to you. When you go back, you can have your team leader check the records, and you'll know with one look."</p><p></p><p>Little Sugar hesitated, and finally looked at Suhao, "Sorry, I misunderstood you......"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled and waved his hand. There were so many people who misunderstood him, what's the big deal?</p><p></p><p>Axing inwardly sighed, 'The useless Awang!'</p><p></p><p>There were also two young men in their early twenties. One was tall and burly, with a metal headband on his head and wild, spiky hair exuding a fierce aura. The other was slimmer, with a gaunt, pale face that looked prettier than a girl when he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yo~ isn't this the Wangxing team? You guys are here to join the fun too? Your strength isn't much, but you've got some guts!"</p><p></p><p>When the slender young man saw Axing and the others, he sauntered over with a smile, subtly shielding Little Sugar behind him, and looked at Axing and Awang with a provocative gaze. The burly young man stood with his hands on his hips, smiling as he waited to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>Axing glanced at Awang, ignoring the other's taunts, and casually said, "Same as your Baolei team."</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to the burly young man and said, "Biqi, how about we team up for this mission? We'll split the reward!"</p><p></p><p>Before the team leader Biqi could speak, the slender young man immediately said, "Does our Baolei team need to team up with you? Don't drag us down."</p><p></p><p>Biqi laughed, "Since Jiangji has no intention of teaming up, then forget it. We'll have another chance to cooperate next time."</p><p></p><p>Axing and Biqi both knew that their two teams could never cooperate seamlessly. In both teams, there were people who liked Little Sugar, and they would compete and get jealous over her. Teaming up wouldn't complement each other, but rather cause them to undermine one another. Being able to complete a regular mission would be good enough, let alone in this strange disaster.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't careful, both teams could end up stuck inside.</p><p></p><p>Axing spread his hands regretfully, "Since that's the case, then forget it. But can we at least share some information?"</p><p></p><p>Biqi said, "Sure."</p><p></p><p>While Biqi and Axing exchanged information, Awang and Jiangji were in a contest, and Little Sugar's gaze kept wandering to Axing from time to time, very discreetly.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao, who was extremely sensitive to his surroundings, noticed this. He thought to himself, "Awang, looks like it's tough!"</p><p></p><p>This kind of melodramatic situation happened everywhere. He liked her, but she liked him, while he didn't like her...</p><p></p><p>It was so complicated!</p><p></p><p>But how could a man grow up without going through such setbacks?</p><p></p><p>Should he just blurt out in front of everyone: "Awang, give up, Little Sugar likes Axing!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The two teams went their separate ways. After Axing inquired about the details at the counter, he took the other two to find an inn to stay.</p><p></p><p>At night, Axing put away the various case files, then called Suhao and Awang over, and the three of them sat in a circle.</p><p></p><p>"Awang, Ayang, based on the information I've collected and a comprehensive evaluation, this strange disaster is rated as intermediate level!"</p><p></p><p>Awang widened his eyes, "Intermediate level?"</p><p></p><p>Disaster levels were divided into beginner, intermediate, advanced, and top levels. The most common were beginner-level disasters, which a team with intermediate-level source masters could generally resolve independently after preparation.</p><p></p><p>The two missions Suhao participated in could be classified as relatively simple beginner-level disasters.</p><p></p><p>The fantasy-type source beast attack on Huaishui Town a year and a half ago could be considered an intermediate-level disaster.</p><p></p><p>Just that one disaster alone killed more than twenty source masters in Huaishui Town, showing how terrifying intermediate disasters could be. A single small team would never be able to complete it.</p><p></p><p>Now Axing had classified this incident as an intermediate strange disaster. No wonder Awang was exceptionally shocked.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this was the most intractable and unsolvable "strange disaster" called "Nowhere to Hide." An intermediate strange disaster, when converted to a source beast disaster or natural disaster, could be rated as an advanced disaster.</p><p></p><p>Axing nodded and continued, "That's right. According to the information I've collected, this strange disaster originally didn't reach an intermediate level, but unfortunately, it was discovered too late and left unresolved for too long. Now the affected radius has reached 30,000 meters and is still expanding every day. If it can't be resolved quickly, it might even metamorphose into an advanced disaster. By then, this entire area would become an uninhabited dead zone."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "If such a strange disaster is not stopped in time, will it spread indefinitely?"</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head, "I don't know. At least I've never seen it happen. From what I've heard, every strange disaster has eventually been resolved."</p><p></p><p>Awang frowned, "Axing, isn't it extremely dangerous? Why don't we just forget about it?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "Of course it's extremely dangerous. Reportedly, as of today, more than twenty source teams have entered Liuyushan Mountain, but none of them have successfully come back out. The two source masters who managed to escape said 'I escaped, but there's nowhere to escape' over and over before dying soon after."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "How did they die?"</p><p></p><p>Axing took a deep breath, "Those two dead source masters...all the organs in their chests and abdomens disappeared. The key is..."</p><p></p><p>"There were no wounds on their bodies at all! It was as if their organs vanished into thin air..."</p><p></p><p>Awang gasped, his body hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining it was terrifying enough.</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised his eyebrows slightly, his heart unmoved. In reality, even if all his internal organs mysteriously disappeared, they could regrow in less than a minute, right?</p><p></p><p>So Suhao chimed in with feigned fear to go along with the strange disaster's intensity, "Whoa! That's awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang: "......"</p><p></p><p>How come they didn't hear any fear in Suhao's tone? Was the strange disaster not strong enough, or did he not express it clearly?</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I'm scared! How can I not be scared, I'm really terrified!"</p><p></p><p>Axing tentatively asked, "I originally thought it was probably a beginner-level strange disaster, but I didn't expect it to be advanced level. This disaster has already exceeded my expectations, so perhaps entering it is not a wise choice. So let's vote again to decide whether to participate in this strange disaster. The minority will obey the majority."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he decided first with firm resolve, "I choose to participate."</p><p></p><p>Next, it depended on Suhao and Awang's choices. If the two of them both chose not to go, then Axing would take the team to travel around the area and return to Huaishui Town after the situation was resolved.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's choice was obvious as he smiled, "I choose to participate."</p><p></p><p>Awang: "......"</p><p></p><p>What kind of teammates did he end up with?</p><p></p><p>Axing revealed a smile and laughed heartily, "Good! Tomorrow we'll report it, then enter Liuyushan Mountain to resolve the strange disaster."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 618</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It took Suhao a full three days to finally complete the 'handmade' 'Focus System'.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, there didn't seem to be much change to the surrounding environment, except for the addition of many criss-crossing stone walls.</p><p></p><p>The original small dirt slope had been leveled, and the soil was piled in another location. </p><p></p><p>In another area, there was now a 10-meter deep pit, and inexplicably a tree swaying in the wind next to it?</p><p></p><p>It was strange to have a single tree standing on such a plain, looking rather lonely.</p><p></p><p>And these disorderly, inexplicable changes were the result of Suhao's three days of work, looking like a child's messy sandpit game. But if one could sense the flow of energy around it, the secrets within would certainly be detected.</p><p></p><p>That's right, after Suhao remodeled the current environment, the flow of energy underwent a slight change, coincidentally forming a complete ellipse.</p><p></p><p>This was the 'Focus System' that Suhao had constructed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao could build such a Focus System with a wave of his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But to form this perfect Focus System by remodeling the environment was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked around and casually picked up a piece of bone, placing it at one of the focal points. Then, in a unique rhythm, he input a large amount of blood energy into the bone.</p><p></p><p>The handmade 'Focus System' activated.</p><p></p><p>Suhao closed his eyes, carefully sensing the flow of various energies around him. After a long while, he revealed a smile: "Activation successful. Just waiting for this bone segment to transform into a source. However, this transformation efficiency is too low. It will probably take a month to reach the critical point for synthesizing a source bead."</p><p></p><p>To confirm its feasibility, Suhao had to guard this place for at least a month to prevent any abnormalities in the energy cycle from interrupting the transformation.</p><p></p><p>One month, Suhao could wait.</p><p></p><p>He could just treat this place as a temporary base, right?</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually took out a source bead and began researching transforming it into specific materials!</p><p></p><p>"First are the elements. Previous research has shown that the probability of obtaining stable elements is much higher than directly obtaining compounds.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because during the transformation process of compounds, the various substances interact with each other, undergoing some inexplicable changes, resulting in a jumble of things after the materials coagulate.</p><p></p><p>In any case, let's try to manifest substances like 'hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron...' one by one..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A month passed quickly. Suhao waved his hand, breaking the bone segment, which then transformed into a low-quality source bead.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the 'Focus System' built using natural energy was so inefficient, only yielding one low-quality source bead in a month.</p><p></p><p>However, this also met Suhao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Even a low-quality source bead could be of extremely high value in Suhao's hands. He could even use this bead to construct a more powerful 'Focus System' to obtain more source beads, snowballing into greater and greater gains.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that in the next life, Suhao might not need to painstakingly accumulate spiritual power like in this life.</p><p></p><p>If there were no other shortcuts, for Suhao to cultivate to the Huashen realm would take at least three to five years at the fastest.</p><p></p><p>How could he endure that?</p><p></p><p>"The first goal, optimizing the 'Focus System', can be considered achieved!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao was being modest with these words. What he had achieved now far exceeded just reaching his goal.</p><p></p><p>After storing away the source bead, Suhao waved his hand, and the crude structures he had spent several days building immediately collapsed into rubble, with a large amount of stones filling the 10-meter deep pit.</p><p></p><p>In a short while, this area reverted to its original desolate appearance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the tree that Suhao had moved here from elsewhere still stood alone. But judging by its appearance, it was severely unsuited to the soil and water here, and would likely die before too long.</p><p></p><p>As for the handmade 'Focus System', it also collapsed and dissipated along with the structures, reverting to its original disorderly state.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could coincidentally become a 'Focus System' again in the future, causing a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Suhao clapped his hands, and in the next moment, his figure disappeared from the spot, transmitting back to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Yashan took the opportunity when Suhao was free to find him.</p><p></p><p>Yashan first reported the current progress in analyzing source energy, and then said: "Master Wei, some time ago, both Hefa from the Mage Association and Zhipeng from the Radiant Society came to me separately to discuss the problems facing the current social environment.</p><p></p><p>The core issue is that source mages who possess great power have lost sufficiently powerful disasters as competitors, causing the mages to turn their excess energy inward, with hints of various factions within the Mage Association starting to form opposing cliques.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's not just that. The mages from the 18 regions around the world are also gradually becoming divided by region, with mages from different regions starting to pursue some inexplicable 'orthodox mage' status..."</p><p></p><p>After Yashan briefly stated the situation, Suhao quickly grasped the key point: they need to find opponents for the mages with excess energy.</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked, "Do they have any solutions?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan shook his head with a wry smile: "They plan to deliberately cultivate disasters to maturity, restoring their former intensity, and no longer issue resolution tasks during the initial stages of a disaster. However, the effect is not great - the current mage strength is too powerful. Even well-cultivated high-level disasters would be easily resolved by mage squads."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "This is indeed a problem."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao deep in thought, Yashan waited a moment before saying, "When the mages came to me before, I had this idea. Is it possible to find a place like the beast corrals of the monasteries in the past, and corral source beasts to serve as opponents for the mages?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "Your suggestion may work temporarily, but not for the long term."</p><p></p><p>Yashan pondered and asked doubtfully, "If this won't work, then how can we resolve the current predicament?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Allowing the Mage Association to completely split apart is also a solution direction. There's no need for artificial intervention - it will naturally restore balance in the end."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "That's true. The key now is that the Mage Association's higher-ups like Hefa and the others unanimously oppose splitting the Mage Association apart. To them, this would make them sinners against the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng also expressed that he doesn't want this unified world to revert to how it was thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>In their view, war is terrifying, and they hope to avoid wars between nations.</p><p></p><p>Both sides have this idea but are at a loss for the current situation. They hope we can provide some suggestions."</p><p></p><p>Suhao stroked his chin, thinking for a moment before suddenly having an idea: "This is easy to handle!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked in surprise, "What solution?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "The problem lies in the mages' excessive energy.</p><p></p><p>The solution is not just finding suitable opponents, but also removing this excess energy from them."</p><p></p><p>Yashan pondered, "You mean, weaken the mages?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Correct! Weaken the mages! Or rather, change the survival mode mages have adhered to, preventing them from easily obtaining source beads and increasing the cost of their battles."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Would they be willing?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "You can't have your cake and eat it too. If they want lasting unity, the Mage Association can no longer maintain this mode!</p><p></p><p>They need to shift the core interest bond of issuing tasks to imparting high-level knowledge!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked curiously, "Then how exactly should it be done?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "It's simple - eliminate the root of disasters in this world and readjust the world's pattern, so that the sources in this world no longer originate from disasters.</p><p></p><p>Instead, let them spread through the air as a medium!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao stretched out his hand as if grasping the air: "Let the entire atmosphere be filled with dense 'sources'. Mages can absorb the 'sources' in the air through cultivation to achieve transcendence..."</p><p></p><p>"Not only can this control the rate of mage growth, but their excess time and energy must also be used to absorb the 'sources' in the air. How then would mages have time and energy for infighting?"</p><p></p><p>"Meanwhile, not only humans can undergo this transformation, but wild animals in certain regional blocks that meet the criteria can also absorb the 'sources' in the air to transform into supernatural source beasts, becoming opponents for the mages.</p><p></p><p>And as for the beast corrals you mentioned, that can be realized too - just find a huge mountain range to enclose them..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Suhao's explanation, Yashan was amazed: "Master Wei, isn't this just like magic and magical beasts from stories? Mountain ranges...Magical Beast Mountain Ranges!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "It can be understood that way too. Yashan, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan also smiled: "Very interesting."</p><p></p><p>What is willfulness? This is what true willfulness looks like!</p><p></p><p>When one's knowledge and power reach a certain level, one really does act according to one's own preferences, without any consideration for others' views and feelings.</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought to himself: "So the mages actually wanted to ask Master Wei for advice? They don't know that the solution Master Wei comes up with on a whim, they may not be able to accept.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, if it becomes a 'magic' world order, with the Mage Association shifting its direction to mainly impart high-level knowledge, it really wouldn't easily split apart.</p><p></p><p>At most...other supernatural organizations would rise up and try to seize the Mage Association's resources.</p><p></p><p>But whatever! As long as Master Wei is happy, that's what's most important!"</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the dudes for the monthly tickets. If I had stockpiled chapters, I would definitely put on a 10-chapter update show for you all...</p>

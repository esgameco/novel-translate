        <h1>Chapter 639</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The replication program of the 'Planet Virus' was largely consistent with previous versions, but with more refined details. Additionally, its control over time was more precise.</p><p></p><p>The original version could differentiate and replicate into five thousand replicas in thirty seconds. However, this seventh generation product not only shortened the time to twenty seconds, but also greatly increased the total number of replications in one cycle, reaching ten thousand 'Planet Viruses'.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this Planet Virus had extremely high stability.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's observation, the 'Planet Virus' continuously replicated, differentiated, replicated again, differentiated again...</p><p></p><p>Layer by layer, in an orderly fashion, spreading outward from the point it was released with a radius of two hundred kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Gradually eroding this planet that Su Hao had toyed with until it was riddled with holes.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand replicas increased per cycle, randomly sent out in all directions. As long as there was matter, it could continue replicating and differentiating.</p><p></p><p>At first it didn't seem like much, but as time passed, the 'replicas' increased exponentially. Each replication cycle multiplied the previous number by ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could even see a large number of replicas being randomly transmitted to the planet's surface or mid-air, continuing to work according to the program.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the replicas transmitted to mid-air quickly ran out of matter and 'died', eventually falling to the ground and becoming new matter. At some point later, they would be transformed back into 'sources'... Their deaths were actually irrelevant, because more 'replicas' had already penetrated deep into the planet's interior.</p><p></p><p>Later on, the 'Planet Virus' showed a tendency to spread towards the core and proliferate to the other half of the planet.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were just Su Hao's calculations. A large number of 'replicas' had already escaped the perception of Su Hao's divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it should be considered a success, right?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao floated silently in the sky, observing the movements of the planet below. But even now, he still could not confirm whether his 'Planet Virus' had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>After all, there had been too many failures. Each time, problems emerged from details he had never even considered.</p><p></p><p>Who knew if this time would be just like before, with some inexplicable little problem leading to complete failure?</p><p></p><p>So, he had to wait! Wait until the moment this planet was completely eroded by the 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Matter was transformed into source, reducing its volume by half. However, when the source was transformed back into a 'replica Planet Virus' composed of 'temporary products of the quality system' through the 'source transformation system', its volume suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>At first, when there were not many replicas, it was not noticeable. But later, as more and more replicas invaded the interior of the planet, the excess massive volume caused the internal pressure of the planet to increase dramatically.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the entire planet began to tremble. The land cracked, mountains rose, valleys closed and swelled forming new peaks. From the originally unstable areas, huge jets of scorching magma gushed out. Even the thick ice-covered lands at the poles, which had remained unchanged for billions of years, began to break apart. Countless years without seeing the light of day, the liquid blue-yellow water of the oceans beneath the ice erupted...</p><p></p><p>A scene of apocalyptic destruction.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the beginning!</p><p></p><p>However, at this rate, it would happen very soon!</p><p></p><p>And this chain replication reaction, eroding the planet, would accelerate faster and faster!</p><p></p><p>Raging, tearing, high temperatures... everything visible was burning!</p><p></p><p>The former Planet Key was already considered a life-forbidden zone, but now it had become a hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>You didn't even need to set foot on this planet. Just entering the atmosphere might be enough to die completely.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, as Su Hao watched the hellish scene below, he didn't feel too excited.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting for this moment for so many years. When it finally arrived, unexpectedly, he was much calmer than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait! Wait for the moment this planet meets its end!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the New Era City Astronomical Observatory on Planet Source, when Planet Key was in turmoil, a observer suddenly exclaimed in alarm: "Come look quickly, there's an anomaly on Planet Key... What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The other people in the observatory were startled by his outburst, looking at him reproachfully, but also very curious about what he had seen to make him lose composure like that.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gathered around, and the data transmitted back through the telescope simulated the appearance of Planet Key on the display screen.</p><p></p><p>It was still the same overall reddish-yellow planet as before, with some white spots dotting it.</p><p></p><p>The crowd wondered, "There's no change?"</p><p></p><p>From such a distant observation, it was difficult to discern specific changes on the planet's surface. It was normal not to see anything.</p><p></p><p>That observer pointed at the white spots on Planet Key and said, "Don't you all notice that the white spots on Planet Key have increased?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Now that you mention it, it does seem to be the case. Let's compare it with previous photos to see clearly!"</p><p></p><p>Someone immediately pulled up previous photos of Planet Key for comparison, and indeed, the white spots had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Why would this happen? Could it be that Planet Key has experienced a massive volcanic eruption, causing dense fog?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, seeing the serious doubt in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There's no point in guessing blindly. Let's just go up to the satellite and observe with the Wind God Telescope. Won't we know then?"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>"Do we need to report to Captain Fei Yue and Teacher Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course. Xiao He, you go report to Captain Fei Yue. Xiao Dan, you stay in the observatory and keep observing any other situations! We'll go up to the satellite first to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>When everyone transmitted to the corresponding satellite and observed the appearance of Planet Key through the Wind God Telescope, they were completely shocked!</p><p></p><p>The entire planet was boiling over, as if the water in a pot had started boiling and was being burned at maximum heat...</p><p></p><p>The observer muttered, "This is a huge problem!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, notify Teacher Feng Cheng to come take a look. Something we don't know about must have happened on Planet Key! It might even affect our planet."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this point, Planet Key had expanded somewhat compared to before!</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's perspective, he could not observe the changes of the entire planet. He could only see the eruption and churning of magma. The once relatively calm Planet Key had completely boiled over. Everything in sight seemed to be 'burning' in the scorching heat!</p><p></p><p>This was all because of the vast number of 'replicas' forcibly prying it open.</p><p></p><p>Prying open a huge planet...</p><p></p><p>Incredible!</p><p></p><p>It was as if it would become a second 'sun' in the next moment!</p><p></p><p>At this time, not only was magma gushing out, but also countless spheres or small cubes were mixed in, soaring high into the air. Some small cubes lost their source pearls and 'died' on the spot. Some lucky ones fell back into the magma, continuing their work diligently and tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>If Planet Key had consciousness, it probably wouldn't dare defy Su Hao now and would surrender instead.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei! The astronomical center has observed an anomaly on Planet Key. I saw it with my own eyes. The disturbance is extremely intense. The entire planet seems to be burning! I even suspect it might explode at any moment! It's terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng frantically @-ed Su Hao in the group and sent him several shaking window notifications.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Hao replied, Ya Shan sent a bubble message: "What's going on? Is Planet Key going to crash into us? Damn, our spaceships aren't built yet! Send some pictures over to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng sent a few pictures taken by the telescope, along with original images of Planet Key for comparison.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan sent a shocked emoji, then said, "Whoa! What happened to Planet Key?"</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that Su Hao finally sent a smiling emoji in the group: "Don't panic, this is an experiment I'm doing on Planet Key. I'm still on Planet Key too!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng's eyes almost popped out as they exclaimed in unison, "Experiment???"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had ever witnessed such an explosive experimental scene!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 602</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With Su Hao's display, and the mage's stunned expression, it gradually solidified.</p><p></p><p>Everything he saw today had exceeded his knowledge of 'source mages', and he simply couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p><p></p><p>A mage who was both an 'energy system' and a 'quality system' at the same time?</p><p></p><p>How in the world did he do that? Was it really researched?</p><p></p><p>The Wabi-sabi mage muttered, "Ordinary people can be awakened into mages through exercise? This ......"</p><p></p><p>To Mage Kazu, this was too subversive!</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he slammed his fist on the ground while a large hole violently exploded in the far wall.</p><p></p><p>Wagamama opened his mouth and froze, unable to speak!</p><p></p><p>Ever since he became a 'Wo Mage', he had never shown this kind of expression, and today, he really couldn't help it, the level of shock within him had already surpassed the limits of what he could control!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, ''Of course, there are many more abilities that I won't show one by one. For example, both the Heart's Source Mage and the God's Source Mage are able to use them at will. Even abilities outside of the three systems of the 'energy system', 'quality system', and 'fantasy system' are able to be developed."</p><p></p><p>"That's why, don't doubt our research capabilities, and it's not nonsense to cooperate with our research, I really want to crack the mysteries of the 'Source'."</p><p></p><p>The way the Wabi Mage looked at Su Hao was as if he was looking at a monster, the previous mentality of looking at a young junior was no longer there, instead, he placed Su Hao on top of a higher position than him, and in his heart, he unavoidably had a trace of respect for this young man.</p><p></p><p>This was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>Mage He held his tongue for half a day, wanting to say something, but couldn't say anything, and finally held back four words, "Incredible."</p><p></p><p>The adamantine armor under Su Hao's feet spread out, restoring the temporary meeting hall to its original form.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "Everything in this world has a law, and all the things that seem unbelievable are because our cognition is too shallow and we haven't comprehended the root of it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, you think that I can do these things incredibly because your cognition has certain limitations, while for me, this is a very simple thing.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the same goes for the attitude towards the Royal Family, you are obsessed with the contribution of the Royal Family to this world simply because of your cognitive limitations on the structure of society, whereas I see a little bit more than you do.</p><p></p><p>That's just it, you'll find that I don't want to debate with you too much about royalty, and that's because I see, a little further than you do, and I happen to know that I know a little more than you do ......</p><p></p><p>You see, the cognitive gap is there in front of you, and there's no point in arguing about it at all.</p><p></p><p>Do you feel that I am very brutal in killing people at the drop of a hat? Brutality is only the appearance, the essence is not, that's just that I know the cognitive gap between each other is so huge that words simply can't convince each other."</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long it's been, but no one dares to speak eloquently in front of and mage about 'I know a little bit more than you', 'your cognition has limitations', 'I don't care to argue with you' ......</p><p></p><p>Today, Mage Kazu ran into one, yet miraculously, he was unable to refute it.</p><p></p><p>This was very outrageous, but he had never thought that he could still run into a day where he was lectured by a young man.</p><p></p><p>Mage Kazu shook his head, "Perhaps, you are right."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reached out and tapped the desk, instantly heating up the teapot and then adding a cup of clear tea to himself before saying, "You are right, 'I am right', and I must be right, because if someone says that I am wrong, then the person who says that I am wrong, will bear the consequences.</p><p></p><p>I think that you should know what these technologies that we currently possess, mean.</p><p></p><p>The 'Chemical Source Vector Suppressor' alone is not something that the Imperial Clan or even the Mage Association can fight against, your source abilities are indeed powerful, but detached from the source, mages are merely a bit stronger than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how do you think the 100,000 mages organized by the Imperial Clan were wiped out in a matter of moments?"</p><p></p><p>Speaking here, Su Hao summarized, "Today's words have made my needs clear, I will do my best to reach my goal in the coming year, and all obstacles will be crushed by me.</p><p></p><p>The demise of the royal family is final, the next step is to see how the attitude of the mage association is, if the cooperation is successfully reached, then I am very happy and will selectively share the research results with you, for example, the mages of the various departments that you have seen today, I will be able to share them all.</p><p></p><p>If cooperation is not reached, then my plan will be postponed for another year, and then I will use the year to slaughter all the mages in the world and reorganize myself into an association that is willing to cooperate with my work."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Su Hao's words, Mage Kazu's hands trembled slightly with difficulty in restraining them.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Su Hao wasn't joking with him and was telling the truth, and because of this, his heart was so unsettled and even fearful.</p><p></p><p>This young man called Jia Wei could do this!</p><p></p><p>In the end, Mage Wo couldn't help but say, "If we cooperate, can you guarantee that you won't destroy this world?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "I have never thought of destroying this world. Please don't think of cleaning up the royal family and some obstacles as destroying the world, you can't represent the world, don't confuse them."</p><p></p><p>He Mage said, "You convinced me, but just convincing me is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Mage Wo, I think you misunderstood! I didn't intend to convince anyone, the reason why I've been talking to you for so long is that I just happened to run into you here and wanted to understand your attitudes. It's best if I can save a bit of effort, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't matter, I don't lack those one or two years."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao lifted his tealight and took a sip, "Alright, let's talk here for now today, I'll give you five days to think about it, within these five days you can visit freely in my experimental base, and after five days I'll send you back to Xinji City.</p><p></p><p>I hope and mage can give me a certain surprise, and also, if the mage association wants to preserve the royal family, by all means try, I have no problem with it. This way, you will be completely dead."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Su Hao's figure slowly disappeared in place, teleporting back to his laboratory.</p><p></p><p>He Mage sat on a chair, quietly looking at the tea at hand out of concentration, a long time long sigh: "I also do not know what the future will be!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next time, no one to restrict and mage's movement, he was also very curious about Su Hao's experimental base, so he wandered around, what he saw and heard shocked him, never thought that there was such an advanced place in the world.</p><p></p><p>The various facilities and equipment within the experimental base, in their opinion, belonged to the feeling of watching aliens' 'black technology'.</p><p></p><p>The next day, and the mage met an acquaintance by chance within the test base.</p><p></p><p>"Mage Kazu? Why did you appear here?"</p><p></p><p>An unusually loud voice suddenly came from the distance, causing Mage Kazu to subconsciously turn his head to look, only to see a curly-haired cloaked man standing in the distance. With his hands clenched into fists, he looked over with a face full of incredulity.</p><p></p><p>"Lada?" The Wabi-Sabi Mage instantly recognized General Director Lada.</p><p></p><p>Radha's teammates as well as the Flying Regulus Squad and the others rushed over at the sound of the noise, and after they saw clearly the face of the Woven Mage, each of them revealed a dumbfounded expression.</p><p></p><p>In the impression of all source mages, Mage He was as honorable as the Lord of the World, his portrait could be seen everywhere in the world, and was even worshipped as if he were a living deity, and although those present had not necessarily seen him face to face, they all more or less recognized his appearance.</p><p></p><p>This is what kind of lofty figure ......</p><p></p><p>They actually met in the enemy's main camp?</p><p></p><p>Lada took a step and boom boom boom and ran in front of Mage Kazu to scrutinize it, and then shocked, "It's Mage Kazu you're right! What the hell! You've been captured too?"</p><p></p><p>Mage Kazu was one of the people who were able to attack him outside of Radha's perception range, and Radha was 'longing for Mage Kazu'.</p><p></p><p>Mage Kazu coughed dryly, "I wasn't captured, I came here to negotiate with the other party's leader, and after discussing the relevant matters, I'll be leaving. Well, it'll be about five days before I leave."</p><p></p><p>Lada had a skeptical look on his face, "Really, you old man likes to lie, bad as hell, don't lie to us."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli and Feiyuan and the others almost stared their eyes out after hearing Lada's words.</p><p></p><p>This was a Wabi-sabi mage!!! How dare Chief Radha dare to talk to Mage Kazu like that?</p><p></p><p>Mage Wo revealed a faint smile and asked without answering, "What about you guys, why are you staying here?"</p><p></p><p>Radha waved his hand, "Harm, don't mention it, I was careless and didn't flash!"</p>

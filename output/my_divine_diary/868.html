        <h1>Chapter 868</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After completing the brain transplant, Su Hao checked thoroughly many times, and tested all the abilities many times. The conclusion was that there were no problems.</p><p></p><p>But just obtaining what he wanted like this, he still had a feeling of unreality.</p><p></p><p>The many years of misfortune had made him always remind himself with one sentence: Beautiful things on the outside always hide deadly poisons, be cautious about everything.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he would treat things obtained too easily with even more caution.</p><p></p><p>It's like suddenly one day on a whim buying a lottery ticket, and oh my, winning 10 million. The first reaction would definitely be disbelief, repeatedly confirming the lottery ticket...</p><p></p><p>Successfully creating a soul brain and obtaining eternal life, in Su Hao's view, was about the same as winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly checking many times, he finally confirmed one thing: "Through my efforts and a bit of luck, I have successfully achieved an alternative form of eternal life."</p><p></p><p>Congratulations.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the enhancements in various abilities brought by this soul brain, Su Hao valued more its ability to constantly renew and never age.</p><p></p><p>Because as long as he had eternal life, these abilities were inevitable byproducts in his view. Even if he didn't have them at first, he would eventually gain them.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will transplant my new brain into the main body of the giant dragon. As for the original dragon brain, since it has carried my consciousness information, to avoid any future anomalies and unpredictable consequences, it must be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed he was the only one, and he would not allow a situation like the deities where the main body and avatars argued with each other. Anything that had carried his consciousness information must ultimately be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first took out the brain from the giant dragon's physical body, then extended countless neural tendrils made of 'spirits' from his current 'soul brain' to interface with the dragon's physical form.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he severed the connection with his current body and transferred the soul brain into the giant dragon's physical form.</p><p></p><p>With this, the entire brain transplant process was completed.</p><p></p><p>Saying it is simple, doing it...</p><p></p><p>For Su Hao, doing it was also simple.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I have overcome another difficult problem. This is just the beginning stage, I believe there will be even more perfect optimizations in the future."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time to this point, Su Hao had basically completed the goals he originally set.</p><p></p><p>He came to the pinball space and brought up the many task plans he had previously set, then crossed out the parts that had been completed one by one.</p><p></p><p>He sat quietly at the familiar desk, enjoying a moment of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>This familiar desk, this familiar study, had always been like this.</p><p></p><p>It was the room dedicated to his studies back when he was Luo Zhaohui.</p><p></p><p>Out of habit, he had never changed it.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he sat at this desk, he could quickly arouse the determination to keep striving forward, and find the path forward.</p><p></p><p>Because that was his most difficult time.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time, in a situation with absolutely no power, that he escaped the shadow of death in his childhood and successfully lived to the age of sixteen. It was also at that time that the rudimentary Xiaoguan was born, providing the indispensable power for his later metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"Every time I sit at this desk, I can feel that helplessness and unwillingness from back then. I never imagined that in the blink of an eye, I would possess everything I couldn't even dream of back then."</p><p></p><p>What he experienced back then was like yesterday, never forgotten.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I don't dislike everything I've been through. On the contrary, I enjoy this process of exploring the secrets of the universe. Every time I learn new knowledge and gain new insights, it brings me a joy from the depths of my soul.</p><p></p><p>What is the ultimate enjoyment in life? Perhaps I am enjoying the ultimate enjoyment that ordinary people don't have - I have always been doing what I love to do. Those who possess the ultimate enjoyment are fortunate, so I am also fortunate, haha!"</p><p></p><p>He picked up the pen on the desk, took out that thick notebook, and flipped through the pages one by one, checking the plans he had made, flipping all the way to the newest blank page.</p><p></p><p>Then he flipped back to the very first page, where there was a column called 'Achievements', and after it was already written: 'Flight', 'Supernatural', 'Genius', 'Flashing', 'Longevity', 'Supernova', 'Roaming'.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, and added another one after: Eternity.</p><p></p><p>The acquisition of each achievement represented the difficulty behind it, how arduous it was.</p><p></p><p>Of course, except for eternity.</p><p></p><p>In the process of exploring eternity, he did not feel it was too difficult, on the contrary, it was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>But from another perspective, the reason he obtained eternity so simply was perhaps a manifestation of his strength. If he had encountered Baijia'er when he was extremely weak, he might have only been enslaved as a believer by the deities. As for researching soul power, that would have been absolutely impossible, let alone finding Baijia'er's home red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly pulled his thoughts back from the distant past and flipped the notebook to the newest blank page.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he slowly wrote down his next plan:</p><p></p><p>"Currently there are two major long-term problems that need to be solved. The first is the ever-present 'wave of fate', and the second is to find the specific location of the pinball space and find a way to escape the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Finding the pinball space is not something that can be done overnight, because the wandering nature of the pinball space means it could cross the boundless universe in an instant, going to another unknown place without a trace. Over the years, I have recorded all the star domains the pinball space has visited and compared them, but found no similarities at all.</p><p></p><p>The pinball space has wandered for at least 200 million years, yet I have not found any star domains that can be successfully matched. The infinity of the universe is indeed hard to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>So, the problem of finding the pinball space will be set aside for now. The current task is to solve the problem of the wave of fate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I already have a preliminary plan for how to solve the wave of fate and find its source.</p><p></p><p>The details are as follows:</p><p></p><p>First, transform the Crucis system into a supernatural world enveloped and monitored by the eighteen deities, with elements like heaven, hell, souls, reincarnation, deity cultivation, apocalyptic demon lord rule, etc. Allow it to develop for a thousand years to form its own unique history, while limiting the eighteen deities from interfering with the normal historical process. Ultimately, perfectly craft it into a world suitable for the survival and development of 'dimensional travelers'.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the transformation of the Crucis system, I had already laid the groundwork long ago by loading the 'world creation assistant' into the eighteen deities. They should have preliminarily set up the corresponding world-linking programs by now.</p><p></p><p>After I inspect and approve it, this plan can be officially launched.</p><p></p><p>Second, allow the various types of worlds created by Yashan and Fengcheng to develop on their own, and remove the concept of 'deities' from the civilizations, isolating all worlds from each other. Similarly, craft them into paradises for dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>What form the worlds take doesn't matter, the key is to remove the 'deity' concept and make atheism the theme, so that future dimensional travelers can fully immerse themselves without unnecessary suspicion that could interrupt the experiment process.</p><p></p><p>Third, explore outward to other galaxies, and in the sufficiently distant depths of the universe, find a suitable intelligent civilization. Then select suitable 'dimensional travelers' from that civilization and send them into these transformed worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now that I have obtained eternal life, I believe that as long as I keep searching, I will eventually find a suitable intelligent civilization - the homeland of dimensional travelers.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, there is a high probability that when I package an intelligent consciousness from the extremely distant universe and send it into these transformed worlds, this so-called 'dimensional traveler' will inevitably be locked onto by the wave of fate. Then, like what happened to me originally, there will be repeated phase-based attacks on the dimensional traveler until they are completely dead.</p><p></p><p>And I will seize this opportunity to observe the wave of fate locking onto the dimensional traveler, trace it back to its source, and find the origin of the wave of fate.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng will help me manage these worlds..."</p><p></p><p>This is the method Su Hao came up with to explore the 'wave of fate'.</p><p></p><p>The principle is quite simple. If only he is locked onto by the wave of fate, while Yashan and Fengcheng are not locked onto, then it means he is the special one, and he can only find a way to break through the wave of fate from within himself.</p><p></p><p>But in his previous life, he observed that Yashan and Fengcheng were also locked onto by the wave of fate. This means that in this universe, consciousnesses from other worlds that possess the lives of this world will also be locked onto by the wave of fate.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Su Hao can artificially create a 'massive' number of dimensional travelers to observe the operation of the wave of fate, without having to worry about his own danger.</p><p></p><p>Until the mysteries of the 'wave of fate' are completely uncovered.</p><p></p><p>Even if he ultimately cannot find the 'wave of fate', doing this will still yield multiple benefits.</p><p></p><p>"First, exploring the more distant cosmic starry skies is something I must do, while also incidentally searching for a suitable 'dimensional traveler homeland'. Why not do it?</p><p></p><p>Second, use my current knowledge to create hundreds of different worlds and civilizations, and use the power of civilization to further optimize and elevate the current system of power, just like in the previous life when the cultivation realm transformed 'spiritual power' into 'spirits'.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I can select a group of suitable talents from among these dimensional travelers to form my own 'roaming' team to help me find more civilizations and explore this unknown universe.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, I said before that I hope this universe has more vitality, with more like-minded people together exploring the universe."</p><p></p><p>On this point, Su Hao was not just saying it - he really intended to do it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, before obtaining eternal life, he would not casually record other consciousnesses to avoid uncontrollable accidents. Now he no longer has such concerns.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao put down his pen, looked at the full page of notes, and muttered: "Transforming worlds is imperative."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 699</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Three years later. The small world of the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked through a spacious factory, his eyes scanning left and right, observing the motionless [Eight-Handed Gods] and [Insect Gods] standing in the small partitions on both sides.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were [Eight-Handed Gods], still looking the same as before.</p><p></p><p>There were only five [Insect Gods], and their appearance looked rather special: overall similar to the other [Gods], they were all wrapped tightly in pink crystal shells covering their bodies. Their bodies resembled a scorpion covered in hooks, with a dinosaur-like head, ferocious fangs, six segmented limbs, and two huge sickle-shaped pincers extending from each side, making one shudder just looking at them. Two pairs of transparent, razor-sharp wings grew from their backs...</p><p></p><p>If the [Eight-Handed Gods] looked 'weirdly cruel', then the [Insect Gods] looked 'ferocious'!</p><p></p><p>However, the [Insect Gods]' nervous systems were much weaker compared to the [Eight-Handed Tribe], less smooth to control, and not very practical, but they made good experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>These two rows of densely packed [Gods], a total of one hundred, were one of Su Hao's achievements over the past three years.</p><p></p><p>The reason there were only one hundred was not because Su Hao could not make more, but because he had exhausted the experimental subjects of the Eight-Handed Tribe and no longer had the opportunity to capture more.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no need to dwell too much on this, as for him, these one hundred [Gods] might not even be usable.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the number of [Gods] increased, but their quality had also been greatly optimized.</p><p></p><p>All the [Gods] in the two rows had mastered core abilities such as 'Deity Realm Cultivator', 'Core Perception Compound Runes', 'Spatial Abilities', and 'Source Mage'.</p><p></p><p>As long as Su Hao activated the 'Full Immersion Control System' in the small black room, he could immediately take complete control of any one of the [Gods].</p><p></p><p>The [Eight-Handed God] he was currently using was even more powerful. After three years of training and adaptation, it could now use advanced spatial skills such as 'Second-Level Space' and 'Small World', further enhancing its survival abilities by another level.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that it was only slightly weaker than his main body, with little difference overall.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned around, very satisfied with his masterpieces. These [Gods] were the source of his confidence.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the factory and entered another area to observe the current state of the Mother Bug.</p><p></p><p>The area where the Star-Eating Bugs resided was isolated by Su Hao because the Mother Bug was too fertile, and the Star-Eating Bugs could reproduce too quickly.</p><p></p><p>In just three short years, they had eaten away nearly half of the soil in his small world.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that ordinary soil and rocks would transform into a group of living bugs, all because of a basketball-sized bug egg?</p><p></p><p>Now, in the isolated small space, there was no soil or other materials left, only densely packed bugs.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't even have the desire to count how many there were.</p><p></p><p>After the Mother Bug realized there were no more resources left in this area to continue reproducing, it began producing large hot air balloons, spraying bug eggs upwards.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, the sprayed bug eggs could not break through the isolation of the small world and fell back down from above...</p><p></p><p>The Mother Bug was still the same, hiding amidst the surrounding bugs, quietly producing. However, now lacking materials, its production rate had dropped to freezing, only one egg per day.</p><p></p><p>However, what Su Hao was concerned about was not how the Mother Bug produced, but how it simultaneously controlled the vast swarm of bugs.</p><p></p><p>During this period of observation, Su Hao made a major discovery: as the number of bugs increased, the Mother Bug's intelligence gradually rose from initially acting based on instinct to now having a certain level of intelligence, comparable to that of a three or four-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>And the secret Su Hao wanted to find lay in the increase of the Mother Bug's intelligence.</p><p></p><p>How did the Mother Bug's intelligence increase?</p><p></p><p>Their way of becoming smarter was very special: the neural network stacking method!</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the Mother Bug did not cultivate the bug eggs one by one, but in pairs.</p><p></p><p>Inside the two bug eggs being cultivated simultaneously, there was a small area that was exactly the same, including the motion of particles, all synchronized.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the synchronized part gradually evolved into a nervous system.</p><p></p><p>After the bug eggs matured, one of them was expelled from the body, while the other remained in the mother's body. After developing to a certain stage, the other parts were invaded and digested, leaving only the synchronized nervous system, which was then transferred to the Mother Bug's brain and integrated with it...</p><p></p><p>This was the way the Mother Bug controlled the bugs, and also the reason why the Mother Bug became smarter.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the Mother Bug kept producing new bugs, its brain would continue to grow, and its intelligence would continue to increase without limit...</p><p></p><p>This method of becoming smarter by stacking neural networks through reproduction was something Su Hao dared not even imagine!</p><p></p><p>The Star-Eating Bug race truly deserved to rule an entire star domain through their own strength.</p><p></p><p>For this, Su Hao gave a sincere praise: "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>As for the principle behind the complete synchronization of the two neural networks...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought of a term - quantum entanglement.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "Perhaps it's related to this theory I studied before, but I don't know exactly how it's implemented. The Star-Eating Bugs have great research value inside and out!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was thinking of feeding the Mother Bug some food to observe its egg-laying process, the broadcast from the Yuanxing Ship sounded.</p><p></p><p>"In two hours, the ship will shut down the warp engine. All personnel must immediately enter the adaptation cabin and prepare."</p><p></p><p>He instinctively looked up: "It seems we've arrived at the human homeworld, Blue Light."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The moment the broadcast sounded, the crew on the entire spaceship cheered excitedly, their faces filled with barely contained excitement.</p><p></p><p>The agonizing three-year wait finally erupted at this moment, and some soldiers even shed tears of joy, unable to hold back.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone knew they had successfully returned home!</p><p></p><p>After twenty years, what would things be like now?</p><p></p><p>However, upon returning, only eight hundred people remained. Six hundred soldiers had closed their eyes forever in the unknown depths of space...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention how excited and sad the crew was, the ship's speed gradually slowed down, appearing in a chaotic asteroid belt, with no sign of Blue Light. The Yuanxing Ship was just outside the asteroid belt.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing Ship sent an arrival signal, then skillfully passed through the asteroid belt, heading towards the empty space on the inside.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that the crew on the Yuanxing Ship slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly remembered that shutting down the warp engine did not mean they had arrived at Blue Light, only that they were approaching.</p><p></p><p>To return to Blue Light, they would still need to travel for at least a month, going through countless checkpoints and undergoing numerous inspections. The time could easily be extended to over two months...</p><p></p><p>They got excited too early!</p><p></p><p>After the extreme excitement, the crew became dejected, looking utterly miserable, losing interest even in their daily training, their minds fully occupied with the hope that time would pass quickly.</p><p></p><p>As the crew had expected, every day there were human small spacecraft approaching to board the ship, carrying various instruments to inspect all aspects of the vessel.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but all personnel on the Yuanxing Ship, including Su Hao, had to undergo blood tests and comprehensive medical examinations...</p><p></p><p>A blood test? If he handed over a tube of [Eight-Handed God] blood, who knows what they would analyze it as.</p><p></p><p>They might not even consider him a human anymore.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's operation was simple. He drew some blood from his main body, modified it with a 'Gene Regression Liquid', and then let the awe-struck inspection officers draw it away.</p><p></p><p>He passed smoothly and was still considered a human.</p><p></p><p>After another two months, the Yuanxing Ship, escorted by many warships, finally arrived in front of a yellow-green planet and slowly entered its atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>This yellow-green planet was the human homeworld, 'Blue Light'!</p><p></p><p>For many years, the Eight-Handed Tribe had been searching for a planet that emitted a blue glow...</p><p></p><p>As the Yuanxing Ship entered the atmosphere, countless cameras focused on this ship that had been on patrol for twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Large and small screens across the planet all broadcast live videos of the Yuanxing Ship entering the atmosphere, with countless people staring intently at the all-black cruiser.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, this cruiser named the Yuanxing Ship had repeatedly become the hottest topic among humans.</p><p></p><p>Because from this warship, many battle videos had been transmitted back that made all humans' blood boil with excitement!</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>In everyone's eyes, this was no longer just a cruiser, but a warship.</p><p></p><p>On this epic warship was a superhero of humanity.</p><p></p><p>His name was Xu Shiqiang!</p>

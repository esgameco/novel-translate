        <h1>Chapter 919</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao uploaded a soul technique called 'Information Will Separation Art' to the gods' marketplace, pricing it at 20,000 points. This technique allowed gods to separate their main will and completely transfer it into a new body.</p><p></p><p>This soul technique was not easy...</p><p></p><p>But what made it difficult for the gods was the high price!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lei An is as unscrupulous as ever!"</p><p></p><p>However, the gods had no control over the pricing, so they could only work hard to earn points.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the gods set their sights on a group of celestial beings idling in heaven: "Since they're just loafing around, why don't we get them to help us earn points?"</p><p></p><p>If the celestial beings who had toiled for a lifetime in heaven knew the gods' plan, they would probably faint in the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>After officially launching the 'First Primordial God', Su Hao entered the Cruciform Star to sense the subtle changes of the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Finding the actual situation basically matched his expectations, he began sending transmigrators to the planet.</p><p></p><p>They were divided into ten groups of ten each, with one hundred people sent to the planet all at once.</p><p></p><p>He planned to have these transmigrators cooperate in squads to carry out various tasks, improving their survival rates while accelerating their growth.</p><p></p><p>Observing the growth trajectories of the previous batch of transmigrators, those sent individually would unconsciously develop timid personalities, completely lacking the domineering spirit of a transmigrator meant to conquer the world...</p><p></p><p>If this continued, how could they stand out in the universe?</p><p></p><p>By grouping the transmigrators into teams, those with ability and ambition would emerge as leaders, while the others would quickly find their roles and cultivate specialties within the group.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao's considerations went beyond just this. More importantly, he wanted to experiment with different methods of sending transmigrators to see the varying results, good or bad. He was willing to try, even if his experiments ultimately led these transmigrators to destruction.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was the reason of testing the new 'First Primordial God'.</p><p></p><p>In his vision, the future management of transmigrators would not require human intervention. The Primordial God would automatically manage everything, continuously producing qualified transmigrators to be taken as disciples by Yashan and Fengcheng's students, passing down the lineage generation after generation to form a vast organization exploring the universe.</p><p></p><p>The gods would eventually be eliminated. Their only value was that their bodies could be used as hardware. Of course, if they eventually learned something, that would be another story.</p><p></p><p>After sending the hundred transmigrators, Su Hao did not linger on the Cruciform Star, but instead transmitted to the Remodeled Star to observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>He had an idea to turn part of the Remodeled Star into instances for the transmigrators to carry out specific tasks. This would train their abilities while stimulating the progress of civilization, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yashan messaged Su Hao in the group: "Old Master Wei, of the previous fifty students, I have screened and selected sixteen qualified candidates to take as disciples. Next, I will guide these sixteen disciples until they learn 'Transmission' and how to make positioning stones."</p><p></p><p>He then sent over the information of the sixteen disciples, including their birth details, behavior records, as well as his standards and thoughts for selecting them.</p><p></p><p>After quickly browsing through, Su Hao praised: "Your selection criteria are indeed reliable. Getting sixteen is quite good!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way Yashan, the thirty-four rejected students' planets - I plan to turn them into 'instances' for the Cruciform Star transmigrators to periodically travel to and carry out specific tasks. This will broaden the transmigrators' horizons and lay a good foundation for later, while also allowing me to observe more changes.</p><p></p><p>So I will turn those rejected students into the ultimate villains for the transmigrators to face. Through intense confrontation, both sides can grow.</p><p></p><p>However, with only thirty-four such planets, it still seems too few. I want to expand to two hundred planets within five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, you need to continue taking in students with potential from other Remodeled Stars as your disciples, while eliminating some to become the 'villains' of those worlds.</p><p></p><p>There is currently a batch of mature transmigrators on the Remodeled Stars, so you can go guide them as the second group of students.</p><p></p><p>Once your students grow up, you can have your disciples take over this task of recruiting students."</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately responded: "Understood, Old Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Then he asked curiously: "Are you trying to build a platform for rapid transmigrator growth?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Not exactly. My original intention was to build a platform that can continuously produce suitable experts. After all, we don't lack time, so it doesn't matter how long it takes for them to grow up eventually.</p><p></p><p>But when I returned to the Cruciform Star, I realized that while we can wait, planetary civilizations develop rapidly. Once a civilization surpasses the Blue-Purple Star level, the Cruciform Star will no longer be suitable as an incubator for transmigrators.</p><p></p><p>So in reality, transmigrators don't have as much time as we imagined. That's why I thought of building a platform like a flowing stream to continuously cultivate transmigrators.</p><p></p><p>The transmigrators will be divided into ten different groups to jointly carry out tasks. If anyone in a group dies, we'll supplement them with new members when they enter instances to complete tasks. This cycle will repeat until the groups grow strong enough to leave the instance tasks.</p><p></p><p>This way, the efficiency of cultivating talents will be much higher."</p><p></p><p>Yashan showed great interest in building the platform: "Old Master Wei, can I have some transmigrators too? I'm very interested in building this kind of platform for cultivating transmigrators. I have some interesting ideas I want to try out."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fengcheng suddenly chimed in: "Ahem! Old Master Wei, I also have many ideas. I want some transmigrators to try cultivating too. It seems really interesting, haha!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Su Hao allocated one thousand transmigrators from his Bouncing Realm to each of them and granted usage permissions.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "You can try it out, but don't experiment in the Xianghu System or surrounding areas. I have a very important project to research in the Xianghu System. Go mess around in other parts of the universe!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng proposed: "Why don't we build a huge arena somewhere in the universe, and then see whose cultivated people are stronger when the time comes?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Yashan's eyes lit up: "That's a constructive suggestion."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "We'll talk about it later! Our goal is to find companions to explore the unknown, not play games. If you want to play games, you might as well go race cars."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng realized he was right. If they started off on the wrong foot, they might end up just seeking amusement in the future.</p><p></p><p>So the arena idea was dropped.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "Yashan, you'll be in charge of the outstanding transmigrators from the Remodeled Stars, while Fengcheng, you'll be responsible for the ones on the Cruciform Star."</p><p></p><p>"Let's aim to cultivate ten thousand companions capable of exploring the universe with us within ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Old Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Previously, they only thought about how to live for ten thousand years. Now they were qualified to set a 'ten-thousand-year goal'.</p><p></p><p>After visiting the thirty-four planets, Su Hao had a basic understanding of these 'instances'.</p><p></p><p>He randomly chose one planet to land on. Looking around, he muttered: "First, build a small transitional space on each planet and place a 'sub-unit' of the First Primordial God to collect planetary data and generate specific tasks. Then..."</p>

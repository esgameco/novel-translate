        <h1>Chapter 913</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Yashān brought the elf king Vali and the orc king Heijier to the third planet, which was the winged people's planet.</p><p></p><p>The winged people who had crossed over to this place had luckily survived over the years. They even led a branch of the winged race to defeat the original orthodox winged king, becoming the new winged king themselves.</p><p></p><p>Yashān found that these crossover travelers who didn't die on the remodeled planets generally lived very well, at least becoming a local ruler. The most powerful had been invincible for many years.</p><p></p><p>When this winged king saw Yashān, the elf king Vali, and the orc king Heijier, various ideas flashed through his mind. In the end, he thought the three of them were the legendary 'Reincarnation Squad' coming to his world on a mission.</p><p></p><p>The winged king thought at the time: "I can't let them know I'm a crossover traveler. I still have to receive them as the winged king and cooperate with them to extract enough information. Then I'll find a way to join them and become a contractor of the Reincarnation Squad!"</p><p></p><p>So the winged king put on luxurious ornaments and came before the three with a group of winged people in formation.</p><p></p><p>Looking down arrogantly at the three, he said indifferently: "Who dares to trespass on this airspace without the permission of me, the great king of the winged race, Quanfugui Niubulasi?"</p><p></p><p>Before Yashān could speak, the elf king Vali and the orc king Heijier had already erupted.</p><p></p><p>They cursed loudly: "F*ck, you like showing off, don't you? Get him!"</p><p></p><p>Then the elf king Vali and the orc king Heijier immediately unleashed their full power and charged forward to fight.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the winds and clouds changed color, mountains crumbled, and rivers were diverted...</p><p></p><p>After a series of loud "booms", the winged king Quanfugui was seized by the two, each grabbing one of his wings, and dragged before Yashān to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>He cried and said, "Great Immortal Lord, I know I was wrong. Little Quanfugui will never dare again."</p><p></p><p>Yashān curiously asked, "Your name is Quanfugui?"</p><p></p><p>The winged king Quanfugui nodded and said, "Replying to the Great Immortal Lord, my name in my previous life was Quanfugui. How could I forget my roots when reincarnating? So when I was reborn, I changed back to my original name. Those who disagreed and tried to stop me from changing my name were defeated by me, and somehow I became the winged king. I didn't want that, but a person must uphold their principles. I cannot forget my roots."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali and the orc king Heijier immediately hung their heads in shame.</p><p></p><p>Yashān nodded and said, "That's right, one cannot forget their roots, even as a winged person. Well done, Fugui, get up! Would you like to leave this world with me in the future?"</p><p></p><p>The winged king Quanfugui immediately kowtowed vigorously, "Thank you Great Immortal Lord for your kindness. Little Quanfugui is more than willing."</p><p></p><p>Then Yashān brought the three kings to the world of the sea people.</p><p></p><p>Next was the sea king.</p><p></p><p>The sea people were born and raised in the sea, but this sea king was different. He liked the continents and the sky, traveling freely between lands every day with a lonely and invincible demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"No one in this world understands me. I have endured so much loneliness."</p><p></p><p>When Yashān and the four stood before him, he had not yet reacted and blankly stared at these four different-looking people, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>The winged king Quanfugui was extremely anxious: "Why don't you show off? If you don't show off, how can I charge up and beat you?"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, after failing to show off in front of Yashān and getting beaten earlier, he was eager to regain face in front of others.</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali and the orc king Heijier also looked ready to act.</p><p></p><p>After holding back for a long time, the sea king finally spoke: "I am the king that covers the heavens and subdues tigers."</p><p></p><p>Yashān and the others were speechless: "......"</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui glanced at Yashān and saw his interested look. He exchanged glances with the other two kings, then stepped forward and said, "Let's go beat the old tiger! Get him!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh~"</p><p></p><p>In the end, the sea king also knelt disheveled before Yashān: "Little fish Yuanshu greets the Immortal."</p><p></p><p>And so, every time they went to a remodeled planet to find crossover travelers, those crossovers would invariably get beaten first, and then obediently follow Yashān.</p><p></p><p>The group grew larger, and the crossover travelers became increasingly amazed, eventually becoming completely numb.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that they realized there were actually so many worlds...</p><p></p><p>And among them, half were human forms, while the other half were all kinds of strange creatures.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they all speculated about Yashān's identity.</p><p></p><p>To be able to freely travel between worlds in the universe while leading a group of people, even with their system abilities, it was hard for them to imagine such power.</p><p></p><p>After taking away the last crossover traveler, Yashān brought the fifty of them to a desolate planet.</p><p></p><p>Then he floated in mid-air and casually pointed down.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The rocky ground shook violently, rapidly transforming its shape and texture, rippling outwards. Countless buildings rose from the ground, and soon this land gained a beautiful cluster of pavilions and palaces.</p><p></p><p>This ability to remake heaven and earth left the crossover travelers gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Yashān smiled faintly, "Let's go down and talk."</p><p></p><p>The crossover travelers followed behind Yashān and flew down.</p><p></p><p>Inside a palace, Yashān stood on the platform and observed the fifty crossover travelers below. He said, "Now there is one last chance. If you want to return to your own world as a king, you can speak up now. I will send you back and respect your choice.</p><p></p><p>But if you stay here, perhaps for a very long time, you may not be able to return. Moreover, your future life will be very busy, lonely and boring. The only people you'll see are each other and me."</p><p></p><p>After waiting a moment and seeing no one wanted to leave, Yashān continued, "Very good. Surviving in the harsh primitive worlds you crossed into can be considered passing the first test. Next, you will face the second test - learning and exploration.</p><p></p><p>From today onwards, you will all address me as Teacher and follow me to learn.</p><p></p><p>But remember, you are not yet my true disciples. To become my disciple, you must complete the second test.</p><p></p><p>Rest assured, if you cannot become my disciple, I will send you back to your worlds."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yashān finished speaking, all the crossover travelers knelt and said in unison, "Greetings, Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Yashān's plan was simple - to lead these students in remodeling this desolate planet into a prosperous, beautiful life planet.</p><p></p><p>In the process of remodeling, he would teach the students various knowledge and set up various tests to stimulate their initiative and creativity.</p><p></p><p>During this, he would carefully observe each student's personality, traits and talents to decide whether to accept them as disciples.</p><p></p><p>The time limit was one hundred years.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use one hundred years to complete the task arranged by the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>As for these crossover student disciples, the sudden series of events left them bewildered but more excited.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had discovered a new world. Everything unknown that lay ahead sparked their desire for exploration and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>In just a couple of days, their horizons had already broadened greatly, no longer limited to a single planet.</p><p></p><p>In their free time, the elf king Vali approached his closest friends, the orc king Heijier and the winged king Quanfugui, and said, "Brothers, I haven't asked about your backgrounds yet. Before crossing over, I was a driver for our boss, but I also did some bodyguard work on the side."</p><p></p><p>The winged king Quanfugui exclaimed admiringly, "No wonder the Teacher values you so much. It's an inherited skill! I was just a small merchant in my previous life, selling whatever could make money. Life wasn't easy!"</p><p></p><p>The orc king chuckled, "You two are both smart and agile talents. I'm not so capable - I was part of a demolition team, a bit of a ruffian, best at smashing and intimidating people. Not fit for high society."</p><p></p><p>The elf king laughed, "Where are these humble words coming from, brothers? We're able to stand here, so there's no need for modesty."</p><p></p><p>He looked around and said in a low voice, "I don't think many people understand how great the Teacher is, or what it means for us to be here. They still have a wait-and-see attitude, which is a path to death! If we want to see more in the future, we need to constantly serve the Teacher's every need. We must not have any other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Brother Jier, Brother Fugui, I don't see you two as outsiders since you followed the Teacher first with me. So I can't help giving some extra advice - I hope you don't mind."</p><p></p><p>The orc king Heijier and winged king Quanfugui immediately expressed gratitude with serious expressions, "Thank you, Elder Brother Vali, for your guidance."</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali put his arms around their shoulders and smiled, "We're all brothers, no need to stand on ceremony."</p>

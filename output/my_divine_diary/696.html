        <h1>Chapter 696</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing ship was extremely important for the current Su Hao, as it was the key to whether he could successfully return to the Blue Light. If the Yuanxing ship suddenly disappeared, he would only be able to drift in this vast universe, hoping to encounter a human or Eight-Armed race ship someday, who knows when.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about learning human or Eight-Armed race technology at that point? Too much to ask!</p><p></p><p>After all, the last 500 years of his previous life spent in solitary research had given him a slight aversion to a world without any life.</p><p></p><p>After securing the Yuanxing ship, Su Hao returned to the small world in his dorm room. The pale red crystal vines spread out, forming an armor similar to a "command seed", enveloping him tightly.</p><p></p><p>The array on the armor activated, the "crispy defense" was triggered, and after releasing a cloaking spell, he flashed 80,000 meters away.</p><p></p><p>'Flash' 'Flash' 'Flash'!</p><p></p><p>He stopped flashing, and suddenly erupted a burst of force from under his feet, propelling him to accelerate towards the Insect Star planet.</p><p></p><p>About twenty hours later, he arrived at this colorful planet.</p><p></p><p>In the outer space of the planet, fresh insect eggs were seen floating densely everywhere.</p><p></p><p>How would a severe tryptophobia patient react to this sight?</p><p></p><p>They would die on the spot!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a large number of insect eggs were still being ejected from below.</p><p></p><p>According to the information, a planet that ejected insect eggs on such a massive scale was most likely a mature insect nest planet.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the floating insect eggs, Su Hao erupted a force from his feet and flew into the planet's atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The average temperature of the atmosphere was extremely high, around 80 degrees Celsius. As soon as he entered the atmosphere, he immediately felt a stifling sensation pressing down on him.</p><p></p><p>After entering the atmosphere, he saw many massive green spheres floating in the high altitude, like huge hot air balloons.</p><p></p><p>From these hot air balloons, a continuous stream of white ellipsoids were being ejected, like machine gun fire.</p><p></p><p>The insect eggs were being ejected into the air from these hot air balloons!</p><p></p><p>It looked quite interesting, so Su Hao moved closer and packaged an entire hot air balloon into the small world he had specially prepared for this.</p><p></p><p>A good start!</p><p></p><p>As for why Su Hao's courage had grown so immense that he dared to approach such strange things so casually...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained that this body was the "Eight-Armed God", so what did it have to do with him? No matter how dangerous, it wouldn't fall on his head, right?</p><p></p><p>Hmm... the second spare "Eight-Armed God" was already being produced. At most, within a year, the "Eight-Armed God" would be in oversupply, so he could be as reckless as he wanted without any worries.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try the 'Insect God' when I get back? I can play with some new tricks."</p><p></p><p>With the wonderful thought of experimenting on the Insect Star creatures, Su Hao quickly approached the ground.</p><p></p><p>The overall ground appeared yellow and blue, but upon closer inspection, he found that the dazzling colors were distributed in spots, presenting a breathtakingly beautiful scene before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The only discomfort was that this exquisite painting was constantly in motion.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao focused his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Good heavens, they were all huge insects!</p><p></p><p>These insects had obviously discovered Su Hao's unusual existence, and the insect swarm quickly became agitated.</p><p></p><p>Some insects the size of flying ants spread their wings and buzzed towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Their two large mandibles below their mouths opened wide, as if trying to bite Su Hao in half.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was quite surprised: "I'm even cloaked, yet they can still detect my presence? But this works out well!"</p><p></p><p>The flying ants were gigantic, the size of a water buffalo, but they flew quite fast, quickly approaching Su Hao and willingly entering his small world.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao accepted them all without hesitation. As he moved closer, he realized the ground was completely covered in insects, stretching as far as the eye could see, densely packed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the entire planet had become the territory of insects.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't even find a place to land.</p><p></p><p>Too many!</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his divine consciousness, he couldn't help but let out a "Wow!"</p><p></p><p>Not only were there insects covering the surface, but underground was also full of insects, with almost no soil or rock structure remaining - everything was a special black substance...</p><p></p><p>"Is this a planet formed by insects? Too shocking, to think there are such species in the universe."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and realized he wanted variety, not quantity. So he threw out some of the flying ant insects he had collected to make more room, then charged downwards.</p><p></p><p>Collect, collect, collect!</p><p></p><p>The huge mandibles bit into his shield, making "crack crack" sounds.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao pushed forward like a bulldozer, horizontally shoving the insects aside while collecting different types into his small world.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the ground in front surged upwards, flinging countless insects into the air as they slid off the sides. An enormously large armored beetle emerged from underground.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao estimated its height to be 80 meters tall!</p><p></p><p>The giant armored beetle roared frantically at Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Then it opened its huge mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Poof! Woosh!"</p><p></p><p>Scorching flames blasted towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually raised his hand, and an arc-shaped shield abruptly appeared in front of him, blocking the gushing flames.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble~"</p><p></p><p>One after another, more fire-breathing giant armored beetles emerged from the surroundings, encircling Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the surrounding swarms of insects had retreated, leaving only the massive fire-breathing armored beetles.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao marveled: "Oh? These insects' attacks seem to be organized."</p><p></p><p>He observed for a moment and indeed confirmed it was true.</p><p></p><p>"Huuurrr!"</p><p></p><p>Massive flames spewed forth, completely surrounding Su Hao in the middle like a huge barbecue pit.</p><p></p><p>However, such an imposing attack had little effect on Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He flashed through the encircling flames and approached one of the gigantic armored beetles.</p><p></p><p>'Collect'!</p><p></p><p>'Collect, collect, collect'!</p><p></p><p>To it, Su Hao was just a tiny bean.</p><p></p><p>It rumbled towards Su Hao, then aimed its tail at him.</p><p></p><p>"Poooff!"</p><p></p><p>A massive torrent of green viscous liquid, like a flood, sprayed towards Su Hao, blocking his escape route.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao didn't dodge. Instead, he was quite curious about what was being sprayed at him.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p></p><p>His shield was drenched, and then started sizzling as the acid corroded it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised: "Well well, quite formidable to actually corrode through my spell shield."</p><p></p><p>Then he moved closer.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and scooped some of the acid from the insect's body.</p><p></p><p>'Collect'!</p><p></p><p>Next, various powerful insects took turns appearing, like a martial arts tournament, using their own special abilities to attack Su Hao, only to be collected into his small world.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because the insects kept attacking with different abilities that Su Hao confirmed they were organized, with an intelligent life form controlling their actions.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be trying to find Su Hao's weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Su Hao's curiosity: Who was controlling the insects' attacks? The insect queen?</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then decided to try a different location.</p><p></p><p>"The insects here have already grasped some of my information and are purposefully attacking me in a targeted manner. If I go to a very distant place and the insects there also launch organized attacks against me from the start, it would suggest that the insects on this entire planet are likely under the same control system."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Su Hao immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>This time, giant floating umbrella insects appeared in the sky, moving slowly but with vicious attacks.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the umbrella tips lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Kachak~"</p><p></p><p>A lightning bolt as thick as a leg struck down onto Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pretended to be overwhelmed, shuddering all over as if on the verge of collapse. Then he erupted a burst of force from his feet and fled towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding insect swarms excitedly screeched.</p><p></p><p>'Flash' 'Flash'...</p><p></p><p>At an extremely fast speed, he reached the other side of the planet, then revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sky was filled with the umbrella-shaped insects.</p><p></p><p>The insect swarm seemed completely inexperienced, acting rather straightforwardly. After a brief test, the result was out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Indeed, they're all part of the same system."</p>

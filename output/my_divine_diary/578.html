        <h1>Chapter 578</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This world hadn't experienced a large-scale war in too long, too long, and what it did have was only small extermination struggles that didn't exceed a thousand battles at the largest scale.</p><p></p><p>As a direct result, battles on the scale of ten thousand people could only be seen, learned, and imagined in books. However, commanding a battle, just relying on imagination is not enough.</p><p></p><p>With the mobilization of a large amount of money, the Imperial Clan managed to gather tens of thousands of teams consisting of ordinary soldiers and source mages, and drove towards the city of Hirakong, with the slogan of purging the evil sect 'Illuminati' in one breath.</p><p></p><p>However, the reality is cruel, no command experience commander first command ten thousand people team out, just set off encountered all sorts of problems, before leaning jin Hirakong city, the team is almost collapsed, needless to say what the combat power, can normally go to Hirakong city are good.</p><p></p><p>Guangyao will not let go of this kind of opportunity, take the initiative to send two hundred people source mage team to try to raid, far away from throwing some skills, did not wait for the other side to chase to run.</p><p></p><p>As for the Royal Family's team, many source mages, once they saw the enemy, under the stimulation of money, wailed and rushed out to chase, but were already ambushed by the people who had already beaten them, surrendered their weapons, and after placing Peng in a ''ideological mobilization meeting'', they joined the Illumination Society.</p><p></p><p>So back and forth a few times, the royal organization's team completely stayed put, a mess, many source squads see the situation is not good, take advantage of the night to sneak away, just a few days, the royal team completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The first expedition was declared a failure.</p><p></p><p>The royal family learned a lesson from the bitter experience, and replaced the previous Prince's generals with slightly famous all-powerful ministers, and after two months of thorough preparation, they once again gathered a team of 4,000 source mages, and set off towards the city of Pingkong.</p><p></p><p>This time the ranks were finally decent, looking the part of an expedition to clear out the rebels, with advance preparation for the kind of tactics that the Illuminati would use to lure in an ambush - keep the ranks and push forward flat.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was in the improvised tactical command headquarters, frowning at the map in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>And Zhi Peng's friends and part-time staff officers pondered the countermeasures as well.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhi Peng's heart was the most complicated, the essence of the Illumination Society that he had formed was to target the reckless royal family, and he had never thought of confronting the source mages in the first place.</p><p></p><p>He grew up listening to heroic stories of source mages, and his parents were one of them, so he had a natural reverence for those source mages who fought against various disasters and protected the world, and he was unwilling to kill these source mages in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, the truth was so cruel, when the source mages stood against the Illumination Society, he had to suppress his heart and give an attack order to the royal organization's source mage team.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of contradiction made him feel very uncomfortable, and he even questioned if what he was doing, was the right thing to do.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that he couldn't hesitate, he had to make a decision on the spot and make a choice as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Snap!"</p><p></p><p>He stood up boldly, slapped his big hand on the table, and firmly said, "Choose the third option - 'guerrilla division', mentally disintegrate the other party's fighting spirit, capture as many source mages as possible, and later, through the mobilization meeting, invite them to to join our Illumination Society and participate in this sacred cause together."</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'guerrilla division' tactic was actually to make use of the 'transit orb's' rapid transfer ability, flexibly transferring between the ten surrounding cities such as Pingkong City, avoiding the Imperial Race's crowded teams, swallowing up the teams with fewer people, and holding a mobilization meeting to turn the enemy into a friend.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Guangyao Association only had two thousand source mage friends, while the team organized by the royal family was more than four thousand people, so they definitely couldn't take advantage of it head-on, but the Guangyao Association had a very huge advantage, which was the 'Transit Orb' that Su Hao had given them.</p><p></p><p>If the royal team is four thousand people gathered in one place, then the light will directly transfer elsewhere, do not fight with each other, no matter how, the royal team can not be reins to catch up with them, so consume who is afraid of who.</p><p></p><p>If the royal team dares to organize a siege, then they will choose the team with the smallest number of people, more than 2,000 members of the Illuminati will hoot and holler together to surge up, to bully the few, the other side will be directly eliminated, and then to the prisoners to open a mobilization meeting, become friends.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, that's playing rogue!</p><p></p><p>However, this could be bitter for Feng Cheng, after Zhi Peng announced the response plan, his face flashed with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>He was the one who had experienced the entire change in the Immortal Cultivation World, and had always known that change was very cruel, and that there was always bloodshed and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>According to his idea, he would help Guangyao create a dozen or so 10,000 explosive bombs and directly throw them at the opposing team, blowing them up for good, so why play so many fancy things.</p><p></p><p>Now the good change and war, was played by them as a game, this can not work?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng secretly said: "If not for the Wei boss backing, these people can achieve great things? I'm just kidding! These people of theirs are playing energetically, but this is a pain in the ass for me, to protect his safety, when is this day going to be the end of the day ...... Crap, now it is ready to arrive at lunch time, I have to go back to cook for Boss Wei and Boss Yashan."</p><p></p><p>As for the safety of Set Peng, can it be as important as Boss Wei and Boss Yashan's lunch?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is no rush, he cooks quickly, without delaying anything, if Zhi Peng was touched up and fucked to death after he left for a while, then it can only be said that Zhi Peng this person is unlucky, death is death.</p><p></p><p>The big deal is that he will personally go out and help Boss Wei to clear out all the royal families in this world!</p><p></p><p>This in his view is very simple, build him ten eight ten thousand explosion, directly throw down that what king's palace, clean and fresh!</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Feng Cheng held it for a few seconds, finally finished preparing for the teleportation, disappeared in a flash, and went back to cook.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Imperial Race team came to Pingkong City, but there was nothing they could do about it, so they tried all kinds of methods, and in the end, after losing more than a thousand people, they retreated.</p><p></p><p>The second expedition of the Imperial Race team was declared a failure a month later, and it was not known when the third expedition would take place.</p><p></p><p>Those who were originally confident in saying that 'within half a year, Guang Yao Club will definitely be destroyed' changed their words to 'within a year, Guang Yao Club will definitely be destroyed'.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, excluding the dead source mages, these thousand people had all become new friends of the Illuminati.</p><p></p><p>In order to facilitate the management, Zhi Peng gave his friends a simple categorization, divided into [first level friends], [second level friends],...... the current highest [fifth level friends].</p><p></p><p>His friends are all working hard to become Zhi Peng's [Level 5 friends], and are very active in their work and fights. ......</p><p></p><p>Very outrageous!</p><p></p><p>Also let the whole watching Feng Cheng scalp numb, daily are directly two ears plugged up, do not dare to have too much communication with Zhi Peng, afraid of one day suddenly also become Zhi Peng's [level 5 friends].</p><p></p><p>Time passes in a hurry, and a year passes quickly.</p><p></p><p>The royal family also did not organize a source mage team to go out to Pingkong City, but switched their strategy, frequently sending people to Pingkong City to negotiate, seeking ways to coexist, as if they had already acquiesced to the existence of the Guangyao Association.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, buying time to hold back big moves?</p><p></p><p>Anything that was not as important as his research.</p><p></p><p>It was also this year of concentration that allowed Su Hao to finally find the principle of transforming matter into a source.</p><p></p><p>He controlled his inner excitement and kept his face relatively calm, faintly spitting out two words, "Temperature!"</p><p></p><p>The answer was unexpectedly simple for Su Hao, but it took him an unknown amount of time.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the hint of tail that he had touched from the source beast by chance, this time would have to be stretched even longer.</p><p></p><p>During this year, he had repeatedly conducted many experiments, and had also repeatedly observed the phenomenon of microscopic particles suddenly transforming into 'sources' after undergoing a certain frequency of movement.</p><p></p><p>Having previously thought that it had something to do with that particular rhythm of motion, he later realized that it was not so.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason for the transformation of matter into a source was that a certain extremely small particle, whose temperature had reached its highest limit in a split second, thus transformed into a 'source', remained relatively stable!</p><p></p><p>And the kind of regular and violent movement that Su Hao observed was merely one of the conditions used to heat the random particle.</p><p></p><p>The 'source vessel' that he had once made on his own, although it could also move according to that kind of regularity, it had essentially failed to heat up the particles to the extreme degree, and naturally, it was unable to obtain the 'source' that he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao marveled, ''Heating the particles ah! Heat it up to 142 trillion kelvins above ......"</p>

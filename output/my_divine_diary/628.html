        <div class="content">
            <p>It had been thirty years since he came to this world, and if he hadn't guessed wrongly, there were still roughly seventy years until the outbreak, and Su Hao wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The so-called anomaly would come one day.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded and said, "Good, keep paying attention, it must be measured once a year to avoid accidents!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Okay, Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked Yashan: "How is your research on fantasy mages and source weapons?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Boss Wei, the functional area of the source has been initially analyzed, and currently I'm able to create some simple source weapons, such as 'lightning increase' source weapons, 'flame increase' source weapons, 'Strength Increase' source artifacts, and so on.</p><p></p><p>However, if I want to realize various special functions, such as 'carve a boat', 'dazzle' and other effects, I'm still trying to parse and assemble them.</p><p></p><p>According to the current progress speculation, it would probably take another twenty years or so.</p><p></p><p>In addition, I've also figured out products that combine electrical appliances, spells, and source artifacts, and was able to obtain quite a few interesting items.</p><p></p><p>For example, a defensive suit that shrinks and fits freely, such as a weapon that freely changes size.</p><p></p><p>With the research, the number of items that can be obtained will, I'm sure, increase."</p><p></p><p>So it seemed that everything was looking up.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was progress, Su Hao wasn't going to ask for too much, he thought for a moment and said, "Yashan, you continue to do the analysis of the source weapon, and while you do that, design the structure of this little world of ours, I plan to make this place into a spaceship, and after that, we'll take this spaceship and go into space."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's face was filled with longing, "Okay, Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned to the middle of the lab, looking at the various substances stored on the rows of shelves, he couldn't help but reveal a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>In ten years' time, he had already successfully transformed most of the common compounds with the source, and stored them so far without any problems, they were indeed substances.</p><p></p><p>His research experiments had reached this point, and he had already counted on reaching his initial goal!</p><p></p><p>However, what Su Hao wanted was not just that.</p><p></p><p>He still had to use the source to transform as many substances as he wanted at will, including blood qi and spiritual energy; he also had to find the 'doom system' with himself as the focal point, and then crack it and take control of it; he also had to integrate what he had learned over the years, absorb it completely, and turn it into his own; he also had to explore this mysterious universe, and head for the stars! Deep into the depths of ......</p><p></p><p>There were many, many more things he had to do!</p><p></p><p>"Let's put an end to the parsing of compounds here for now! Other uncommon substances will be studied later when we have time.</p><p></p><p>For now! Turn to 'irrational number' mixtures! Start by cracking the 'blood qi' at the very beginning! Within five years, take it down!"</p><p></p><p>Five years seemed like a long time, but for how difficult it was, five years was still very short.</p><p></p><p>Using a source to directly transform into 'integer' monomers and 'fractional' compounds was relatively not that difficult. But trying to use a source to directly obtain mixtures, the difficulty was not generally high.</p><p></p><p>The hardest part was that the different substances would interfere with each other during the conversion process, forming some other products and not being able to obtain the desired mixture.</p><p></p><p>This point would be difficult to solve.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to even figure out where exactly they interfere with each other.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only difficult, Su Hao believed that he would be able to find a solution.</p><p></p><p>"Blood qi is a kind of biological energy, and each unit of blood qi consists of three basic factors, named 'energy factor,' 'excitation factor,' and 'balance factor,' and the three interact with each other in order to have all sorts of special effects. ', and the three interact with each other in order to have all sorts of special effects ......</p><p></p><p>From the time I acquired blood qi until now, it has been an unknown number of years, and I have long since studied it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>However, if you want to use the source to directly transform to get the blood qi, you still need to test the blood qi's 'frequency band', 'energy factor', 'mass-to-body ratio' and other basic data first ......"</p><p></p><p>As for how to test it?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually created a fist-sized piece of spherical space, and then the majestic blood qi in his body violently surged into this tiny space, instantly filling it up.</p><p></p><p>It was seen that on his palm, there was a dark red ball of qi, as if it was locked by an invisible barrier, unable to leak out, condensed in the tiny space, circulating and flowing unhurriedly, looking very stable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start by measuring the concentration of blood qi under standard pressure!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>With this, Su Hao entered the middle of the lab again and started his research.</p><p></p><p>After the slow progress of research, or thinking in a difficult situation, he left the laboratory, running all over the world, traveling over the mountains, the sky and sea, downtown palaces, everywhere there is his figure, and no one knows his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>When he was playing, inspiration suddenly came to his mind, and he immediately went into the laboratory to realize all the inspiration into a data or a formula.</p><p></p><p>In addition, every once in a while, Su Hao and the three of them would get together with Ah Xing and Ah Wang to talk about the recent situation and the past.</p><p></p><p>The two of their children are a boy and a girl, Ah Xing Ah Wang gave these two little ones fixed doll marriage, but also took the liberty of helping the small children to press the handprint ......</p><p></p><p>Just don't know what expression those two little ones will have when they know in the future.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang two people are now retired from the mage association, secluded in the town of Huai Shui, Gu Yin president is also gradually old, retired, said to the president of the town of Huai Shui mage association to Ah Xing, Ah Xing also did not agree.</p><p></p><p>According to Xing, without the bizarre disasters, the motivation to be a mage has faded, and he can't get excited about the magical beasts roaming in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>And he said that if his own children liked it, then he would train them to become a powerful mage.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps many years later, the story of two teenage 'magicians' and their powerful father will unfold.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, those who were close to Su Hao's trio slowly discovered some problems.</p><p></p><p>That is, why was Su Hao's trio clearly already in their forties, but still looked like they were once in their twenties?</p><p></p><p>After so many years had passed, the appearance had not even changed a bit!</p><p></p><p>The 'Lucky Star Five Handsome Men' that once made young girls all over the world think about them day and night were now only three left.</p><p></p><p>This made Xing Awan simply unable to accept it!</p><p></p><p>They pursued Su Hao to ask if he had any secret recipes for maintenance.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Not only is youth everlasting, but it can also increase longevity. If you two want to learn, look for Feng Cheng to teach you, he is now a teacher, specializing in the business of teaching people."</p><p></p><p>Xing and Wang wanted to learn Immortal Cultivation, Su Hao was willing to teach, Fei Yuanyuan could learn if he wanted to, as for the others, that would be fine.</p><p></p><p>This world didn't have 'aura wave' radiation, the human body in this world, also didn't have the corresponding talent to cultivate immortality, wanting to cultivate immortality was a very troublesome thing, aura was on the one hand, elixir was on the other hand, the resources to be consumed to cultivate immortality was much more than imagined, there was no value to popularize it in this world at all.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang had wanted to find Feng Cheng to learn, but after returning home and seeing his wife whose face was also gradually aging, they changed their minds.</p><p></p><p>The face is forever ...... or not to learn it!</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang could not imagine the fear of their wives slowly aging while their faces remained young.</p><p></p><p>It's a betrayal of love for the sake of looks.</p><p></p><p>After thinking long and hard, Sing and Wang chose their love.</p><p></p><p>However, Ah Xing Ah Wang has a wife and children, do not want their most cherished people in aging pain, choose to accompany, choose not to learn.</p><p></p><p>But Feiyuan, who did not have a wife and children, was unattached, and after noticing the difference between Su Hao and the others, he pondered for a long time, and finally asked the doubts in his heart in front of Su Hao, and received the same answer as Asing Ahwang.</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan did not hesitate and chose to study.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao had designed his Immortal Cultivation Talent for him, and then used the Gene Modification Liquid to help him obtain the Immortal Cultivation Talent, he directly told him to go to Feng Cheng to learn how to cultivate Immortality.</p><p></p><p>After two years of cultivation with Feng Cheng's help and becoming an honorable 'Foundation Establishment Realm' cultivator, Feiyuan realized a very serious problem.</p><p></p><p>"These three Mr. Jia are not right! It's very likely that they are aliens!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, everything is figured out!"</p><p></p><p>"I xxx, I actually hung out with three aliens!"</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial thing is that these three aliens are actually willing to unreservedly impart their most precious knowledge to me? Simply ...... unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>In his imagination, when the aliens came, the first thing they did was definitely to rule the world, and then capture slaves, sell human beings, or directly exterminate their clans and seize the planet ......</p><p></p><p>"These three aliens I encountered are too nice to talk to!"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Feiyuan decided to confess his findings.</p><p></p><p>Simply because when he was facing Su Hao, it was as if he was facing an all-knowing god, and if he had something to hide in his heart, he would inevitably be nervous in front of Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to be like that, he wanted to be open in his heart when he exchanged knowledge with Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>In his opinion, how could a mortal like him hide from a god?</p><p></p><p>Thus, Fei Yuan found Su Hao's free point of time and directly approached him, saying in person, "Mr. Javi ...... you ...... you're an alien, right!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was filled with surprise: "???"</p><p></p><p>What the hell alien?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 569</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the past year or two, Su Hao had collected quite a few source devices, and was able to observe the phenomenon of various materials gradually transforming into sources around the source devices. He thought he would soon be able to grasp the patterns behind it, and then even without using source devices, he could achieve the materialization of sources.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he thought too much. The conditions required for materials to transform into sources were much more complex and stringent than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>When he simulated the manifestation of the source device with runes, he did not successfully transform materials into sources.</p><p></p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>This indicated one issue - Su Hao's observations were incomplete, and the conditions he simulated were also not complete, inevitably lacking some necessary factors.</p><p></p><p>It's like how people see a match igniting dry grass and think that as long as there is a flame, it can ignite all combustible materials, but they don't see that for combustion, in addition to high temperatures, oxygen is also required; people see a four-wheeled car running on the ground and think that by putting on four wheels, it can run that fast, but they don't see the internal engine and fuel...</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's spiritual observation, the entire structure of the source device was exposed without concealment. At first, he thought that as long as he manifested all these structures, he could master the method of transforming materials into sources.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was not the case.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was not everything. At least his spiritual observation could not allow him to see finer and deeper things, or even if he saw them, he could not understand what those special structures and movements meant.</p><p></p><p>It's like taking apart a computer case and seeing the internal structure of the computer - can you easily manufacture a computer and realize all its functions?</p><p></p><p>It's the same principle as Su Hao's spiritual observation of the source device.</p><p></p><p>Now the problem is, what method can be used to manifest the things hidden inside the source device.</p><p></p><p>"The bouncing ball space has indeed recorded the entire structure of the source device, and my spiritual observation has verified this. Since this is the case, why did my simulation fail?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered for a long time, and finally arrived at a direction: "Perhaps...the source device I recorded is only a 'component' of the source device!"</p><p></p><p>But even if Su Hao's guess was correct, there was currently no way to solve the problem. Fundamentally, he had too little information and lacked sufficient understanding of this entire world.</p><p></p><p>But there's no rush, he's only twenty years old, still young. From a time perspective, time is on his side...</p><p></p><p>Since the observation methods are not comprehensive, then find ways to increase observation methods. Since there is not enough information, then go find ready-made information!</p><p></p><p>If this world ends up being destroyed because of him, and he still fails to successfully unravel the secrets of the source, then perhaps in order to continue researching the source, he will choose to board a spaceship and wander in space, wandering for as many years as he can until he can wander no more.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that in Su Hao's view, the mysteries of the source were so important to him, even more important than this planet itself.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng's "preaching and making friends" work was progressing very smoothly. A month later, he began to send his good friends to the experimental base one after another to receive Ya Shan's transformation. As the business became more and more proficient, the number of people sent over also increased, making Ya Shan smile from ear to ear.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Feng Cheng was also frantically studying all kinds of knowledge. Every time Su Hao saw him, his eyes were bloodshot and he looked like he hadn't slept well for a long time. Although his appearance had dropped a notch, his knowledge was indeed advancing by leaps and bounds. Under Ya Shan's occasional guidance, he could also serve as Ya Shan's assistant in researching the spiritual frequency segment and lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, Su Hao still hadn't found a new way to observe the source device, and his research work had once again stagnated. He couldn't help but sigh, "Since I can't figure it out, then I won't think about it anymore. For now, I should just go to various places and collect more information!"</p><p></p><p>He had collected a lot of information, and also obtained some useful intelligence, but not much. It was like a huge knowledge jigsaw puzzle - he could only get some small fragments, still far from seeing what the whole picture looked like.</p><p></p><p>At one point, he really wanted to rush into the Yixuan City Imperial Palace, hold a knife to the emperor's throat and say, "Robbery! Hand over all the secret documents and information from the Hengxuan District."</p><p></p><p>But it was just a thought. In reality, the emperor's power was not that great, and his life might not be worth more than the value of those materials! In the end, he could only get some perfunctory things. Instead, it would make them hide the truly useful things even deeper. Compared to what others gave him, Su Hao was more willing to believe what he obtained himself.</p><p></p><p>If he really couldn't find anything useful in the next year or two, Su Hao didn't mind trying to rob someone, to test if the strategy of "stirring up a hornet's nest" would work or not.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering how to get the information, his spiritual perception sensed a special fluctuation coming from the distant sea - a fluctuation he was very familiar with, which was the phenomenon of a living creature shedding and transforming into a source beast.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and marveled, "What a lucky fish, becoming a source beast and becoming a dominant force in the ocean. And there are no human source masters coming out to clear them, so they can live freely and at ease. However, the transformation of living beings into source beasts is indeed a miraculous thing. I wonder what changes occur during the process..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he gradually trailed off, the smile on his face freezing as if time had stopped.</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened, flashing with scorching light.</p><p></p><p>"Damn! Why didn't I think of it - source beasts! I can observe the shedding process of source beasts to find the secrets of how materials transform into sources!"</p><p></p><p>His bouncing ball space had an extremely special characteristic - it could record consciousness information!</p><p></p><p>This was an absolute divine tool for studying living beings. How could he have forgotten about this?</p><p></p><p>For inanimate objects like source devices that could not establish ultra-remote state resonance, he could not observe the source devices' dynamics in real-time. But for conscious living beings like source beasts, he could.</p><p></p><p>And the source beast itself possessed the special ability to "transform materials into sources" just like source devices.</p><p></p><p>"Since studying source devices is not feasible, then I don't need to insist on source devices. By changing the research subject, I may be able to solve the bottleneck I've been stuck on all along! I should have thought of this earlier! My brain doesn't seem to be working well enough...I should take the opportunity to try upgrading the 'Prophet Human'. Hmm, those royal family members can be used as experimental subjects."</p><p></p><p>Since he had thought of a new research direction, Su Hao immediately took action. Transforming into 'Destiny Child', he used the 'Water Body Technique' to flash and disappear from his original spot, appearing next to the fish that had just transformed into a source beast.</p><p></p><p>This lucky fish was about as big as a person, colorful and beautiful. It was happily swimming in the water, its pointed mouth opening and closing, as if celebrating having undergone the shedding transformation and becoming the ruler of the ocean. It was completely unaware that an even greater fortune awaited it.</p><p></p><p>Its transformation brought enlightenment to Su Hao. If this world had a heavenly way, it would probably send down auspicious seven-colored clouds and merits to reward this fish.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao appeared next to this colorful fish, startling it into shuddering and about to dart away, but it found that at one point, it could no longer move.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reached out and touched the fish, then infused it with his blood energy, recording its consciousness information including its physical information. With a wave of his hand, he released his restraint on the seawater, allowing the large fish to swim away.</p><p></p><p>He entered the bouncing ball space without delay, observing the fish's physical state and real-time changes. About an hour later, Su Hao's lips curved up as he silently said, "My thinking was not wrong. Observing the shedding of source beasts is indeed feasible! I will definitely find the secrets of how materials transform into sources from the source beasts!"</p><p></p><p>He wandered around the surrounding sea areas and found that there were many marine creatures in this area, feeling very satisfied. "This sea area now belongs to me."</p>

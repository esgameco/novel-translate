        <h1>Chapter 829</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When faced with this kind of situation, explanations were impossible. The mother dragon Shaduo herself was a hot-tempered, extremely violent mother dragon. Extremely disappointed and furious at the same time, she didn't even hear what Muti said, and directly charged at him with a huge dragon tail swing.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The tail whipped Muti in the face, forcibly cutting off whatever he was going to say next. His entire dragon head was flung to the side, his massive body toppling sideways and crashing into the rock wall.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble" it dislodged quite a few loose rocks.</p><p></p><p>The slightly smaller mother dragon who witnessed this was also stunned. She immediately rushed to Muti's side, standing protectively in front of him and glaring angrily at Shaduo: "Who are you? What do you want to do, why..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish speaking, Shaduo leapt up and kicked her away. She slammed into Muti.</p><p></p><p>Muti flipped over and roared: "Shaduo, stop!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Then Muti was also kicked over by Shaduo, letting out a cry of pain.</p><p></p><p>Next, Shaduo raised her feet and frantically attacked, clawing and scratching, occasionally opening her mouth to bite. In no time, she had scratched Muti's body bloody.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—"</p><p></p><p>Muti let out an angry roar, a golden light shining from within and forming a shield that blasted outwards, pushing Shaduo back.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo was hit by the massive force and kept stumbling backwards. Caught off guard, she almost fell over, only managing to regain her balance when Suhao stepped forward and propped her up with his claws.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo looked down and saw it was her own child. She barely regained a bit of rationality and said to Suhao: "Ryan Oakes, this is a matter between elders, you don't need to intervene. I can handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>In Shaduo's view, Suhao's abilities were too powerful. If he wasn't careful, he could accidentally harm her life. But obviously, things hadn't reached the point of needing to take Muti's life - she just needed to beat him up to vent her anger.</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "Of course, Mother Shaduo can decide for herself. But if Mother Shaduo is worried I'll go overboard, you really don't need to. I can beat him to whatever extent you require, not deviating in the slightest."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo nodded: "Don't worry Ryan, I can handle it myself. Just keep an eye on your brother and sister, so they don't get caught up in our fight."</p><p></p><p>It was clear Shaduo hadn't vented her anger enough yet, the fury still burning fiercely within her.</p><p></p><p>Over a year ago, at her husband Muti's urging, she had left their ancestral home alone and passed through the perilous Heavenly Passage to reach the Cloud Mountain Range, where she gave birth to three children. Then day and night without stopping, she incubated them, and after they were born, devoted herself to raising them...</p><p></p><p>Her three children had almost been stolen by despicable humans, and she and her children had nearly been killed by the human divine envoy.</p><p></p><p>But she never expected that the husband she trusted so much would actually get together with other mother dragons while she was away. This was simply unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo's tail glowed orange, and she suddenly lashed it towards Muti.</p><p></p><p>"Bang—"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous crash shook the entire cave.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo raised her claws imbued with soul power and charged forward again, continuously scratching at Muti, but each strike was blocked by the golden light around his body.</p><p></p><p>Muti shouted: "Enough Shaduo! If you keep going, I won't hold back."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo opened her mouth slightly towards Muti, preparing her dragon's breath of fire.</p><p></p><p>Muti's pupils contracted slightly. If he got hit by that, he'd definitely lose some scales. And critically, they were still inside the cave, with nowhere to dodge.</p><p></p><p>'Golden Light Burst'!</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>A powerful force erupted outwards, forming a shockwave that swept horizontally in all directions. Shaduo and the smaller mother dragon were both blown away by the massive force, interrupting Shaduo's prepared breath attack.</p><p></p><p>The three little dragon cubs at the entrance to the chamber were like ants in a storm, involuntarily blown away and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "The power seems decent. A huge dragon's massive body means they sometimes face smaller opponents clinging to them. This move is perfect for blowing those enemies away."</p><p></p><p>He flipped and landed steadily, while the other two little cubs flew against the wind to his side, snarling and waving their claws.</p><p></p><p>After regaining her footing, Shaduo couldn't help but look back at her three children, worried they'd been caught up in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Suhao gave her a reassuring look: "No problem, you two can continue."</p><p></p><p>However, Shaduo ultimately prioritized her own children and did not continue attacking Muti. Instead, she pointed at the bewildered smaller mother dragon: "Muti, let me beat up this vile dragon and throw her out, then this matter is settled."</p><p></p><p>She started walking towards the smaller mother dragon. The smaller one bared her teeth defiantly at Shaduo, unafraid.</p><p></p><p>But Muti blocked Shaduo's path: "Her name is Dian, she is also my wife. I won't let you harm her, Shaduo."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo: "Do you even know what you're saying, Muti???"</p><p></p><p>Muti: "I got together with Dian two years ago. It was my mistake, but I don't regret it."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo: "!!!"</p><p></p><p>Muti: "A year and a half ago, you became pregnant with our children. I was overjoyed and planned to raise our children together. But three months after you got pregnant, Dian also became pregnant with my child.</p><p></p><p>I fell into a dilemma, thinking hard until I finally came up with a good idea: As long as one of you left the ancestral home to go to the fertile Cloud Mountain Range and give birth there, while I stayed behind to care for the other's child, the problem would be solved.</p><p></p><p>But Dian is too weak and frail, nowhere near as powerful as you Shaduo. It would be too dangerous for her to go to the Cloud Mountains alone. So I convinced you, and you agreed to go to the Cloud Mountains alone to give birth and raise the children.</p><p></p><p>I just never expected you to come back so soon...</p><p></p><p>Dian's two children were born very quickly. I hope you and Dian can coexist peacefully."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo was simply stunned: "So when you told me a year ago that our ancestral home was too desolate to raise all three children, that was a lie?"</p><p></p><p>Muti: "Not entirely a lie..."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo roared angrily: "Ryan, beat him up badly for me."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually replied: "Got it, Mother Shaduo."</p><p></p><p>Muti looked at Suhao curiously: "This is my chi..."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Before Muti could finish, he was cut off by a dull crash. His chest suddenly caved in deeply, eyes bulging, unable to even groan.</p><p></p><p>Suhao flicked his palm lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Muti and Mother Dian were both slapped and stuck to the wall, without even a chance to use defensive soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Bam bam!"</p><p></p><p>They then slid down from the wall.</p><p></p><p>Muti and Dian were dazed: "What just happened?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao walked up slowly, clenching his fists. He gave Muti and Dian a smile, then started throwing punches.</p><p></p><p>Muti instinctively used a defensive technique, a golden light shimmering around his body.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The golden light shattered instantly. Muti's face caved in deeply as his head whipped back, slamming into the wall. The massive force made him rebound forward right into Suhao's next punch.</p><p></p><p>"Bam bam bam..."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo also stepped up and started viciously beating the just-awakened Dian.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the agonized wails of the dragons echoed out from this cave.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's older dragon brother Chipu and younger sister Moli watched with interest from the side, excitedly trying to imitate Suhao's moves, punching and kicking Muti while squealing excitedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Shaduo led the three dragon cubs out of the cave, she flew aimlessly along the cliffs of the ancestral home.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Shaduo turned to Chipu and Moli: "Chipu, Moli, from now on you no longer have a father. That scumbag Muti is unfit to be your father. Your names will now be Chipu Oakes and Moli Oakes."</p><p></p><p>The two little cubs didn't understand the implications, only feeling happy that their names now matched their mother's and younger brother's.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo fell silent for a moment, then said: "Ryan, my child, I'll take you to the temple of the Heavenly God Nati to undergo the soul awakening ritual. But before that, we need to obtain enough food."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually pointed: "That's easy, there's some over there."</p><p></p><p>Shaduo flew in the direction Suhao indicated, preparing to hunt enough food.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Suhao's main body in the second-level world looked at the two dragon eggs in his hands and smiled: "These two dragon eggs I casually brought back will be perfect for awakening Yashan and Fengcheng. I never expected to gain something on my return to the dragon ancestral home."</p><p></p><p>These two dragon eggs looked like they would hatch very soon, so Suhao didn't need to spend more time slowly incubating them.</p>

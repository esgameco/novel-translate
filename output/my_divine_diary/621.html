        <h1>Chapter 621</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the other two were like three diligent little bees, continuously moving the mountain peaks of that stone forest into space, then turning them into spherical satellites that revolved along predetermined orbits.</p><p></p><p>On the first day, they moved seventy mountain peaks, transforming the original peak forest into a vast wilderness.  </p><p></p><p>As dusk fell, the three felt a bit fatigued, so they temporarily returned to the small world of their base to rest.</p><p></p><p>About an hour after Suhao and the others left, a hunting team carrying a full load of game animals and singing folk songs entered this peak forest.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>All opened their eyes wide, following the last rays of fading daylight to gaze dumbfounded at the empty 'plain' before them.</p><p></p><p>A hunter set down a wild boar he had been carrying on his shoulder, wiped away sweat, and said to a middle-aged man behind him, "Big brother, what is this place? Could we have taken the wrong path?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man looked at the 'plain' before them in astonished disbelief and shook his head, "We've walked this road so many times, we couldn't be lost!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what is this place? Is there such a flat area near our village?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...we've encountered something disastrous?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt a chill down their spines and couldn't help but shudder. The earlier joy of a successful hunt had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In all their years of hunting in the mountains, this was the first time they had encountered such an bizarre situation!</p><p></p><p>"We're doomed!" They silently passed their own death sentences.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the middle-aged man calmly said, "It's said that the mages of the Mage Association now deal with disasters very quickly. Basically, as soon as a disaster occurs, they can resolve it within a day. So let's just stay here and not move around. We'll wait for the mages to handle this disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense! Big brother is so wise. We'll just wait here and not go anywhere else!"</p><p></p><p>The hunters all set down their game and sat quietly, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>As night fell completely and starlight shone down, the men could still barely make out objects. Suddenly one hunter couldn't hold it in anymore, "Big brother, I need to pee!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man said, "Don't wander off, just turn around and go right there!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a gust of wind blew over and the hunters all covered their noses and mouths, unable to stop cursing, "So smelly! You damn dog Liuzi, can't you at least face the wind when you pee?"</p><p></p><p>Liuzi smelled it and said aggrievedly, "It's not smelly!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Suhao returned to this peak forest with renewed energy to continue his unfinished work.</p><p></p><p>Then the hunters witnessed an unforgettable sight: the distant mountain peaks were disappearing one by one!</p><p></p><p>This was simply terrifying! It almost made the hunters pee their pants!</p><p></p><p>One hunter cried out in panic, "We didn't get lost! This is definitely Luanchi Peak, that 'disaster' must have moved Luanchi Peak away!"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?" Everyone looked to the middle-aged man together.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, the middle-aged man said, "The road ahead is dangerous. Since it's impassable now, we'll take another route back! We must make it back alive!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of their wives and children at home...</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man shouldered his game and turned to leave. He had never longed for his humble home as much as he did now.</p><p></p><p>No one said anything more. Although apprehensive, they still followed the middle-aged man's steps.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the hunting team disappeared down the mountain trail.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was unaware that his act of moving mountains had almost made people pee themselves. Although he sensed there were some people nearby, he didn't care about that and only focused on completing his current task as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Five days passed quickly, and Suhao finally achieved his goal of moving enough mountain peaks into space, while Yashan and Fengcheng one by one turned these peaks into spherical satellites that slowly revolved in sync with the planet along predetermined orbits.</p><p></p><p>The area originally called Luanchi Peak no longer had its dense cluster of peaks, instead becoming an open plain. As far as the eye could see, not a single towering peak remained.</p><p></p><p>Only some low mounds of earth were overlooked and spared.</p><p></p><p>This place also became a forbidden zone for surrounding residents. They only dared to watch from afar as the peaks disappeared one by one, but didn't dare approach.</p><p></p><p>Not that they could get close even if they wanted to, because during the work, Suhao had set up a protective formation around the site to prevent others from randomly entering and disrupting his work.</p><p></p><p>There were also quite a few Source Teams that came to investigate and tried to break through Suhao's formation, but all failed.</p><p></p><p>This location was defined by them as a 'new type of disaster', named the 'Unstoppable Luanchi Bewilderment'!</p><p></p><p>This even included Axing and Awang!</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "Axing, have you forgotten our previous experience? Running off to other realms again, aren't you afraid of getting stuck halfway?"</p><p></p><p>Axing looked around at the flat land in amazement and casually brushed it off, "Afraid of what? This time we're just here to see the commotion, not trying to resolve this disaster. It won't be dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Awang criticized, "Of course you're not afraid, because Ayang is there to cover for you...I really don't understand how Ayang can stand your constant summons! If it were me, I'd be annoyed by you long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Axing laughed, "Awang, that's just something you can't comprehend! We're all in the same squad, what's the big deal? Hey look, there's a squad of beautiful ladies over there!"</p><p></p><p>"Where?" Awang immediately turned to look, his eyes instantly captivated by the beautiful mage ladies, instantly forgetting the previous topic.</p><p></p><p>Axing hooked Awang's neck and walked towards the ladies, "Let's go form a squad with those ladies!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After deploying a few hundred satellites, Suhao flew all over observing the changes in the planet's energy flow.</p><p></p><p>A month later, he finally had results.</p><p></p><p>The disasters occurring all over the world were disappearing at a terrifyingly rapid pace. And the disappearance rate was only getting faster!</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in at most half a year, this world's natural and bizarre disasters would completely vanish, leaving only the Source Beast disasters still active.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a special substance - Source - began mixing into the air around the world.</p><p></p><p>Then, as the planet rotated and the climate changed, it dispersed and transferred to every corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Source content in the air was extremely dilute, but over time it would inevitably increase gradually until reaching a level perceptible to mages.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Success! Just waiting for time to settle, and this world will take on a whole new appearance."</p><p></p><p>Yashan marveled, "MasterWei, I can't believe we were actually able to reach this level, completely changing the 'disasters' that plague humanity. It's almost unbelievable when I think about it."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng had a more open view of such things, "What's the big deal? Is there anything MasterWei can't do?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan scoffed, "You little brat, your knowledge is too shallow to understand the greatness of achieving this! But I'm too lazy to explain it to you, because even if I did you still wouldn't get it, you 'little addition and subtraction expert'!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was struck speechless by the "little addition and subtraction expert" jab. He silently resolved, "Next time I really can't go to the Music Immortal Palace anymore, I have to spend all my time studying!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Yashan, didn't you want to install propulsion control units on the satellites? You can also install a stellar monitoring system for this star system to avoid impacts from extraterrestrial meteorites."</p><p></p><p>Yashan suddenly remembered the two consecutive small asteroid strikes on the planet in his previous life. Connecting it to MasterWei's words, he suddenly realized something and couldn't help but look up at the sky, "Will that happen again?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Not necessarily, anything is possible. Before something occurs, we can't predict the process and outcome. But we can prepare in advance."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought for a moment, then pointed at Fengcheng, "Installing the monitoring system isn't difficult, but the hard part is updating the data once a year. Why don't we have Fengcheng go to the Glorious Union's academy and select some super talents to teach some astronomy knowledge, forming a small astronomical research team?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "Let's do that!"</p><p></p><p>This was an independent task, so Fengcheng immediately got excited, "Leave it to me! It's just astronomy, piece of cake for a little expert like me!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 767</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The moment he successfully entered the Serpens system, Su Hao immediately transmitted a large number of [Eight-Armed Gods] using his current [Eight-Armed God] as the coordinate, and utilized the 'Planetary Network' to scatter and transmit them to various locations, leaving behind many positioning stones.</p><p></p><p>This was to ensure that no accident would cause him to become disconnected from the Serpens system.</p><p></p><p>Although he could perform network transmission again, it would still take six to seven years to reach the central region near the Coma Cluster.</p><p></p><p>Only after ensuring stability did Su Hao have time to feel excited about this.</p><p></p><p>What this meant, he was all too clear.</p><p></p><p>It meant that instead of his original lifespan of five thousand years per world, he could now explore many more star systems.</p><p></p><p>The Serpens system was slightly smaller than the Coma Cluster, with a diameter of only 130,000 light-years, and like the Coma Cluster, it was a spiral galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gazed into the distance, seeing the dense stars emitting bright radiance, overall appearing yellow or red.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful and vast.</p><p></p><p>"Let me search carefully to see if the Serpens system has any special features or life civilizations."</p><p></p><p>After a long period of exploration, Su Hao had realized that to uncover more secrets of the universe, he currently needed to learn from all kinds of civilizations.</p><p></p><p>Civilizations were usually miracles of life born by chance in the universe, and such miracles of life would typically contain some secrets of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Understanding and learning from the achievements of civilizations would allow Su Hao to gain more knowledge and power most quickly.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for him now to seclude himself in a cave like the legends to comprehend the great Way and rules, and grasp the supreme mysteries of the universe.</p><p></p><p>It was like placing a blue crystal in front of Su Hao - without the special nature of the Compound Eye Race, no matter how hard he racked his brains, he would not know what use this thing could have.</p><p></p><p>Thinking aimlessly would only cause him to fall into a world constructed by his own mind like Ah Shan before, detached from reality and existing in meaningless illusions.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the future when he gained some stronger ability to observe the universe, he might be able to do this.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao sent out many 'mini-selves' to search the Serpens system, Ah Shan sent a message in the group, full of excitement and passion: "Great Sage, it's estimated that in a hundred years, our avatars will reach the Serpens system on the other side!</p><p></p><p>Exploring another galaxy is so awesome! And in the Serpens system, we may be the first life forms there."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said: "It's unimaginable, considering the two galaxies are separated by four million light-years...</p><p></p><p>If we bring seeds of life from the Coma Cluster to the Serpens system and plant them there, what would it look like billions of years later?"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Su Hao remember that Ah Shan and Feng Cheng were still painstakingly making their way over using 'Starlight Travel'.</p><p></p><p>He laughed and said, "Haha! I forgot to tell you, I've already arrived in the Serpens system. I'm investigating whether there are life-bearing planets in the Serpens system. It should take a few years to search the entire Serpens system. Hopefully there will be good news."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng looked dumbfounded: "???"</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan said: "As expected of the Great Sage!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Great Sage, what level of curvature travel is your Starlight Travel? Mine maxes out at 9.8, I didn't expect the Great Sage could fly even faster, arriving a full hundred years ahead of time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "No such thing, my current limit for Starlight Travel is also 9.8. I didn't use Starlight Travel to come to the Serpens system, but rather 'Network Transmission' - I've found a way to connect to adjacent galaxies.</p><p></p><p>So this early arrival was using 'Network Transmission'."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng were stunned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Ah Shan and Feng Cheng also transmitted directly to the Serpens system using Su Hao's [Eight-Armed God] as the coordinate.</p><p></p><p>They jointly began searching the Serpens system.</p><p></p><p>The Serpens system had over a trillion stars, with an unknowable number of planets. Among so many planets, there must be numerous habitable ones.</p><p></p><p>And each habitable planet had a chance of giving birth to life over a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>Seen this way, the probability of the Serpens system having life-bearing planets should not be low.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the other two were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>How interesting it would be to explore the universe and encounter a life-bearing planet!</p><p></p><p>A galaxy was after all a galaxy, immense enough to make ordinary people despair.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the three rapidly explored through the 'Planetary Network', until five years later, they had barely finished searching the entire Serpens system.</p><p></p><p>What left Su Hao and the others utterly astonished was that in this vast Serpens system, with its innumerable habitable planets, there was not a single life-bearing planet...</p><p></p><p>The entire Serpens system looked extraordinarily brilliant, but was utterly silent, with everything operating according to its own rules, rational, rigorous and silent.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "There are no traces of life in the entire Serpens system, perhaps the universe is just this silent... The birth of life is truly a miracle."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan: "Full of anticipation, yet full of disappointment. The word 'miracle' may not be enough to describe the coincidence of life arising."</p><p></p><p>"Whenever I sense the ingenious phenomena in the universe that defy comprehension, and connect it with the Great Sage's existence, I can't help but think this universe has a 'Creator'!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "I don't know if there is a Creator, but I know the Great Sage will definitely become a Creator."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "The universe is so vast, beyond our imagination. In other words: our imagination has limits, but the universe does not.</p><p></p><p>So any event that can possibly happen will become reality against the backdrop of such a universe.</p><p></p><p>Life is just one part of that reality.</p><p></p><p>In a vast galaxy, it's not strange to have life, and it's not strange to have no life either. But as long as we keep searching, we'll eventually find life-bearing, civilized planets.</p><p></p><p>As for coincidence and the Creator..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "It's too early to discuss coincidence and the Creator now. Since there are no life-bearing planets in the Serpens system, then let's wander around this galaxy and see if there's anything worth collecting.</p><p></p><p>After exploring it, we'll go to other galaxies and look for civilizations."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng said: "Okay, Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>Then the two began carefully searching for unique things in the Serpens system through the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Such a vast galaxy must have some specialty products, right?</p><p></p><p>Even if there were no specialty products, perhaps a certain planet could provide some inspiration to the three of them.</p><p></p><p>After exploring for another five years, the three regrouped.</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng both said they had made no special discoveries, it was just a perfectly normal galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Ah Shan and the others not discover anything, even Su Hao himself had no special findings.</p><p></p><p>It was that same point - without the knowledge brought by a civilization naturally evolved from life, even if the most priceless treasure was placed before Su Hao, he might not recognize it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "If there are no discoveries, then there are none! Let's go to other galaxies and search. Come with me, I'll teach you how to connect the networks between galaxies."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng's eyes lit up as they immediately followed Su Hao in transmitting to the center of the Serpens system's black hole, then used Starlight Travel to fly towards the black hole.</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan and Feng Cheng looked at the distant black circular shadow with some trepidation: "Great Sage, are we really going to brave the black hole?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Thinking about it, it does seem rather exciting! In all these years, I've never even gone to play around a black hole..."</p><p></p><p>Ah Shan: "I want to visit the black hole too, I just don't know if my body can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "So the method of connecting galaxies is related to the black hole? How wondrous."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "You're overthinking it, just being able to approach the black hole is already impressive. We're just getting as close to the black hole as the [Eight-Armed God] can withstand, then using its gravity combined with the 'Gravity Array' to connect the 'Planetary Networks' of the two galaxies, enabling network transmission."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 599</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Without any suspense, the seventeen imperial rulers and the Harmony Master were all arrested.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Yashan's figure appear, a name instantly popped into their minds - the Armor of Scraping the Earth!</p><p></p><p>The Armor of Scraping the Earth had actually found their location, then passed through layers of guards, came to their absolute headquarters, and announced their arrest!</p><p></p><p>It was like a joke, but it happened in such a bizarre way.</p><p></p><p>For everyone present, the 'Harmony Fortress' in New Epoch City was the safest place in this world, second to none.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the seventeen imperial rulers were unwilling to return to their jurisdictions, apart from dealing with the affairs of the 'Radiant Society', was that they had the idea of using the 'Harmony Fortress' to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that while staying in this safest place, they would be caught in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>The so-called most mysterious 'Harmony Master' in the world not only failed to protect them properly, but he himself was also captured.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some of them tried to call for the guards, but found that all the entrances and exits were blocked by a thick layer of crystal, and no one could get in.</p><p></p><p>"We're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The seventeen imperial rulers and the Source Master felt complicated in their hearts...</p><p></p><p>Yashan first said, "As long as you cooperate obediently, I guarantee everyone will be unharmed."</p><p></p><p>After reassuring them, he used a body-binding technique to fix everyone in place, then put a 'Balancing Technique' on them, and teleported them back to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he sent a message in the group: "Wind Cheng, it's done, you can remove the inhibitors!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng deactivated the effect of the inhibitors and teleported back to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see what these highly esteemed imperial rulers of the world looked like, and wondered if he should have himself crowned as an emperor for fun.</p><p></p><p>After Wind Cheng removed the inhibitors, the conference hall of the 'Harmony Fortress' was reopened by the masters who regained their source abilities. When they rushed into the conference hall, where could they find their respected emperors and the 'Harmony Master'?</p><p></p><p>The guards were indefensible, and in the worst case, their lives might not be spared. After searching around and failing to find the missing imperial rulers, many people had different thoughts in their hearts: "Perhaps I should consider joining the Radiant Society, I wonder if they are recruiting..."</p><p></p><p>The news of the seventeen imperial rulers and the 'Harmony Master' disappearing abruptly was initially suppressed, but as time passed, it quickly became impossible to cover up. It spread like wildfire through various channels, with all kinds of versions.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it became impossible to discern what had actually happened, and the truth was hard to tell.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the base small world, the eighteen imperial rulers and the 'Harmony Master' were temporarily detained in a laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by all kinds of strange experimental apparatuses, they had never seen or heard of such things before, and could not figure out where they had been taken.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, feeling deeply uneasy about their current predicament, not knowing what fate awaited them next. All the imperial rulers were pondering one question: as emperors, if the other party tortured them, should they confess and surrender, or remain stubborn to the end and maintain their imperial dignity?</p><p></p><p>The one who brought them here was the 'Armor of Scraping the Earth' wanted by the Association, they would never mistake that. And the Armor of Scraping the Earth was a member of the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>In other words, not long after the war with the Radiant Society began, they, the decision-makers at the top, had all been captured by the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Outrageous!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone finally spoke up: "Just now, my source ability suddenly failed, and it still hasn't recovered even after being brought to this place."</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Emperor frowned and said, "My ability is also unusable."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that everyone's abilities are unusable now. It must be the Radiant Society's means of disabling masters' abilities, a means that cannot be dispelled. What kind of unprecedented and unbelievable means is this?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if we cannot break through this ability-disabling means, we have no chance of winning against the Radiant Society!"</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten about the Catastrophe Cannon?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be naive, can the Catastrophe Cannon compare to ten thousand masters? Even if we have the Catastrophe Cannon, at most it can only destroy their cities, but it has no flexible mobility..."</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of considering all this? We should think about our current predicament instead."</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Splendid Emperor showed a look of panic: "Quick, imperial brothers, think of a way out, or are we just going to wait for death?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone shook their heads and sighed. If they had a way out, they would not have been captured and brought to this place.</p><p></p><p>The Splendid Emperor then turned to the Harmony Master and said, "Harmony Master, please say something, what should we do in this situation?"</p><p></p><p>All the imperial rulers looked at the Harmony Master. Since being brought here, the Harmony Master had kept his eyes closed, as if thinking about something, or perhaps just resting with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, he opened his spiritual eyes and said, "All you can do is wait quietly. If you don't want to suffer, then obediently cooperate with the other party. If you think your willpower is strong enough, then you can do whatever you want."</p><p></p><p>Even the Harmony Master was advising them to surrender directly?</p><p></p><p>In that case, there really was no hope left.</p><p></p><p>The Splendid Emperor asked again, "Harmony Master, you are well-traveled and knowledgeable, do you know how to break through this ability-disabling means?"</p><p></p><p>The other imperial rulers silently scolded him for being a fool. If the Harmony Master knew, would they have been captured and brought to this place?</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, just wait patiently. If we can survive in the end, we will surely know everything. If we unfortunately die, then thinking too much is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>He made a lot of sense, and the seventeen imperial rulers were speechless.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>These imperial rulers were detained for seven days. In those seven days, the arrogant air of superiority they once had was completely worn away.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during these seven days, the fear of the unknown future gradually spread in their minds, leaving them constantly uneasy and increasingly haggard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the laboratory door slowly opened, and three young, shaven-headed men walked in slowly. The one in the lead was extremely handsome, with a faint, barely noticeable smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>It was Suhao and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Yashan originally planned to have these imperial rulers directly handed over to Zhipeng for reformation into friends. However, he suddenly realized a problem: most of the captured people were source masters, and he was unsure of their abilities. If he rashly handed them over to Zhipeng, he might end up harming Zhipeng instead. If he used inhibitors to suppress their abilities, then Zhipeng would also be unable to use his abilities...</p><p></p><p>In other words, for safety reasons, Zhipeng currently had no way to turn these people into friends at this stage.</p><p></p><p>With no better solution, Yashan reported this matter to Suhao. Upon hearing that Yashan had actually captured all the imperial rulers of the royal clan, Suhao marveled at it. After a few days of detention, he came to the place where the imperial rulers were held, accompanied by Yashan and Wind Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the other two did not transform into [Destiny Child], but wore casual clothes.</p><p></p><p>However, their arrival still made the hearts of these imperial rulers skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>As the rulers of this world, they could sense the lofty and all-controlling aura from one another to some extent. The moment they saw Suhao and the other two, they were immediately overwhelmed by the imposing aura emanating from the three of them.</p><p></p><p>For some inexplicable reason, they felt that these three people were different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Those brilliant eyes seemed capable of penetrating everything.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, the most sensitive was the Harmony Master. Ever since Suhao and the others entered, he had felt an immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they could obliterate him with just a flick of their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Suhao scanned the room but didn't say a word. He casually cast a spell, immobilizing everyone and preventing them from moving or speaking. Then he walked up, and under the terrified gazes of the imperial rulers, he extended his slender fingers and recorded each of their consciousness information in his bouncing ball space, imprisoning them in the small black room.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the lives of these eighteen people were at Suhao's whim.</p><p></p><p>Suhao waved his hand, releasing the body-binding spell. The restraints on the imperial rulers suddenly loosened, causing them to stumble back a few steps before regaining their balance.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were filled with shock and horror, completely unaware of what this young man in the lead had done by pointing his fingers at their foreheads...</p><p></p><p>They only felt a warm current filling their entire brains, which was quite pleasant. But the enemy wouldn't be so kind as to give them a massage, would they?</p><p></p><p>The answer was no!</p><p></p><p>With a trembling voice full of fear, he said, "You... what did you do to me?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled lightly, "Don't be afraid, I don't have any intention of killing you for now, as you still have some use. Let me introduce myself first, my name is Jia Wei, and I'm a very reasonable scholar.</p><p></p><p>Now it's your turn to introduce yourselves. Come on, one by one, report your respective situations, names, genders, positions, whether you are a source master, what your abilities are, and so on."</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's brow gradually furrowed, "You don't seem willing?"</p>

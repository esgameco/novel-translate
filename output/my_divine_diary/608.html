        <h1>Chapter 608</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under Yahan's leadership, the voices of opposition and resistance disappeared completely after erupting for a period of time. Everyone fully cooperated with the work of the Glory Church.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng had previously worried that the remaining royals would cause trouble, but they didn't even dare fart, wishing they could hide themselves deep in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>These royals were terrified, not daring to show their faces, let alone going out to make trouble for the Glory Church. Only those wishing for a quicker death would dare go out!  To be honest, they hadn't lived enough yet! Having narrowly escaped with their lives, what did they want to do instead of hiding far away?</p><p></p><p>They were determined to find a place where no one knew them, change their names, and live a happy life in hiding.</p><p></p><p>While Yahan handled various matters, Fengcheng assisted him the whole time, learning how to deal with internal affairs of the Glory Church, finding it extremely engaging.</p><p></p><p>He kept praising: "As expected of the great Yahan, acting so decisively and getting straight to the point. I've learned it! Like this 'slap them three times before meeting' method, it can reach a consensus with the other party the fastest. Incredible!"</p><p></p><p>Yahan laughed: "Kid, learn more of this. These are Lao Su's secret techniques not easily passed down. Ordinary people can't grasp the profound meaning."</p><p></p><p>Thinking he could learn Suhao's "secret techniques", Fengcheng trembled with excitement: "Great Yahan, teach me, I want to learn."</p><p></p><p>Yahan joked: "Not going to the 'Music Immortal Palace' to play? Why the thought of learning this?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said with a 'sage' look: "Aiya! Can't go there every day! Going once a month is enough. In reality, learning brings true happiness!"</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng both knew that those who didn't learn couldn't keep up with Suhao. To avoid being eliminated, they could only keep learning and catch up to Suhao's pace.</p><p></p><p>There were many miscellaneous things for them to learn, like cooking delicious meals, doing housework properly, building qualified large bases, information gathering, procurement, project research, mechanical engineering, etc. They also had to know how to moonlight as emperors, organization leaders, and other roles.</p><p></p><p>So being a little brother wasn't that easy - without learning, even being a little brother would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>After some casual chat, Yahan assigned Fengcheng a task: "Fengcheng, the timing is basically ripe. It's time to negotiate with the Mage Association. Write a negotiation letter under Zhipeng's name and deliver it personally to the 'Peace Mage' in New Era City and Fort."</p><p></p><p>As a little brother, you also have to be able to write letters...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The formal talks between the Glory Church and the Mage Association were scheduled a month later.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of these talks was to confirm the Glory Church's legitimate ruling status worldwide, clarify the different roles of the Glory Church and Mage Association, and establish the rules of the game, the so-called 'no'!</p><p></p><p>Specific details would continue in second and third rounds of talks...</p><p></p><p>Until either the Glory Church or Mage Association was eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association repeatedly emphasized 'not participating in or interfering with the Glory Church's rule, focusing solely on eliminating disasters and maintaining a peaceful human environment', which facilitated the talks' progress.</p><p></p><p>So much so that after the talks, Zhipeng felt dazed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao didn't pay much attention to the outcome of the Glory Church's talks with the Mage Association. What mattered to him was gaining equal cooperation status with the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>After the first round of formal talks concluded, the content was officially announced to the world.</p><p></p><p>It was also at this time that Suhao, Yahan, and Fengcheng met with the Mage Association's top leaders in 'Peace Fort'.</p><p></p><p>In the same conference room, the Peace Mage, the 'Ten Great Mages', the 18 Regional Head Mages, and recorders represented the Mage Association, totaling 30 people sitting on one side. Of course, the captured Regional Head Mage Lada, previously released by Suhao, was also among them.</p><p></p><p>Suhao, Yahan, and Fengcheng sat on the other side.</p><p></p><p>The 30 people were mostly middle-aged and older, while Suhao's trio appeared excessively young.</p><p></p><p>Thirty people versus three - it seemed the former had an absolute advantage, but not really. Everyone knew that even if these 30 world's strongest source mages combined, they wouldn't be a match for one of the trio's fingers.</p><p></p><p>So the Mage Association's representatives appeared very humble and gentle.</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng appeared in their true forms, while Suhao remained hidden in his 'second-dimensional space', only appearing as a projection indistinguishable from being there in person. No one detected any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>This was Suhao's precaution. For this meeting, to show sincerity, they didn't set up source vector suppressors to restrict the Mage Association's abilities, meaning these mages posed an extreme threat to the trio. Hiding in the 'second-dimensional space' ensured safety.</p><p></p><p>As for Yahan and Fengcheng...if they died, they died - it wouldn't be the first time, they'd just revive as new men.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Suhao believed after going through so much, the other side wouldn't take action here, as the Mage Association couldn't afford the consequences of a failed assassination attempt.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was amiable, with everyone appearing to have a shared goal of making money together.</p><p></p><p>Suhao spoke first: "Let me introduce myself. My name is Jia Wei, a seeker of knowledge passionate about exploring the mysteries of 'source'. Meeting the mage representatives here is solely on my personal behalf, hoping to reach some cooperation with the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>This is Jia Yahan, and this is Jia Fengcheng, my two capable assistants who are also powerful mages."</p><p></p><p>The Peace Mage cleared his throat and introduced the Mage Association representatives, then asked: "May I ask what kind of cooperation Mr. Jia Wei wishes to establish with our Mage Association?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng stood and handed a stack of documents to the conference clerk, who distributed them to each representative.</p><p></p><p>As the curious representatives browsed the files, Suhao said: "The specific cooperation items are detailed in the documents. But before discussing them, let me explain the benefits the Mage Association can gain from cooperating with me."</p><p></p><p>"First, my simplified research results, including previous and future findings, will be shared with the mages, allowing you to at least gain abilities from other disciplines - I won't say more.</p><p></p><p>Second, I will no longer use 'source vector suppressors' to restrict the abilities of 'friendly mages' in the Mage Association, and ensure these suppressors don't spread from the three of us.</p><p></p><p>Third, in five years, I will deliver a special technique called 'the method for ordinary people to awaken as source mages' to the Mage Association, which will have full authority over this technique..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the mage representatives' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could become source mages too? If true, the Mage Association's status would be severely challenged - they could imagine no longer being the world's sole mage authority in the future.</p><p></p><p>The good news was that Jia Wei was willing to give the Mage Association full control over this technique.</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored the others' thoughts and continued: "Fourth, the source artifacts I took from the Mage Association will be returned in full after five years. If possible, I'll also give the Mage Association the technique to manufacture source artifacts."</p><p></p><p>The mages' hearts pounded like thunder - they almost stood up from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Did they hear that right? The source artifact manufacturing technique!</p><p></p><p>They looked at the trio in astonishment, hoping to see any hint they were joking on their faces.</p><p></p><p>But to their disappointment, they only saw seriousness, not the slightest joke.</p><p></p><p>This made the mage representatives marvel inwardly: "Just who are this Jia Wei and his two assistants? Their mastery and understanding of 'source' has reached such a level. Beyond genius! An peerless genius not seen in a thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>They'd seen all kinds of geniuses, and shamelessly speaking, everyone present was a genius crushing the masses.</p><p></p><p>But even for geniuses like them, what Jia Wei mentioned was unimaginable. They had tried in their youth too, which was precisely why they knew how difficult it was.</p><p></p><p>Suhao added: "Fifth, I can ensure the Mage Association won't be eliminated while I'm still alive!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Suhao finished speaking, the restless mage representatives instantly calmed down, as if doused with cold water.</p><p></p><p>They all knew Suhao's words were an outright threat.</p>

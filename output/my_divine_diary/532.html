        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just by virtue of Ah Xing and Ah Wang, the two intermediate level source mages, to dare to rush into an intermediate level bizarre disaster, presuming to solve the bizarre disaster by his own strength, this was definitely a ridiculous move in the eyes of any sane person.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, it was a lack of self-knowledge and self-importance.</p><p></p><p>Not only did other people see it that way, even Ah Wang in the squad felt that his squad was just looking for death. He was already mentally prepared to face all sorts of great terrors.</p><p></p><p>However, his two teammates looked very abnormal, and after Ah Xing made his decision, his entire state changed, and he was seldom seen showing a smile on his face, all that was there was seriousness.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xing's usual kind of cheeky state seemed to have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He was mentally under great pressure, as the captain, since he led his teammates into the weird disaster, he had the responsibility to lead the team to solve the weird disaster, and at the same time ensure that every teammate could survive and return in one piece.</p><p></p><p>Ever since his father died in the midst of the bizarre disaster, he had spent a great deal of time on studying the bizarre disaster, and by now, he dared to say that he knew more about the bizarre disaster than many veteran source mages. And had great confidence that he could solve it.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he dared to say that he would take Su Hao to see the bizarre disaster on the third mission before was precisely from his confidence.</p><p></p><p>At least, he wouldn't think of bringing his teammates to die.</p><p></p><p>When he heard about the bizarre disaster over here two days ago, he had gotten a little excited and brought his squad here without much thought.</p><p></p><p>This disaster event, however, was far beyond his imagination. It wasn't primary, but intermediate!</p><p></p><p>At this time, he hesitated ...... Should he continue?</p><p></p><p>His heart wanted to continue, but he had to consider for his two teammates, and then he made a decision, but wherever A Yang showed a hint of retreat, then he would immediately stop this operation and wait for the next primary bizarre disaster, and then come back to participate.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Ah Yang seemed to be even more daring than him, facing bizarre disasters more actively than even he?</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably again, Ah Xing actually felt that illusion that everything was under control from Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>No, it wasn't an illusion, that confidence that emanated from the depths of his soul couldn't be fooled. It was as if he could see through all sorts of things in this world, and nothing could defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this feeling of reliability exactly what he had been going after all along? He didn't expect to see it in a rookie source mage, which made him doubly dismayed.</p><p></p><p>Since he wasn't afraid of anything except for Ah Wang, there wasn't any reason to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it just an intermediate level bizarre disaster?</p><p></p><p>In the future, he would have to solve advanced level bizarre disasters, top level bizarre disasters, and become the most powerful bizarre nemesis in the world!</p><p></p><p>Xing was unusually serious, ''Ah Wang, Ah Yang, don't worry! I will definitely lead you to solve the bizarre and bring you out in one piece. I promise!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As expected, no matter how strong Hoshi's resolve was, he was belittled by the little girl checking in at the counter when he went to report his participation in the 'Nowhere to Run' shenanigans disaster.</p><p></p><p>A red-lipped little girl with gold-rimmed glasses spoke extremely fast and spat, ''Is your Yangwangxing squad serious? It's only a junior source squad! Are you sure you're not thinking of going to die?</p><p></p><p>Look at the configuration of your squad, two intermediate source mages and a rookie source mage who doesn't even have a rating!</p><p></p><p>What's the point of having a small team of rookies like you? You're young, you've got a lot of years ahead of you, you should be looking for a girl to work with!</p><p></p><p>Good girl, listen to your sister and go back where you came from! If you don't have a place to stay tonight, you can come to my sister's house for the night. ......"</p><p></p><p>Xing: "......"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing welcomed the scalp all kinds of steadfastness, that self-proclaimed sister's little sister also take him no way, finally helpless to give Ah Xing formalities, after that look at his eyes, as if looking at a fool in general.</p><p></p><p>These days, people looking for death can not pull back ah! It's a pity that the three big handsome guys.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao not long ago also gave himself a shot of 'handsome and forceful needle', the more the face grows, the more durable, now is also considered a handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had always known that a good looking face could minimize the difficulty of many things.</p><p></p><p>After completing the formalities, the three of them arrived outside of Willow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Now the blazing sun in the sky, the entire weeping willow mountain also not see clouds, but it looks just dark and heavy, the sun can not penetrate the weeping willow mountain, shining on it, from a distance at first shake a glance, only to see a dim willow forest, drooping to the ground willow branches seem to have the wind flicked, swaying from side to side, but then look more carefully, but nothing can not be seen clearly, a misty, very bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Just close to, can make a person's heart hairy, as if all inside is all kinds of dirty things in general.</p><p></p><p>But the three did not retreat, slowly walked forward.</p><p></p><p>While walking Ah Xing explained, "Ah Wang Ah Yang, Weird Disaster, as its name suggests, is very weird, and cannot be figured out by common sense at all, because all weirdness is against common sense.</p><p></p><p>But the most amazing thing lies in the fact that weirdness is against common sense from a realistic point of view, but reasonable from a subjective point of view ......</p><p></p><p>Understand what that means?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ah Wang both shook their heads, indicating what the hell are you talking about.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing said helplessly, "Forget it, after the experience, you guys will naturally understand, but after you go in, everything is on me, do not move around freely, otherwise it will be easy to trigger the lethal effect. Once the lethal effect is triggered, then you are dead, no one can save you."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "How to avoid the lethal effect trigger?"</p><p></p><p>Xing said, "As long as you find the conditions for the bizarre disaster to trigger and avoid it, then the bizarre disaster will become harmless."</p><p></p><p>That's right, it seemed so simple!</p><p></p><p>And once one mastered the operating conditions to avoid the lethal effect triggering, one could ignore the entire bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>What so many source squads have to do when they enter the interior of the disaster is to find the 'nowhere to run' trigger condition, and then find the nucleus and destroy the 'lead' on it.</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't easy to really find the trigger condition of a bizarre disaster, and if you weren't careful, you'd trigger the condition and die.</p><p></p><p>In other words, one needs to go through trial and error until one gets lucky and finds the trigger condition.</p><p></p><p>Bad luck ...... can only be blamed on bad luck.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry too much, the environment around the weird disaster often has the answer to this weird question. As long as, we pay attention to observe and find the clues in it, and then connect all the clues together, we will be able to find the answer." Xing said as he stepped into the bizarre range first.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly follow, don't get separated."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ah Wang followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The three of them only felt their eyes dawning, as if they had traveled through time and space to another world.</p><p></p><p>A willow world made up of densely packed countless willow trees.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the road has disappeared, the eye is full of dense willow branches.</p><p></p><p>Xing carefully retreated two steps back, and realized that he was not out of this environment, he took a deep breath, looked at his surroundings, and calmly said, "We've already come in, and we can't exit the weird range by retreating, because what we see at this moment, maybe none of it is real, and maybe the directions we perceive are all the opposite. That is to say, next, we have to understand this place, and then find its triggering conditions and destroy the core."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had his radar perception on the entire time, and after coming in, he immediately realized that the scene perceived by the radar had suddenly changed all over.</p><p></p><p>It was just the same as if he had teleported to another place.</p><p></p><p>He secretly said, "Could it be that after stepping into the weird range just now, it converted another space?"</p><p></p><p>However, he clearly did not sense the fluctuation of the spatial shift, indicating that in reality, the three of them were still standing in the same place and had not been teleported to another place.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that his spiritual perception had been interfered with by some kind of force field, so much so that his radar perception had failed.</p><p></p><p>Half of Su Hao's consciousness was transferred into the space of the pinball, and he called up his body data, and found that there was no abnormality, and then he called up the information data of the most core consciousness, which was observed with both eyes, and there was no abnormality either.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he immediately gave Xiao Guang the order, "Xiao Guang, compare the difference in consciousness information before and after entering the Willow Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait."</p><p></p><p>His consciousness information was too huge to complete the comparison in a moment, he exited the pinball space and scanned his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Xing thought for a moment and slowly said, "Ah Wang, make three dummy balloons out, inflate them and use them to scout the way, while we cloak ourselves and follow behind the dummies. Also, these willows are very weird, try not to be touched by it."</p><p></p><p>Soon the three of them were invisible, with only a faint outline that could not be detected without a closer look.</p><p></p><p>The three dummy balloons were also blown up and nimbly walked ahead.</p><p></p><p>They followed the dummies for a while before they heard the sound of a faint song coming from the distance and getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>A moment of silver bell laughter, a moment of sadness and grief, and a moment of bawling, and an indescribable fear ......</p><p></p><p>"I'm scared! I'm going to run away ~ not afraid of fear! I won't be able to escape~ Run, run, run! Run, run, run!</p>

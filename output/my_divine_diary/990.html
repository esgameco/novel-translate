        <h1>Chapter 990</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Wanleishen recalled the battle scene with a serious expression and asked, "Chipu, when we were fighting with Congrenfei before, we suddenly lost the ability to teleport. What was that all about?"</p><p></p><p>He thought Congrenfei was Chipu's second senior martial brother, so he should know something.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu smiled and said, "That was a formation that can suppress the fluctuations of the surrounding space modules. Only a small portion of the disciples in the Twin Sword Sect know this formation, and they are all at the team leader level of enforcer disciples. </p><p></p><p>This was specially taught to us by our master to subdue disciples who violate the sect rules.</p><p></p><p>So you see, mastering spatial teleportation doesn't necessarily make you invincible."</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities: "......"</p><p>Why didn't you say so earlier?</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu shook his head, "This is a top secret of the higher ranks of my Twin Sword Sect. Without my master's permission, I dare not casually spread it, not even to you."</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities were burning with envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God Baishen asked dejectedly, "What about that basin-like magic treasure Congrenfei had? When it shone on me, I felt miserable for three years. Just recalling that scene makes my head spin uncontrollably."</p><p></p><p>Even until now, Baishen hadn't recovered. If possible, he never wanted to encounter Congrenfei again in the future.</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned this, the other deities' expressions changed, revealing apprehension.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu said, "That magic treasure is called the 'Three Day Mind Confusion Talisman'. Not only are you all afraid of it, I am too. I can't imagine what kind of person would develop such an inhumanely cruel magic treasure. It's simply inhumane!"</p><p></p><p>Baishen curiously asked, "Don't you have this magic treasure, Chipu?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu shook his head, "My master gave Congshuling, Congrenfei and me each a body protecting magic treasure. Congshuling got a small sword called the 'Wish Sword', which is said to be able to silently cut down any enemy within its perception range, though I've never seen her use it so I don't know the details. Congrenfei got the Mind Confusion Talisman you saw, which instantly clouds one's mind upon being illuminated by it, rendering one unable to control themselves. You witnessed its might and that there's no way to resist it."</p><p></p><p>The deities curiously stared at Chipu and asked, "Then what magic treasure did your master give you?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu laughed heartily and casually took out a small hollow ball, "The magic treasure my master gave me is called the 'Crispy Skin Ball'. Its defense is unbreakable by anyone. Even the magic treasures of Congshuling and Congrenfei cannot break through my defense as long as I'm holding the Crispy Skin Ball. With it, I stand undefeated.</p><p></p><p>My master cares more about me and was concerned for my safety, so he gave me this magic treasure."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Chipu put away the magic treasure and smiled without saying more.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities were once again so envious that they could hardly keep their expressions calm.</p><p>They too wanted powerful magic treasures!</p><p></p><p>After leaving separately, the more the Eighteen Deities thought about it, the more dissatisfied they became, so they gathered together again.</p><p></p><p>Hongguang said helplessly, "I suddenly realize that a good magic treasure may be even more useful than all the spells we've learned."</p><p></p><p>Baishen said with lingering fear, "That's right, our abilities are too one-dimensional. Once we encounter some special magic treasures, we can only become lambs waiting to be slaughtered."</p><p></p><p>"We originally thought that relying on our strength, we could roam freely in the Infinite Land with no one able to match us. Now we realize it's not the case. It was still fine encountering Congrenfei this time, but what if we meet some small fry holding a powerful magic treasure in the future and they shine it on us..."</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Imagining that scene, the Eighteen Deities gasped, their scalps going numb all the way to their feet.</p><p></p><p>"It really could happen. According to Chipu's description, as long as there are special magic treasures that can be activated without needing much spiritual power, then isn't it..."</p><p></p><p>A child holding a real gun could make even the strongest man panic.</p><p></p><p>"Then what should we do? We have no way to obtain powerful special magic treasures. That kind of powerful magic treasure is probably only possessed by the three Primordial Sacred Ones, and we definitely don't have a share."</p><p></p><p>The Bathing God Yiti suggested, "There may not be any powerful magic treasures in the mall, and even if there are, we can't afford them. But there are methods for forging magic treasures, and they're not expensive. We can first learn how to forge magic treasures, then design and make the powerful ones we desire ourselves."</p><p></p><p>The deities perked up a bit and entered the mall to browse.</p><p></p><p>They found that as Yiti said, the methods for forging magic treasures were indeed not expensive...</p><p></p><p>They thought about it and realized they could only do it this way.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they didn't have much confidence in their forging abilities and didn't know what they would end up with.</p><p></p><p>Bali thought to himself, "The first goal of learning to forge treasures is to be able to use them successfully. Don't ask for too much in terms of effects."</p><p></p><p>So the Eighteen Deities got busy in a rare way, studying feverishly every day.</p><p></p><p>From this, we can see that being instantly subdued by Congrenfei's "Three Day Mind Confusion Talisman" left a huge psychological scar on the Eighteen Deities.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After taking Lv Yijiang's group away, Congrenfei came to his residence in the Twin Sword City.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's group exclaimed in amazement, "Wow Congrenfei, is this your home? It's so high-class and awesome!"</p><p></p><p>In their years of traveling the Infinite Land, they had seen many advanced technological products that had greatly broadened their horizons. But they never expected to see even more sci-fi scenes in Congrenfei's home that exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei lay half-reclined on the soft sofa and smiled when he heard them, "Smart home system, not bad right? Whenever there are any technological achievements in the Infinite Land and Independent Worlds, I find a way to bring them to my home. What you're seeing here is almost the highest level of products from the Infinite Land and Independent Worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, these smart machines may seem no different from normal people, but they don't have independent consciousness - their personalities are just simulations.</p><p></p><p>There's currently a 'Hyper Composite Spirit Power Technological Revolution' sweeping the Infinite Land, giving birth to many technological products that combine various high-level energies. But they're not very mature yet.</p><p></p><p>Rumor has it they may break through the limits of artificial intelligence and allow machines to develop independent consciousness. Heh heh, it's still unknown if it's true or not for now.</p><p></p><p>But I'm quite looking forward to the achievements of this hyper composite spirit power technology. It's estimated that in a little over a thousand years, we'll get relatively sophisticated technological results."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's group looked envious - they too wanted such a smart home system.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi curiously asked, "Congrenfei, who exactly are you? To be so powerful that even the Great Demon King Chipu, known as the strongest in the demonic realm, is so respectful towards you."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and Tai Cheng also looked at Congrenfei curiously.</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei said, "Well, I'm not sure how to put it...Let me put it this way. The Infinite Land was designed by my master and senior uncles. As for me, I participated in the construction of the Infinite Land, so you could say I watched as the Infinite Land gradually took shape and opened up.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Demon King Chipu, he's nominally my junior martial brother. But he's probably a bit older than me. It's hard to compare our strengths since we've never really fought.</p><p></p><p>The beings you now see in the Infinite Land are basically my juniors, you could say."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh..."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's group gasped in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Just the simple statement of "The Great Demon King is my junior martial brother" was already a lot for them to digest, let alone that he participated in building the "Infinite Land". This was too much information for them.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't imagine that this young man who had been so friendly with them was actually such a powerful figure, standing at the pinnacle of all beings...</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked, "Um...Congrenfei, when was the Infinite Land built?"</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei replied, "I haven't calculated the exact time, but it was probably over seven thousand years ago. Back then, every world was independent from each other.</p><p></p><p>My master said the main reason for building the Infinite Land was to allow beings from many worlds to move around and interact with each other."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi asked, "Will our planet also connect to the Infinite Land and become part of it?"</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei said, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi worriedly said, "I'm concerned that the powerful beings in the Infinite Land might harm our world..."</p><p></p><p>They didn't think much of it when those beings were running rampant in the Infinite Land. But now that they realized their own homeland could potentially be invaded by others, their thoughts changed.</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei laughed, "Don't worry, there will be corresponding safeguard mechanisms. From what I know, the Celestial Court has a huge department dedicated to monitoring crises in various worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's group looked baffled, "What's the Celestial Court?"</p><p></p><p>This touched upon another area outside their knowledge.</p><p></p><p>After Congrenfei patiently explained it to them, he asked, "What are your plans next? Will you continue in the Infinite Land or return to your own planet?</p><p></p><p>In two to three years, the portal to your planet will be opened. After that, you can come and go freely with a travel permit without any special restrictions."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said, "Let's go back first since there's no natural spiritual energy in the Infinite Land."</p><p></p><p>Congrenfei smiled, "From what I know, the Twin Sword Sect and Infinite Sect have formed dedicated construction teams to work on a plan to introduce spiritual energy. In a few hundred years, the Infinite Land should have an inexhaustible supply of natural spiritual energy too."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang's group's eyes widened slightly, "!!!"</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized that the Twin Sword Sect and Infinite Sect seemed unstoppable...</p><p></p><p>The image of Su Hao flashed in their minds, and they couldn't help but wonder, "Could Mr. Jia Wei really be a Primordial Sacred One nurtured since the birth of the universe, as Congrenfei said?"</p>

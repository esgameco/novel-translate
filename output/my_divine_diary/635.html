        <h1>Chapter 635</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Yashan brought in a large engineering crew to the base small world and began constructing the framework for a spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>The base small world was originally just an island, but Suhao had excavated it and placed it into the small world realm.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it was an enormously huge rock.</p><p></p><p>When the engineering crew entered the base small world, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This...they didn't know where to start.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Yashan had a comprehensive plan laid out, dividing the steps to build the spacecraft in detail.</p><p></p><p>First, he and Fengcheng used the Vajra Armor transformation to hollow out the interior of the base small world, expanding it outward like inflating a balloon. The excess rock material was moved to the ground to construct a massive castle.</p><p></p><p>Next, using currently available sturdy and resilient metals, they gradually built the metal outer shell and load-bearing columns around the interior space.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they installed rails, load-bearing walls and other standard framework components.</p><p></p><p>Under Yashan's overall command and coordination, everything proceeded smoothly without the slightest disturbance to Suhao reading books and reports in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, Suhao was lounging by the pool pavilion again, reviewing reports sent by Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Guard organization's 25 'Demon Warriors' applied to establish a 'Demon Warrior Association' and gained approval from the highest chancellor..."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xinke Group' under the Mages Association launched the first generation of 'personal computers', with the first 2,000 units going on trial sale at the price of..."</p><p></p><p>"A remnant den of the Refraction Cult was raided in the Dragon Heart District..."</p><p></p><p>"The Lingxuan District rainforest is showing signs of becoming the world's second largest monster gathering point..."</p><p></p><p>"Temperatures plunged sharply, a plague broke out in Huixin Town, please be cautious and take protective measures, citizens..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Suhao was reading this, he suddenly froze, staring fixatedly at the news about the "plague", muttering to himself: "Plague, plague...virus! Transcription replication..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes grew brighter and brighter, joy quickly spreading across his face!</p><p></p><p>How does a virus invade the human body?</p><p></p><p>It doesn't take much, just inhaling a small amount of the virus. With lowered immunity over time, the human body becomes a paradise for the virus, which can even lead to death.</p><p></p><p>Just inhaling a tiny, insignificant amount of virus can destroy the entire human body - isn't this exactly the chain reaction principle Suhao has been searching for?</p><p></p><p>This made Suhao wonder if the ultimate secrets of the universe are hidden within the various forms of life. He had already come into contact with the core secrets of the universe, but just failed to make the connection and realization.</p><p></p><p>So, revere the universe, revere life!</p><p></p><p>To understand viruses, simply researching information is not enough. He needs to personally observe the operating modes of viruses, even allowing them to invade his own body to carefully study their proliferation principles.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can use viruses' operating modes as a reference to create a 'planet virus' designed specifically to erode planets. If I inject the 'planet virus' into a planet's interior and wait, it could destroy the entire planet, turning it into various energy beams and harmless cosmic dust."</p><p></p><p>Using a virus method to destroy planets is different from his earlier imagined scenario of smashing them with a punch, but as long as the end result is the same, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Any cat is a good cat...</p><p></p><p>Suhao acted quickly, soon arriving at the plague-stricken Huixin Town.</p><p></p><p>The situation he witnessed firsthand was starkly different from the brief plague mention in the report.</p><p></p><p>The report only said a sudden plague broke out, making it seem like a minor flu outbreak. But in reality, it was extremely severe, spreading to surrounding towns.</p><p></p><p>The death toll from contracting the plague kept rising.</p><p></p><p>Everyone here was fearing for their lives, hiding in their homes and not daring to go out.</p><p></p><p>Smoke rose everywhere - people burning the belongings of the deceased to prevent the plague from spreading further.</p><p></p><p>Suhao landed on a street in Huixin Town, walking slowly without any fear of being infected. On the contrary, he hoped the virus would come find him soon.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough...let me out! Cough cough...are you really going to just watch me die? Do you have any conscience...cough cough! Please! Let me out! I need to find a doctor for treatment...cough cough! I don't want to die!"</p><p></p><p>Raucous coughing, angry shouting, the sound of a washbasin hitting the floor, and banging on a door came from a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A chaotic scene.</p><p></p><p>It really had devolved into chaos - when one person in a family contracted the plague, the situation was easy to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stopped and headed towards the small courtyard. The tightly locked main gate posed no obstacle to him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the courtyard, he saw a middle-aged man lying against the door, weakly banging on it while coughing, shouting angrily, and pleading.</p><p></p><p>The door had multiple locks and chains securing it, only allowing one hand to reach out and retrieve food left outside.</p><p></p><p>An extremely desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao walked up and asked, "You caught the plague?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao, a glimmer of hope appeared in the middle-aged man's eyes. "Yes yes! Can you let me out? I'm really sick, I'm going to die! But I don't want to die...cough cough! Please let me out to find a doctor! If you can cure me, I'll give you everything I have..."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring his words, Suhao said, "Come with me for a bit, I'll guarantee your life. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man nodded without hesitation, "Okay! Okay!"</p><p></p><p>As long as someone could take him away from this hellish place, he was willing to do anything.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man rushed out from the neighboring house, his mouth and nose tightly covered with thick cloth, looking at Suhao with trepidation. "Who are you? He's already infected with the plague, he'll be dead soon. You should keep your distance, if you catch the plague too, no one in town can save you now."</p><p></p><p>Before Suhao could respond, the middle-aged man angrily roared, "You ungrateful son...cough cough! I wasted all those years raising you, and this is how you treat your own father? You can't wait for me to die...ungrateful wretch!"</p><p></p><p>The young man said helplessly, "You're about to die, be quiet for a bit, maybe you'll live a few more days."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man pointed at the young man, his face flushed red, coughing continuously and unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't say much more. With a casual gesture, he cast a 'Balancing Technique' on the middle-aged man, then took him back to the base small world.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man gradually stopped coughing, looking around the unfamiliar environment with utter bewilderment. "I...this..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze fell on the young man beside him. The anger he previously felt vanished after arriving here, replaced by a growing sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Don't worry, you won't die. You can go back after a while, as long as you cooperate with some of my work. Come with me!"</p><p></p><p>Before Suhao, the middle-aged man didn't dare say much, only obediently replying, "Okay...okay!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao's research had two parts. The first was recording the middle-aged man's physical information into the Bouncing Realm to observe the virus invasion process.</p><p></p><p>In just ten days, Suhao completed the first part, gaining a preliminary understanding of how the virus erodes the body.</p><p></p><p>He also cured the middle-aged man and sent him back to Huixin Town. As for how he would deal with his unfilial son, that was none of Suhao's concern.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he casually developed an effective antiviral drug and gave the production method to Fengcheng. "Fengcheng, this is the method for making the special plague cure for Huixin Town. It also includes the thought process behind developing antiviral drugs. Find some time to pass it along to Zhipeng! I reckon he still doesn't know about the plague situation in Huixin Town."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately replied, "Got it, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Next was the second part of the research: injecting the virus into his own body to observe the entire process.</p><p></p><p>Suhao first injected himself with an 'immune system suppressor', drastically weakening his immune function. Then he extracted the virus from the middle-aged man and slowly injected it into his own body.</p><p></p><p>"The 'planet virus' - I already have some ideas! But I should still observe this from start to finish. Viruses are truly wondrous things."</p>

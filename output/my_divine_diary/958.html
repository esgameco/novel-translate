        <h1>Chapter 958</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Exploring the universe in the future will indeed require many hands, which is why Suhao had Yashan and Fengcheng set up the trial platform to screen talents.</p><p></p><p>But it's not that he attached great importance to the trial platform.</p><p></p><p>Even for the first primordial god, it was merely a byproduct of his research on the 'Doom System'.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, it was just a platform he casually set up based on needs.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the construction of the Infinite Lands was done in the same way.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Lands were not a necessity, but rather something he did out of interest, while also providing himself, Yashan and Fengcheng a place to settle down, so that the three of them would no longer be drifters in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The word 'wandering' sounds beautiful, but in reality, a wandering heart is empty. Only those who have truly experienced being homeless can understand that indescribable sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Although Yashan and Fengcheng wandered, they at least had Suhao as a spiritual anchor in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But what about Suhao? Who could he anchor himself to?</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he felt that the 'Pinball Space' was his home, but sometimes he didn't.</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't even know where the Pinball Space was at the moment...</p><p></p><p>The Pinball Space was indeed his current foundation, but it was far from being his spiritual anchor. On the contrary, he was constantly worried that something might happen to the Pinball Space, so he wanted to find it as soon as possible and bring it completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>A place that is uncontrolled, without absolute security, and cannot be found - how could it be called home?</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had always thought that it didn't matter where he was in the universe, after all, he would just die after a while, and then follow the Pinball Space to another location, another world, stay for a while, and then die and leave again.</p><p></p><p>It was a repetitive cycle with no difference.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different. If nothing unexpected happens, theoretically speaking, he now has an infinite lifespan. Millions of years, billions of years, trillions of years - it would make no difference.</p><p></p><p>He will keep his eyes open forever, witnessing the birth and death of stars, the development and decay of all things, and the ever-changing vastness of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Lands are the starting point of his observation, as well as the center of 'his universe'. He now has a base, and from here he will set out, using his own senses, to attempt to measure the vastness of the universe.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, the essence of his life has fundamentally changed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he is no longer 'human' anymore.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao couldn't help but laugh softly and mutter to himself: "If I'm not human, then what am I?"</p><p></p><p>He had once pondered a question: Is there a truly omniscient and omnipotent god in this universe?</p><p></p><p>If such a god exists, then how was the first deity in the universe born? And how did they become omniscient and omnipotent?</p><p></p><p>Suhao could never find the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>But he believed that the first deity in the universe must have gone through many difficulties, overcoming them one by one, growing from weakness to strength, from ignorance to wisdom, and finally reaching a state of pervading the entire universe...</p><p></p><p>After their radiance and power spread outwards, other ignorant people would then regard them as the divine creator of all things.</p><p></p><p>Just like what he had experienced.</p><p></p><p>As for the idea of a creator god creating everything, Suhao didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Because he couldn't understand who created the creator...</p><p></p><p>He preferred to believe that all of this was a miracle of the universe, a coincidence arising from infinite vastness and infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's consciousness lingered in the Pinball Space, gazing at these familiar surroundings, and murmured: "Can I become the omniscient and omnipotent god I imagined? Will I encounter the true first deity of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head: "What's the use of thinking so much? With my current level, if I encounter them, they could probably just stretch out a finger and casually crush me to death. It's better to focus on exploration and mastering more knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, I've been reborn into quite a few worlds already. If there really was a first deity, I would have encountered them long ago, right?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao gathered his thoughts and stopped pondering such future matters, returning to the problem at hand: Where is the Pinball Space? How can he find its location?</p><p></p><p>This issue is not urgent, but it is very important - something Suhao must deal with, otherwise he won't feel completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>Everything can be destroyed. What if the Pinball Space inexplicably explodes? Their entire group would be wiped out, with nowhere to grieve.</p><p></p><p>Even the soul force carrying information cannot save them.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>He completely replicates a copy of his consciousness information, implants it into the soul force, and then destroys the consciousness in the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>In that way...</p><p></p><p>Stop!</p><p></p><p>Such 'suicidal' thoughts are extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Suhao dispelled the distracting thoughts and pondered seriously:</p><p></p><p>"After the Pinball Space starts jumping, I am unable to determine its existence.</p><p></p><p>So, the only way I can determine the Pinball Space's location is during that brief period after rebirth."</p><p></p><p>Then, should he commit suicide to be reborn?</p><p></p><p>He can also be reborn into other worlds while alive, as long as there is a suitable vessel.</p><p></p><p>The method is simple - create a large number of self-adapting consciousness packages in the Pinball Space and scatter them, waiting for them to automatically match.</p><p></p><p>When the Pinball Space happens to arrive in a new world and finds a suitable intelligent life form, these consciousness packages will automatically complete the match, thereby opening a connection for Suhao to that world.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Suhao can control the reborn body to construct a small transmission array, completing the transmission of his 'divine' avatar.</p><p></p><p>In theory, it is feasible, but there are still many technical details that Suhao needs to overcome.</p><p></p><p>For example, how to produce consciousness packages that can more easily complete the rebirth program; and once the consciousness package successfully matches, how to construct the transmission array at the fastest speed to open a two-way channel...</p><p></p><p>This will require a great deal of experimentation and reasoning.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult part is that even after producing them, there's no guarantee that they will actually work.</p><p></p><p>Because the interval between rebirths is too long.</p><p></p><p>Each rebirth is full of chance, and even the Pinball Space itself cannot predict when the next rebirth will occur.</p><p></p><p>What Suhao can do is to prepare as comprehensively as possible, and then wait patiently - for a million years, ten million years, or even a hundred million years...</p><p></p><p>Until he encounters a suitable consciousness vessel.</p><p></p><p>This kind of waiting is completely different from when he died before, closing his eyes and then opening them again in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>He has to endure, to wait, with longing in his heart, not knowing when it will suddenly happen.</p><p></p><p>But Suhao is more than happy to wait in this way, at least during this process he can still do what he wants to do.</p><p></p><p>By then, he will have probably left his footprints across countless galaxies!</p><p></p><p>Suhao took out paper and pen, and began writing down a simple plan for what's next:</p><p></p><p>"2. Complete the analysis of the 'Fate Line', mastering the models of 'Doom' and 'Fortune';</p><p></p><p>4. Produce rebirth consciousness packages, prepare for the next rebirth, and research how to establish a temporary transmission array to open a channel."</p><p></p><p>So let time flow like this!</p><p></p><p>The universe is endless, exploration never extinguished.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 776</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao explored further, the mysterious veil of the Sacred Mountain was gradually unveiled.</p><p></p><p>When he entered the Mother's Pool and followed it into the underground water world, he came to understand the truth of this world's supernatural power.</p><p></p><p>This supernatural force, once again beyond Su Hao's expectations, manifested in this world in an inconceivable way.</p><p></p><p>It can be simply described as the wondrous combination of two life forms.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the so-called Mother's Pool magic power of the dragon race was the force unleashed when two life forms combined.</p><p></p><p>At first, Su Hao thought some special power permeated the purple pool water, which the Winged Ones absorbed and stored within their bodies, granting them immense strength.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was not so.</p><p></p><p>What permeated the Mother's Pool was not a 'mysterious power', but rather a special kind of microorganism, densely packed and innumerable! Let's call it the purple fungus.</p><p></p><p>With this understanding, the principle of how the Winged Ones gained power became very clear.</p><p></p><p>In their youth, the Winged Ones drank the pool water containing large amounts of purple fungus spores, which entered their bodies and propagated as parasites.</p><p></p><p>The young Winged Ones' powerful ability to adapt allowed them to rapidly accommodate the massive influx of purple fungus. Over time, their blood and flesh underwent changes, forming a symbiotic relationship with the fungus within, thereby producing the 'magic power' described by the Winged Ones.</p><p></p><p>This way of gaining power truly opened Su Hao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If life itself is a miracle of the universe, then the supernatural abilities gained through the symbiosis of two life forms could certainly be called a miracle of life.</p><p></p><p>"This state of symbiosis between life forms happens to fill a gap in my knowledge on this subject - an unexpected pleasure. It may even provide inspiration for the structure of my spirit body."</p><p></p><p>He emerged from the Mother's Pool and returned to the water's edge. Gazing at the expanse of purple water, he marveled, "This is coincidence, yet also inevitability! The world is always so ingenious and wondrous."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this planet was not originally divided into the surface world and underground world...</p><p></p><p>But one day, movements of the earth's crust split the world into two realms. The life forms in each realm evolved and survived separately, cut off from each other for eons without any interaction.</p><p></p><p>Until one day, further movements opened a passage connecting the surface and underground worlds right at the Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the purple fungus discovered this ideal place to propagate and settled there.</p><p></p><p>Even more coincidentally, the Winged Dragon tribe also discovered this location and the pool teeming with purple fungus.</p><p></p><p>The two parties immediately joined forces, claiming the sole passage between worlds as their own and sealing it off.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Winged Dragon tribe became the Winged Ones, and the purple fungus became the Mother...</p><p></p><p>Ingenious!</p><p></p><p>"Based on the traces of the 'magic power' network left in the Winged Ones' bodies, my conjecture is about 90% accurate!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the purple 'magic power' networks branching through every part of the Winged Ones' bodies, his hypothesis of their symbiosis with the purple fungus fit perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the Mother's Pool, Su Hao scooped up a handful of the water teeming with fungal spores and transmitted it into his miniature world.</p><p></p><p>He had developed a keen interest in this purple fungus and planned to cultivate a pool of it himself.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could try combining it with various life forms and perhaps produce some peculiar reactions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to his miniature world, Su Hao immediately entered his laboratory and casually picked up the Winged Lord, who seemed to have regained his strength.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Lord's face was twisted in an ugly snarl, baring his teeth as if Su Hao's casual manhandling was a grave insult.</p><p></p><p>He roared madly at Su Hao, "Vile human, you are a faithless wretch! You promised to let me go, but instead imprisoned me here.</p><p></p><p>Debasing your own honor with such despicable actions - for all your tremendous power, you lack a heart worthy of it.</p><p></p><p>You will surely walk the path to destruction for your deeds and be struck by divine punishment..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily, "If only the heavens could find me, I might believe you."</p><p></p><p>Seizing the moment when Su Hao was distracted speaking, the Lord suddenly opened his massive maw and spat out a silent yet swift purple arrow.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao made no attempt to dodge, allowing the arrow to strike his head.</p><p></p><p>The Lord's face lit up with delight, "My attack worked! At this close range, the human had no time to react...In the end, I've won. If I can defeat him, I'll surely find a way out of this place."</p><p></p><p>The purple arrow pierced Su Hao's head and exited out the back of his skull.</p><p></p><p>A perfect headshot! Flawless attack! Well done!</p><p></p><p>Just as the Lord was grinning in anticipated victory, he saw Su Hao raise his head and smile back at him.</p><p></p><p>The Lord's smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? How could he still smile after being shot through the head?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stepped forward until he stood right in front of the Lord, craning his neck to look up at him. "You want to kill me and escape from here? Since you dislike my world and wish to leave, I'll give you a chance.</p><p></p><p>Attack me with all you have! If you can defeat me, you win and I'll let you leave and return to your own world. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Though the Lord had just called Su Hao faithless, hearing this glimmer of hope, he immediately agreed, "You have my word."</p><p></p><p>Then his entire body glowed purple as he unleashed a barrage of attacks on Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p>Violent stomping.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack!"</p><p>Snapping bites.</p><p></p><p>"Swish—swish—"</p><p>Raking claws.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh—"</p><p>Beating wings.  </p><p></p><p>"Swish—boom!"</p><p>Purple energy blasts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Lord left nothing out, assaulting Su Hao in the most frenzied manner.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, every attack passed straight through Su Hao's body, failing to land a single blow.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao closely observed how the Lord channeled, used, and regenerated his energy.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the Lord panted heavily and gradually ceased his attacks.</p><p></p><p>For he had realized that no matter what, he could not harm Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Utterly shocked and despairing, he thought, "Why is this happening..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked puzzled. "Why did you stop? Keep going!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord felt extremely vexed, yet powerless before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He brazenly protested, "Human, this contest is completely unfair. You demand that I defeat you, but you keep dodging, making it impossible for me to land a hit. How can I possibly defeat you? You're just toying with me. If you have the guts, then stop evading and take my attacks directly. I will certainly be able to defeat you then."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao never expected this outwardly dignified Winged Dragon to be so shameless as to make such a demand.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't mind. "Alright, I won't dodge anymore. Go ahead and attack."</p><p></p><p>The Lord's heart leapt with joy, mixed with lingering doubt.</p><p></p><p>He experimentally swiped a claw.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>Just before reaching Su Hao, the claw was blocked by a thin golden barrier.</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed, the Lord thought, "So he truly won't dodge! This time I'll definitely win. Does he really think such a flimsy shield can withstand my attacks? Hah, the human will pay for his carelessness."</p><p></p><p>He then summoned his immense magic power and launched an even more frenzied assault.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ding ding—"</p><p>A stream of crisp sounds rang out.</p><p></p><p>All of the Lord's attacks were blocked by this seemingly thin barrier.</p><p></p><p>Enraged, the Lord turned his head and opened his jaws, biting down on Su Hao with his 'Reality-Piercing Fangs'!</p><p></p><p>"Crunch!"</p><p>It was like biting into the hardest metal in this world. Several teeth shattered and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Lord let out an agonized wail and instinctively released his bite, retreating a few steps in utter despair. "Even my Reality-Piercing Fangs couldn't penetrate this defense...how can I possibly defeat him?"</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Su Hao finished recording the information on how the Lord channeled, used, and regenerated his 'magic power'.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would conduct an experiment implanting the purple fungus.</p><p></p><p>For that, he needed the Lord to obediently lie still.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stepped forward and raised his hand in a flicking motion, saying softly, "You failed to defeat me, so it seems you've lost. Now it's my turn."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's flicking gesture, the Lord's eyes went wide with alarm. "Human, wait..."</p><p></p><p>He had tasted the pain of having his head exploded before.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Su Hao flicked his finger lightly.</p><p></p><p>Striking the Lord squarely in the center of his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The Lord conveniently lost consciousness and naturally fell onto Su Hao's experiment table.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chuckled lightly, "Just like that, everything falls perfectly into place."</p>

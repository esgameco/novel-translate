        <h1>Chapter 786</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not disappoint the Celestial Emperor. Upon hearing this, he readily praised: "I didn't expect you to be so capable, you are indeed formidable. But what is the breakthrough direction of your Reviving Spirit, and how about the Condensing Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Having gained the approval of Xu Shiqiang, the sacred leader of humans, the Celestial Emperor felt extremely proud, with a sense of satisfaction welling up from the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>This feeling even surpassed the sensation of gaining human recognition and ascending to the throne of the Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor excitedly thought to himself: "The sacred human leader Xu Shiqiang is interested in my breakthrough discovery and has acknowledged it."</p><p></p><p>Although he considered himself extraordinary, he still held great reverence towards the sacred human leader.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor raised the teacup, taking a light sip. A rich fragrant aroma pervaded his surroundings, invigorating his spirit greatly.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a long breath and said: "The reason it's called the Reviving Spirit is because the breakthrough of the Condensing Spirit Mirror drew inspiration from the spiritual power of the old era.</p><p></p><p>I used to be an ordinary person seeking the path of breakthrough. After many years of exploring spiritual energy and trying all kinds of ideas, I had no results, because I found that the spiritual energy reformed by the first Celestial Emperor had only preserved the pure spiritual power while losing a certain 'vitalizing' quality.</p><p></p><p>So I set the spiritual energy aside and searched through the records of cultivators from thousands of years ago in the old era. Then I made a new discovery: combining the old spiritual power with the new spiritual energy in a specific way could produce an extraordinarily miraculous effect. Not only could the combined spiritual power become more freely manipulable, but it could also develop more spells with slightly enhanced power.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this kind of spiritual power could slightly fuse into the flesh and blood, transforming the cultivator's body into a true spiritual form, greatly extending their lifespan. It could also integrate into the nervous system, causing the cultivator's mental power to soar!</p><p></p><p>I simply call this spiritual power formed by the new combination method 'Spirit'. Because I believe this is certainly not the ultimate form of spiritual power, but it is the direction for the future development of spiritual power. As we continue to explore the structure of spiritual power, we will be able to obtain an even more powerful 'Spirit' in the future."</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very interested in the 'Spirit' described by the Celestial Emperor and chuckled: "Just based on your discovery alone, you are fully qualified to sit on the throne of the Fourth Celestial Emperor, and you will certainly leave a very profound mark in the history of human cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor humbly said: "This is nothing compared to you, Your Holiness. There are three reasons why I was able to make this discovery. First, I had conducted many years of research on spiritual energy beforehand, gaining sufficient understanding of its characteristics. Second, I suddenly and inexplicably wanted to dig out the spiritual power records from thousands of years ago for study. Third, my starting position was high, allowing me access to the ancient spiritual power. If not for these three factors together, I'm afraid I would have achieved nothing."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "You are being too modest. There were others who met those three conditions, but only you successfully broke through to the Condensing Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>He did not stint in his praise of the Fourth Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had deliberately refrained from interfering with the development of the Cloud Ring System for thousands of years, hoping to reap the fruits of this civilization's natural progress.</p><p></p><p>This return had truly brought him a great surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected that Yonghua had managed to pass down the lineage of cultivation, nor that cultivation in the Cloud Ring System had been pushed to new heights from another direction.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had originally only intended to come back and collect some interstellar technology...</p><p></p><p>The discoveries of the First Celestial Emperor and the Fourth Celestial Emperor before him had propelled the development of the holy land of cultivation. This seemed coincidental, yet it was an inevitability arising from the combined effects of the number of cultivators, technology, and time.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that no matter who it was, their lifespan had limits. Every person could only drift along a small segment of the long river of history. What inevitabilities would occur in the future was unknown, and what inevitabilities had occurred in the past could only be vaguely glimpsed through historical records...</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because Suhao's lifespan in this world was long enough to span thousands of years of civilization that he could witness this brand new facet of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, perhaps millions of years later when Suhao awoke from another world, he would still be using what the holy land of cultivation called the spiritual power of the old era.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was not in a hurry. He slowly sipped his tea while casually chatting with the Celestial Emperor: "I am very interested in your discovery of 'Spirit', perhaps we will have many topics in common to discuss."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor also realized that this sacred human leader Xu Shiqiang before him meant no harm, and was not rushed either. Feeling greatly honored by this conversation with the sacred human, he remarked: "I never imagined that one day I would have the chance to sit down and discuss cultivation with Your Holiness over tea. This is the greatest honor for me!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao glanced around the surroundings and smiled: "This is just a small world I temporarily constructed, not a suitable place for conversation. Let's change locations."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor was stunned again, gazing in awe at the vast expanse of space and thinking to himself: "This is the legendary small world?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Suhao's hand, the scene shifted for the two of them, the stone table and chairs they were sitting on transported to an exquisitely beautiful realm akin to a celestial paradise - it was Suhao's 'second-level world'.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor turned to admire the scenery of the second-level world. First stunned by Suhao's casual teleportation, he then exclaimed in astonishment: "Hey, why is the environment here similar to a tourist planet called 'Fantasy Land'?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao explained: "Oh, you mean this? The land and scenery here were directly excavated in one piece from an Eight-Armed Race's colonial planet thousands of years ago. Over the years, my assistant Jia Fengcheng has taken good care of it."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor gasped, eyes widening in disbelief: "The 'Holy Spoon Sea' with a diameter of four hundred kilometers on Fantasy Land was dug out by you? There were rumors before that it was you who took it away, but I didn't believe it. I never expected it to be true. And the sacred Jia Fengcheng is also still around..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Yes, I did scoop out that spoonful. The scene you see here is not much different from before."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor stared blankly at Suhao. Six thousand years ago, the sacred Xu Shiqiang was already capable of such feats, while he, the strongest human cultivator, would struggle to even lift a stone block of just a few kilometers in diameter...</p><p></p><p>So what kind of cultivation had they been practicing for these past six thousand years?</p><p></p><p>What? This person is Xu Shiqiang? Never mind then.</p><p></p><p>Because there was simply no basis for comparison.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Please explain in detail the specific composition, characteristics of 'Spirit', as well as the application of various spells."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he casually demonstrated his spiritual power to the Celestial Emperor, then continued: "To be honest, these past few thousand years I have been wandering and exploring the outer universe, without conducting deeper research into spiritual power. The spiritual power I currently use is still limited to what you called the spiritual power of the old era."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor thought to himself: "Even using the spiritual power of the old era, he is invincible. Xu Shiqiang is truly worthy of being called the sacred one."</p><p></p><p>He took another sip of tea and said: "If Your Holiness is not in a hurry, I will start by explaining my research findings on the two types of spiritual power, as well as my combination approach. I have stored more materials in a top-secret computer which I can retrieve for you at any time, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Take your time, no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suhao and the Celestial Emperor began discussing the topic in detail within the small world.</p><p></p><p>However, what they were both unaware of was that the outside world had already erupted into an uproar over the Fourth Celestial Emperor being captured. The battle video quickly spread everywhere through quantum communications and teleportation arrays.</p><p></p><p>The news that the person fighting the Celestial Emperor might be the sacred Xu Shiqiang had ignited the entire human population of the Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's first reaction was "Are you kidding me? How can such news be believed?" This society must have become hopelessly delusional to this degree.</p><p></p><p>Then a young girl named Yue Xiaodan uploaded a first-person perspective video, in which she was seen interacting and conversing with a man in a white shirt.</p><p></p><p>That man's appearance was identical to the statues of the sacred Xu Shiqiang on various planets.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, when Yue Xiaodan asked for the man's name, he replied: "I'm called Jia Wei."</p><p></p><p>Many did not understand the significance of this name, until they saw the explanations in the comments below.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts instantly ignited with flames, and they began to believe that this person was indeed Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>If asked why, they would undoubtedly answer: "A feeling! The person in the video, he just feels like Xu Shiqiang. No one could imitate that transcendent and noble aura."</p><p></p><p>Of course, not everyone welcomed Xu Shiqiang's return with cheers and jubilation.</p><p></p><p>The high officials of the Four Great Alliances were not necessarily happy about the sacred Xu Shiqiang's return, as their biggest concern was that he might take everything away from them.</p><p></p><p>If it really was Xu Shiqiang, they had no doubt that he could accomplish such a feat.</p>

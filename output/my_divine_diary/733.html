        <h1>Chapter 733</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Another decade slipped by quietly.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had always thought Yashan's research would progress quickly, but he didn't expect that while his own research on entangled vital force and entangled spiritual energy had made breakthroughs, he was still waiting for Yashan's good news.</p><p></p><p>Until this day, Yashan suddenly ran into Suhao's lab, shouting excitedly: "Master Wei! Master Wei! I succeeded! I found a way to infinitely embed and stack neural units into a brain."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes lit up: "This is really good news!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly put down his work to examine Yashan's research results.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "The mother insect's brain is very peculiar, composed of one small module after another. Although its brain volume is large, its internal structure is actually quite simple when deconstructed.</p><p></p><p>The most amazing thing is that this very simple modular structure allows the mother insect to have extremely high intelligence - its memory, computing power, logical reasoning, observation, and judgment are all top-notch. This is almost unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>This means that as long as neural modules keep being stacked into the mother insect's brain, its intelligence can continue increasing until the brain structure can no longer support the massive volume.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated research and testing, I discovered that the fundamental reason for possessing powerful intelligence lies in those tiny modular structures.</p><p></p><p>Looking at a single small structure doesn't seem special, but when the embedded quantity reaches a certain level, the power displayed is simply incalculably strong."</p><p></p><p>At first, Suhao had also studied the mother insect's brain, so he was very clear about this. After listening to Yashan, he nodded: "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan became almost excitedly dancing: "If the human brain could also stack infinitely like this, does it mean that human intelligence could reach extremely high levels too?</p><p></p><p>I first tested this on the main brain of the Eight-Armed Race. The experimental subject that succeeded displayed intelligence beyond anything I've ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Then I tested it on human brains and found the intelligence increase was almost boundless! Aside from the head becoming several times larger and increased energy consumption, there were almost no other side effects.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is data obtained from experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>I haven't personally tried it yet. After reporting to you Master Wei, I plan to test it on my own brain to see the real effects."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "If you're not afraid of messing up your own brain, I have no objections."</p><p></p><p>Yashan confidently said: "Anything produced by Yashan is top-notch, you can rest assured!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, my stacking method won't damage my own brain. Even if it doesn't work, I can directly disconnect and restore to the original state."</p><p></p><p>Suhao turned his gaze back to the materials: "It's good that you're confident."</p><p></p><p>As he looked through it, Suhao said in surprise: "Yashan, your construction approach is quite impressive! Beyond my expectations."</p><p></p><p>Yashan felt immensely pleased being praised by his Master Wei, his hair standing on end: "Ha! Not bad at all! It's all from learning from Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>During the research process, I did encounter some rather difficult problems.</p><p></p><p>For example, since the human brain structure is already fixed, how to turn it into the mother insect's modular structure?</p><p></p><p>Where can we find neural organizations compatible with humans? Do we have to plunder them from other humans?</p><p></p><p>These problems seem simple, but the actual operations are infinitely difficult. Any tiny detail could stump me for a long time...</p><p></p><p>But in the end, I managed to solve them one by one!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Your solutions are also very ingenious. These seemingly difficult problems can actually be solved with very simple methods. And you managed to do that - this ability is top-notch no matter where you apply it.</p><p></p><p>Yashan, after learning a vast amount of knowledge and constantly optimizing your thinking methods, you have completed a metamorphosis of your soul.</p><p></p><p>Even without me, the 'Prophet Human', modifying your brain in the future, you will still be a formidable person. Congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the assistant's evaluation of Yashan quietly changed to 'Senior Researcher', and with one more step, it could become 'Scholar'.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Suhao had praised Yashan so solemnly, leaving Yashan surrounded by immense joy.</p><p></p><p>After so many years of hard study, research, and tirelessly chasing Master Wei's footsteps, he had finally received official praise!</p><p></p><p>This was different from just acknowledgment - 'praise' was far higher level than 'acknowledgment'!</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself: "I, Yashan, am different? A bit different, but still the same - I'm Yashan, striving to catch up to Master Wei's steps, able to help Master Wei. In the future, I'll continue working hard."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao finished reviewing Yashan's research results. Theoretically, it was indeed feasible and the method was simple.</p><p></p><p>The mother insect's brain had a structure called the 'core', which was its brain before stacking neural organizations during spawning.</p><p></p><p>Yashan used the human brain as the 'core', and like the mother insect, accumulated and stacked neural organizations outward from the core.</p><p></p><p>However, the human brain structure is different from the mother insect 'core', so how did Yashan solve the connection problem?</p><p></p><p>Very simple - use the 'mind platform' of celestial cultivators to envelop the brain, turning it into a structure like the mother insect 'core'.</p><p></p><p>Then he could infinitely connect neural modules to it, just like the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>Where did the 'neural modules' come from?</p><p></p><p>It was precisely these two points that made Suhao praise Yashan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed simple, but being able to think of it and actually do it was not easy, yet Yashan managed it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered for a moment, then suddenly asked: "Yashan, this plan should have no issues. It's essentially similar to us celestial cultivators externally interfacing a 'mind platform'. You can boldly experiment on your own body without worry.</p><p></p><p>After the experimental results come out, try to skip the 'mother insect neural module' step and directly construct 'neural modules' from spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan was stunned at first, then uncertainly said: "Master Wei, are you suggesting I reference the structure of the mother insect's 'neural modules' and use spiritual energy to build a spiritual brain?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "Correct! We must find a suitable substitute for the mother insect's neural modules, preferably something we can easily manifest with our own abilities, like vital force, spiritual energy, source power...</p><p></p><p>Relying too much on the mother insect's production means this power fundamentally does not belong to us."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao finished speaking, Yashan immediately understood: "I understand, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>For now, this task was assigned to Yashan. If Yashan couldn't do it, Suhao would take over Yashan's initial achievements and participate in the research himself.</p><p></p><p>If in the end they really couldn't use spiritual energy or anything else to produce a suitable brain, then Suhao had another method: starting from cellular differentiation.</p><p></p><p>But fundamentally, Suhao was more inclined to use spiritual energy to replace cells!</p><p></p><p>And this was also the key to him obtaining eternal life.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "In terms of function, spiritual energy has 'versatility' and can flexibly combine into complex structures to perform various functions, theoretically replacing neural structures is possible.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, I had also studied the subject of 'using spiritual energy to replace the brain and extend lifespan', but was limited by lack of knowledge about structures, unable to delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>Now the mother insect's brain structure can serve as a reference.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps my previous conception can be realized in this world..."</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly confirming there were no issues with Yashan's work, Suhao said to him: "We'll discuss the spiritual energy brain later. For now, I'll assist you in building a brain using the neural modules produced by the mother insects, so we can see the effects!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 982</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered and said, "Through this incident, I realized that merely exploring life planets might cause us to miss out on many interesting materials. For example, if there wasn't this Martial Dao planet in this galaxy system this time, we would have had no connection with Yuanqi.</p><p></p><p>So our exploration team needs to slow down the exploration speed and add an exploration step: collect material samples from different planets.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, establish a sample research center dedicated to studying the collected samples to find those materials scattered in the universe that we haven't discovered."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Captain Su!"</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, this is ultimately a material universe. Studying materials is essentially studying the universe.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed this research direction was absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when he thoroughly researched all the unknown materials, the door to the 'fantasy world' hidden beneath the material world would open up to him.</p><p></p><p>And this so-called 'fantasy world' would inevitably overturn their understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>After assigning the corresponding tasks, Su Hao asked, "Feng Cheng, what's the progress on your research on magic insects?"</p><p></p><p>Talking about this, Feng Cheng became very excited, "Captain Su, I've basically analyzed the principles of magic insect cells.</p><p></p><p>The reason why magic insect cells can maintain extremely high activity without collapsing and express genetic information after their genes undergo drastic changes is because magic insect cells have a 'pressure screening system' to ensure that gene transcription will not harm the cells."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded. When he previously researched magic insect cells, he had similar speculations that there might be a transcription 'threshold' inside the cells. As long as it didn't exceed this threshold, it meant the cells could withstand it, so the cells would develop and evolve normally by default.</p><p></p><p>But once it exceeded this threshold, it meant it might threaten the cell's survival, so it would activate corresponding programs to automatically cut off gene sequences that could destroy the cells.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it's similar to the mechanism of maintaining a constant body temperature - sweating to cool down when hot, and shivering with constricted pores to warm up when cold.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Can this screening system be realized in ordinary human bodies?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Theoretically it's possible, but there's no practical application yet. At most it will take a hundred years for me to get results."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Haha, I'm very interested in these magic insects. A hundred years is too long for you. If it were me, I'm confident I could figure it out in ten years. But I have a more interesting project now, so I'll leave the magic insect research to you."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Su Hao returned to the lab and continued trying to transform the source into more different types of 'Yuanqi', storing each in separate small worlds for preservation.</p><p></p><p>He then conducted various experiments on these different Yuanqi.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Awesome, this is the feeling of fist-to-flesh combat."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei, Lv Yijiang and the third person were fiercely battling in mid-air, fighting as if it were the apocalypse with winds whipping up and sand and stones flying.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei really enjoyed the exhilaration of this kind of battle.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this berserk fighting style was more interesting than precisely taking out the enemy with spells.</p><p></p><p>No need to think too much, just go red-eyed and barge through with fists...</p><p></p><p>After they stopped, Cong Renfei didn't understand, "With the same Yuanqi amount, why do I feel you hit harder? Is it because of martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Just clashing Yuanqi head-on, Cong Renfei couldn't beat the three of them, but he would use other cheating methods, so it looked like they were evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang smiled, "You mean Ling, right? Our Yuanqi contains some Ling, this part of energy called Yuanling by Mr. Jia Wei is much more explosive."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's eyes almost popped out, "Huh? Yuanling? What's that?"</p><p></p><p>He had only obtained Yuanqi for a short time, and the Yuanqi in his body had not yet fused with his spiritual power, so Cong Renfei didn't know what so-called Yuanling was.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lv Yijiang explained to Cong Renfei what Yuanling was. Cong Renfei exclaimed, "Yuanqi has this effect too?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang showed Cong Renfei the new cultivation method taught by Su Hao, saying, "This is the new cultivation method Mr. Jia Wei taught us, which includes a way to integrate spiritual power and Yuanqi."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cloud Emperor flashed and appeared beside Lv Yijiang, "What new cultivation method? Let me see."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Old man Cloud Emperor, at your ripe old age, instead of watching videos, you still want to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>But he didn't intend to hide it alone either. After reading it himself, he casually handed it to Cloud Emperor.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Cloud Emperor shook his head and kept praising, "Brilliant, brilliant! Who could have conceived of such an ingenious cultivation method? This is completely different from our current popular cultivation concepts, enough to establish a new sect and be renowned for thousands of years!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei mocked, "Establishing a new sect and being renowned for thousands of years is impressive? Is having the name 'Jia Wei' impressive? No, right?"</p><p></p><p>Two months later, Cong Renfei successfully integrated Yuanqi into the spiritual power he commonly used, obtaining a large amount of Yuanling. After trying to use Yuanling to release various spells, he was shocked by the power displayed.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively opened Cong Shuli's contact, "Sis, come look, I got stronger, I'm awesome now!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cong Shuli was still frantically exploring other planets in the galaxy system. Hearing Cong Renfei's words, she was annoyed, "Did you learn that Martial Dao stuff? Hurry and join me exploring planets so we can finish early and rest. I want to take a vacation!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Ahem, that, I'm still learning. I'll teach you after I learn it. This ability is guaranteed to be awesome. Sis, take your time searching. I'll hang up first."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Cong Renfei immediately hung up.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, just a moment later, Cong Shuli suddenly appeared beside him, hands on hips, glaring angrily.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "......"</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have said it so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, people tend to get carried away when excited.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei forced a brilliant smile, "Sis, I didn't lie to you. This is called Yuanling, it can greatly increase our strength..."</p><p></p><p>So a few months later, after successfully learning Yuanling, Cong Shuli dragged Cong Renfei along to explore the unfinished planets together.</p><p></p><p>The mission required exploring this entire galaxy system, but she refused to explore alone while her brother slacked off here, even if he tried to tempt her with credits.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said softly, "Sis, can you return the two thousand credits I gave you before?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"One thousand is fine too."</p><p></p><p>"No return!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "......"</p><p></p><p>Sisters are just awesome.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei thought inwardly, "If I were the older brother and you the younger sister, I definitely wouldn't listen to you."</p><p></p><p>When Cong Shuli was about to take Cong Renfei away, Lv Yijiang ran over and asked, "Cong Renfei, when will you take us to the Infinite Land?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled bitterly, "I have to work now, so I probably won't have time to take you guys to the Infinite Land to wander. If you're in a hurry, I can send you over directly and you can do your own thing. If not urgent, wait for me here for a few years until I finish work, then I'll take you there."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the other two looked at each other, quickly making a decision, "You can send us over now, we'll be fine on our own, no need to trouble you to accompany us cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei carefully considered it and nodded, "Okay, your strength is enough for self-protection, as long as you run fast enough, there shouldn't be a big problem if you encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no Heavenly or Earthly Yuanqi to replenish you in the Infinite Land, meaning your strength will weaken considerably. So you need to be careful.</p><p></p><p>Also, there are many powerful beings in the Infinite Land that you cannot contend with at your current level. If you provoke them, who knows how you'll die. So keep a low profile, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The three nodded, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei redeemed three 'Lucky Goddess' Lost Coins' and three 'Natural Yuanqi Spheres' from the mall, handing them to the three, "Use these sparingly, this Natural Yuanqi should last you a few years. I'll come find you in the Infinite Land after finishing work!"</p><p></p><p>After going over some precautions, Cong Renfei transmitted the three to the border of the Infinite Land about to connect with the Martial Dao Planet, then went to work with Cong Shuli.</p><p></p><p>After spending time with Lv Yijiang and the other two, Cong Renfei had come to see them as friends, so he casually helped them out when he could.</p><p></p><p>As for whether these three friends would act recklessly in the Infinite Land, Cong Renfei didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>Now that he could redeem three travel passes and Natural Yuanqi Spheres with his own credits, he felt he had already done enough as a friend...</p><p></p><p>Besides, the three's strength in the Infinite Land was already in the upper-middle tier, they could protect themselves fine as long as they didn't provoke the big shots.</p><p></p><p>If they died, as their friend, Cong Renfei would come back to help collect their corpses after finishing his main work.</p><p></p><p>End of the month, asking for some monthly tickets~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 921</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Another hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>By this time, Yashan had finished training his fifth generation of disciples, having accepted a total of ninety-nine direct disciples. The students who did not qualify were all sent back, becoming the 'great villains' on the Remodeling Planet.</p><p></p><p>After that, Yashan no longer continued to take in new disciples, focusing solely on guiding his current ninety-nine disciples well. If there were suitable disciples, he would have those among the ninety-nine who had already gained his approval take them in as students.</p><p></p><p>And Yashan's disciples considered being able to independently take in students as the highest honor.</p><p></p><p>According to his idea, if the number of future generations of students became large in the future, then he would select a time each year to give public lectures...</p><p></p><p>During these hundred years, Fengcheng also took in thirty exceptionally outstanding disciples, leaving the rest to be taught by Congshuli and Congrenfei.</p><p></p><p>At this time, including the Red Demon King who was just there to make up the numbers, Fengcheng had a total of eighty-nine disciples and descendants, slightly fewer than Yashan.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, he had no intention of taking in disciples for the time being. Moreover, up until now, he had not discovered anyone he found exceptionally impressive. Even if he encountered decent seedlings, he mostly directly handed them over to Yashan and Fengcheng for guidance.</p><p></p><p>If calculated strictly, Yashan and Fengcheng could also be considered his disciples. It's just that these two disciples were somewhat special, with more of a comrade and assistant feeling than disciples.</p><p></p><p>"After resolving the Wave in the future and having nothing to do, I could pick out some good seedlings to personally guide. But now is not the time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had always been very goal-oriented, which made him extremely focused on what he was doing, rarely experiencing situations where he would suddenly lose sight of his goal midway.</p><p></p><p>That day, he came to Heaven and met with the deities.</p><p></p><p>All the deities looked at him with hopeful faces.</p><p></p><p>If their guess was not wrong, this time Lei'an had come to set them free - they had been waiting for this moment for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Because during these hundred years, they had arranged everything properly, without dissatisfaction, complaints or hatred, only longing for going out...</p><p></p><p>But the closer they were to gaining freedom, the more anxious they became in their hearts, completely different from the excitement and delight they had imagined before.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that Lei'an would tear up the agreement, they were afraid that the freedom they had waited for over a thousand years was just a beautiful fantasy painted by Lei'an, they were afraid that when they lost their use, Lei'an would mercilessly kill them...</p><p></p><p>This kind of worry overshadowed everything.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not prevent their longing for a better life in the future.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they firmly believed one fact in their hearts: Lei'an would not deceive them. Although Lei'an's heart was black, over such a long period of time he had always kept his word. Lei'an possessed a noble soul unmatched by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked around and revealed a brilliant smile, saying, "Congratulations, deity sirs, you have perfectly completed all the tasks. With your own efforts, you have obtained the freedom you wanted. So now, adjust the operating mode of the First Primordial God to full automatic!"</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately jumped up excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Nati, as the first deity captured by Su Hao, said with a trembling voice from the excitement, "Too...too good!"</p><p></p><p>This excited emotion was almost comparable to when he first saw the other deities also being captured.</p><p></p><p>The other deities also wanted to express something, but opened their mouths without saying anything, and silently adjusted the First Primordial God's program to full automatic mode.</p><p></p><p>Then they waited for Su Hao's next arrangement.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Su Hao summoned eighteen [Divine] bodies with 'soul brains', and said, "These are the eighteen [Divine] bodies I have prepared for you, with extremely powerful functions, no different from the one I'm using now.</p><p></p><p>However, you need to be mentally prepared that when your will enters these powerful bodies, your perception and thinking will experience a tremendous surge. During the adaptation process, you must adhere to the essence of your will and not indulge in this vastly increased illusory power."</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at the [Divine] bodies, drooling all over the floor.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "Using these [Divine] bodies is very complicated, but there are corresponding operation prompts. You can slowly get used to it by following the prompts. Now, use the 'Information Will Peeling Technique' to peel your main will away from the Baijia bodies, then enter Heaven through the soul network. I will plant you one by one into the bodies."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the deities started arguing fiercely in their group chat:</p><p></p><p>"Don't snatch it from me, I call dibs on the first body. I reserved it first, so it's mine."</p><p></p><p>"I want the one in the middle, the middle one should be the weakest, you guys don't need to fight me for it."  </p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, I also want the middle one, don't snatch it from me."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we decide by rock-paper-scissors?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey hey, why should just the two of you decide by rock-paper-scissors? What about the rest of us?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, didn't you hear Lei'an say all the bodies are the same? Which one is different?"</p><p></p><p>"You like to say such goody-goody stuff, then you can go stand aside and choose after we're done."</p><p></p><p>"Never mind what I said, I want the one on the far left, I've taken a fancy to it, it's definitely mine."</p><p></p><p>...The argument went on and on.</p><p></p><p>So the Golden God Bali pointed at the pile of [Divine] bodies and said to Su Hao, "Lei'an sir, for fairness, we plan to draw lots first to decide who enters which body. To avoid more arguing later."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at these deities in surprise, "These bodies are all about the same, you're even distinguishing them so clearly?"</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshi said indifferently, "Lei'an sir, please don't think too highly of these petty, small-hearted fellows. They've lived for who knows how many years, but anywhere there's a hole, they just get smaller and smaller. They really can't take any losses at all."</p><p></p><p>The other deities glared angrily at Yongshi, "Lord Yongshi, what nonsense are you spouting? As if your asshole is bigger than ours."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, take your pants off and let's compare if you dare."</p><p></p><p>"We don't have assholes, ah haha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately interrupted, "Alright, alright, just draw lots then..."</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao numbered the [Divine] bodies and casually sent out eighteen beams of golden light floating in mid-air, "Choose!"</p><p></p><p>The deities rubbed their hands, took deep breaths, and kept muttering, "Lei'an Oakes bless me to draw the middle one, Lei'an sir bless me, Lei'an sir his own man bless me..."</p><p></p><p>After fidgeting for a while, the deities finally made their picks.</p><p></p><p>Then they looked at the [Divine] body they drew, and without exception, none of them got the one they wanted.</p><p></p><p>So they started negotiating to trade with each other...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Are you done yet? If not, I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>The deities immediately became obedient, and in no time, their soul wills appeared in Heaven together.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao collected them, then casually waved out, and the deities' soul wills entered the [Divine] bodies they had drawn respectively.</p><p></p><p>Everything became quiet.</p><p></p><p>After the deities' soul wills fused with the soul brains Su Hao had prepared for them, all the deities felt as if they were in a dream, experiencing a tsunami-like eruption of their abilities.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they indulged in this metamorphosis, taking a long time to regain their senses.</p><p></p><p>After all, although these deities had existed for countless years, from the perspective of consciousness information, they were far weaker than Su Hao and the others.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had suddenly gained such powerful brains, despite Su Hao's prior warning, they still struggled to control themselves from falling into the same 'unable to distinguish illusion from reality' scenario that Yashan had encountered.</p><p></p><p>For these deities, the world constructed by the powerful brains was almost the only reality.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed for a moment, then casually pointed to seal part of the soul brain's functions, and woke the deities up.</p><p></p><p>"Hey hey, you've indulged too much, you can't even control these [Divine] bodies!"</p><p></p><p>The deities one by one woke up.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they were all dazed.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that they profoundly realized just how vast the gap between them and Su Hao truly was.</p><p></p><p>It far exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Such bodies..."</p><p></p><p>Then three words popped into the minds of all the deities: "We hit the jackpot!"</p>

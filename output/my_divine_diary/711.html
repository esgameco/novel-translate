        <h1>Chapter 711</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao was completely baffled. He was doing fine with 'Stargating', but as soon as he stopped, he suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This was even more abrupt than encountering the particle stream in his previous life, without even time to react.</p><p></p><p>He entered the pinball space and repeatedly played back the death record of [Eight-Armed God]. </p><p></p><p>Finally, he confirmed that he was unfortunately hit by a small meteorite.</p><p></p><p>After stopping 'Stargating', he left the protection of the 'space bubble' in curved space travel, and directly collided with a small meteorite at nearly the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>Under such a high-speed impact, even as [Eight-Armed God], a deity-level cultivator, he had to die.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but complain: "How unlucky do I have to be to encounter a small meteorite right when I stop?"</p><p></p><p>If he had stopped a few seconds later, he might have perfectly avoided this meteorite.</p><p></p><p>This was more exciting than winning the lottery, making him wonder if his 'unlucky attribute' was innate, and the 'Doom System' was just a supplement...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao fell into contemplation: "Generally speaking, before a spacecraft engages in curved space travel, it must go through a lot of calculations to determine a safe landing point before activating the curvature engine. Once the curvature engine is activated, it will not stop until it reaches the destination, not only due to the characteristics of the curvature engine itself but also to avoid such collision dangers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, although I can freely control the start and stop of Stargating, I cannot determine if there are other dangers after I stop. For example, I might collide with a planet directly?"</p><p></p><p>He could not rely on his luck after the first attempt killed an [Eight-Armed God].</p><p></p><p>"What should I do? During travel, there is a special space bubble for protection, so I don't need to worry about colliding with celestial bodies and meteorites. In other words, as long as I maintain the space bubble, I can avoid danger...</p><p></p><p>The problem is, the space bubble disappears when Stargating stops. My secondary space and 'counter-space barrier' cannot take effect during high-speed motion either..."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Suhao had a preliminary plan: use 'Small World' as a buffer.</p><p></p><p>First, create a suitably sized small world, with Suhao's body inside.</p><p></p><p>Then use Stargating to envelop the 'Small World' and travel with it through curved space.</p><p></p><p>Because no matter how fast the entire small world moves relative to the outside, the space within the small world is fixed, and Suhao inside is relatively stationary.</p><p></p><p>Then his 'secondary space' and 'counter-space barrier' can take effect, avoiding collisions with any matter.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if he collides head-on with a planet during the high-speed motion phase after travel ends, he can avoid it through secondary space or the counter-space barrier.</p><p></p><p>With the idea in mind, Suhao reactivated the 'control clone' program.</p><p></p><p>In the [God] warehouse, an [Eight-Armed God] suddenly opened its eyes and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"The new body needs an hour or two to adapt!"</p><p></p><p>So he performed various actions in this small world to quickly integrate with the current body.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng flashed in, immediately noticing one [Eight-Armed God] missing from the warehouse. Uncertain, they asked: "Master Suhao?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded and explained: "I just went out for a spin and broke this body, so I changed to a new one. I'm adapting right now. After I finish adapting, I'll go out again."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked at each other, that was the top-configured [Eight-Armed God]!</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed quite interesting, and they both expressed wanting to try it too!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao adapted quickly, and he transmitted away again, returning to that supply planet.</p><p></p><p>Looking around.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? An Octopus Clan warship? Are they here to investigate?"</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao flashed a few times close to the warship, raised his fist and smashed it into the hull.</p><p></p><p>'Locking Punch'!</p><p></p><p>Then he flashed into the warship, skillfully shutting down all communication equipment, before transmitting into the small world.</p><p></p><p>This warship now belonged to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>He also sent a message in the group: "Yashan Fengcheng, I picked up a warship, find time to disassemble and study it. The corresponding technology for the Eight-Armed Clan warships can be found in the assistant."</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied: "Received, Master Suhao!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "Picked up? Where can I go pick one up too!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "There are many scattered in this star domain, if you want one, go find it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Yashan sent a dazed expression emoji.</p><p></p><p>After assigning the tasks, Suhao went into space again for the second 'Stargating' skill test.</p><p></p><p>He first created a small world, entered it, then pink crystal vines spread out, enveloping the small world and generating dense rune formations, with fifty high-quality source pearls embedded on it.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>Stargating activated successfully again.</p><p></p><p>A day later, he deactivated 'Stargating', and set up a 'counter-space barrier' inside the small world.</p><p></p><p>Then he plunged straight into a huge meteorite, emerging from the other side in an extremely short time.</p><p></p><p>Completely unharmed!</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed silently, not stopping there, but reactivating 'Stargating' and randomly choosing a direction to travel at super-high speed.</p><p></p><p>From an initial level 3 curvature, he increased to level 4, then 5, 6...</p><p></p><p>Until reaching the maximum level 8, Suhao felt the energy output becoming extremely strained.</p><p></p><p>Level 8 curvature travel had reached 1024 times the speed of light, supposedly faster than the fastest Eight-Armed Clan warships.</p><p></p><p>He thought: "Level 8, is this my limit?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he increased the energy output, he could not make spacetime reach a higher curvature.</p><p></p><p>But at only 1024 times the speed of light, it was far from his expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Ring System had a diameter of about 200,000 light-years. At level 8 curvature travel, it would take 200 years to traverse this galaxy...</p><p></p><p>At that speed, what roaming the universe? It was more like a slow stroll.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, I can go faster!"</p><p></p><p>"The formations can only support up to level 8 speed, but what affects spacetime curvature is not just the rune formations, but also my spiritual tentacles and space modules. So..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao concentrated his mind, the core compound rune in his body operating frantically, continuously stacking space modules ahead while his spiritual tentacles extended behind, cooperating with the formations to forcefully stretch space.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the spacetime in front and behind Suhao bent drastically again.</p><p></p><p>Level 9.4!</p><p></p><p>"Not enough! Again!"</p><p></p><p>9.6...</p><p></p><p>Suhao felt immense mental pressure, but he didn't care since he was an [Eight-Armed God] - if this one broke, he could just get another.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he exerted all his effort but could only maintain level 9.6, a speed of about 1,900 times light speed.</p><p></p><p>It would still take at least 100 years to traverse the Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>To maintain this high-pressure travel state...</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "Can't do it, at this rate, it won't take 100 years, just 5 years and the [Eight-Armed God]'s mental power will probably collapse! Looks like I celebrated too early, I've only taken the second step!"</p><p></p><p>Next, while traveling at warp 9 speeds, he tried various tricks.</p><p></p><p>Such as: intermittent travel, bringing various 'mind's eyes' to try observing external signals, cooperating with Yashan and Fengcheng to test various electronic signals, bringing insects into the space bubble to observe the mother insect's control, throwing objects out of the space bubble...</p><p></p><p>Then, Suhao successfully broke this [Eight-Armed God], waking up again from the secondary space.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, another one dead."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 934</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"What? At this year's opening ceremony, our master will come to observe?" </p><p></p><p>The beastman king Black Gill immediately became agitated. "This means we have to hand in our assignments, right? Oh no, our master is coming but we haven't prepared anything. What if we don't do a good job? Won't that disappoint our master?"</p><p></p><p>The bird-man king Rich Glory also looked tense. If Master Ah Shan came every year, they would know what standards he had in mind and wouldn't be so nervous. But Ah Shan was only coming to inspect after they had been running the universities for ten years, which made them extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>An uncontrollable question arose in their minds: Have the two universities we established met our master's requirements? Did we fail to do something properly?</p><p></p><p>Just imagining Master Ah Shan touring their schools, with his face gradually turning unsightly, made the disciples' legs go weak.</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vali said solemnly, "Don't be too nervous. The master said they probably won't get directly involved, but will observe secretly from the shadows. We should just do what we normally do, without any special preparations."</p><p></p><p>After the elf king Vali finished speaking, the professors in the office became even more anxious instead of being reassured.</p><p></p><p>A secret inspection? That's even more terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Vali took a deep breath and said slowly, "That's right, besides our master, there's also Master Wind Cheng and...Master Protector Wei!"</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh--"</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the office gasped. Those who had seen Su Hao couldn't help picturing the scene of him laughing wildly as a planet was being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The disciples shuddered all over and couldn't help looking at the elf king Vali, implying he should take responsibility if anything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>Vali spread his hands. "Don't look at me, what can we do? We'll just do what needs to be done. If there are any problems, we'll share the burden together and no one can escape. However, I think there won't be any issues as long as we do one thing well..."</p><p></p><p>The other disciples perked up and asked curiously, "What thing?"</p><p></p><p>Vali revealed a mysterious smile. "As long as we do better than the Twin Swords University next door, there definitely won't be any problems. From the professors' demeanor, publicity, ceremonial atmosphere, campus environment, etc., we need to comprehensively surpass Twin Swords University. With that comparison, our master and the others will only see our strengths."</p><p></p><p>The disciples marveled, "As expected of our senior brother, brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the majestic Twin Swords University buildings nestled in the mountains, the disciples of the Twin Swords Sect held a meeting presided over by Cong Shuling in a luxurious conference hall.</p><p></p><p>After a heated discussion, Cong Shuling slammed her hand on the table and said solemnly, "Our master and protector are coming. We must present the best side of our university, and most importantly: surpass the Infinite University next door."</p><p></p><p>"Our senior sister is wise!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "So we need to send out a scouting team to collect information and plans about Infinite University's opening ceremony."</p><p></p><p>The disciples looked excited, determined to win with high morale.</p><p></p><p>They had worked hard on the Blue-Purple Planet for ten years, pouring tremendous effort into it. They had to make a good showing in front of the three immortal masters.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Su Hao was just curious about what kind of schools Ah Shan and Wind Cheng had established and wanted to take a casual look. He didn't expect this casual thought to spark such intense competition between the two renowned universities on the Blue-Purple Planet.</p><p></p><p>The two extraordinary universities had previously maintained a certain understanding and progressed side by side. Even when recruiting students, they each admitted five thousand, neither more nor less.</p><p></p><p>The concern was that the two universities would get carried away competing against each other, eventually dragging the entire Blue-Purple Planet into the fray.</p><p></p><p>...</p>

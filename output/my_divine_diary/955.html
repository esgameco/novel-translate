        <h1>Chapter 955</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Forty years later, the passage was officially opened.</p><p></p><p>The kings of all the major races had sent their capable men to the location where the world passage was first built, just in case.</p><p></p><p>The world passage wasn't limited to a certain mountain range or ocean, but rather stretched over thousands and thousands of kilometers, separating the entire world's pattern, skillfully, along the harshest of environments.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the kings stood before a mountain range, looking into the distance, what they saw was no longer the once familiar scene, but another unfamiliar mountain range, two completely different world styles, but skillfully blended into one, can't see any traces of the otherworldly, just like the same mountain, the same sea ......</p><p></p><p>When they wanted to check where the so-called world passage was exactly, they failed to detect a trace, incomparably amazing.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the locations of this seemingly endless world passage were unguarded.</p><p></p><p>There was also no race that could have that much manpower to arrange manpower to detect all the areas.</p><p></p><p>However, there were a small number of areas where, very coincidentally, there were clansmen of different races looking curiously at each other through the world passage.</p><p></p><p>The tall and strong Giant Race and the petite Goblin Race looked at each other, truly - wide-eyed;</p><p></p><p>The hairy Hairy Tailed Race and the long-handed Ape Race look at each other, true-orangutans cherish each other ......</p><p></p><p>But they just looked at each other curiously and had no intention of rushing into each other's territory.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, idly bored, suddenly someone greeted first: "Hey! Hello friend on the other side."</p><p></p><p>To the amazement of all the clansmen, they were able to understand this sentence.</p><p></p><p>Except for the different intonation and word usage habits, both sides were using the same set of language.</p><p></p><p>The clansmen then looked at each other and carefully communicated with each other.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the Troll God King was before a mountain range, looking at the distant world of dark red tones, it was still midday on their side, and the other side of the mountain range was also brightly illuminated, but he clearly felt something different.</p><p></p><p>The location at the end of his vision was a dark shadow of the mountains, and the sky on the opposite side was also dim.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, it was daytime on this side and nighttime on the other side, and the reason why it looked bright was entirely the result of the sunlight on this side shining through the world channel.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he thought a lot in his head, this was a habit he had developed over the years, only by thinking more, doubting more and testing more, would he not be cheated, tricked or encountered danger.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I have already sent my most capable men through the world passage, but only the strongest Early managed to pass through the world passage, and the others all suffered different degrees of serious injuries after going deeper and had to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, as long as one's strength reaches a certain level, one can pass through the world passage, and Early's strength has exactly reached the fifth rank, which should be the minimum standard for passing through the world passage.</p><p></p><p>And I'm now at the highest seventh rank, there shouldn't be any problems crossing the world passage.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the World Passage can only allow strong people above the fifth rank to cross it? In this case, I am the one who doesn't need to worry about the alien races invading my world in a big way, and the general direction is good.</p><p></p><p>I still need to personally go through and investigate, so that I can grasp the situation firsthand as early as possible and make plans for the future."</p><p></p><p>After thinking that, the Troll God King no longer hesitated, and after giving his men guarding orders, he led Early through the world passage and explored towards another continent.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that after he left, the kings of the other worlds, too, quietly entered their worlds from another location in the world passage and explored in a hidden form.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao Yashan and Feng Cheng gathered together and watched this scene of the official opening of the world passageway, there was no earth-shattering ceremony or sensational scene, it was the same as usual.</p><p></p><p>It was just that what happened after this day would have an incomparably huge impact on the future.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, ''It seems to be going well, the current world passage can only be passed through by people at the top of the YuanYing realm. In this way, it avoids a violent conflict in the first stage."</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded and said, "Most of those who can currently pass through the world passage are the students I eliminated back then, some of them know each other, the probability of a direct outbreak of conflict won't be too high, and in a short period of time, it should still be dominated by rational exchanges. The communication and fusion we expected, I'm afraid we won't be able to see it so soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "There's no rush, we've made it this far, let the rest develop naturally on their own, what it becomes, we don't need to bother.</p><p></p><p>Just like a huge galaxy, no matter how chaotic it is in the early stages, in the end, a new balance will inevitably be formed."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng had checked Su Hao's description of the balanced shipping line and could understand what Su Hao meant.</p><p></p><p>However, Feng Cheng still had some doubts, "Boss Wei, the kings of all races possess extreme power, won't letting them string around destroying the balance towards the pot system?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Su Hao's mouth hooked up, "Yes, but don't worry about it too much, their destructive power to the entire galaxy is only like a drop of water falling into the ocean, it's not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I've already opened up the 'Goddess of Luck's Lost Coin' in their mall, it's labeled at one hundred points, not too expensive, so there's no problem in exchanging it.</p><p></p><p>Right now there are still many travelers on the Cross Star who don't want to exchange the 'Lucky Coins', they are also sharing the transport wave energy, as long as they die, it will diminish some of the transport wave energy, postponing the impact of the transport wave backward.</p><p></p><p>I have paid special attention to this, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Different galaxies had different galactic balances, and if one rashly intruded from one galaxy into another without the Lucky Coins to protect them, they would inevitably encounter all sorts of bad luck.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this point didn't need to be explicitly stated, and when the people of this land got used to it, they would know that they had to find the lucky coins before crossing the world passage.</p><p></p><p>It was foreseeable that Lucky Coins would inevitably become a cross-border 'pass' in the future.</p><p></p><p>Up until this point, their infinite land plan, had already been inaugurated.</p><p></p><p>This land was the base camp of the three of them, and in the countless years to come, no matter how far outward they explored, this would be the absolute centerpiece.</p><p></p><p>And the 'three-dimensional coordinates of the universe' that Su Hao had planned from a long, long time ago had also been constructed.</p><p></p><p>Taking the black hole towards the pot system as the origin of the 'spatial right-angle coordinate system', pointing towards the blue-violet star billions of light-years away, as the X-axis, extending outwards infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Now all the areas explored, more than ten billion light years range, all included in his coordinate system, just waiting for the future to see his coordinate system, in the end, how far it can be extended.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the empty coordinate system, and looked at the distant and unknown mist outside the coordinate system, and couldn't help but reveal a hopeful smile.</p><p></p><p>Those, were the unknown areas that he would explore.</p><p></p><p>What treasures of the universe would be hidden there?</p><p></p><p>And the current model of apprenticeship, getting talent is too inefficient to meet our future needs.</p><p></p><p>So, each of you go ahead and build a platform that automatically screens for talent, so that the right people can join us in our quest in a steady stream.</p><p></p><p>You can refer to the screening mechanism I built for the Primordial Lord God, and it has been proven that the quality of the people who come out of the Primordial Lord God are not bad.</p><p></p><p>Next, I intend to expand the scale of the Primordial Lord God and screen suitable people from the dead beings of the Infinite Lands to participate in the trials of the Primordial Lord God.</p><p></p><p>Once we have the platform completely set up, we'll be able to focus on researching new things without having to be distracted by other things."</p><p></p><p>"Understood Boss Vi."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed again, "Actually, I had such an idea many years ago, and now I've already initially designed a complete set of screening mechanisms, just that there's never been a good opportunity to build it out.</p><p></p><p>It's just the right time to complete the building of the Infinite Land."</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded his head as well and said, "I've actually already started to build it. The quality of the students that I personally brought out is indeed very good, but the quantity is far below the requirements.</p><p></p><p>What I'm thinking about is finding a way to balance quantity and quality, and most crucially, not to get a bunch of guys with backbones in the back of their heads."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed and said, "I don't have this trouble, because I think that as long as there are more people, backbones can't be avoided!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan also laughed, "That's true, the big thing is to clean up every once in a while."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Boss Yashan, what kind of screening mechanism are you planning to build?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I should create a variety of breakthrough worlds from which I will screen talents with the right intelligence and heart, while exercising their ability to solve various difficult problems. What about Feng Chengyou?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "I'll probably build a huge trial city somewhere, and then create all sorts of duplicates."</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at Su Hao, "Boss Wei, what kind of screening mechanism do you plan to create?"</p>

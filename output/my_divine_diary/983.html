        <h1>Chapter 983</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, the Wuqiong Gate and the Twin Sword Gate have been searching the universe for living planets. After studying the characteristics of the lifeforms and natural environments on these planets, they have designed specific plans to incorporate these living planets into the Infinite Lands, making them a part of the Infinite Lands. This has caused the current Infinite Lands to become extremely vast.</p><p></p><p>Most of these planets do not have intelligent life, but each planet has its own unique aspects. They are interconnected and integrated, while the living planets from different galaxies are isolated from each other.</p><p></p><p>Within the Infinite Lands, planets from the same galaxy are grouped into the same region, while living planets from different galaxies are divided into separate regions.</p><p></p><p>For example, the original Xianghu System had over two hundred living planets, and these two hundred plus living planets together formed the Xianghu Region, which is immense. As for the newly discovered Wudao Star, after being incorporated into the Infinite Lands, it will be named the Wudao Region, consisting of only one planet in size.</p><p></p><p>When operating within the same region, as long as one's strength reaches a certain level, one can move about freely. However, to cross into different regions, one must possess a travel permit, otherwise it is impossible to pass through the interdimensional passages.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of beings living in the Infinite Lands do not have a way to cross the interdimensional passages to reach another world. Even fewer beings can obtain travel permits to traverse different regions.</p><p></p><p>Those lower beings without strength can only move within the scope of their home planet during their lifetime. Even if they know that beyond that tall mountain or vast ocean lies another world, they are powerless to reach it.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, most beings ignored the existence of the interdimensional passages and returned to their own lives.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how vast and wonderful the worlds are, it has nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>The wonders belong to others, while for these ordinary beings...all they can do is watch from the sidelines?</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and his two companions arrived in a brand new world. They learned from Cong Renfei that this place was the border of the Infinite Lands, and the world they were currently in had no intelligent life, only various unique lifeforms fiercely competing for living space and reproducing.</p><p></p><p>They just needed to follow the land forward to reach the central region of the Infinite Lands - the Xianghu Region.</p><p></p><p>Tai Chengdong looked around, jumping up and down, and suddenly said, "Yijiang, Gaoqi, don't you feel lighter here?"</p><p></p><p>The planet they lived on, Wudao Star, had an extremely large mass and higher gravity than other living planets, so after arriving on this planet, they felt their bodies become much lighter.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang nodded, "Indeed, it feels much lighter, very noticeable."</p><p></p><p>Gaoqi shook his head as he looked up information on his learning machine, "There is a corresponding explanation in the learning machine, but I can't understand it..."</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble! Swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of heavy footsteps came from deep within the jungle, accompanied by the noise of broken leaves and branches, growing clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a huge creature was about to emerge from the jungle, causing all three of them to become alert.</p><p></p><p>This world had no spiritual energy of heaven and earth, so they could not merge with nature through spiritual energy. In this world, their sensory perception was greatly weakened, and they were unsure what was about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>With a "huff", an enormous elephant-like creature emerged from the jungle, seeming to glare angrily at Lyu Yijiang's group.</p><p></p><p>This giant elephant was completely black, with a triangular head, and its body was covered in dense scales. A strange sound came from within the giant elephant, and its massive size exerted an overwhelming pressure.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had never seen such a creature before and stared at it in astonishment, taking defensive stances and preparing to flee if the situation became unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sharp-eyed Gaoqi suddenly said, "Wait, there's something strange about this monster, look at the scales on its body."</p><p></p><p>The other two looked closely and indeed discovered something odd - the scales on the monster seemed to be slowly squirming?</p><p></p><p>This was no monster, but rather an enormous creature formed by countless rat-sized millipedes piled together.</p><p></p><p>Gaoqi couldn't help but ask, "What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Before they could continue observing, the quick-handed Tai Chengdong had already fired a small spiritual energy blast, striking the millipede-formed giant elephant.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>With a muffled sound, the giant elephant suddenly burst apart, countless millipedes scattered, blotting out the sky as many flew towards them.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and Gaoqi's eyes nearly popped out as they shouted, "Tai Cheng, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Then without hesitation, they turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>Tai Chengdong followed behind, scratching his head sheepishly, "Hehe, I just wanted to try it out. Didn't expect it to actually explode."</p><p></p><p>His mindset was like seeing a pile of cow dung on the road while coincidentally having a firecracker in hand.</p><p></p><p>A perfect combination of opportunity and impulse.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the millipedes did not give chase, they curiously turned back, wanting to see what these unique millipedes actually were - just like the first time entering a village and seeing a steaming pile of cow dung, their curiosity overcoming their fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw these millipedes gathering together again, constantly squirming until finally forming a massive humanoid creature.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? It turned into a human form?"</p><p></p><p>Gaoqi stroked his chin, "Perhaps they mimic what they perceive as powerful creatures to scare off other predators."</p><p></p><p>After observing the strange humanoid millipede creature for a while, the three carefully bypassed it and entered deeper into the rainforest.</p><p></p><p>Everything in this world piqued their curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the animals different, but even the plants were completely unlike anything they'd seen before.</p><p></p><p>They encountered massive underground worms that suddenly emerged to bite their prey and drag them into tunnels;</p><p></p><p>A tree that suddenly turned into a predator, waving its branches to swallow prey before taking root again;</p><p></p><p>An animal that inserted its head into the ground, then stood upside down disguised as a flower - it seemed to be sleeping? The mischievous Tai Chengdong casually plucked it out, and they ended up staring at each other eye-to-eye...</p><p></p><p>Everything they saw exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang marveled, "Too amazing, this is the Infinite Lands. I never imagined there could be such a place."</p><p></p><p>Gaoqi said, "Cong Renfei said the Infinite Lands are inhabited by many different intelligent races. That must be very interesting. Yijiang, Tai Cheng, let's go find these legendary intelligent races of the Infinite Lands!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>So for the next three years, the three of them wandered the Infinite Lands, passing through one interdimensional passage after another, visiting different worlds and experiencing all kinds of wonders.</p><p></p><p>They were full of anticipation for their future journey.</p><p></p><p>They wondered: After crossing through the interdimensional passage ahead, what would they encounter in the next world?</p><p></p><p>The worlds are so vast, with endless marvels. The universe is so vast, with all possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One day, they crossed another interdimensional passage and arrived in a yellow desert, stretching endlessly with howling winds and sandstorms all around.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, by passing through this desert, we should be able to see the full view of this world."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm really looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>The three had long grown accustomed to emerging into harsh environments like deserts, having realized early on that interdimensional passages were generally built in the most inhospitable environments of worlds, where few could reach.</p><p></p><p>After running for two days in one direction, they finally arrived at a desolate small town.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these strange structures that were clearly built by intelligent beings, the three's eyes lit up like lanterns.</p><p></p><p>"Great, this is a world with an intelligent race. Let's go greet them."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lyu Yijiang charged into the town first, and then saw a group of lizard people staring at him in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Gaoqi frowned, "Yijiang, wait, don't be rash..."</p><p></p><p>But Lyu Yijiang didn't listen at all and had already entered the town.</p><p></p><p>Full of anticipation, Lyu Yijiang greeted the lizard people, "Hello, my name is Lyu Yijiang. Can we be friends?"</p><p></p><p>The lizard people looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>An elderly, well-traveled lizard person recognized Lyu Yijiang and the others' identities and murmured to the other lizards, "These must be the legendary humans! They look quite strong."</p>

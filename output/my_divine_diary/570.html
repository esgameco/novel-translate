        <h1>Chapter 570</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had already confirmed that observing the Source Beast yielded more comprehensive information than observing the Source Device.</p><p></p><p>So he immediately thought of a plan to study the Source Beasts.</p><p></p><p>What he meant by studying Source Beasts was not to capture them and observe their physical structures. The Source Beasts that had already completed their metamorphosis were not very useful to him.</p><p></p><p>What he really needed was an ordinary creature, starting from zero, going through the entire process of metamorphosing into a Source Beast.</p><p></p><p>This would allow him to accurately discover what kind of mechanism would cause matter to transform into Source.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not easy to observe the entire metamorphosis process of an ordinary creature. The biggest difficulty lay in how to confirm which creature would eventually become a Source Beast.</p><p></p><p>In this world, all kinds of disasters occurred in various parts of the world every day, but no one knew where a disaster would strike before it happened.</p><p></p><p>It was the same with Source Beasts. Among the billions of creatures in the world, who could confirm which lucky one would eventually metamorphose into a Source Beast?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's understanding of this was: it was a probability problem.</p><p></p><p>The most direct way to solve a probability problem was to increase the observation base. As long as the base was large enough and the probability was not too low, then it could be roughly regarded as a 'certainty'.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao's strategy was simple: to enclose a large area of the ocean and record the consciousness information of all the fish groups within this sea area into the Bouncing Space, waiting for one or a few of them to metamorphose into Source Beasts, then trace back to review the metamorphosis process of these Source Beasts.</p><p></p><p>It sounded very troublesome, but for Su Hao, who had been pondering for half a year without any gains, having a feasible plan was already good enough. No matter how troublesome, he had to overcome the difficulties.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, Su Hao made hundreds of array devices that could attract various fish to gather, and scattered them into the sea.</p><p></p><p>He also set up a newly developed 'Blood Aura Recording Information Boundary' around them. Its function was that after the fish passed through the boundary, their scattered blood aura would automatically record their consciousness information into the Bouncing Space.</p><p></p><p>This greatly reduced Su Hao's workload. He only needed to constantly supply blood aura to maintain the existence of the boundary.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had plenty of this blood aura thing. Even if he had to go through several rounds, one day he would be able to record enough fish groups.</p><p></p><p>The array devices Su Hao used to attract fish groups worked very well. Soon after they were deployed, large groups of fish swarmed in. After recording their information, Su Hao dispersed them from afar.</p><p></p><p>Recording batch after batch like this, the efficiency was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>In just three days, he had recorded the consciousness information of countless fish, all locked in the small black room.</p><p></p><p>But it was not enough. The recorded fish groups were far from meeting Su Hao's base number requirement.</p><p></p><p>So after exhausting all his blood aura, Su Hao returned to the base to replenish it, then continued to enter the ocean to record fish group information, over and over again. Half a year later, none of the fish he had recorded had metamorphosed into a Source Beast, which was extremely unlucky.</p><p></p><p>However, the good news was that Big Dog had metamorphosed into a Source Beast.</p><p></p><p>Big Dog metamorphosed into a Source Beast?</p><p></p><p>It was hard to understand whether this was good luck or bad luck.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Su Hao had recorded Big Dog's consciousness information into the Bouncing Space early on, in order to conveniently check on Big Dog and the situation at home.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, this allowed Su Hao to obtain the first precious information about an ordinary animal metamorphosing into a Source Beast.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this was a good start. Su Hao had a feeling that as long as he kept recording, some of these fish would definitely metamorphose into Source Beasts, and he would obtain more and more samples.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he learned of Big Dog's metamorphosis, Su Hao brought it to the experimental base to first determine its abilities.</p><p></p><p>First was its size. Its overall appearance had not changed much, except that its size was increasing every day, and it might soon grow as large as an elephant.</p><p></p><p>Next was its category. This Big Dog belonged to the rarest fantasy-type Source Beast.</p><p></p><p>Finally, its ability. When it stretched out its head and lit up its forehead, the target would involuntarily place their soles on its forehead.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "???"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't there something wrong here! What if they didn't have feet? Moreover, when its head grew as tall as an elephant in the future, who could use their feet to reach its forehead? Wouldn't they have to perform a split on the spot!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the Bouncing Space and retrieved all the information about Big Dog from the moment it was recorded into the Bouncing Space until now: "Let me see how an ordinary dog metamorphosed into a powerful Source Beast."</p><p></p><p>This look lasted ten whole days. Speeding up, slowing down, repeatedly and carefully studying the changes and differences before, during, and after the metamorphosis, Su Hao finally saw a clue.</p><p></p><p>It was this clue that made Su Hao feel that staying in the sea for half a year to record the fish groups was worthwhile, and he rewarded Big Dog with a sole.</p><p></p><p>"It's a system!"</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Su Hao finally understood the puzzlement he had before - what exactly was that thing.</p><p></p><p>The Source Device was not something that could transform matter into Source by itself. What could transform matter into Source was an entire massive system, and the Source Devices and Source Beasts he had studied were merely tiny ports in this massive system!</p><p></p><p>Essentially, they were meaningless on their own. These components were just a small part of the "system" computer!</p><p></p><p>The Source Devices and Source Beasts were the same. Looking at them individually, there was no way to know why they could transform matter into Source. Even if Su Hao restored them, he would not be able to achieve a similar effect.</p><p></p><p>This discovery pointed Su Hao's research in the right direction, and his research on Source was about to make a huge leap forward.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Source Device I completely simulated with runes was effective, just not activated yet."</p><p></p><p>With the dual confirmation of the Bouncing Space and Divine Thought, plus Su Hao's rigorous attitude in restoring the Source Device, even if he didn't restore it identically, he could get it 80-90% similar. So the Source Device he made by hand was highly likely to be effective.</p><p></p><p>The reason it had no effect was probably because Su Hao hadn't connected his self-made "Source Device" to a certain special massive system yet, just like a display without power and VGA cable connected to a computer.</p><p></p><p>So how could he connect it?</p><p></p><p>"Since I've sorted out my thinking, there's no need to rush. I'll take it one step at a time. First, find the location of the 'interface'."</p><p></p><p>Finding the interface was not an easy task either. Su Hao didn't understand much about the unique structure of creatures like Source Beasts, so he had no way to pinpoint the location of the interface at a glance. Therefore, the solution was to obtain enough samples, and then compare the samples to lock onto the target.</p><p></p><p>And obtaining a large number of samples required patiently waiting for the creatures he recorded to metamorphose into Source Beasts.</p><p></p><p>It might take two to three years at the fastest, or seven to eight years at the slowest, but Su Hao was still young and could wait.</p><p></p><p>He exited the Bouncing Space, feeling a bit weary. He let Feng Cheng arrange resources for him to replenish his blood aura. After eating, he lay on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been working intensely on research almost non-stop. Even with his powerful mental strength, he was a bit overwhelmed. It was rare to have made new progress, so he might as well enjoy the pleasure of sleeping.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Su Hao woke up in high spirits. After symbolically rewarding Big Dog with a sole, he flashed to the depths of the ocean, setting up array devices to attract fish groups and blood aura boundaries.</p><p></p><p>It was another energetic day.</p>

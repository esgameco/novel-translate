        <h1>Chapter 684</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao said that they could also learn 'superpowers' through training, the captain and others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>When they learned that Suhao might be one of the lucky ones who mutated into a 'new human', they were very envious and had fantasized about one day suddenly awakening and gaining some strange ability.</p><p></p><p>But they were all rational people. They could only fantasize about it, as mutation was a matter of probability - either it happened or it didn't, and individuals had no control over it.</p><p></p><p>However, 'new humans' could learn it? Manually mutate?</p><p></p><p>As for the three words 'simplified version' that Suhao mentioned, they temporarily ignored them.</p><p></p><p>The captain quickly suppressed his inexplicable excitement and asked, "Can it be learned? Is it like a body enhancement drug?"</p><p></p><p>Body enhancement drugs were the highest achievement of human biology, capable of enhancing various aspects of the human body to varying degrees, including physique, physical strength, recovery ability, reaction speed, comprehensive intelligence, and even lifespan!</p><p></p><p>The strongest enhancement drugs could even extend a person's lifespan to five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The crew on the spacecraft had all received enhancements from these drugs, with lifespans generally over 250 years, perfectly suited for the long space travel missions.</p><p></p><p>To ordinary people, these enhanced crew members were like superhumans.</p><p></p><p>But to these crew members, Suhao was the true 'superhuman'.</p><p></p><p>Hitting the target from tens of thousands of meters away, what concept was that?</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "You can understand it as an alternative enhancement drug. The energy source for superpowers is energy blocks. When using the energy, you need to carry the energy blocks with you, which is inconvenient."</p><p></p><p>The others didn't care about this!</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "But not right now. I need some time to summarize and organize it properly. After that, I can let you all try it out."</p><p></p><p>They would be happy to wait even if it took ten years.</p><p></p><p>The commander's face flushed red with excitement as he blurted out, "That's great! I'll be able to do magic tricks too! When we get back to the Blue Light, I can perform magic for the ladies, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The captain kicked him away, "With that attitude, how embarrassing! Get away from me."</p><p></p><p>Suhao was very satisfied that the captain and others were willing to cooperate with his new experiments.</p><p></p><p>A win-win situation!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Suhao and the others left, the captain and Commander Jiang in the command center took a long time to recover.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Commander Jiang asked uncertainly, "Captain, do you think what that kid Xu Shiqiang said is true? Could he be bluffing?"</p><p></p><p>The captain replied, "You're asking me about your own soldier? Who else can I ask?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he continued, "But this kid Xu Shiqiang, the confidence he exudes from the bottom of his heart is so strong that even when I face him, I feel a bit...ahem! In my opinion, he's not the type to talk nonsense. On the contrary, he's a pragmatic person who calls a spade a spade and wouldn't lie.</p><p></p><p>You think back, has he ever said anything to fool us?"</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang thought about it and realized he really hadn't, then asked curiously, "So does that mean the plan to raid the Eight-Hand supply station is definitely happening?"</p><p></p><p>The captain shook his head, "The plan to raid the supply station now seems too conservative. I think we might as well be bolder and directly raid a small military port! Let's reconvene the officers' meeting and plan our next move. Finding the Eight-Hands' military ports will require all our technical capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang: "......"</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to say, "Captain, you're getting carried away!"</p><p></p><p>But the captain was his superior, so whatever he said was right.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the way back, Squad Leader Yan and Little Chang followed beside Suhao, constantly marveling: "Big Strong, you're so awesome!"</p><p></p><p>"When I first saw you, I knew you were no ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"The first time before going into battle, I saw you looking unwell and trembling all over. I thought you were scared. Little did I know, I was mistaken - you weren't afraid, you were trembling with excitement! I almost misjudged you."</p><p></p><p>"Big Strong, what enhancement drug did you take? The Type 3 my dad gave me is the best he could find on the market, but it looks like your family is no ordinary household and must have a deep background! So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"Big Strong, when can we learn 'superpowers'? I can't wait to have '100% accuracy' - I'll be a god on the battlefield then!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After seeing off his two chattering, excited comrades, Suhao locked the dormitory door and entered his small world. He took out an energy block he had pried off his armor.</p><p></p><p>The energy block was a rectangular metal bar about the size of a pack of cigarettes, emanating a cold metallic glow and looking like an ordinary metal block.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, after completing his cultivation tasks each day, Suhao would spend some time researching this world's new gadget - the energy block.</p><p></p><p>Through research, he discovered that although the energy block looked like metal, it didn't match any metal element on the periodic table.</p><p></p><p>However, after the energy block released all its energy, it would turn into an ordinary metal - iron!</p><p></p><p>This amazed Suhao. Energy matter turning into iron? Or could iron be used as energy matter?</p><p></p><p>He had never considered this direction before, yet it was so miraculous.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it wasn't that iron could be used as energy matter, but rather another substance with a special structure that turned into iron after releasing its energy!</p><p></p><p>After a long period of research, not long ago, he finally cracked the secret of the energy blocks: the energy released from them was nuclear fusion energy.</p><p></p><p>The atomic structure inside the energy blocks was very special, combined in a trumpet-mosquito coil structure, then stacked in small pieces to form the macroscopic metallic block appearance.</p><p></p><p>Under certain conditions, the energy blocks would undergo nuclear fusion, with multiple atoms combining into a complete iron atom!</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't imagine how the humans in this world created these specially structured energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just an issue of atomic structure, but more crucially, the state of the atoms.</p><p></p><p>This state was something Suhao had never heard of or seen before.</p><p></p><p>It was like a bullet being fired from a gun barrel, then suddenly being paused at the muzzle by someone pressing a button. But the bullet's kinetic energy remained completely undissipated. When the button was pressed again, the bullet would resume its original speed and fly out.</p><p></p><p>The energy blocks Suhao saw were like that - dangerous yet miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Even he couldn't guarantee being able to transform atoms into this state through his 'Source' power.</p><p></p><p>"Inconceivable!"</p><p></p><p>This world's people found his abilities inconceivable, but didn't Suhao feel the same way seeing this world's various technologies?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly had another thought: "Or perhaps these energy blocks weren't created by humans or the Eight-Hands at all, but are a natural product of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Was it possible that the lifeforms in this world, while exploring the universe, accidentally discovered this substance containing immense energy? After years of research, they found a way to control its gradual energy release, thus beginning this vast interstellar journey?</p><p></p><p>It was very possible!</p><p></p><p>Because Suhao understood that for a civilization to begin interstellar travel, the first issue to solve was energy.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ordinary-looking metal block in his hand - it was the energy source for almost all armed machinery in this world!</p><p></p><p>It was this block that supported the entire "Cloud Ring System" interstellar civilization.</p><p></p><p>Suhao set aside his scattered thoughts and pondered another question: could I use my mental power to directly guide the release of energy from the blocks?</p><p></p><p>For this, Suhao already had the answer: "Using mental power to guide this kind of energy is possible!"</p>

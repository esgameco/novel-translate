        <h1>Chapter 904</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After the deities obtained the learning machines, they excitedly began exploring them. The listed directory looked very advanced, pushing their emotions to new heights.</p><p></p><p>It was like when someone buys a book that looks extremely impressive at first glance, such as "Quantum Mechanics". The initial excitement of getting the book is self-evident, as if a great "quantum mechanics expert" would emerge in just a few days. As for what their feelings would be after actually opening the book, that remains unknown.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao cleared his throat to get the deities' attention, and said: "There is still a long way to go, you can take your time studying these learning machines. Now I have a new matter to tell you about."</p><p></p><p>The deities did shift their attention to Su Hao, very curious about the new matter he mentioned. Based on past experience, it must be something extremely novel.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "You have successfully safeguarded the growth of two World Wills, making them very excited and feeling it is time for their official emergence.</p><p></p><p>So, the World Wills have decided that within the next month, they will continuously awaken one hundred World Wills in the same small town, to jointly seek methods for growth.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the previous two World Wills, the growth of these new World Wills will need close attention from you deities to ensure their smooth development."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities were dumbstruck: "Huh???"</p><p></p><p>The successful growth of two World Wills made them very excited, so they awakened one hundred World Wills all at once?</p><p></p><p>The deities were thunderstruck, having never imagined such a thing...</p><p></p><p>The emergence of these World Wills was like sending a turtle to scout ahead before baby sea turtles go into the ocean?</p><p></p><p>They had thought that as long as they brought out these two World Wills, they could retire and enjoy a free and unrestrained retirement. Little did they know this was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The deities opened their mouths but couldn't say a word for a while.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, seeing the deities remained silent, Su Hao thought they didn't hear clearly, so he said again: "You don't need to worry, these World Wills are already very mature and have good self-care abilities. Even if they die, it won't deduct too many of your points.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I believe that you lords who have successful experience nurturing World Wills will surely be able to take good care of these World Wills."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Barry looked conflicted: "Lord Leian, just how many World Wills are there? I didn't expect they could awaken one hundred at once, it's beyond my expectations. I want to ask, how long do we need to nurture these World Wills?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of World Wills, as long as they are well-maintained. As long as you bring out the World Wills, this matter will naturally conclude."</p><p></p><p>The Order God Red Light couldn't help asking: "Gail and Talia have already grown so powerful, doesn't that count as having grown up?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stated as a matter of course: "That's just the beginning, they are still far from truly growing up. Not to mention roaming the universe beyond the planet, at the very least they must defeat the Great Demon King Chipu. If they can't even defeat the Demon King, how can we say they have grown up?"</p><p></p><p>The deities thought about it and realized it was true. But thinking about the Great Demon King Chipu's power that could destroy a huge island with one strike, they couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>Even they couldn't reach that level, not even the extremely powerful "nuclear bomb" in the mall could do that.</p><p></p><p>The Light Bathing God Yi suddenly said: "So you mean, as long as we nurture the World Wills to the point of defeating the Great Demon King Chipu, that counts as them having grown up?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled wryly: "Lowering the bar, thinking that way is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>The deities' spirits lifted, afraid Su Hao might go back on his word, they immediately said: "Good, it's a deal. As long as we defeat the Great Demon King Chipu, we gain our freedom."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Little did the Great Demon King Chipu expect that after going around in a circle, the eighteen deities he originally wanted to save would end up making him the key to their freedom.</p><p></p><p>Originally he had put out the call to "defeat the evil Demon King Leian and save the deities". Now it had become "defeat the Great Demon King Chipu for the deities to break free".</p><p></p><p>How unpredictable life can be.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Paradise in the Underworld, Su Hao began strolling on the Cruciform Planet, looking for a suitable transfer point for the crossers-over.</p><p></p><p>He finally chose a small coastal town on the Varan Continent.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "This place just experienced a small tsunami, with many people near death or killed. It would be perfect to use them as reincarnation vessels for the crossers-over. And being far away from the most dangerous Heroic World, it should give this group enough time to adjust. Besides, surely there won't be another tsunami that wipes out all the crossers-over, right?"</p><p></p><p>With that thought and no hesitation, he took the first one hundred crossers-over from the Pinball Dimension according to their sequence numbers and stuffed them into one hundred suitable humans, reviving them.</p><p></p><p>After they woke up, he would leave this place.</p><p></p><p>"Among these one hundred people, will any be able to successfully grow up? Let's patiently wait and see!"</p><p></p><p>Even if only one or two ended up growing up, it wouldn't be a loss for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Cruciform Planet, Su Hao transmitted to the remodeled planet that Feng Cheng was overseeing, and selected another two hundred crossers-over to stuff into one hundred planets, two crossers-over per planet scattered in different locations.</p><p></p><p>After finishing all this, Su Hao returned to his experimental base and began calculating the ripple situation collected across the entire Hydria Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he reached a conclusion: "The ripples are indeed subtly strengthening, but it's a bit chaotic and hard to distinguish whose they specifically are...Whatever, we'll resolve any difficulties that arise, let's revisit this in a few years."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after Su Hao left, the people in the coastal town who seemed dead or near death miraculously woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Cold, damp, weak, noisy, salty..."</p><p></p><p>A young man regained consciousness from his coma, these were his first sensations.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and saw the scene of destruction around him...</p><p></p><p>He was lying among a pile of debris, completely soaked, with a wooden board covering him.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Luo Yanfeng, an ordinary office worker without any superhuman intelligence, talent, wealth or background. I don't even have a girlfriend. In summary, I'm utterly 'mediocre'.  All I have is the 'unbearable' burden brought by life.</p><p></p><p>I don't know why I work so hard either. Perhaps I feel 'it's all good, whatever', just dragging my weary body through each day.</p><p></p><p>But what I didn't expect was that after clicking 'Yes' on a blue dialog box, I actually crossed over to another world. Originally I didn't believe this universe had things like crossers-over, but now I see how laughable my initial thoughts were - the vastness of the universe far exceeded my imagination.</p><p></p><p>Do I regret it? Maybe a little! I regret not thanking those who helped me before coming to this world, not telling that girl I liked how I felt, and not paying back all the pain to those who insulted, cursed and hurt me. Perhaps I'm just petty like that, I'll never forgive those who hurt me.</p><p></p><p>Not doing those things before coming to this world is quite regrettable.</p><p></p><p>But it's all in the past now, perhaps I can get a new lease on life in this world..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng pushed off the wooden board covering him and crawled up, instinctively straightening his clothes to not look so disheveled: "A tsunami huh? Life is so fragile in the face of nature. I guess this counts as a fresh start! This life, I want to live well. I no longer have any burdens, I won't suppress myself anymore. From this moment on, I live for myself..."</p><p></p><p>He looked around at the environment, thought for a moment, but then shrank back: "Better keep a low profile first. It seems I've gained some memories from the original person. No need to unleash myself right away, I'll act according to the former habits first, find a way to survive, gather information, and see what this seemingly different world is like."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he rallied his spirits and headed in one direction: "It seems there are many unfortunate people, let me rescue them first!"</p>

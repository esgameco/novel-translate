        <h1>Chapter 806</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Inside the small world imprisoning the humans, the members of the Rich Gold squad sat idly on the ground, their faces pale and dim, having long lost the vigor they had when first setting out to hunt the young dragon.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that this failure had dealt them a tremendous blow.</p><p></p><p>The sole soul cultivator Viya had also woken up, completely unaware of what had happened while she was unconscious. Now she only felt her head buzzing, her mind filled with the image of the young dragon flicking her forehead with its claw.</p><p></p><p>Just that seemingly light flick had instantly knocked her out. Such powerful finger strength could only belong to a level 7 soul guardian, right?</p><p></p><p>Originally intending to capture the young dragon, they had been captured by it instead. Just thinking about it was rather dramatic.</p><p></p><p>Viya sat quietly, but grew increasingly restless in her heart. Unable to hold back, she asked the bearded Westbro, "Westbro, what should we do next? We need to find a way to escape from here!"</p><p></p><p>Westbro couldn't even be bothered to roll his eyes, his mind flashing to the basketball-sized small world on Suhao's claw. He said indifferently, "I've looked, this is a spherical cage, very special, like a new world created by deities - you can get in but not out."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand to gesture, his eyes a mix of excitement, dejection and despair. "Can you imagine the place we're in now is only this small? You see this vast space, but it's only this big...unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>Viya went berserk. "What's so unbelievable? Do you even know our situation now? Are we just going to stay here and wait for death? If we could get in, there must be a way out. This isn't like you Westbro, pull yourself together! We're not dead yet!"</p><p></p><p>Westbro shook his head. "Viya, I advise you to just stay put and conserve your strength, maybe you can hold on a bit longer. Who knows, there might still be a chance to live. That young dragon just imprisoned us instead of killing us directly, so maybe we still have some use."</p><p></p><p>Viya asked, "What if it's keeping us as food reserves?"</p><p></p><p>Westbro nodded. "That's possible. If it's keeping us as food, it might eat the wilted, less fresh ones first. So staying energetic can delay your death a bit."</p><p></p><p>Viya stamped her feet in exasperation. "You're all useless. If you're not going to find a way out, I'll do it myself. It's better to die trying than just sitting and waiting for death."</p><p></p><p>She approached the boundary of the small world and unleashed a barrage of soul techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Shattering Technique!"</p><p>"Wall Breaking Technique!" </p><p>"Soul Scorching!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, she exhausted herself pale-faced, but couldn't do anything to the small world's spatial structure.</p><p></p><p>Only then did she understand what the bearded Westbro meant by not wasting her energy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with no other choice, she angrily plopped down next to Westbro, feeling a bit safer, but after just two breaths she jumped back up, covering her nose and mouth. "It stinks to death, are you trying to suffocate me? I'm thirsty, where's your water?"</p><p></p><p>The bearded Westbro couldn't even be bothered to raise an eyelid. What man doesn't have a bit of musk? Besides, Viya herself reeked of garlic, how dare she complain?</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed over his waterskin. "Conserve it, you can only have a small sip."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In another small world, after absorbing and converting the 'spiritual essence', Suhao rapidly constructed his spiritual power system within his body. After a while, he opened his eyes, feeling the surging spiritual power, and revealed a row of sharp teeth in a smile. "My spiritual power has returned. More importantly, my powerful 'spiritual sense' has also returned."</p><p></p><p>Suhao activated a temporary 'perception' rune, coupled with his spiritual sense, instantly reaching out 50,000 meters, that feeling of perceiving everything returning to him.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage before his perception faded, he used 'Flash Step' to the farthest location.</p><p></p><p>This was an ordinary dense forest in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Without even making hand seals, he simply pointed his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Bullet!"</p><p></p><p>A azure beam flashed out, shooting into a distant mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>In the midst of a violent explosion, boulders flew, trees toppled, debris scattered into the air in a swirling mess.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pulled his finger back with a smile. "Not bad power. Let me try the 'Destruction Cannon' using energy compression techniques!"</p><p></p><p>He first transmitted himself far away from the lair, then flew up high, extended his finger pointing down, and a golden light suddenly burst forth from his fingertip, growing brighter and brighter until reaching a peak, then firing out in a golden beam connecting to the mountains below.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a sun seemed to rise from the earth...</p><p></p><p>"Hummm--"</p><p></p><p>A powerful shockwave swept out, shaking the mountains, appearing as if it could level an entire mountain range.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous explosion rang out, the area below gradually enveloped in thick smoke, obscuring the true devastation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao praised, "Decent power, should be enough to handle the supernatural beings of this world for now. But without an external mind boosting calculations, the computing power is too weak, so the force expressed is a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>The huge rumbling echoed through the mountains, transmitting farther and farther.</p><p></p><p>This 'Destruction Cannon' of his must have alarmed many powerful beings in the Cloud Interval Mountains, scattering in all directions away from the blast, or finding places to hide. Birds of all sizes screeched in fright, taking flight...</p><p></p><p>Many 'hunting squads' exploring the Cloud Interval Mountains also turned their heads to look towards the distant explosion, all wondering what had happened.</p><p></p><p>However, Suhao did not wait for the smoke to clear before observing the destruction he caused. Instead, he changed locations and continued experimenting with various spiritual power techniques.</p><p></p><p>With skills like these, it was best to practice them first to avoid embarrassing situations when trying to use them against enemies later.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, estimating that the mother dragon Shaduo would return soon, Suhao stopped his testing and used several Flash Steps to return to the lair.</p><p></p><p>Back inside, he dragged the cotton and fur from the hatching chamber into another rock chamber, arranged a comfortable nest area, then sprawled down to take a nap with half-lidded eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the noise, the older dragon siblings Chipu and Morry scampered in, their mouths agape in disbelief at the sight of Suhao napping on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The older brother Chipu crept closer, uncertain. "Third brother?"</p><p></p><p>But Suhao didn't open his eyes, only saying, "I'm sleeping, go play by yourselves. I'm in a good mood today so I won't hit you."</p><p></p><p>Chipu and Morry looked at each other, circling Suhao a couple times to confirm it really was their third brother Leian without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>But why, after searching all day thinking he had been taken by those strange upright creatures that appeared yesterday, did he suddenly show up now?</p><p></p><p>Chipu leaned towards Morry, still unsure. "Sister, is this...our third brother?"</p><p></p><p>Morry blinked her eyes, not quite certain either. "I think so?"</p><p></p><p>They wanted to rouse Suhao and get to the bottom of it, but didn't quite dare. After hesitating, they put it out of their minds and started playing hide-and-seek in the cave.</p><p></p><p>As dusk approached, the mother dragon Shaduo returned with food.</p><p></p><p>However, even before entering the den, she noticed the rope hanging down the cliff face from outside and her pupils constricted sharply, instantly realizing what must have happened. Her mind went blank with an unprecedented sense of terror she had never felt before, not even facing the mightiest dragon kings.</p><p></p><p>"Raaawwwrrr--"</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar filled with boundless rage and sorrow echoed through the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo's originally golden vertical pupils had turned blood red. The sudden surge of anger nearly overwhelmed her rationality as the immense power within her churned forth, nearly causing her whole body to boil over.</p><p></p><p>"Hufffff!"</p><p></p><p>With a powerful flap of her wings, Shaduo's speed increased explosively as she shot into the den like a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>The only thought her remaining rationality could process was: scent, just follow the stinking human scent and my children's fragrant scent to find them!</p><p></p><p>However, just as she charged into the den, she saw two small red-golden figures with wings half-spread rushing towards her.</p><p></p><p>"Mother Shaduo!"</p><p></p><p>Mother Shaduo's eyes bulged, a surge of immense joy filling her heart, then a warm current spread from her heart throughout her body, allowing every cell to relax, even the myriad scales covering her body slightly rising.</p><p></p><p>She joyfully embraced the two little ones, holding them tightly to her chest.</p><p></p><p>"Rooooaaarr--"</p><p></p><p>Another dragon's roar filled with joy echoed through the mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Leian?"</p><p></p><p>As the mother dragon was searching, Suhao slowly walked out, a bit surprised. "Mother Shaduo, did you not bring back any food this time?"</p><p></p><p>Though Suhao no longer needed to rely on the mother's hunted prey to eat, he was still somewhat puzzled that she had returned empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Mother Shaduo paused, setting down the two young dragons to look at her own claws. She clearly remembered each of her four claws had a wild bull hanging from them earlier, but now they were gone.</p><p></p><p>It seemed...in her earlier rage, she had simply dropped them?</p>

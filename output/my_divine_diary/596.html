        <h1>Chapter 596</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Calamity Cannon! It is an ultimate superweapon controlled by the Eighteen Imperial States. This is truly a doomsday weapon.</p><p></p><p>A single shot can destroy an entire city!</p><p></p><p>They don't care about the lives of the citizens in Glory Union's territories. They can directly invoke the Celestial Calamity Cannon to annihilate all of Glory Union's cities.</p><p></p><p>They all believe that under the Celestial Calamity Cannon, no matter how powerful Glory Union is, they will ultimately fail to escape death.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Calamity Cannon controlled by the royal families is the fundamental reason why the Mage Association originally agreed to sign the 'Upholding the Legitimate Rule of the Royal Families' pact.</p><p></p><p>Next is the stage for a vote by a show of hands!</p><p></p><p>As long as more than two-thirds of the emperors present agree, and the mages do not object, then invoking the Celestial Calamity Cannon to destroy all of Glory Union's cities will be legal.</p><p></p><p>The young and righteous Emperor Jia raised his hand first in approval: "Glory Union's crimes deserve annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>The other emperors looked at each other, lowered their heads in thought, frequently glancing at the head mage. Then one by one, each had their own reasons to raise their hands in agreement to deploy the Celestial Calamity Cannon and completely destroy Glory Union.</p><p></p><p>However, regarding the use of the city-destroying Celestial Calamity Cannon, the final decision to successfully activate it still rests on the head mage's opinion.</p><p></p><p>The head mage pondered briefly, then calmly said: "Regarding activating the Celestial Calamity Cannon, I abstain."</p><p></p><p>The emperors rejoiced: "It's decided!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Calamity Cannon appeared over a thousand years ago as a deterrent superweapon, and was also one of the reasons that prompted the world's major imperial states to unite.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the inheriting royal families and top association members who can access this information, others have never heard of it.</p><p></p><p>In deciding to use the Celestial Calamity Cannon this time, the emperors also harbored the intention of demonstrating the royal families' power to the world.</p><p></p><p>Only with absolute power can they make everyone fear them and dispel those unrealistic ideas of the lowly commoners.</p><p></p><p>This world has been too peaceful for too long, so peaceful that it seems everyone has forgotten the terror of being brutally ruled by the Eighteen Imperial States.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there are actually people who think they have grasped great power and dare to move against the royal families, directly destroying the Hengxuan District's royal family!</p><p></p><p>They simply do not know what's good for them!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Glory Union's people were cleaning up the battlefield, their hearts were shaken!</p><p></p><p>Their minds were filled with the four words "unbelievable", while an inexplicable emotion sprouted from the depths of their hearts: "This friend Zhi Peng is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Just as Aya had told Zhi Peng before, the deeper the despair when an unstoppable enemy arrives, the greater the self-confidence after victory.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only are Glory Union's members full of confidence in their cause, even the ordinary people in Glory Union's territories are filled with hope in Glory Union.</p><p></p><p>Everyone feels that Glory Union will eventually be able to overthrow the rule of the royal families and give this world a new face free from oppression.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng carefully handed over the accounted spoils of war to Aya and asked: "Mr. Jia Aya, how did you manage to annihilate the Eighteen Imperial States' allied forces in such a short time? It's unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>While browsing the list of source artifacts and some prisoners, Aya casually said: "Unbelievable is right, if you could understand our capability, that would be troubling."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Aya not explaining further, Zhi Peng didn't mind and said to himself: "Indeed, 'unbelievable' is good!</p><p></p><p>I'm confident I can make the entire Hengxuan District turn over a new leaf within five years."</p><p></p><p>Aya nodded: "It's good that you have confidence. Just proceed according to the plan. The start-up phase is most crucial. Be sure not to believe others' nonsense. It's better to rely more on your friends, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The first step of the plan is for Zhi Peng to hold a mobilization rally in the safe area under his control to make more friends and rely on friends to get through the initial unstable period of lacking manpower.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng showed a smile: "I understand! Rest assured, making friends is my specialty!"</p><p></p><p>After everything was arranged, Aya brought the massive spoils of war back to the small world base.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first recorded Fei Yao's genetic information and brain structure data in the Bouncing Realm. After some research, however, he did not obtain any particularly useful information.</p><p></p><p>To acquire decisive data for enhancing the brain, he was still far from it.</p><p></p><p>At least he would need the brain data of over a thousand gifted geniuses to have a chance of deciphering the secrets of super powerful thinking, right?</p><p></p><p>Of course, just thinking about it is enough!</p><p></p><p>Since he could not uncover the mysteries of the brain for now, there was no need to rush. He would do what he could presently and wait patiently for the future.</p><p></p><p>Having already directly crushed the royal families' military forces with absolute power, he just needed to bide his time before finding an opportunity to overthrow the rule of the Eighteen Royal Families and support Glory Union's rise to power.</p><p></p><p>After accomplishing this, he could legitimately seek cooperation with the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that at that time, the Source Mage Association would definitely not reject him.</p><p></p><p>If they did reject him, Su Hao also had ways to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>At most, he would eliminate those in the Mage Association who rejected him. If that didn't work, he could make those people become Zhi Peng's friends. If even that failed, he could destroy the Mage Association and establish his own 'Church of Light'.</p><p></p><p>There were plenty of ways, he was bound to succeed. The world was so vast, with so many people, there would definitely be those willing to cooperate with Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll patiently wait for a period of time until the royal families are abandoned by the Mage Association! During this time, I can also continue to deeply study the Source Vector."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao first encased himself in a protective layer that isolated the fluctuations of the 'Source Vector Suppressor', then raised his hand to guide a strand of source energy, controlling it to transform into a metal bowl.</p><p></p><p>Soil gradually formed in the bowl, quickly becoming moist into a bowl of muddy water.</p><p></p><p>This was the ability of a Gold Source Mage that the Sect Leader Gu Qin had demonstrated to Su Hao when they first met.</p><p></p><p>Gold Source Mages could transform source energy into common substances.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"These substances are not true substances. Essentially, they have not been completely transformed from source energy into matter.</p><p></p><p>I want to directly create the desired substances from source energy, but it's not that simple!"</p><p></p><p>After absorbing Aya's research results, Su Hao deeply studied the abilities and effects of Material Source Mages, hoping to directly transform source energy into substances compatible with his blood energy and spirit power.</p><p></p><p>If successful, he would no longer need to spend vast amounts of time converting and accumulating blood energy and spirit power.</p><p></p><p>However, achieving this proved far more difficult than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The metal bowl and muddy water transformed from source energy by Su Hao looked similar to ordinary objects, but they were not the same.</p><p></p><p>This bowl and water were merely 'illusions' constructed by source energy under the guidance of Su Hao's Source Vector!</p><p></p><p>For example, the transformed metal was hard, malleable, conductive, etc., no different from ordinary metals.</p><p></p><p>And the transformed water could even be used for washing hands...</p><p></p><p>But they were not true, stable substances. Without someone maintaining them, they would quickly collapse and dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao called these things transformed by Gold Source Mages: Temporary Material Products.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the blood energy and spirit power he transformed from source energy appeared no different from true blood energy and spirit power on the surface, but could not activate runes or cast spells.</p><p></p><p>If so, what use were these transformed blood energy and spirit power?</p><p></p><p>If he could not obtain real, tangible substances, then the value of source energy to Su Hao would be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he cut off the source energy's maintenance and isolated the metal bowl in a separate space, calmly waiting for these 'Temporary Material Products' to automatically collapse and dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Around half an hour later, the bowl and muddy water lost their color, as if corroded by strong acid, gradually shriveling, like being weathered by time, scattering into particles.</p><p></p><p>What was originally a bowl of muddy water soon disappeared, leaving only specks of black powder settling at the bottom of the separate space.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao guided his blood energy to quickly record the information of those remaining black powder remnants in the Bouncing Realm.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness entered the Bouncing Realm to examine the powder remnants.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Su Hao's consciousness withdrew. He waved his hand, storing the remaining powder into a test tube, sealing it with a label of records before placing it on a shelf.</p><p></p><p>The shelf was already filled with similar test tubes containing black powder, evidently having conducted many such experiments before.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at these test tubes, lost in thought:</p><p></p><p>"The substances formed from the collapse are determined by the 'Temporary Material Products'.</p><p></p><p>For example, the powder left behind from the collapsed bowl of muddy water contained small amounts of various metal elements, small amounts of silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, etc., as well as small amounts of water and various gases.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly corresponding.</p><p></p><p>It seems that whatever 'temporary products' the mages create, the collapse will yield the corresponding substances.</p><p></p><p>But it's not that simple. At least I have no way to directly obtain blood energy and spirit power. All I get are some imitations that are completely useless...</p><p></p><p>So what is the rule governing the collapse?</p><p></p><p>How can I directly obtain spirit power, blood energy, and any substance I desire?"</p><p></p><p>Despite cross-referencing previous experimental data, Su Hao remained stumped. He could only take out another source bead to continue experimenting: "It seems this is another project that requires long-term efforts!"</p>

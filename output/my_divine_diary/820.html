            <p>The pirate groups were imposing to unite and take out the popular 'Evil Dragon Legend', however, no matter how vicious they were on the voyage, in front of Su Hao, they could only be loaded into the small world in a comedic way, without exception.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao's plan to return to the Dragon Continent wasn't even delayed for a day.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, "It's a pity that there's no divine messenger this time, it would be curious to see how the will of a divine messenger differs from that of other soul magicians."</p><p></p><p>He took the time to use his spirit thoughts to perceive the situation within the small world, and was shocked to see that the people of the Fu Jin squad had been controlled by the pirates who had just been admitted into it.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was that the only female member of that Fu Jin squad was about to meet an unfortunate fate, so what the hell?</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the small world was as still as a fly frozen in amber.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao swept a glance and frowned at a few guys whose pants were already off ......</p><p></p><p>With a casual point of his hand, several streams of light flashed and didn't enter their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Snap~"</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound came from within the skull, and those few pirates immediately fell limply.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, these few dead men were turned into dust that drifted away without a trace.</p><p></p><p>These people felt a bit diabolical when they were used to make 'tool people'.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao's appearance, the bearded Xibo and Weiya both showed ecstatic colors on their faces, and if they weren't still confined in place, they would have already fallen down on their knees and shouted.</p><p></p><p>The pirates, on the other hand, looked at the two or three month old red and gold young dragon in front of them with a face full of terror.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the red gold young dragon that was to be captured two days ago? The little delicate red stripe on the forehead, absolutely can not be mistaken ......</p><p></p><p>This red gold young dragon ......</p><p></p><p>For a moment, a violent storm was set off in their brains, washing over the cognition and going through the mindset that Bearded Sibel and the others had gone through at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't need to ask, he understood what was happening, and didn't bother to say anything more, these people were just experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>With just a casual stroke of his hand, he separated the small world from the center, forming two parts.</p><p></p><p>After casually leaving plenty of food for the Fu Jin squad's side, he directly left.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not leave food for the pirates ......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought that these people would starve for a while before they would be honest, so as not to be too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the Nian Ruyi that imprisoned everyone was loosened and they regained their freedom of movement.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the pirates noisily inquired about what was going on with the bizarre young dragon, while on the other side, the Fu Jin squad fell into a brief calm.</p><p></p><p>The last two members of the team suddenly knelt down and said to the bearded Xibo in horror, "Captain, Captain Xibo, we're wrong, we know we're wrong, for the sake of the fact that we've been on the same team for so many years, spare us for once!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, his eyes were red and he was almost ready to cry.</p><p></p><p>The other team member who knelt down also kowtowed frantically, "Just now, we were color-crazed and our bodies were not under control before we did such a thing, don't you know what we are like? We are good by nature, we simply wouldn't do such a thing ah ......"</p><p></p><p>Bearded Xibo's fists were tugged tightly in death, his chest rose and fell violently, sweat and blood wetting his lapel and neck, he said in an incomparably icy tone, "That's not what you guys said just now when you were complacent. Moreover, I said that whoever exposes Via's existence, I will personally rip his head off, true to my word."</p><p></p><p>A member of the team who fell to his knees watched the bearded Sibo slowly approach, so terrified that snot and tears flowed down together, "Captain, you can't be like this ...... Spare us once ......"</p><p></p><p>Xibo violently stepped forward and kicked the other party down, then strangled the other party's neck from behind and slowly lifted it up, gradually exerting force ......</p><p></p><p>The other team member looked at his companion was strangled speechless, panic after the mouth, "Captain this can not be all on us, blame Via, blame her too beautiful, I want to make out with her has been a long time ...... No, blame the captain you, we are also people ah, why you can go into the small house with Via to make out with, we will be We are human beings too. That's right, all blame the captain you, we are also normal people, why not share the brothers a little, give me three minutes or ......"</p><p></p><p>"Click~"</p><p></p><p>A crunching sound came from the hands of the bearded Xibo, it was the sound of a broken cervical vertebrae.</p><p></p><p>It's not over yet, everyone watched as the bearded Sibo just used brute force and slowly lifted a head intact ......</p><p></p><p>"Pff~"</p><p></p><p>The scene was mosaic for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The other kneeling member was stunned, frantically backing away from the bearded man, opening his mouth, unable to utter a single word, fear making him so weak that he couldn't even stand up.</p><p></p><p>The bearded Sibel casually tossed his hand, then slowly walked towards the man.</p><p></p><p>"I'll fight you ......"</p><p></p><p>"Ka-ba~"</p><p></p><p>"Pfft~"</p><p></p><p>The bearded Sibo casually threw his blood-stained finger at Via, who was sitting frozen, and said in a low voice, "She, is my woman!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time passed by in a hurry, the mother dragon Shadoe carried the three young dragons all the way through the heavenly channel unhindered, and was about to finish the last journey to reach the Dragon Continent.</p><p></p><p>It was also at this time that the external brain that Su Hao had built was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the first [God] that hatched from the [God Egg] in the small world had matured.</p><p></p><p>"Then the next step is to first implant the outer brain into the brain along with the blue crystal, break through to the 'Divine Separation Realm', and then formally use the [God] to take on the appearance of a young dragon, and walk around outside in place of the young dragon. After that, I can speed up the search and learning of knowledge, the soul power of this world will certainly not let me down.</p><p></p><p>I have a premonition that soul power, can solve the problem of my consciousness transmutation. Eternal life, right here in this world."</p><p></p><p>After thinking about this, Su Hao slowly calmed his slightly agitated heart, sank into the spiritual world, and began to add the outer brain and blue crystal to his head.</p><p></p><p>It was also at this time, on a small island in the latter half of the Paradise Voyage that was extremely distant from Su Hao, a black-haired stunningly beautiful woman and a blonde-haired, green-pupilized man were watching a variety of videos in front of them.</p><p></p><p>These two people were none other than the main god, the God of Darkness - Eternal, and the secondary god, the God of Gold - Barry.</p><p></p><p>And on the densely-packed videos ahead, there was one video that showed a red and gold dragon that was carrying three young dragons, and it was none other than Su Hao and the others.</p><p></p><p>But the video was not clear, only a vague outline could be seen, and it was not even possible to see the three young dragons on their backs.</p><p></p><p>Without Su Hao realizing it, their movements were all under the surveillance of the God of Darkness-Eternal.</p><p></p><p>Barry reached out and rubbed his chin strangely, ''It's really strange, even you, Eternal, can't detect the traces of that new god? Worthy of being the 'God of Secrecy', you really have a knack for hiding yourself.</p><p></p><p>That said, this ability of yours is so powerful that you are able to control all kinds of fish, birds and beasts within your range to become your own eyes. I also want to learn ah, if you don't mind, you can teach me."</p><p></p><p>The God of Darkness - Eternal said indifferently, "I mind."</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold-Barry spread his hands and said, "Alright, I won't learn."</p><p></p><p>Eternal frowned, "Although it's too far away to see clearly, I can always sense the scent, yet not a single trace of the new god's scent is perceived, as if there is no new god at all, is he hiding too well, or is my perception too weak?"</p><p></p><p>She had already confirmed that there was bound to be a New God traveling with the red and gold dragon, and the pirates that had inexplicably disappeared from those small islands were the best evidence of that.</p><p></p><p>The strange thing was that the first half of the voyage was still the brain turning into mush and dying, but the second half turned into a disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Barry laughed and countered with a rare laugh, "Maybe it's both? So, what do we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Yonsei looked at Barry and said, "I'm going to pretend to be a passerby to get close to the other side and sense something up close, based on the patterns I've observed, as long as I don't reveal my hostility, the other side shouldn't attack."</p><p></p><p>Barry muttered in his heart, "I didn't reveal my hostility before, and I was still somehow attacked?"</p><p></p><p>He superficially nodded his head in agreement, "Indeed, we should observe it from a close distance, if it's you, you are bound to be able to perceive the clues."</p><p></p><p>Yong Shi: "You're coming with me."</p><p></p><p>Barry shook his head, "I'm not going! If you want to go, you go yourself, I've already changed my body twice recently, if I change it again I won't have any servants."</p><p></p><p>Wingman: "Have to go, and we're splitting up."</p><p></p><p>Barry: "......"</p><p></p><p>Suho doesn't realize that he has been observed by a deity and has been doing his own thing.</p><p></p><p>In less than two days, he managed to connect to the outer brain.</p><p></p><p>The moment he connected, that familiar feeling returned.</p><p></p><p>Under the increase of the external brain, the mental power skyrocketed, 200,000 meters square was under control, as he gradually adapted, the feeling of 'omnipotence' hit his heart, one after another ego activated one after another, from the original single-threaded work, metamorphosed into a multi-threaded work, the comprehensive brain power ushered in a surge.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, then slowly exhaled, ''This feeling of omnipotence is, really, too intoxicating. The current me is in full bloom ah! It took three months after the reincarnation, and I got back all my strength, all my skills, and I can use them perfectly. To sum it up - strong!"</p><p></p><p>Having been in this state of high cerebral functioning for a long time in his last life, he had long since taken this feeling for granted, and the feeling was not obvious.</p><p></p><p>However, now after first experiencing an ordinary brain, suddenly obtaining such a powerful brain, in contrast, a huge to unimaginable gap immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The next island is just ahead, then, at the next island, hide my main body, into the secondary world!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised his head and looked into the distance, "Huh? This kind of aura ...... is two divine messengers? Yoho, perception is still quite strong! It's not easy to come across two, it's a pity not to take advantage of the fact that it's now included in the small world to be temporarily locked up for some research."</p><p></p><p>Thinking here, Su Hao's metamorphosed 'divine thoughts' enveloped the two 'divine messengers'.</p><p></p><p>'Teleportation through space'!</p><p></p><p>The God of Darkness-Eternal and the God of Gold-Barry only felt a flash in front of them, and came to an unfamiliar place with an intense pressure and tearing sensation coming from all parts of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Eternal and Barry's hearts tightened as they secretly said, ''What's going on? Did that Hidden God strike? Surprisingly, there was no sign of it! It's really powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, chaotic sounds could be heard from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Someone's coming in again, haha, brothers come look na, someone's coming in again!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is it? Let me see their kind of dumbfounded expression ...... hiss! Oh my god, this time a super stunningly beautiful woman came in! My soul is intoxicated."</p><p></p><p>"Wow Cao! It's so good looking ...... drooling all over the place."</p><p></p><p>"All get out of the way, let me quietly. Hiss - really fucking strong ah."</p><p></p><p>There was also someone who whistled to Yonsei: "Hey! Big beautiful girl, look this way~ Give me a smile!"</p><p></p><p>Forever and Barry happened to both be teleported to the same location and looked at each other speechless, "......"</p>

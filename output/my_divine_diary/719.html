        <h1>Chapter 719</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun's orders were being carried out, panic among humans was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The theory of doomsday gradually became popular.</p><p></p><p>Many from the "carpe diem" faction began indulging themselves, doing as they pleased.</p><p></p><p>According to them: It was said long ago that humans would inevitably perish, so why not enjoy life to the fullest? Why bother doing those meaningless things? Humans were born to enjoy life, why resist happiness? Give up! Enjoy life, and await destruction in happiness!</p><p></p><p>In their view, the Octopus Clan ruled the entire universe, while humans only had one tiny planet. How could they possibly defeat such an opponent?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't figure out what humans could use to resist the Octopus Clan.</p><p></p><p>And such voices grew louder and louder, showing a tendency to spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun heard about the situation, his face turned icy cold: "Kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, every single human was extremely precious, but he had to use thunderous measures to suppress these voices. Otherwise, before the Octopus Clan even arrived, humans would collapse on their own!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one would dare defy Xia Qingjun's orders. If someone uttered a word of dissent, the next moment Xia Qingjun might point his gun at them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xia Qingjun was the leader of humans.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Although Xia Qingjun reacted quickly and the "Changsong" cooperated fully, everyone underestimated the Octopus Clan's attention to the "Changsong". The Octopus Clan had not only implanted one ultra-long frequency program, but three different ultra-long frequency programs.</p><p></p><p>The blue-green planet Langguan still aroused the Octopus Clan's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a ship that had completely destroyed one of their colony planets!</p><p></p><p>Not only had their warships and planets been defeated by human warships, but the way humans defeated them was incomprehensible to the Octopus Clan!</p><p></p><p>In other words, humans had somehow mastered technology that could threaten the Octopus Clan!</p><p></p><p>They believed that humans could not escape their tentacles. Whenever they wanted, they could make humans go extinct......</p><p></p><p>After all, it was quite good to let humans be active in the universe for a while.</p><p></p><p>Human warships were all good combat training partners for the Octopus Clan's elite troops.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, some Octopus nobles also needed military achievements to upgrade their status and consolidate their positions. If there were no humans and Compound Eyes, who could they earn enough military achievements to upgrade from?</p><p></p><p>Seen this way, the Octopus Clan had actually been very protective of humans and the Compound Eyes for a long time......</p><p></p><p>They just didn't expect that, out of nowhere, humans would develop such powerful technology?</p><p></p><p>This was unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>Screw them!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, they had to find out what kind of new weapon humans had developed!</p><p></p><p>Who could guarantee that while sleeping soundly, their planet wouldn't suddenly be destroyed by humans one day?</p><p></p><p>Victory City, underground conference room.</p><p></p><p>"The Octopus Clan has sent scout ships towards Langguan! The possibility of our home planet being exposed has become infinitely great. Everyone must be prepared for the worst!"</p><p></p><p>They had thought this day would come, but didn't expect it to arrive so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Someone harbored a glimmer of hope: "No need to panic. We've already camouflaged the planet's surface. Perhaps they'll just come scout around and won't discover anything. The Octopus Clan has great faith in their scouting technology, they may not search thoroughly......"</p><p></p><p>Someone immediately refuted: "That possibility does not exist! Langguan is a life-bearing planet, even a fool could confirm it at a glance! No matter how well we humans camouflage it, once the Octopus Clan scout ships approach, everything will be exposed. So please do not cling to false hopes, it's extremely dangerous. We should focus all our efforts on preparing for being exposed."</p><p></p><p>"We can't let the Octopus Clan scout ships approach Langguan! I propose sending out the psionic fleet to intercept them directly outside the star system!"</p><p></p><p>"Taking the initiative to intercept is tantamount to admitting it, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's still better than letting them in!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun massaged his brow, finally deciding: "Send out camouflaged psionic warships to intercept and destroy the scouts under the pretext of an accidental encounter. Don't let them enter the star system!"</p><p></p><p>Buy some time if possible!</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded, then shook his head: "I know a bit, but not much!"</p><p></p><p>After Xia Qingjun briefly explained the situation to the captain, he said: "Go find Xu Shiqiang and give him a heads up, tell him to prepare early! As long as Xu Shiqiang is around, humanity still has hope. You understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded: "Understood, let Xu Shiqiang run first!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said helplessly: "Not let him run first, but let him try to take more people with him when he runs!"</p><p></p><p>"Received, Leader!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with this situation, all of humanity was helpless. What could one Xu Shiqiang do?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun thought to himself: "When push comes to shove, the only choice is to run! Run with as many as possible. As long as the spark of humanity remains, one day in the future we will surely be able to sweep across the entire Cloud Ring system and wipe out the Octopus Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how to completely eliminate the Octopus Clan, who could predict the future?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After listening to the captain, Su Hao said in surprise: "How were we discovered? Wasn't everything going well before?"</p><p></p><p>He was very satisfied with his current life and had thought the quiet days of research could continue for a long time, if not a thousand years, at least a hundred?</p><p></p><p>He didn't provoke the Octopus Clan, yet they came flaunting their existence right in front of him!</p><p></p><p>The captain smiled bitterly: "Apparently our Yaoxing ship offended the Octopus Clan badly. In order to find our Yaoxing ship, they focused on developing a brand new tracking program. Ten years ago, the 'Changsong' we sent to test the 'Shattered Star Cuboid' was caught in it and led the Octopus Clan to Langguan..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "I see, humanity's defenses really are full of holes. The Octopus Clan only needs to get a little serious and we can't withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>The captain looked embarrassed: "When you put it that way, it is indeed so. But we are at a disadvantage, and in reality the initiative has always been in the Octopus Clan's control. This is unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "So what do you plan to do?"</p><p></p><p>The captain said: "According to the leader's intentions, we'll try to buy some time for now, delay the Octopus Clan confirming Langguan's location as much as possible, and try to find a suitable planet to transfer to using the teleportation array. We can abandon the home planet Langguan, but not the people. As long as we're alive, humanity still has a chance to rise up!</p><p></p><p>So the leader asked me to give you a heads up, to get you prepared. At the critical final moment, if possible, help take more people with you when you leave. Take as many as you can."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment, then put down what he was doing and said bluntly: "No need to leave. Do as I say, I have a way to dispel the Octopus Clan's malice.</p><p></p><p>And prevent their ships from entering!"</p><p></p><p>The captain: "What did you say???"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "I said, it's just the Octopus Clan, no big deal. Take me to see Leader Xia Qingjun!"</p><p></p><p>Every time he heard Su Hao speak, the captain couldn't help but secretly mock him: What a big mouth, he's blown his own abilities up to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Yet the result of every incident proved that what Su Hao said was correct!</p><p></p><p>This time, after hearing Su Hao's words, the captain's first thought was: "Damn, this Xu Shiqiang is really powerful, and his arrogance has gone to his head. It's a sickness that needs treatment."</p><p></p><p>It's not surprising he thought this way, because who could resist the mighty Octopus Clan?</p><p></p><p>Faced with an Octopus Clan fleet, even a celestial immortal would probably have to surrender.</p><p></p><p>However, he only dared think it, and would never say it out loud. He just showed an embarrassed but polite smile: "Okay, with your words, my confidence has doubled!"</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao left with the captain, he sent a message in the group: "Yashan Fengcheng, it seems the Octopus Clan is going to attack Langguan. Put down what you're doing first, let's join forces to defeat the Octopus Clan."</p><p></p><p>Yashan Fengcheng's eyes lit up with excitement: "Got it, Captain Wei."</p><p></p><p>They quickly flashed and appeared by Su Hao's side, going with him to find Xia Qingjun.</p><p></p><p>After finding Xia Qingjun, Su Hao didn't beat around the bush and directly stated his intention: "No need to buy time. Just tell the Octopus Clan Langguan's location directly and let them in."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun looked dumbfounded: "Huh?"</p>

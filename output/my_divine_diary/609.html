        <h1>Chapter 609</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Mage Association was established, who dared to threaten the Mage Association in front of its highest-ranking leaders?</p><p></p><p>There had been cases before, but within two days, those who dared to threaten were annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with their mastery of complete source power, the Mage Association was tremendously powerful. For a long period after its establishment, their source technology was the most advanced in this world.</p><p></p><p>However, today they discovered that the technologies mastered by the Mage Association were no longer the most advanced.</p><p></p><p>There were three guys who had grasped even more advanced technologies, openly standing before them and declaring "cooperate or be destroyed", yet the Mage Association was powerless and could not muster any hostility.</p><p></p><p>Because falling behind meant they had lost their dominance over this world.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to regain that dominance...</p><p></p><p>Those present were all quick-witted elites, not an overstatement to call them the "essence of humanity". They quickly arrived at a solution.</p><p></p><p>It was simple: cooperate with him, take advantage of him, learn from him!</p><p></p><p>No matter how long a human's lifespan, it was at most 120 years. Jia Wei and the other two may seem invincible and dominating now, but at most it would last 100 years before they turned to nothingness, while the Mage Association would remain the Mage Association, its status unwavering.</p><p></p><p>After all, such transcendent talents may not appear even once in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Mage Association could learn and master Jia Wei's technologies, then 100 years later, the Mage Association would still possess the most advanced source technology!</p><p></p><p>A mere 100 years was no great loss!</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as the Mage Association could stand at the pinnacle of this world, enduring some humiliation was inconsequential for these people.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After explaining the benefits the Mage Association could gain, Su Hao picked up the materials beside him and analyzed the first phase of the cooperation projects one by one for the Mage representatives.</p><p></p><p>He listed many items, including "opening the Mage Association's massive database", "the right to freely issue tasks", "building the Mage Association network", etc.</p><p></p><p>But there was only one core project: establishing a real-time disaster monitoring system!</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao wanted was real-time data on disasters erupting across the entire planet, including any disaster in the remotest corner of the continents, as well as those in the vast oceans.</p><p></p><p>With this, he could analyze the "system" by which matter in this world transformed into source energy, and uncover its true nature!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a premonition that once he obtained the corresponding data, he would definitely be able to unlock the secret of instantly heating particles to extreme temperatures!</p><p></p><p>However, establishing such a "real-time monitoring system" was extremely difficult!</p><p></p><p>Having heard Su Hao talk about "cooperation" all along, they had envisioned him proposing all sorts of demands, but never such an outlandish form of cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, one of the "Ten Great Mages" raised doubts: "We in the Mage Association have also conceived of such a 'real-time monitoring system' before, but were unable to realize it. After many years of research, we only managed to create a machine called the 'Disaster Balancer' that could merely detect which direction a disaster occurred, but not the specific location."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "You need not worry about the technical aspects. What I need from the Mage Association is its vast manpower! As long as the Mage Association follows my arrangements, the 'real-time monitoring system' can be established within two years at most!"</p><p></p><p>Another "Great Mage" shook his head: "Our control over mages around the world is not as strong as you imagine. We cannot command them like an army with absolute obedience. The ideas are good, but the execution may not achieve the effect you desire. Even for regular tasks, mages take them freely. Mandatory tasks occur only about once every six months, not enough to sustain for two years."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "That's because the benefits offered were insufficient to motivate them. In a few days, I will divide my research results into skill levels of varying tiers. Mages will need to complete specific tasks to earn points that can be redeemed for corresponding skills.</p><p></p><p>This will solve the motivation issue. For example, for wind source mages, I can list out hundreds of skills, categorized from level 1 to 9, with different point requirements to acquire each skill. Moreover, upon collecting three skills each from levels 1 to 9, they will unlock the 'Diligent Little Bee' achievement, granting them the qualification to exchange for a 'second talent'."</p><p></p><p>Someone asked curiously: "What is a second talent?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained: "As the name suggests, for instance, a physical wind source mage could choose to become an energy lightning source mage or energy fire source mage, or even a specialized fantasy mage.</p><p></p><p>As long as they have enough points, they can acquire any ability they desire!"</p><p></p><p>The Mage representatives were greatly motivated. Even they themselves could not resist the urge to work and earn points to exchange for their desired abilities.</p><p></p><p>A regional director asked with great anticipation: "Can Sir Jia Wei really make this happen?"</p><p></p><p>Instead of answering, Su Hao directly demonstrated all the abilities across the energy, physical, and fantasy systems.</p><p></p><p>Not only Su Hao, but to prove others could also do it, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng also each demonstrated the full range of abilities from every system.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling array of skills left the Mage representatives dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>It was truly feasible!</p><p></p><p>This was an exciting prospect that set their blood boiling.</p><p></p><p>Then, regarding the establishment of the "real-time monitoring system", both sides raised all sorts of doubts, which Su Hao answered comprehensively one by one. After all questions were resolved, the Head Mage asked: "Sir Jia Wei, do you stand by the five commitments to the Mage Association you stated initially?"</p><p></p><p>Even the fifth condition, the threat, could be viewed positively as a form of protection for the Mage Association!</p><p></p><p>After seeing no objections, the Head Mage said: "Then please circulate the meeting minutes now. Once everyone has confirmed it, sign at the end."</p><p></p><p>The minutes circulated one by one. This process took a long time, as everyone reviewed it very carefully, leaving no room for carelessness. It also gave those present ample time for discussion and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, the circulation was complete, and everyone, including Su Hao's group, had signed their names.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no objections, the Head Mage stood up: "Next, the Mage representatives will hold an anonymous vote on whether to cooperate with Sir Jia Wei. More than fifteen votes in favor means the Mage Association agrees to cooperate with Sir Jia Wei, otherwise the cooperation is rejected."</p><p></p><p>The mages' hearts began racing.</p><p></p><p>Cooperate or battle?</p><p></p><p>Before the results, they dared not assume the final outcome.</p><p></p><p>History had proven time and again that voting results often defied "obvious" expectations.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they cast their chosen balls into the sealed box, eyes fixed on it in case of tampering.</p><p></p><p>The ceremonial lady soon announced the voting results: Twenty-nine in favor, one abstention!</p><p></p><p>All the Mage representatives heaved a sigh of relief!</p><p></p><p>They dared not imagine what would happen if cooperation failed to be reached, but it would certainly not be what they wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>Because no one wanted to confront this mysterious Jia Wei.</p><p></p><p>The rest was simple. Professional mages drafted the various agreements on the spot, thirty-three in total. Then, all those attending signed their titles and names, leaving their handprints.</p><p></p><p>The agreement was reached.</p><p></p><p>Whether there was an agreement mattered little to Su Hao. If he wanted, no agreement could bind him.</p><p></p><p>But the agreement held great significance for the Mage representatives. Having an agreement accepted by both sides formed the basis for cooperation, while also providing an explanation to their subordinates.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting adjourned, Feng Cheng went to the Zhu Le Xian Palace to have fun. As Su Hao and Ya Shan were about to leave, Lada squeezed out a smile and approached Su Hao: "Um...Sir Jia Wei, now that we've reached a cooperation, can you release my teammates and disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Of course. I only had them stay at my base temporarily, in case they caused trouble."</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to Ya Shan: "Ya Shan, go bring them here to Director Lada!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded: "Got it, Old Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ya Shan brought everyone over - Lada's four teammates and Xiang Li, Fei Tiao, and three others.</p><p></p><p>Excitement was written all over their faces. After being confined for nearly two years, they were finally free!</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others looked at Fei Tiao in disbelief. Was this kid's brain damaged? Escaping that hellish place was already hard enough, yet he still wanted to go back?</p><p></p><p>Once back at the base, all their source abilities would be sealed, an unbearably miserable experience.</p><p></p><p>However, Jia Wei would surely refuse, right? How could he allow free entry into their secret base?</p><p></p><p>But to everyone's astonishment, Jia Wei actually nodded, then casually took out a metal ball and handed it to Fei Tiao, saying, "Of course you can. This is a transit ball with direct access to the base. You can return anytime to read books."</p>

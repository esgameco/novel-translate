        <h1>Chapter 710</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by, and a year passed.</p><p></p><p>After fully adapting to controlling the "Eight-Armed God", Yashan and Fengcheng finally managed to create the 'Source Power Life Capsule' that allowed their main bodies to survive for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as they had a high-quality source bead, the life capsule could sustain their main bodies for ten years!</p><p></p><p>There were three silver ellipsoid life capsules placed in the base. Suhao circled around them twice, constantly praising, "Not bad, it looks very high-tech and aesthetically pleasing!"</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the two of them, "Who wants to try it first?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately said, "I'll go. As Yashan's assistant, I participated in the whole research and development process, so I'm fully confident in the product!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Anything produced by Yashan must be a quality product!"</p><p></p><p>A few weeks later, Fengcheng found Suhao and said, "Ahem, Chief Maintainer, well, there's a small problem with the life capsule. We've only solved the input issue but haven't resolved the output problem yet. Could you please help take my main body out of the life capsule so we can redesign and modify it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao curiously asked, "Output problem?"</p><p></p><p>He casually took out Fengcheng's life capsule.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he took it out, a foul odor emanated from the life capsule. Suhao couldn't help but retreat a few steps, cursing loudly, "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>He finally understood what the 'output problem' was.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled awkwardly, enduring the stench, and immediately ran away with the life capsule.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Is this really a product of Yashan?</p><p></p><p>He had thoroughly analyzed the structure and operating principles of the energy blocks. Essentially, they had similarities to his own 'collapse' and 'gravitational wave' rune structures, with the way they functioned being largely the same. By drawing from each other, it wasn't difficult for him to understand.</p><p></p><p>The difficult part was how to safely use the curvature engine himself.</p><p></p><p>Suhao muttered, "It's almost there! Distance will no longer be an obstacle I can't overcome."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Suhao had just left when Yonghua came in carrying a food box.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she entered, she smelled the strong odor and instinctively covered her mouth and nose, "What's that smell? It feels like I've entered a cesspit."</p><p></p><p>She lingered outside Suhao's lab for a long time but didn't see him come out, so she knew she wouldn't be able to see him today.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes shifted, looking towards the workshop where Yashan and Fengcheng often appeared, "Why don't I go play with Brother Yashan and the others?"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, she immediately took small steps towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>Then in the workshop, she saw Yashan and Fengcheng huddled together, whispering about something.</p><p></p><p>She tiptoed over curiously and took a look.</p><p></p><p>It was a life capsule, and a strong odor was emanating from it, making her dizzy.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but say, "Brother Yashan, Brother Fengcheng! You two actually pooped in the life capsule? So perverted and scary!"</p><p></p><p>She knew about this life capsule that Brother Yashan and Brother Fengcheng had been working on for a year, but she never expected......</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng knew this little girl had come, but the two of them were studying a new solution and didn't have time to pay attention to her.</p><p></p><p>When they heard Yonghua mistakenly thought they had......</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately pointed at Fengcheng, "It has nothing to do with me, it's your Brother Fengcheng's doing!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's face flushed red, unable to say a word in rebuttal.</p><p></p><p>Yonghua suddenly retreated two steps, keeping her distance from Fengcheng, making a disgusted sound, "Eww~"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was critically hit!</p><p></p><p>Yashan grinned, "He's our leader!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua: "Leader? Are you three in a gang?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily, "A gang? I like that! But we're even more vicious than a gang, capable of doing anything."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua shook her head, "I don't believe it. You look like good people, how could you be vicious?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Yonghua, you're still young. You can't judge whether someone is vicious or not by their appearance. But you guessed right, a handsome guy like me must not be a bad person."</p><p></p><p>Yashan burst his bubble, "If it weren't for the Chief Maintainer, with your 'human trash' status, how could you be handsome?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng dejectedly said, "Yashan, don't expose me in front of the little girl. I'll listen to you from now on!"</p><p></p><p>However, with Yashan and Fengcheng's current appearance and demeanor, they did look quite attractive. Their handsome looks combined with their unique aura could easily attract a young girl like Yonghua.</p><p></p><p>In Yonghua's eyes, how could a handsome person be a bad person?</p><p></p><p>She asked again, "You two stay here all the time and never go out. Aren't you bored?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan raised his brows, "We all have our own things to do, why would we be bored?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also said, "That's right, we live fulfilling days every day, we don't feel bored at all."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua suddenly froze, muttering, "Have your own things to do? My uncle also said he has his own things to do. What about me?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't even know what she would do in the future.</p><p></p><p>When she was very young, she felt sensitive and inferior because her family wasn't wealthy. After her uncle became a hero, she regained the courage to face others, but that was it.</p><p></p><p>She still didn't know what she could do.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment, she suddenly realized that everyone else seemed to have things they wanted to do, except her. She had nothing!</p><p></p><p>Yashan, as if reminded of his own daughter Taini, smiled, "Yonghua, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua shook her head, "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Then you should think about it carefully and follow your heart's choice in doing things. Being immersed in doing what you want to do is very happy."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng showed a smile and nodded in agreement, "That's true. I'm doing what I want to do now, and I feel very happy."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was very envious that Yashan and Fengcheng had things they wanted to do. She carefully asked, "Then...Brother Yashan, Brother Fengcheng, what is it that you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily, "Of course, it's the tasks assigned by the Chief Maintainer! I want to use my abilities to help the Chief Maintainer achieve his goals."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "For me, it's simpler. I just need to follow the Chief Maintainer, it doesn't matter what I do."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua thought they would say something grand like "for the sake of humanity", but she didn't expect this.</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand, "This can also be something you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said matter-of-factly, "Of course! Follow your heart's choice, do whatever you want to do!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua looked confused, "Follow my heart's choice?"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Yonghua gave the food box to Yashan and Fengcheng, then said, "In a month, I'll be going to university, so maybe I won't be able to come see you often."</p><p></p><p>Then, with a heart full of doubts, she left, repeatedly asking herself: What do I want to do?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Two months later, the life capsule was finally modified. Fengcheng became the first user again. After another month of him holding his breath, no other problems occurred.</p><p></p><p>Then the main bodies of all three of them were placed into the life capsules, which Suhao hid in his second-level space.</p><p></p><p>That day, Suhao sent a message in the group, "I'll be gone for a while, the duration is uncertain. If there's anything, just say it in the group."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Chief Maintainer!"</p><p></p><p>'Transmit'!</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack!"</p><p></p><p>He first transformed into the "Eight-Armed God" with all protective shields on. Then he used two consecutive flashes to appear in space.</p><p></p><p>Then he discovered that the Eight-Armed Tribe had re-established a supply station on this planet, "Huh? They dare to build a supply station here again?"</p><p></p><p>This was an important transit point where he had placed a positioning stone. How could he allow the Eight-Armed Tribe to establish a supply station here?</p><p></p><p>'Destruction Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose, accompanied by a loud noise......</p><p></p><p>But it had nothing to do with Suhao anymore. He used a few more flashes to appear in space again.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's try out the effect of my curvature engine! Hmm...let me give it a new name! I'll call it 'Starlight Roaming'."</p><p></p><p>Crystal armor surged out, constructing dense rune formations outside his body, with fifty high-quality source beads embedded in the runes.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>After a humming sound.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's spiritual tentacles clearly sensed the surrounding space-time beginning to distort, forming a gap. According to the level established by humans, it was a level three curvature engine, capable of traveling at thirty-nine times the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>"Did it succeed?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He felt himself accelerating, that planet rapidly retreating......</p><p></p><p>Faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>At one point, Suhao's divine sense lost perception of the outside world. Even his eyes couldn't see the stars in the universe anymore. He could only see the stars stretching into lines of light, and the cosmic scenery transformed into a different scene before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just like what he had seen on the Yuoxing spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>"My Starlight Roaming succeeded! I've achieved faster-than-light travel! Hahaha, the vast universe, here I come!"</p><p></p><p>After traveling for two more days, Suhao decided to stop temporarily and observe how far he had traveled.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stopped providing energy to 'Starlight Roaming', and the surrounding space-time gradually returned to normal. At one moment, the lines of light disappeared, and he could see the stars in the universe again.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a brilliant firework lit up in this space.</p><p></p><p>And inside the second-level space, Suhao's main body opened his eyes in astonishment, "How did I die......"</p>

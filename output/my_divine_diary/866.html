        <h1>Chapter 866</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After seeing Suhao, the Dragon Mother Shaduo poured out the worries she had carried over the years, expressing her concerns for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>She also told Suhao that seeing him grow up healthy, she no longer had any worries. She would go out to find another giant dragon mate, and if all went well, she would even give birth to a few more younger brothers and sisters for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she did not dwell on the matter of her previous husband Muchi Sak.</p><p></p><p>When mentioning Chipu and Moli, she expressed full support for her children pursuing the lives they wanted, seeing her younger brother as the Great Demon King, and having the goal of defeating her younger brother was also acceptable. At least she knew Suhao would not treat Chipu that way.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this ideology was also a tradition of the Golden Dragon race - they never interfered with what their children pursued.</p><p></p><p>Simply put: Once their wings hardened, they could do whatever they wanted.</p><p></p><p>And Suhao did not need to worry about the safety of the Dragon Mother Shaduo, Chipu, and Moli. After all, without deities and soul power, the Red Golden Giant Dragons were truly at the top of the food chain in this world - others should worry about them instead.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Dragon Mother Shaduo's small world nest, Suhao began to work on transforming the giant dragon body into a humanoid form.</p><p></p><p>The solution was actually quite simple - just add the "humanoid" gene sequence to the giant dragon body, and then they could freely transform into any form they liked.</p><p></p><p>Of course, upgrading the body to a "deity" was also possible. Long ago in the previous world, he had already solved the problem of consciousness being dispersed when evolving into a "deity".</p><p></p><p>The main reason he did not plan to evolve his body into a "deity" now was to prevent any accidents, and there was no need to take risks - stability came first.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, a young Red Golden Giant Dragon led seven Red Golden Giant Dragons of about the same size, flying towards a snow-capped mountain whose peak could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Listen to me, brothers. If we truly succeed in rescuing the Deity Pinning the Heavens - His Majesty Nati, His Majesty Nati will undoubtedly appoint us as the most revered Dragon Envoys, and we will gain tremendous power and the ability of eternal life. The vast world will be open for us to roam freely."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the distant snow mountain and said, "Do you see that snow mountain ahead? It is the largest and tallest snow mountain in our Dragon Continent. If the Great Demon King Leiān Ōkūsū has truly hidden the deities, it is very likely he hid them there."</p><p></p><p>A slightly timid Red Golden Giant Dragon said, "Big Brother Chipu, the Great Demon King Leiān Ōkūsū possesses incomparably powerful strength. Can we defeat him?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu said matter-of-factly, "Of course. The Great Demon King Leiān's power has all been used to suppress the deities. I guess he does not have extra power to deal with us. As long as we slightly divert the Great Demon King Leiān's attention, the deities will surely be able to break free from the Great Demon King Leiān's control, escape smoothly, and in turn defeat the Great Demon King Leiān. At that time, we will be victorious."</p><p></p><p>The group of young dragons, incited by Chipu's words, could not help but let out long roars towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement cooled down, another young Golden Dragon asked, "Big Brother Chipu, how do you know the deities were captured by the Great Demon King Leiān? Are you really the older brother of the Great Demon King?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu snorted, "Of course I am the older brother of the Great Demon King Leiān. It is precisely because I am his older brother that I have witnessed the Great Demon King Leiān's evil power since I was young, and inadvertently learned a trace of the Great Demon King's power. Only I know the Great Demon King Leiān best, so I have a chance to defeat him. Perhaps I was born for this, born for justice."</p><p></p><p>The young Golden Dragons looked at Chipu with admiring eyes, full of excitement, "As expected of Big Brother Chipu, you are even willing to destroy your own kin for a great cause."</p><p></p><p>Chipu was very proud of the admiration from the other young Golden Dragons, which was something he could not get from his own younger brothers and sisters. He clenched his paw tightly, "As for why I know the Great Demon King Leiān captured the deities, that's because I saw it with my own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Leiān Ōkūsū, he is the Great Demon King of the world, possessing tremendous and evil power. I personally witnessed the God of Myriad Thunders - His Majesty Gu and the Goddess of Beauty - Her Majesty Fu'er fighting the Great Demon King Leiān for hundreds of rounds before being defeated and captured.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Leiān is simply too cruel. We must overthrow him."</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the snow mountain and roared, "Brothers, charge! For justice!"</p><p></p><p>"Woooo——"</p><p></p><p>Then the group of young dragons charged recklessly up the towering snow mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Chipu, there are no traces of the Great Demon King Leiān, nor any signs of the Deity Sovereigns. It's also a bit cold, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu looked grim, "The Great Demon King Leiān is too cunning. He must have been alerted by the loud noises of our discussion just now and moved them preemptively. As expected of my younger brother, he remains as sharp and cautious as ever after all these years. Next time, you definitely won't be able to escape. Brothers, let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten years later.</p><p></p><p>After observing sixty young men equipped with soul brains, Suhao confirmed that the current "Soul Cultivation Record" had become well-developed without any issues.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I really succeeded. It's time to call Yashan and Fengcheng back to begin the next experiment."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao sent Yashan and Fengcheng a message: "Yashan, Fengcheng, there is a soul transfer experiment that needs your cooperation. Put aside what you're working on and come to my lab."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng did not hesitate and immediately came to Suhao's lab.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons marched with a swaggering gait and thunderous steps, stopping in front of Suhao, "Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Master Wei, is this your true body? When did you transform into a human form?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I added the 'humanoid' gene sequence. If you want to become humanoid, it's better to just find human bodies directly instead of going through that trouble. I called you here this time to give you new brains."</p><p></p><p>New brains?</p><p></p><p>For them, getting new brains was not dangerous, but an upgrade.</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked in amazement, "Master Wei, have you created an even more powerful brain?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "I combined the spirit brain and soul power to obtain a more powerful soul brain. This will be another qualitative change for our brains. After replacing the soul brain, amplified by the 'core rune perception', perhaps our 'divine consciousness' can expand to cover an entire planet, or even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and the other were stunned. They didn't expect that in less than fifty years, Master Wei had thoroughly unraveled the mysteries of soul power, assimilating it. This ability to learn and research was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a divine consciousness covering an entire planet...</p><p></p><p>Although they could freely come and go on any ordinary planet and completely destroy it, they never underestimated the vastness of a planet. Subconsciously, they felt that a planet was so enormous that it would be difficult for the 'divine consciousness' to fully encompass it.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that, not counting the linear divine consciousness formed by using minor tricks, the pinnacle state was the divine consciousness, but it could only cover a range of 200 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred kilometers sounded large, but on the scale of a planet, it was merely a slightly bigger dot.</p><p></p><p>Now, Master Wei told them that their divine consciousness might directly expand from a small dot to encompass an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Such a vast increase in range still surprised the two well-traveled individuals.</p><p></p><p>Yashan curiously asked, "Master Wei, how did you achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao explained, "It has nothing to do with me; this is an innate characteristic of soul power. The radiation range of spirit power fluctuations is only 200 kilometers, but the radiation range of soul power is much greater than spirit power, more than enough to cover an entire planet. After integrating soul power into the spirit brain to form the soul brain, combined with the characteristics of the perception runes, this characteristic is also the reason why the deities of this world can hide their main bodies in one place while controlling their avatars to roam freely all over the world."</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually took out two pure soul power condensed into soul seeds and showed them to Yashan and Fengcheng, "These are soul seeds formed from the soul power I produced myself. The first step in creating a soul brain is to fuse the soul seed with your own brain, and then according to the methods written in my 'Soul Cultivation Record', nourish the soul power to form a specific structure and reach the state of astral projection. At that point, you can freely replace your body and brain."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "So after the soul leaves the body, we can replace our new bodies when our physical bodies age, and continue living?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, through the experience of the previous life, Fengcheng developed an aversion and fear of aging, and he truly hoped his physical body would not grow old.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Correct, perhaps there will be no need to reincarnate in the future."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng cheered excitedly, "Wonderful. I can't wait for astral projection."</p><p></p><p>Yashan looked at the soul seeds in Suhao's hand and murmured, "This is the fruit of exploration, the crystallization of knowledge. Master Wei, you have unknowingly reached such a level. What will the future be like? It's truly filled with anticipation."</p><p></p><p>Now that they had encompassed an entire planet within their perception, what about the future? Could they perhaps hold a vast planet in the palm of their hand, treating it like a toy ball that children play with?</p><p></p><p>Suhao just smiled lightly, "It's still far from that. Everything that seems beautiful may contain a deadly weapon. We can only say that we must continue to explore, never stopping easily. At the same time, we should enjoy the knowledge and scenery we gain along the way.</p><p></p><p>As for how far we can ultimately go, we'll just go as far as we can!"</p>

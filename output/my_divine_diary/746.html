        <h1>Chapter 746</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not know that after glaring away the mushroom girl, he had caused a mushroom person to lose its precious love.</p><p></p><p>He walked slowly up to the blue crystal, controlling the tail behind the mushroom head to rise up. He opened his eye petals, aiming at a protruding point on the crystal, like a baby latching onto a plastic nipple.</p><p></p><p>The eye petals enveloped the blue crystal head, with the dense neural tentacles tightly adhering to the blue crystal. In that instant, a huge stream of information violently rushed in, causing the mushroom person controlled by Suhao to shudder involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>In a daze, Suhao entered a grayish-white world, unable to make out what was near or far.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his perceptual vision flickered with dense white dots, like an old TV with static.</p><p></p><p>Then the world scene began to gain color, and the white dots began to twist and gradually change and flow.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the colors pieced together, inexplicably forming a scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>The painting was blurred at first, but gradually became clear...</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao found himself as if in a sky full of balloons. These balloons were colorful, varied in size, gorgeous with intricate and beautiful patterns, emitting a faint glow around them...</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked at the scene before him in a daze, uncertain: "Are these...planets?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was like a sprite floating in mid-air, able to freely pass through these spheres. With just a thought, he could pass through the not-so-large gaps between these spheres and arrive at any place he saw.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stared at a distant yellow sphere, and with a thought, his vision blurred slightly before he arrived in front of this sphere.</p><p></p><p>He murmured in amazement: "So this is the 'Star Viewing World'? It's too incredible! And these dense spheres must be planets!</p><p></p><p>It's as if...these planets are servers, interconnected to build a vast network world, and I'm now inside this network world.</p><p></p><p>Against the backdrop of the starry sky, though separated by vast distances, they are extremely close in this network world."</p><p></p><p>The planets interconnected to build a vast network?</p><p></p><p>Only someone with holes in their brain would dare think that way!</p><p></p><p>But is it possible?</p><p></p><p>What Suhao saw indeed brought him a strong enough shock to give him a whole new perspective on this universe.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he saw another facet of this universe.</p><p></p><p>"From my view, the distances between galaxies in the universe are immense, but from another angle, the distances may not be so far.</p><p></p><p>I need more angles to observe the universe, like the 'spiritual eye'. Perhaps I can make the blue crystal into a spiritual eye, allowing me to enter this wondrous Star Viewing World anytime."</p><p></p><p>Suhao examined the yellowish-brown planet before him, about the size of a cruise ship, clearly seeing the shifting winds and clouds on its surface.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but try to reach out and touch this seemingly small planet, but forgot he had no hands at the moment...</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the yellowish-brown planet suddenly enlarged before his eyes. His vision blurred for an instant, and when it cleared again, he had entered the planet's atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>It was like clicking a magnifying glass button.</p><p></p><p>Suhao seemed to have mastered controlling his vision, rapidly roaming over this planet, crossing over mountains, through storms, into the underground, swimming through magma...</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what he did, the surrounding environment had no effect on him - he was merely an observer.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this planet seemed to be constructed from a set of data, synchronizing information corresponding to the actual planet in real-time.</p><p></p><p>Suhao only had viewing rights, not modification rights.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought: "I see, so this is the Star Viewing World! Just by staying in the Star Viewing Divine Temple, I can freely roam the planets of the universe! This ability is too powerful!</p><p></p><p>So to prevent the Compound Eye Race from stealing their vision technology, humans adopted the 'deception' policy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao's shielded mini-world may be effective against the 'Star Viewing World', a point he could only verify later!</p><p></p><p>While marveling at the power of the 'Star Viewing World', Suhao couldn't help but mock the so-called Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>With such an advantageous environment and innate conditions, they still ended up like this - it's too disgraceful!</p><p></p><p>Don't think about it, don't think about it!</p><p></p><p>But in their shoes, Suhao couldn't be certain he would definitely soar either. In any case, he still felt pity for the Compound Eye Race."</p><p></p><p>Suhao left this planet and passed through a few more, gradually adapting to moving in the Star Viewing World.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he turned towards the massive, softly glowing white giant - a star.</p><p></p><p>This was a star! Presented to Suhao in this way.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had been curious about stars for a long time but never had a chance to see them up close. Now with this opportunity, he naturally wouldn't let it pass.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he instantly arrived before the star and, without hesitation, plunged right in.</p><p></p><p>Like diving into water, his vision transformed into a brilliant golden expanse.</p><p></p><p>This was probably the star's atmosphere, where Suhao knew terrifying high temperatures raged, but this heat had no effect on him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Continuing downwards...</p><p></p><p>Before long, Suhao found himself stuck, unable to approach the star's interior no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Unable to withstand the star's raging energy and disconnected? It seems the Star Viewing World can't observe every celestial body...I was originally going to take a look inside the black hole at the center of the nebula, but that was presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>He idled around the star's surface, carefully observing the conditions, pondering whether tossing his 'Star Shard Cube' onto the star was feasible...</p><p></p><p>The answer was cruel: the Star Shard Cube would likely vaporize before even landing.</p><p></p><p>Stars were not something humans could challenge.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Suhao controlling the mushroom person released the eye petals gripping the blue crystal, gradually waking from the Star Viewing World.</p><p></p><p>He coiled the 'eye petal' tail in front of his eyes, watching the eye petals slowly close, unable to hold back a light laugh: "Dream Stone, Eye Petals, Star Viewing World...it's all too fascinating!"</p><p></p><p>Then he disengaged control of this body and returned to the Bouncing Realm space.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a huge blue crystal network structure appeared in the Bouncing Realm space, emitting a faint blue glow.</p><p></p><p>This was the blue crystal structure he personally recorded across the entire Divine Planet with his divine consciousness, with little deviation overall.</p><p></p><p>The more Suhao looked, the more satisfied he became: "What secrets are hidden in this blue crystal? I can't wait to uncover them!"</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the powerful Eight-Armed Race forcing the entire Nebula System to interconnect, this deeply buried Compound Eye Race was flushed out.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if Suhao was reborn into the Nebula System, he may never have found this wondrous planet!</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, just obtaining this massive blue crystal alone made his rebirth after waiting hundreds of millions of years worthwhile!</p><p></p><p>Recalling his previous life ending at just two or three years old, Suhao slowly felt regretful: "Back then I experienced so many worlds, but how many good things did I miss..."</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made his heart ache and bleed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Suhao released control of the mushroom person named Changtong, it woke up dazed with a head full of questions: "Huh? When did I fall asleep? Why did I end up next to the Dream Stone?"</p><p></p><p>Then it looked around and quickly found that beautiful figure.</p><p></p><p>That was its mushroom person partner - they had a very good relationship...</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the mushroom person Changtong petrified, then shattered into pieces falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>What did it see? Its beloved sweetheart, actually kissing another male mushroom person...</p>

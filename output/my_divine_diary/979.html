        <div class="content">
            <p>On top of a barren mountain, Cong Renfei's brows were furrowed as he diligently attempted the Wudaoist's cultivation of the heart, trying to step through the door of the Wudaoist's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't get anywhere.</p><p></p><p>On this day, he felt the Yuan Qi permeating around him and secretly said, "Could it be that outsiders really don't have the means to perform martial arts cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he shook his head and said, "It won't be, I feel that if the martial artists of this world are able to use a power like Yuan Qi, then I must be able to do it as well, and there must be a way to skip the step of 'mastering oneself' and instead utilize the Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi directly."</p><p></p><p>After cultivating according to the martial Taoist's cultivation method for a period of time, Cong Renfei was already able to perceive the existence of Yuan Qi without using his divine mind, but he could only perceive it, but he was unable to mobilize the Yuan Qi of heaven and earth into his body.</p><p></p><p>According to the words of Heavenly King on the Cloud: a wastrel without roots cannot communicate with nature, just as a cup without a bottom cannot hold water.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei suddenly thought of Master Wei's operation a few months ago, and couldn't help but think, "Master Wei should be studying Yuan Qi as well, if it's Master Wei's words, what method would he use?"</p><p></p><p>He would never have imagined that Su Hao was directly stuffing a ball of highly concentrated natural yuan qi into his chest and forcibly blocking it to allow it to naturally fuse.</p><p></p><p>Even if he thought of it, he wouldn't dare to do so.</p><p></p><p>After all, although he possessed a soul brain, his body was just an ordinary 'spirit body', and there was no way to recover quickly with 'flesh and blood augmentation' like Su Hao's [God] if he played with it.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Cong Renfei got up and walked towards the humble house, and after seeing the Heavenly King Yunshang who was sitting aside watching a small movie, he said, "Old man Yunshang, my cultivation is still not working, or else how about you give me a little bit of yuan qi to be used as my start-up capital?"</p><p></p><p>Although Heavenly King Yun Shang's eyes were glued to the screen, watching the male and female protagonists inside perform vigorously, his mind was thinking of other things.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't forget about the instantaneous fading of Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi and the big explosion that happened a few months ago.</p><p></p><p>He thought of many possibilities, but couldn't figure out what had happened at all.</p><p></p><p>When he went to the location of the explosion, there was nothing else but an immense and incomparable explosion crater.</p><p></p><p>Now when he heard Cong Renfei's question, his eyes finally moved away from the screen, "That won't work, the yuan qi is mine, no one else can control it, the moment it enters your body, it can blow you up into a pile of broken meat, you want to take the risk, but I don't want to, no way."</p><p></p><p>He is still inseparable from Cong Renfei, because after the computer is dead, he needs Cong Renfei to help him change the battery ......</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei is also very admiring this little old man, he clearly taught this old man how to fast forward, but this old man watching the movie is hard to see the end from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>He thinks that those who do not fast forward when watching a movie are ruthless people, so he very much admires this ruthless person, the Heavenly King on the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds suddenly said, ''Kid, you said that explosion was caused by your senior? And that the Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi being instantly drained away was also your Senior Uncle's handiwork?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei nodded his head and said, "I could sense that my Senior Uncle was there at that time, so there shouldn't be any mistake."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds asked, "What is your Senior Uncle?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei stroked his chin and glanced at the Heavenly King on the Clouds, pondering whether or not to tell this little old man the truth.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds: "What's in your kid's eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "I was wondering if you're qualified to know the true identity of my Master Wei. But well, old man you're actually quite powerful, no worse than many people I've met, so it shouldn't be a problem to tell you."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds took Cong Renfei to be talking nonsense and simply asked, "Speak up, what person?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei lowered his voice and said, "My Master Wei is not a person!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly King on the Clouds:"?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said again, "My Master Wei is a god!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly King on the Cloud: "???"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei added, "Not just my Master Wei, my Master and my two Masters, they are all three innate Sacred Ones, omniscient and omnipotent at the beginning of the birth of this Universe, nurtured by the essence of the Universe, whose power is so great that it surpasses the imagination of ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds was silent for a moment, then ventured out, "Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned his head to focus on watching a small movie.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was stunned, "You ...... don't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly King on the Clouds spewed out a puff of air from his nose and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei waved his hand and sighed, "You have no chance with the True God."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he went out on his own, closed his eyes and opened the mall, wandering around.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, he got a large amount of points, he hadn't thought about what to buy, and he liked to browse the mall when he had free time.</p><p></p><p>Shopping, he suddenly found two new products in the mall, one named 'Innate Yuan Qi', one named 'Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi', he instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>"What? Innate Yuan Qi is sold in the mall? When did this thing come into existence?...... It couldn't be that Master Wei put it up for sale after he researched it thoroughly!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly opened the item description and read it carefully, quickly confirming that the Yuan Qi spoken of here was the martial dao Yuan Qi he wanted to learn.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's head was filled with black lines, "If I knew that the mall sells it, why do I still need to tempt this old man to teach me with a small porno? Just buy it directly and it wouldn't be over."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the price tag again, two thousand points of credit, nothing to hesitate, change!</p><p></p><p>Soon his hand more a ball of light white light, as soon as it appeared it automatically sank into his palm, along the palm to the heart position, and fused with the heart.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei's divine mind observed and found that this ball of innate energy was able to integrate into the bloodstream and transported to every part of his body through the blood vessels.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this make it Innate Yuan Qi? I can carry out martial artist cultivation now, hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>When Cong Renfei opened his eyes, it was slightly blurred in front of him, and the figure of the Heavenly King on the Cloud suddenly appeared in front of him, staring blankly at him.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei heatedly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly King on the Clouds couldn't help but ask, "Kid, what's going on with the Yuan Qi inside your body?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shrugged his shoulders and said, "There's nothing to tell, because you wouldn't believe me even if I told you."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Wudao Star Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The four people released by Su Hao, Lu Yijiang, Gao Qi, Taicheng, and King An Ming.</p><p></p><p>Three against one, fiercely confronting each other, ferocious auras raged between the several people, flying sand and stones, and the wind and clouds changed.</p><p></p><p>They had been holding each other back for a long time.</p><p></p><p>No one could understand the suffocating feeling of not being able to hit each other even though they had been in close proximity for months.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had just been released by Su Hao, both of them couldn't wait to get each other killed.</p><p></p><p>"Knock knock knock!"</p><p></p><p>A familiar sound, like the sound of bells and hammers, came out from King Anming, striking the eardrums.</p><p></p><p>The three of them, Lu Yi Jiang, knew that this was a sign of King An Ming's activating his full state, and they immediately assumed a fighting stance.</p><p></p><p>"Gu~" "Ah ah ah ah~"</p><p></p><p>The muscles on King Anming's body bulged high and his veins stood out. He roared madly, as he had done before, his torso hardening and pulling up a large portion of his body, his aura skyrocketing several times.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding rubble was shattered by the powerful aura, drifting away with the violent wind.</p><p></p><p>"Ahahahaha! Tremble under my power, Lu Yijiang! Without others to help you this time, I'll see what you can do to stop me."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Taicheng's hearts jumped indisputably, "Good ...... power!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang clenched his hands into fists, veins rippled all over his body, and in a frantic low roar, his powerful aura surged out, completing his preparation for battle.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang roared, "Come on Anming King, I will defeat you completely today."</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, his feet stepped down and the ground exploded into a large pit, his entire body disappeared in place and appeared in front of King Anming, and he blasted out with a square fist.</p><p></p><p>An Ming Wang haha laughed, in the face of Lv Yi Jiang's bombarded fist actually did not flash and did not avoid, flipped his hand and blasted a fist towards Lv Yi Jiang.</p><p></p><p>"Boom..."</p><p></p><p>Both of their fists hit each other's face hard, then flew out backwards at the same time.</p><p></p><p>And re-stood again.</p><p></p><p>King Anming revealed an unbelievable expression, "Your power, how did it become so strong!"</p><p></p><p>Judging from the power of the blast against him just now, Lu Yijiang's power was no longer inferior to his.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yijiang himself was also very shocked, "This ...... I didn't know!"</p><p></p><p>Then he revealed a bright smile, "Haha, this makes me even more confident in defeating you! Come on King Anming, I'm going to defeat you right here!"</p><p></p><p>King Anmyo: "......"</p><p></p><p>What a familiar line.</p>

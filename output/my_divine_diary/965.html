        <h1>Chapter 965</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when the Infinite Gate and Twin Sword Gate explore the outer universe, they operate in pairs for better efficiency compared to searching alone.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, it takes two disciples five to ten years to search an entire galaxy.</p><p></p><p>After completing the search of a galaxy, the disciples can take a two-year break. After two years, they will be assigned to search another galaxy.</p><p></p><p>As the disciples say, this is called "double vacation"...</p><p></p><p>Of course, every hundred years, they can have a ten-year long vacation. If accumulated for two hundred years, they can take a twenty-year vacation at once.</p><p></p><p>However, most disciples can't hold out that long and tend to take vacations as soon as they can, seizing pleasure early.</p><p></p><p>When disciples happen to be on vacation together and have a good relationship, they may invite each other to explore and play at some unique places in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the Infinite Gate and Twin Sword Gate, one had to find a job. Even after cultivating into a Golden Immortal in the sects, one still has to work - there's no difference. It's just about getting used to it.</p><p></p><p>Such a work-life pattern is unavoidable even for Cong Shuling, a senior martial sister of the Twin Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Whenever it's time for a mission, she would call her younger brother Cong Renfei to team up with her. It's not that she is particularly clingy to her brother, but as a senior martial sister, she would feel the atmosphere a bit awkward teaming up with other junior disciples.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei doesn't want to team up with his sister either. He prefers teaming up with the beautiful female disciples of the Twin Sword Gate...</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei casually chose a very stable planet, sat cross-legged on a huge rock, set up a defensive formation, and then connected to the galactic network to begin searching the planet's oceans.</p><p></p><p>How many planets are there in a galaxy?</p><p></p><p>It's hard to count.</p><p></p><p>Even with careful searching, a hundred years may not be enough. So when they search galaxies, they mostly just glance to confirm if a planet has no life and then move on.</p><p></p><p>For those who enjoy it, this searching process is full of the joy of exploration. For those who don't, it's simply torturous, especially when the continuous search lasts hundreds or thousands of years - a torture within torture.</p><p></p><p>Only the vacations can give them a reprieve.</p><p></p><p>But there's no way around the rules of the Infinite Gate and Twin Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Cong Renfei enjoys this process of exploration. He feels immense satisfaction from seeing all kinds of beautiful, fantastic planets. If he's lucky enough to encounter a life-bearing planet, he can experience indescribable delight.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei splits into many smaller consciousnesses, wandering among various planets and appreciating their unique beauty.</p><p></p><p>Two years later, he senses a flash of white light in his peripheral vision before it disappears.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? I don't think I saw it wrong, there was a white flash over there. Could it be an interesting planet? Let me check it out."</p><p></p><p>The planet that briefly flashed white is not far away, just to his left, emanating from an immense blue-green planet.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his consciousness flashes in front of this planet, looking down upon it.</p><p></p><p>Raging dark clouds cover the land, obscuring the surface scenery. He can only vaguely make out continents and oceans from other angles.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei thinks to himself: "This planet is so massive, the chances of life arising are low. And judging from the roiling clouds, the weather seems quite harsh, making life even less likely."</p><p></p><p>However, he won't give up searching this planet based just on his judgement. He still needs to go down to the surface and oceans to investigate.</p><p></p><p>After all, his master often reminds them: "Life can arise even on stars, so anything is possible. Life often emerges in places we least expect." After hearing this for a long time, he has developed the habit of "seeing is believing, imagination is empty."</p><p></p><p>With another thought, Cong Renfei's vision shifts, and he finds himself on the surface of this planet, seeing its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>He can't help but open his mouth wide in disbelief: "This is...a life-bearing planet? No, to be precise, this is a planet with human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, on the surface of this planet, he sees humans wearing clothes.</p><p></p><p>This one fact alone explains a lot.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei instinctively opens his communication log to message his sister: "Sister, it's unbelievable, I've discovered a planet with human civilization. And it seems to be quite advanced."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "??Really or are you kidding me?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Why would I kid you? Just come over and you'll see. I'll send you the location."</p><p></p><p>Her first reaction is disbelief - she can't believe she's lucky enough to stumble upon a planet with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Finding a life-bearing planet in a galaxy is already unlikely, let alone a civilized planet. And the odds of finding a human civilization are astronomically low.</p><p></p><p>Her second thought is to suspect that the life-bearing planets in this galaxy have already joined the Infinite Lands.</p><p></p><p>For planets connected to the Infinite Lands, it's normal to have traces of human presence.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Cong Renfei's location, Cong Shuling's consciousness swiftly shifts, quickly finding this planet.</p><p></p><p>One look and she's stunned too: "It really is a planet with human civilization. From my memory, there shouldn't be this planet in the Infinite Lands we know of. Little Fei, our luck has exploded."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a shattered wasteland, two powerful men are fighting fiercely in mid-air, raining blows on each other's flesh. Their martial arts uniforms are already tattered, hanging in strips from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, their pants remain intact, avoiding an embarrassing scene of their privates flapping about.</p><p></p><p>"Argh! Die, An Mingwang!"</p><p></p><p>A young man with needle-like upswept hair is roaring madly, his fists striking like phantoms at the bald muscular man.</p><p></p><p>His entire muscular body is like forged steel, bulging with sharply defined angles that exude immense power.</p><p></p><p>Each punch he throws at the bald man An Mingwang releases powerful shockwaves that distort the surrounding air.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang--"</p><p></p><p>The dull, intense sounds blend into one, carrying far into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yet no matter how fast and powerful his punches, most are blocked by An Mingwang's arms, with only a few landing on his body and face.</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang is spitting blood, his eyes bulging, with the needle-haired man's fist imprints protruding from his back. But he stubbornly defends against the attacks, as if his flesh body is made of rubber, impervious to damage.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>The needle-haired man lets out a bellow, pulling his fist back to gather power for one punch.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>It slams squarely into An Mingwang's face.</p><p></p><p>An Mingwang is like a cannonball smashing heavily into the pitted ground.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>An explosion-like roar erupts as the ground cracks and shatters in a spreading circle, shrouded in billowing dust like a meteor impact scene.</p><p></p><p>But it's not over. As soon as the needle-haired man's punch sends An Mingwang crashing down, he opens his palms towards the impact area.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish--"</p><p></p><p>A barrage of spherical energy blasts erupts from his hands, raining down madly.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>The entire shattered ground shakes violently as the ferocious energy vents outwards, giving a sense of the heavens collapsing.</p><p></p><p>A strong, short-haired man in martial arts attire exclaims in shock: "Such explosive power, so strong!"</p><p></p><p>Then he clenches his fists tightly, gritting his teeth: "I never expected Lyu Yijiang to grow to this level, while I...while I..."</p><p></p><p>He casually punches a huge boulder into dust: "I will definitely surpass Yijiang, just you wait!"</p><p></p><p>Another shorter, spiky-haired man furrows his brow, staring intently at the distant battlefield: "Did he finish off An Mingwang?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man takes a deep breath to calm down, then shakes his head, focusing on the battlefield: "No, I can still sense that evil, immense 'force' from An Mingwang."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finishes speaking, raucous laughter echoes from afar: "Hahaha! Lyu Yijiang, not bad, not bad! But if you think this is enough to defeat me, you're still far off!"</p><p></p><p>From the smoke, a towering, muscular bald figure gradually appears - it's An Mingwang.</p><p></p><p>He wipes a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth, grinning up at the needle-haired Lyu Yijiang in mid-air: "Why don't you come feel my true power!"</p><p></p><p>He crouches slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>With an explosion, the ground gains another crater.</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's pupils constrict as he instinctively turns and crosses his arms in front of his body.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment An Mingwang's frenzied attacks rain down.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>Now it's Lyu Yijiang being pummeled relentlessly by the bald muscular man, that meaty pounding sound carrying outwards again accompanied by wild roars.</p>

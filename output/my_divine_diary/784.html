        <h1>Chapter 784</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Immortal Emperor looked forward violently, only to see a young white-shirted man standing still in the void, looking at them with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>When the surrounding cultivators saw the Immortal Emperor's expression, they immediately realized that this was the assassin that the Immortal Emperor was talking about, and they looked at Su Hao with grave expressions, and the high-tech magic weapons in their hands were all sacrificed, pointing at Su Hao from afar.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the next moment, all the swords would be fired and zap Su Hao into a scarecrow.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor raised his hand to stop it and said gruffly, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "My name is Xu Shiqiang."</p><p></p><p>The crowd of people first froze.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Xu Shiqiang???"</p><p></p><p>At first, the crowd didn't react, searching their brains carefully to find out which character 'Xu Shiqiang' was, who was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no such figure among the famous experts in recent years.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, they suddenly came back to their senses.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Xu Shiqiang the head of the Three Holy Gods of Humanity?</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at his appearance, and damn, it was exactly the same!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the expressions of the crowd became unusually ugly, their faces gradually flaring red as if they had eaten chili peppers in a rage.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor's face twisted up, ''Arrogant! Where did you get the courage to call yourself Xu Shiqiang? Thinking that if you have some strength and change your face to look like the Holy Xu Shiqiang, you can call yourself holy at will?</p><p></p><p>He reached out and beckoned, a stream of light shot out from the debris below and stopped in front of him, revealing a golden longsword that was magnificent and unusual.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of spiritual energy was injected into the long sword, and the long sword blazed with light.</p><p></p><p>Then it pointed towards Su Hao remotely.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>The golden light longsword suddenly disappeared, and when it reappeared, it still pierced through Su Hao's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Shot!" The Immortal Emperor's face remained unchanged, wanting to take this opportunity to zap back and forth a few more times, this time aiming for the head.</p><p></p><p>He lightly lifted his finger, and the golden light longsword once again abruptly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>A crunching sound spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fixed their eyes to see a scene that made their eyes roll.</p><p></p><p>The person in front, who called himself Xu Shiqiang, had actually held the 'Immortal Emperor Sword', which was regarded as the strongest magic weapon, the symbolic token of power in the Immortal Cultivation Holy Land, in one hand.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Soon he had a judgment, ''The magic weapon is still under my spiritual control, it's just been imprisoned by an overwhelming force, even if I push it with all my might, I can't make the Immortal Emperor Sword move a single bit. How can this ...... this be so!"</p><p></p><p>It was also this judgment that made it difficult for the Immortal Emperor to believe that this was true.</p><p></p><p>That shameful assassin who didn't know the heights of heaven and earth, at this moment, was even recklessly observing and fiddling with his Immortal Emperor Sword, and the other party could be heard 'tsk tsk tsk' praising that the sword wasn't bad, it was innovative!</p><p></p><p>He changed the spells in his hands and activated a special technique carried within the Immortal Emperor Sword.</p><p></p><p>'Chaotic God'!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Sword erupted with a strange fluctuation that swept out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised, ''Huh~ Doesn't it have the same effect as my 'Confusion God Formation'? If my [Eight-Handed God] doppelganger was still using a polymerization-type brain, it might have already been struck. However, I am now using a decentralized bone layer plexus system, and the Mystic God Formation already doesn't have an effect on me."</p><p></p><p>"Ah~"</p><p></p><p>A scream came from the front as the Palace Guard cultivators around the Immortal Emperor lost their balance and fell from the sky like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was speechless, "Looking at the spells inscribed on this sword enemy and self na!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, only the Immortal Emperor was still floating in the air, and he stared at Su Hao with a fierce face, not understanding why Su Hao was still able to float up after being attacked by the 'Chaotic God'.</p><p></p><p>And a one meter diameter white energy bullet in his hand was ready.</p><p></p><p>'Daylight'!</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were instantly dyed white, and many of the palaces in the Yonghua Palace collapsed and shattered into mincemeat.</p><p></p><p>Such power made people subconsciously think of the huge energy main cannons on battleships.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was much more powerful than the main cannon.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long it took for the explosion to subside, and the tourists who came to visit the Immortal Cultivation Holy Land, looking distantly in the direction of the explosion, uncontrollably marveled in their hearts, "Is this the power of the Immortals? Too strong!"</p><p></p><p>The palace guard cultivators quickly recovered from the 'chaotic spirit' and flew into the sky, coming around the Immortal Emperor to protect him.</p><p></p><p>"Finished?"</p><p></p><p>"Being attacked by the 'God of Chaos' as well as bombarded with such a powerful might, it's bound to be finished off."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can save themselves in such an outburst are no more than a dozen in the universe."</p><p></p><p>"Do not be careless, I can sense that the assassin this time, is unusual."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, without some level of skill, who would dare to impersonate Holy Xu Shiqiang?"</p><p></p><p>"I hate people who make fun of Sacred Xu Shiqiang the most, they don't respect mankind's greatest founder at all, kill every one they see in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, how many young people nowadays know the greatness of Holy Xu Shiqiang? Each and every one of them always thinks that they can be compared to the Holy Spirit. That face is simply disgusting."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor frowned tightly without the slightest carelessness as his spiritual power swept through in detail, trying to find the assassin's figure.</p><p></p><p>Because, he sensed that his magic weapon, the Immortal Emperor Sword, was still imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>He secretly said, ''Did the attack just now not finish him off? Sure enough, he has two skills!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a light-hearted voice suddenly came from beside him, "Alright! It doesn't matter if you don't believe I'm Xu Shiqiang, I just want to find you to ask something, but don't break this good palace."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor was creeped out, wanting to mobilize the spiritual energy in his body to fight back, he found that the spiritual energy of his whole body, has been controlled to death, not subject to his control in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head to look, he only saw that white-shirted youth, who was on his right side, stretching out a finger to gently point at his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor was unusually shocked in his heart, "I just lost on a finger!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Let's talk somewhere else!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the Immortal Emperor instantly disappeared in place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the flying swords and various spells that the palace guard cultivators shot at Su Hao also fell short.</p><p></p><p>"Where is everyone?"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Emperor was taken captive?"</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the ability to move instantly, the Immortal Emperor was moved away! What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Go after it, of course!"</p><p></p><p>"Where to chase?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the Immortal Emperor is dead, how about we start picking the fifth generation Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>This game, which was not considered a battle in Su Hao's eyes, was a shocking battle in the eyes of the others.</p><p></p><p>The scene, which was simply a volley of mountains and the sun and moon, shocked the souls of all the spectators.</p><p></p><p>The tourists who came here to travel, once they saw that there is no danger, they have run out from the hiding place, exclaiming that they are too much fun, and the ones who reacted slowly realized that they have to take pictures to send out the circle to cheat the praise ......</p><p></p><p>Overall, this trip to the tour, this ticket money spent is really worth it.</p><p></p><p>Some people even ask: Is this a play that is arranged in advance by the Immortal Cultivation Sanctuary to surprise people?</p><p></p><p>She was the Yue Xiaodan who had previously salivated over Su Hao's beauty at the gate of Yonghua Palace and had come up to accost her.</p><p></p><p>Yue Xiaodan pointed at Su Hao, her open mouth wanted to speak several times, but couldn't say a word: "This ...... that ...... Jia Wei ...... "</p><p></p><p>But the heart has long been churning and boiling: "Just now that guy is Jia Wei, right? It must be Javi, my eyes are sharp, it's impossible to see wrong!</p><p></p><p>Isn't the one who fought with Jia Wei the Netflix Immortal Emperor? Those around are the Immortal Emperor's escorting Palace Guard cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Jia Wei fought with the Immortal Emperor? How is this possible, didn't Jia Wei say he was coming to worship the Immortal Emperor? If he fought like this, who would be willing to take him as a disciple?</p><p></p><p>Jia Wei is a liar and still says he's worshipping a master ......"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Yue Xiaodan's brain was like being hit hard by a sledgehammer.</p><p></p><p>"Bang-"</p><p></p><p>Uncontrollably, her brain frantically popped up a thought, "Jia Wei, could it be Jia Wei, could it really be ...... Holy Xu Shiqiang?"</p><p></p><p>The more she thought about it, the more she thought it was possible, and the more she thought about it, the more she thought it was impossible ......</p><p></p><p>A character from over six thousand years ago appearing in front of her?</p><p></p><p>She reached out and grabbed her head helplessly, almost messing up the little fairy's hairstyle, "Someone please tell me what the hell is going on!"</p><p></p><p>In the small world, Su Hao said, "So, are you calmer now?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor couldn't move no matter how much he tried, and even his spiritual energy, which used to do whatever he wanted, was no longer under his control.</p><p></p><p>A moment later he finally calmed down and stopped making unnecessary attempts, frowning as he asked, "Who the hell are you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao faintly said, "Xu Shiqiang."</p>

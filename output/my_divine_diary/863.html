        <h1>Chapter 863</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This was a cluster of pure soul force without any accompanying will. Suhao had been waiting for it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew that one day he would find this special kind of soul force, when he actually obtained it, he still couldn't help but feel excited. His entire body's scales relaxed, as if a cool breeze passed through from inside, making him feel extraordinarily refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had studied soul force for a long time and was extremely familiar with all the different ways to utilize it.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the soul force was born, he had a feeling that he could control this newborn pure soul force without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not rush to terminate this experimental process. Let this cluster of pure soul force continue generating. The more the better. What I need to do now is create the second and third small worlds and repeat this process. If I can still successfully obtain pure soul force, then it means my experiment has succeeded."</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Suhao split off a small part of himself and set up two more small worlds exactly the same as before, simulating the red giant star environment, and repeated the previous process.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Suhao obtained the second and third clusters of pure soul force.</p><p></p><p>Under his precise operation, one success could be a coincidence, but two or three successes were inevitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Only after obtaining three clusters of pure soul force did Suhao finally feel completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>In other words, no matter what situation he encountered in the future, as long as his basic abilities remained, he could obtain this special substance of soul force at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll start reducing the conditions one by one, eliminating all the unnecessary ones. What's left will be the necessary conditions for generating soul force. Then I'll try to combine and simplify these conditions."</p><p></p><p>Suhao believed the conditions for generating soul force were stringent but not too complicated. The conditions added for experimentation in the small worlds could probably be streamlined by more than half.</p><p></p><p>Once the technique matured, he could even complete the "palm soul force generation" operation.</p><p></p><p>A year later, Suhao successfully streamlined and combined the conditions for generating soul force to the extreme, completing the micro-operation for soul force generation.</p><p></p><p>He simply opened his palm, and a small world refracting light appeared, quickly filling with a crimson red color. In just a moment, it turned into a sphere radiating multicolored light.</p><p></p><p>This was the pure soul force Suhao obtained through his streamlined method.</p><p></p><p>"Generating soul force is simpler than I imagined, with the required conditions reduced by almost ninety percent."</p><p></p><p>However, it's not like he could have supplemented all these conditions through slow exploration alone.</p><p></p><p>The red giant stars capable of generating soul force were one in a thousand.</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked at the color-changing soul force and unconsciously revealed a faint smile: "I'm only one step away from the so-called eternal life."</p><p></p><p>After storing this cluster of pure soul force, he sent a message to Fengcheng: "Fengcheng, where are those spirited young men from before? Bring them to my lab, I have an experiment that needs them."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was stunned, then reacted: "You mean my 'Starry Sky Exploration Team', Great Deity? Haha, they've been clamoring to continue experimenting with you for a while. They tasted sweetness in the last experiment and have become full of vigor."</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Fengcheng said, "Please wait a moment, Great Deity. I'll mark them with the Twin Swords Seal first and teleport them directly outside your lab."</p><p></p><p>Suhao suddenly thought, "Perhaps I can open up a task assignment function for Yashan and Fengcheng to help them manage their subordinates more conveniently. But this involves using the Pinball Space, so I need to be cautious. I'll consider it after successfully integrating my consciousness into the 'Soul Brain'."</p><p></p><p>Suhao called the brain made from combining soul force and spiritual power the "Soul Brain". The manufacturing method was simple - just use the deities' techniques to condense pure soul force into a "soul seed" and plant it in the brain. The soul force and spiritual brain would then fuse naturally into a new Soul Brain.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fengcheng brought his "Starry Sky Exploration Team" to Suhao's lab.</p><p></p><p>The spirited young men from over ten years ago had become a bit greasy now. A large group of them barged in, all with excited looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>For these spirited young men, "doing experiments" wasn't really doing experiments, but enhancing their strength.</p><p></p><p>In previous experiments, they discovered that by cooperating to complete the deities' experiments, they could truly gain increases in power. The advertisements Mr. Jia Fengcheng had put out before were real and didn't deceive them.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "Young men, it's been over ten years but your spirits are still high! For the first phase, I need twenty young men to assist my experiment. Who wants to go first?"</p><p></p><p>These members of the "Starry Sky Exploration Team" had never been contaminated by the deities' soul force before, making them perfect for experiments with pure soul force.</p><p></p><p>As for those spirit cultivators who already had the deities' soul force seeds planted in their minds, they were no more valuable to Suhao now than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The spirited young men eagerly raised their hands upon hearing, shouting "Me me me!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao randomly picked twenty of them and led them into the lab.</p><p></p><p>Under the expectant gazes of the twenty spirited young men, Suhao took out twenty clusters of pure soul force, condensed them into soul seeds, and planted them in their brains. He then transmitted a cultivation manual called the "Soul Cultivation Record" and told them, "Cultivate according to this Soul Cultivation Record, gradually adapt to the power of the soul sea, and assimilate it completely."</p><p></p><p>Someone flipped through the Soul Cultivation Record and curiously asked, "Great Deity, what level can one reach by cultivating to the end of the Soul Cultivation Record?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed lightly, "I don't know, probably becoming a 'Yuanshen' and having your soul roam the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"The soul roaming?"</p><p>"Yuanshen roaming the heavens and earth?"</p><p>"That's too powerful! The Soul Cultivation Record is invincible."</p><p></p><p>Suhao first explained the key points of the Soul Cultivation Record to accelerate their cultivation progress, then let them begin cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, based on the first batch of experimental subjects' cultivation, Suhao revised the Soul Cultivation Record and fine-tuned the structure of the "soul seeds". He then found a second batch of experimental subjects and began the second phase of experiments.</p><p></p><p>Another half year later, he continued making adjustments based on deficiencies and began the third phase of experiments.</p><p></p><p>He proceeded like this, making micro-adjustments and revisions every half year while observing the changes in the experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>"Their vitality has become more vigorous. At the same time, their learning ability, thinking ability, spiritual power, memory and other areas have all been comprehensively enhanced. They have also mastered the special power of soul force and can be considered superhuman. However, there are corresponding defects. These young men implanted with pure soul force have inherited the shared flaw of the deities - if they lack sufficient stimulating information, their thinking will gradually become sluggish."</p><p></p><p>In other words, if Suhao also used soul force to package his consciousness, he would carry this flaw as well, which was unacceptable to him.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>The reason for this sluggish thinking phenomenon was, as Suhao discovered through research, a kind of inertia unique to soul force lifeforms, similar to how humans tend to procrastinate...</p><p></p><p>And "abundant information" could eliminate the inertia of soul force.</p><p></p><p>But who could guarantee there would always be enough rich information to maintain the vitality of soul force? Not everyone was like those deities who were a bunch of gaming addicts.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, those with soul force wouldn't notice their own thinking problems.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't want to have such a fatal weakness that would make him constantly worried.</p><p></p><p>"Information..."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, his gaze fell on the Soul Cultivation Record, and he thought inwardly, "Perhaps I can change the way soul force obtains information, allowing it to acquire information on its own and achieve dynamic balance through self-sufficiency."</p><p></p><p>The universe was filled with endless information everywhere. As long as he could flexibly convert it into special symbolic patterns, soul force could obtain enough "abundant information" without human intervention.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Pinball Space and simulated the state of the soul force implanted in the experimental subjects' brains, beginning to design a soul force structure capable of independently acquiring sufficient information.</p><p></p><p>"I can divide the soul force into inner and outer layers, with the outer layer dedicated to receiving all kinds of signals and converting them into rich information..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Suhao unconsciously froze, then muttered, "I finally understand why the Baigar's physical structure takes the form of a 'core + radiating ten-colored plates' - the inner core carries the main will, while the outer ten-colored plates are used to acquire information. The solution I want is actually what the Baigar have already presented on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they are the crystallization of nature. Most lifeforms I can see are probably the most perfect structures for their corresponding environments."</p><p></p><p>The innate flaw of the Baigar could provide the answer.</p><p></p><p>This was the wonder of nature.</p><p></p><p>As for why the Baigar ended up looking like this, with their thinking slowed down a thousandfold, that was another matter.</p>

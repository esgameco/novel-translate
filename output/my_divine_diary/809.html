        <h1>Chapter 809</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao came out, he observed the humans in the small world from the outside. Seeing that they had finished eating and regained some energy, he flashed back inside and appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao entered, it seemed that everyone had reached a consensus. They immediately knelt down and exclaimed, "We pay respects to the great divine majesty. May we know your title?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said in an awkward language, "Stand up and speak. You can call me Jiawei."</p><p></p><p>Jiawei?</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo and others looked at each other in confusion, as if they had never heard of such a divine name.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "I have some questions, and you only need to answer truthfully. If I am satisfied and you cooperate with me on some experiments, it is possible to let you leave."</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo immediately said, "Our knowledge is limited, but as long as the great divine asks, we dare not hide anything we know."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded and asked the first question, "The power you possess is called soul force?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo was startled. Why would the divine ask such a question?</p><p></p><p>But he did not dare think too much about it and answered honestly, "That's right, the power we possess is called soul force."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Then how do you obtain soul force?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo suppressed the strangeness in his heart and explained according to his understanding, "The power we possess comes from the bestowal of the great divine."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao became interested, "Oh, the bestowal of the divine? Isn't it cultivated through your own practice?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo could not help but exchange a glance with the middle-aged pale man Geya beside him, seeing the same confusion in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xibo thought, "Perhaps the divine is testing our knowledge? But judging from the young dragon Jiawei's appearance, he seems to truly not know these common senses, unlike a test..."</p><p></p><p>Xibo took a deep breath and quickly organized his words, "Indeed, we become stronger through our own cultivation, but there is a prerequisite: believing in the divine, joining the divine sect, and obtaining the 'soul seed' bestowed by the divine. Only then can we cultivate soul force with the soul seed as the core and gain tremendous power."</p><p></p><p>This was something Su Hao had not expected. He thought the people of this world were born with a talent to cultivate soul force and then obtained soul force through the "awakening ritual" mentioned by Shaduo's mother. He did not expect it to be like this.</p><p></p><p>The "awakening ritual" mentioned by Shaduo's mother might refer to returning to Dragon Shore and obtaining an extraordinary power through the "divine" of the dragon race by being bestowed a soul seed.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, humans are not born with soul force but need to have a soul seed planted externally by the human divine to master soul force.</p><p></p><p>So the question is, what is a soul seed, and what is the divine?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought, "I'm so curious. I feel this world is different. I can't wait to recover my power and understand everything. Heh, I wonder if the 'divine' of this world possesses power as strong as mine and is also a group of explorers of the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao showed a satisfied smile and said to the big-bearded Xibo, "You answered well. Please continue to explain in detail about the divines of this world, how to obtain soul seeds, how to cultivate, and what kind of power soul force possesses. Tell me everything you know about soul force!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the others, "All of you can supplement with what you know. Don't rush, we have plenty of time."</p><p></p><p>Xibo was a bit confused and asked carefully, "Respected divine majesty, where should I start?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Start with the divines of this world. Who are these so-called divines?"</p><p></p><p>To talk about other divines in front of a divine? No, perhaps one of the divines he would mention was this young dragon in front of him...</p><p></p><p>Xibo's heart couldn't help but feel flustered. He hoped he wouldn't say anything wrong.</p><p></p><p>He calmed himself and began, "Before the beginning of heaven and earth, before the stars were set, the divines already existed. It was the great divines who created this land and this world. Ah! I praise the great divines for bestowing us with life, land, and power..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately interrupted him, "Stop, stop, stop. What are you talking about? I don't want to know those things. Tell me directly who the divines are, what abilities they possess, and how they planted the soul seeds in you."</p><p></p><p>Xibo felt a chill down his spine. He thought the divine would like to hear such things. It turned out not to be the case. Then were the prayers they made in front of the divine statues not heard by the divines at all?</p><p></p><p>"Under the six main divines, there are twelve deputy divines. They are... And the divine we 'Dragon Thieves' believe in is the 'Golden Divine Bali', who values wealth and fair trade. The 'Golden Divine Bali' is a deputy divine under the 'Eternal Night Divine'."</p><p></p><p>After briefly introducing all the divines, Xibo recounted some of the divines' deeds and continued, "It is said that a long time ago, the divines fought each other on this land for territory and faith. Finally, they reached a consensus, divided the territories, and the wars between the divines gradually disappeared. This land also regained peace, but there were still occasional conflicts between the deputy divines.</p><p></p><p>Especially among the sects founded by the divines, conflicts were most intense, with countless large and small sect wars..."</p><p></p><p>After understanding the situation, Su Hao directly asked, "Then how does one become a divine? For example, if you keep cultivating and becoming stronger, can you become a new divine?"</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded Xibo shuddered in shock.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an immortal divine? This was something he dared not even think about!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "If you cultivate soul force to an extremely powerful level, even stronger than the 'Golden Divine Bali', can you not become a divine?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo opened his mouth but could not speak. "This... This is impossible! Mortals cannot be stronger than divines. For thousands of years, no mortal has become a new divine."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao realized that perhaps the so-called divines had mastered some core technology and tacitly blocked all paths for mortals to ascend.</p><p></p><p>And this core technology might not be knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked again, "Are these soul techniques you use taught by the divines or self-comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo said, "Most soul techniques are learned from the sects. Of course, there are also talented soul warriors who have flashes of inspiration and create their own powerful soul techniques with soul force. But it is very difficult, and ordinary soul warriors use the sect's soul techniques more often."</p><p></p><p>At this point, he could not help but show off his talent in front of this "divine", "Even as a mere fourth-level soul warrior, I am one of those with some talent. I created my own powerful soul technique 'Flash'! This series of soul techniques allows me to easily defeat soul mages of the same level. You should know that at the same level, soul mages can crush soul warriors."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at Weiya and asked, "Is she a soul mage? What is the difference between soul warriors and soul mages?"</p><p></p><p>Xibo said, "Heh, under the divine sects, there are two different professions: soul warriors and soul mages. Different people have different talent inclinations. Most people only have the talent to become soul warriors, mainly tempering their physical bodies, mastering soul techniques, and engaging in close-quarters combat with weapons. A small number of people have the talent of soul mages, tempering their willpower and practicing soul spells..."</p><p></p><p>"Weiya is one of those lucky ones with the talent of a soul mage and became a powerful soul mage."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, she is also a fourth-level soul mage, but she can't beat me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Weiya was full of black lines, obviously not agreeing with what the big-bearded Xibo said. If Su Hao were not present, she would have to take out her weapon and have a duel with the big beard.</p>

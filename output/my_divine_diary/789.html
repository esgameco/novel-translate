        <h1>Chapter 789</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the ball space, Su Hao watched as if watching a movie, observing Niu Yingzi gradually adapting to the illusory world he created, being guided onto an extraordinary path.</p><p></p><p>Everything was proceeding according to the script he had envisioned, and he couldn't help but reveal a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>At this pace of development, in twenty years, the performance of the spiritual power brain and whether it could develop multi-dimensional spiritual power would become roughly apparent.</p><p></p><p>"Then, taking advantage of this idle time, redesign a new spiritual power brain using the advanced version of spiritual power called 'ling'. A brain made with 'ling' will surely be even more powerful."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao no longer focused on Niu Yingzi's development, but instead opened up an experimental platform and began trying to design and build a new spiritual power brain.</p><p></p><p>As for Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, Su Hao gave them a vacation.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to have the two enter Niu Yingzi's illusory world to monitor him, randomly responding and patching any loopholes that appeared.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that they had been working for him for thousands of years, he should give them some vacation time...</p><p></p><p>So he told them to take a hundred years off, to play around as they wished, and to come back whenever they felt refreshed.</p><p></p><p>As for the loophole issue, he would implant the 'suggestion' skill of ignoring loopholes into the black room, so that he could later guide Niu Yingzi to ignore any loopholes.</p><p></p><p>Ten years passed in the blink of an eye, and the illusory world's Niu Yingzi had already become a somewhat famous magician in the jianghu, with magical skills so masterful they were bewitching. Among peers, he was unmatched, and could even challenge higher levels.</p><p></p><p>He was considered a super new star in the magic world, with many forces openly and secretly trying all means to recruit him. Some major forces that failed to recruit him even secretly sent higher-level assassins to kill this ungrateful Niu Yingzi prematurely. However, for some inexplicable reason, their flawless ambushes repeatedly failed due to various minor incidents.</p><p></p><p>And after defeating the enemies, Niu Yingzi would always manage to foil the evil schemes of the major villains.</p><p></p><p>This gradually gave Niu Yingzi an immense reputation across the continent, with everyone calling him "Lord Niu" upon seeing him.</p><p></p><p>However, Niu Yingzi did not become arrogant because of this, as he found this world to be a bit strange...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite put his finger on how it was strange. He had clearly seen strange things before, but whenever he turned his head to ponder what exactly was odd, he found he could no longer recall what he had just seen...</p><p></p><p>That itself was strange.</p><p></p><p>And the mere fact that he could sense something was strange was itself an oddity. At least in his previous life, he had never had such a feeling.</p><p></p><p>Why was this the case?</p><p></p><p>"The Wind Thunder Manor was recently exposed for buying and selling young girls into prostitution. Tonight I will go investigate. If the situation is true, I, Niu Yingzi, who despises such heinous scum more than anything in this life, will exterminate them all..."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he thought of his younger sister from his previous life, and felt a pang of melancholy. If that incident had not happened, how wonderful that would have been!</p><p></p><p>She would be eighteen years old now, sweet, lovely, charming and full of youthful vigor...</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi knew Ahua liked him, but he only saw Ahua as his younger sister!</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi thought to himself: "After dealing with the Wind Thunder Manor, I'll go back and see Ahua, lest someone snatches her away."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao took a break to observe Niu Yingzi, he found that Niu Yingzi had already sensed something amiss about the illusory world.</p><p></p><p>He thought: "Indeed, no matter how immense the computing power of a virtual world, in the face of the complex human mind, it is bound to exhibit glitches and appear unnatural. Were it not for the black room's suggestion function, the illusion would have been exposed by now, making it impossible to continue the experiment. Or perhaps the illusion has already been exposed, but was forcibly patched by the suggestion function.</p><p></p><p>However, overall, it does not affect my testing of the spiritual power brain, as long as the intended result is achieved. The process is unimportant.</p><p></p><p>As for the performance of the spiritual power brain..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because the spiritual power brain's learning and imagination abilities were extremely powerful, but its multi-dimensional spiritual power was extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>Even with Su Hao giving Niu Yingzi cheat codes, Niu Yingzi's cultivation of spiritual power was still painstakingly slow.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary fool would not be at such a low level.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the spiritual power brain may be too weak in terms of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Does enhancing the spiritual power brain's learning and thinking abilities come at the cost of weakening its spiritual power? Why is this so..."</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out for the time being, Su Hao was not in a rush either, believing he would eventually solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry, let's wait another ten years for him to grow further and see the results before deciding. My new 'ling brain' has been successfully designed and produced. Next, I'll test whether it can properly run consciousness."</p><p></p><p>He implanted the new 'ling brain' into a body, bridging all the nerves.</p><p></p><p>After testing confirmed the bridging was exceptionally good, he randomly selected a consciousness information from the ball space and imported it into the newly produced 'ling brain'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under Su Hao's observation, the consciousness information showed signs of activity.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Ha! A success on the first try, as expected of me."</p><p></p><p>After waiting a moment, the body with the 'ling brain' opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's perspective, those eyes were filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "This is normal as the consciousness is gradually reviving. Other consciousness revivals were like this too."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the person seemed to regain some sense and slowly crawled off the experimental platform.</p><p></p><p>Moving clumsily, as if not yet accustomed to the new body.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "It should be fine, just needs some time to adapt."</p><p></p><p>After being dazed for about two minutes, the experimental subject began looking around the environment, finally noticing Su Hao standing nearby.</p><p></p><p>The subject suddenly smiled at him: "Heh heh heh!"</p><p></p><p>His mouth slightly open, a trail of drool flowing from the corner as he had a happy yet vacant expression...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao cursed inwardly: "Damn it, a perfectly fine person has become an idiot!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this 'ling brain' still has some minor issues. Let me check it over...theoretically, this should not happen. But in practice, 'theoretically' is unreliable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another ten years passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao successfully produced a 'ling brain' meeting standards, which would not turn the consciousness implanted into an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, its overall performance was far superior to the 'spiritual power brain'.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, he had freed up time to observe Niu Yingzi's development in the illusory world.</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi was already killing indiscriminately in the illusory world, enjoying an immense status in the jianghu, known as 'Lord Niu'. Beautiful women threw themselves at him, and he was living it up.</p><p></p><p>He had even forgotten about previously sensing that this world was strange.</p><p></p><p>To him, so what if it was strange? Life had to go on, and living each day well was an embrace of life itself.</p><p></p><p>He was already a dead man reborn. Simply being alive in this world was the greatest fortune - each extra day lived was a bonus.</p><p></p><p>His only regret was that this body's aptitude was too poor. No matter how hard he tried, he could not learn the higher-level 'Sacred Realm magic'.</p><p></p><p>According to his master, his spiritual power was too weak, and he needed to temper his willpower to increase his spiritual power before having a chance to learn higher-level Sacred Realm magic.</p><p></p><p>But after years of tempering, his spiritual power had made zero progress, draining his willpower.</p><p></p><p>He fully understood what the word 'aptitude' meant in this supernatural world.</p><p></p><p>Some things simply could not be overcome by 'effort' alone.</p><p></p><p>To break through the limits of aptitude, one needed to perceive its essence, and then find a way to change it.</p><p></p><p>But could he do that?</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi shook his head: "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>It was better to take care of his children and enjoy life with his wives every day.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, Sacred Realm mages were not his match.</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi felt regretful yet extremely proud: "I fear nothing."</p><p></p><p>After observing Niu Yingzi's experiences in the ball space, Su Hao's brow furrowed slightly: "So the spiritual power brain really cannot produce multi-dimensional spiritual power? What is the difference between it and the neural brain?"</p><p></p><p>Through this experiment, Su Hao confirmed one thing - that the spiritual power brain was definitely lacking some very critical element compared to the neural brain.</p><p></p><p>"But what could it be?"</p><p></p><p>He pulled up both for careful comparison, but could not find any clues.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Hao quickly had a new plan: "I'll find an opportunity to have Niu Yingzi die in battle, then replace him with the newly produced 'ling brain' and have him try again in a new illusory world. Perhaps the new 'ling brain' can solve the spiritual power issue."</p>

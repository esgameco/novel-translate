        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>One month later, Suhao successively evolved Yashan and Fengcheng into "Prophet Humans", greatly enhancing their mental capabilities.</p><p></p><p>The two were so excited that they cried tears of joy. If they were not of the same gender, they would have hugged each other in elation.</p><p></p><p>During this period, their dull thinking and bizarre language had tormented them to the point of not wanting to live.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had evolved into "Prophet Humans", the shackles restraining their thoughts were finally unlocked.</p><p></p><p>Their minds and consciousness had finally gained freedom.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng said: "Master Wei, not having enough brainpower is truly one of the greatest terrors in the world. I never want to be dumb again!"</p><p></p><p>Only those who have experienced memorizing words, forgetting them, re-memorizing, and re-forgetting can understand that despair!</p><p></p><p>Next, Fengcheng was responsible for taking care of the base and various spiritual herbs, while Yashan was taken by Suhao to the Changqing Factory to introduce him to Old Ying!</p><p></p><p>Old Ying took one look and thought, who are you kidding! Just finding some teenager who speaks incoherently and claiming he's a mechanical design master?</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't care how to explain the situation later. After bringing Yashan there, he left on his own, believing Yashan could handle such a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Facing a middle-aged Old Hu and an elderly Old Ying, Yashan couldn't get a word out for a long time. Finally, he stuttered in self-introduction: "You...you all...hello! I..."</p><p></p><p>Old Ying was furious...</p><p></p><p>That little brother Zihao was so bad, actually bringing an idiot to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, the assembly line machinery was finally completed. Yashan and Fengcheng, the two "Life Seeds", personally carried each piece back to the base.</p><p></p><p>Yashan also proved with his ability that he was not only not an idiot, but an absolute genius in various senses. In just half a year, he had all the technicians at Changqing Factory obediently calling this young lad "Brother Shan"!</p><p></p><p>Even the factory director, who was said to have connections, called Yashan "Brother Shan" when facing him, just like everyone else in the factory!</p><p></p><p>Solving various mechanical problems the factory couldn't was secondary. Most crucially, a small car independently designed and produced by their factory sold like hotcakes in major cities!</p><p></p><p>Limited by production capacity, orders were now backed up for three years...</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Yashan like their own brother. In the end, Suhao didn't even ask for the promised one million material fee.</p><p></p><p>Just kidding, who needs money now? They want to give money instead.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the director awarded Yashan the title of "Permanent Honorary Senior Research Expert" at Changqing Factory. Even if he did nothing, he would receive an annual salary of five million - something unimaginable to everyone, but the director's move showed great vision.</p><p></p><p>Changqing Factory then invested heavily to expand the plant and increase production capacity!</p><p></p><p>When the assembly line customized by Yashan was completed and tested successfully, Yashan said he would temporarily leave.</p><p></p><p>During the farewell, the director grasped Yashan's hand, squeezing out two reluctant tears.</p><p></p><p>He truly didn't want to let go. Was he seeing off a technician? No! He was seeing off piles of money!</p><p></p><p>Ever since the factory's profits soared, his status was unparalleled. Even the mayor of Huchang City personally hosted a banquet, seeking a specially made Changqing compact car.</p><p></p><p>What was this? Face!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Brother Shan promised to help resolve any issues.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yashan had no particular interest in being the "brother" of Changqing Factory. In his view, things like Changqing Factory were still too low-level. He had developed a keen interest in "origins" and was waiting for Master Wei to assign him specific research tasks.</p><p></p><p>Now that the assembly line was installed, it immediately started operating, attempting to produce the first batch of spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>After a period of adjustment, it was a success!</p><p></p><p>This ushered in a stage of rapid development in the trio's absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, all three had practiced to the Golden Core realm and were not far from the next Yuanying realm!</p><p></p><p>That day, Suhao received a note left by Axing at his doorstep - the second bizarre disaster mission had arrived!</p><p></p><p>After rushing for two days, they arrived at a place called Huoling Town. What was bizarre was that the entire small town was deserted, with no townspeople in sight, only those who had come to participate in the mission.</p><p></p><p>The trio didn't understand the reason but had solemn expressions as they headed straight for the Association's main hall.</p><p></p><p>They quickly gathered information about this bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>"This bizarre disaster is called an 'infectious disease'?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked at the mission details in his hand, finding it different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Axing frowned: "It's not a typical bizarre disaster. Strictly speaking, it should be considered a fantasy-type origin beast disaster. However, this origin beast is a very special bizarre origin beast with effects similar to a bizarre disaster."</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence description, this origin beast resembles a giant boar. Apart from its massive size, there is nothing special about its appearance. However, anyone within three thousand meters of this giant boar goes insane! Those who go insane behave like pigs, lying on the ground and using their mouths to dig in the mud, searching for food...</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, these insane people are imbued with a bizarre effect. Anyone within one thousand meters of them also goes insane, like an infectious disease!"</p><p></p><p>Awang said, "You mean this bizarre disaster doesn't pose a life-threatening danger?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "Indeed, but acting like a pig lying on the ground digging mud is even harder to accept than death. Moreover, until now, none of those infected have recovered. Perhaps only by killing that fantasy-type origin beast can those driven insane recover.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe they'll never recover!"</p><p></p><p>This bizarre disaster was more terrifying than imagined.</p><p></p><p>If such bizarreness spread among humans, Suhao's mind conjured up the zombie movies he had seen long ago!</p><p></p><p>Apparently, one didn't even need to approach the giant boar. Just entering within one thousand meters of a second-generation infected human would naturally cause insanity in a short while.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to kill that giant boar, but they couldn't even get close, let alone kill it. Moreover, the giant boar seemed quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>Axing let out a long sigh: "Now this bizarre infectious disease has spread. No one knows where the giant boar is. The entire area south of Huoling Town has become a restricted zone, but no one knows how far the affected area extends. Surrounding people evacuated after learning about it!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao frowned: "Can't they use aircraft to search from above?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said: "They've probably tried, but Huoling Town is surrounded by dense jungles. Once the boar dives in, it's impossible to find its location. Even the strongest perception-type origin masters can't sense anything beyond three thousand meters! And they can't get too close..."</p><p></p><p>Even if they found it, three thousand meters was too far to kill it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao really wanted to ask if this world had guided missiles...</p><p>Most likely not.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Axing spread his hands: "To be honest, I'm at a loss too!"</p><p></p><p>Awang interjected: "Can't Ayang sense origin beasts up to ten thousand meters away?"</p><p></p><p>Axing's eyes lit up: "That's right! Ayang, can you sense where that origin beast is?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "I should be able to! Moreover, my 'Pinpoint Detonation' can hit targets thousands of meters away, so killing it is no big deal for me."</p><p></p><p>Axing immediately said: "Then what are we waiting for? Let's do it!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head: "No rush, let me make some preparations. I need to run some experiments!"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang said in unison: "Here we go again!"</p>

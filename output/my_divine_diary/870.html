        <h1>Chapter 870</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For the deities, there were not many things they cared about. They didn't even care much about what the world had become.</p><p></p><p>What they cared about was their own lives, gaining freedom, and having infinite games to play.</p><p></p><p>However, they realized that all three things they cared about were under Su Hao's control.</p><p></p><p>But this mission allowed the deities to see some different information.</p><p></p><p>One was that their lives were now guaranteed. After all, to remake the world, at least during the remaking process, they didn't need to worry about Lord Lei'an turning against them and destroying them directly.</p><p></p><p>The other was freedom.</p><p></p><p>They caught a whiff of freedom. Going to the Crucis system to remake the world, didn't that mean they could return to the Crucis system?</p><p></p><p>What the deities didn't expect was that the Golden God Barry directly asked the mysterious Lord Lei'an: "Lord Lei'an, does this mean we can return to the Crucis system and gain freedom?"</p><p></p><p>The 'heart' hidden somewhere twitched violently, cursing Barry as a fool for just asking Lord Lei'an directly, while also nervously observing Su Hao's expression, hoping to see the message 'you are free' on his face.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled.</p><p></p><p>The deities heaved a sigh of relief, a surge of wild joy enveloping them, making the Ten-Color Board flicker incessantly: Lord Lei'an smiled, there's a chance, there's a chance!</p><p></p><p>The deities instantly understood, then fell silent: "......"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Su Hao said, he had never stopped them from leaving...</p><p></p><p>The key was, they didn't have spatial abilities, so they couldn't get out.</p><p></p><p>The deities complained: "How is this different from being confined?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao answered, the deities already knew the answer, so they didn't mention it again. Of course, they still surrounded and cursed Barry fiercely in their group chat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the deities no longer spoke, Su Hao said, "Of course, if you accept the mission, you can see the development of the entire Crucis system at any time, and it won't be much different from when you were deities. You can even experience a different life as an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>The deities went from dejected to delighted: "You mean we can control avatars to move freely?"</p><p></p><p>If so, it really wouldn't be much different from before. Even without servants, they could accept it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "Not free movement. If you want to go out for a stroll, you can only act as 'guides', and the rest of the time, you cannot interfere with the natural development of civilization. Similarly, as long as you complete the tasks as required, I won't interfere with your freedom. Any other questions?"</p><p></p><p>This group of deities raised a bunch of questions in their group chat, but in front of Su Hao, they all obediently said, "We understand, Lord Lei'an, we have no other questions."</p><p></p><p>After they replied, each deity heard a 'ding dong' sound, which was the notification for issuing a mission.</p><p></p><p>They opened the mission information and found the mission title was: Remaking the New World.</p><p></p><p>"Complete the five-stage mission according to the set requirements. Each stage will be evaluated and rewarded with 20,000 merit points. Based on the completion degree, merit points will be added or deducted from the base 20,000.</p><p></p><p>Stage 1 Mission: Remake the Ten-Color Board. Note: Adjust the soul power structure of the Ten-Color Board according to the 'receiver transmitter' structure in the 'World Creation Game', interconnecting with the other seventeen deities to form an eighteen-deity network.</p><p></p><p>Mission deadline: One year.</p><p></p><p>Stage 2 Mission will be issued after completing Stage 1.</p><p></p><p>Please accept the mission and complete it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>After seeing the mission, the deities realized: "The 'World Creation Game' we played before was actually to learn and practice for use now. I understand."</p><p></p><p>They didn't hesitate to accept the mission. Remaking the Ten-Color Board sounded terrifying, but they knew it just meant building a signal receiving and transmitting structure on the outer layer of the Ten-Color Board. It wouldn't actually harm their main bodies.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the deities had accepted the mission and started trying to build the soul power structure, Su Hao said, "Then I wish you success in your mission. Farewell."</p><p></p><p>He then teleported away to the Crucis system.</p><p></p><p>From when the deities disappeared until now, more than forty years had passed, and the world had taken on a completely new appearance.</p><p></p><p>Twenty or thirty years ago, a 'search for deities' craze swept through, with many remaining soul cultivators and soul guardians forming squads to scour the world, trying to find their missing deities. After many years of fruitless searching, some soul cultivators finally gave up, believing the deities had abandoned their followers for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the deities had grown weary of this boring world. Perhaps the world would soon come to an end. Or perhaps the deities had found better servants.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they believed that from then on, they had to rely on themselves.</p><p></p><p>What a feeling of bewilderment and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, the initial search squads grew larger and larger. Inevitably, various large and small forces clashed and collided, quickly erupting into all-out war.</p><p></p><p>Annexation, extinction, fleeing, lying dormant...such scenes played out almost constantly all over the world, extremely brutal in the details.</p><p></p><p>The current state of the world consisted of forces of all sizes scattered across the continents, dividing up their own territories and each proclaiming themselves kings and rulers.</p><p></p><p>There were also many with ambitions to unify the continents and the world.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was in a primitive stage of redistributing interests.</p><p></p><p>After the deities left, the civilizations of humans, mountain spirits, and giant dragons were gradually being born amidst the blood and fire of war.</p><p></p><p>And what Su Hao had to do was sprinkle some special seasonings into the civilizations they generated on their own, to make their development a bit more flavorful.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao was strolling on the Crucis system looking for a suitable location to build the soul power network node, he happened to encounter a special red-gold giant dragon on a mountain - Chipu Oakes, who used to be the elder brother's body for the red-gold giant dragons.</p><p></p><p>Chipu led three or four dozen young red-gold giant dragons, creeping up the mountain like hunting cats, but each one could barely conceal their excited expressions, as if injected with chicken blood.</p><p></p><p>Chipu kept his voice low as he crawled at the front, suppressing a roar: "Brothers, victory is in sight. I've already caught the scent of the Demon King. Prepare to charge with me! Only I can save the Deity Lords. Only by following me can you save the Deity Lords, who have been imprisoned for so long and desperately crave the victory we bring."</p><p></p><p>Another dragon also spoke in a muffled voice: "Big brother Chipu, we are prepared to battle the Great Demon King Lei'an for hundreds of rounds until my blood stops flowing, until I can no longer raise my head, until my eyes close forever..."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Chipu, I also smell the Demon King's scent. This time, perhaps the Demon King is unaware of our arrival and hasn't fled in advance!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu's mouth twisted into a cruel grin: "Hahaha, our arrival will certainly give the Great Demon King Lei'an a huge surprise. I'm so excited. My lifelong enemy, the Great Demon King Lei'an, accept my judgment! I will defeat you in my most glorious and youthful time."</p><p></p><p>The other dragons trembled with excitement, but it didn't affect their agile movements at all.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under Chipu's lead, dozens of red-gold giant dragons climbed to the top of this peak.</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, on the small platform at the very top, they saw another red-gold dragon just as big as them, but looking even more agile and slender.</p><p></p><p>That red-gold dragon slowly turned its head to look at Chipu: "Chipu, what are you doing? Why are you calling me the Great Demon King?"</p><p></p><p>"Kah--"</p><p></p><p>Having just climbed up, Chipu was petrified when he made eye contact with Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>The familiar patterns on the forehead, the slender agile form, the voice he had heard countless times, that unique casual tone...</p><p></p><p>Everything proved that the red-gold dragon before him was the 'Great Demon King Lei'an Oakes' that he and his band of delusional golden dragons had been searching for.</p><p></p><p>"Third...brother?"</p>

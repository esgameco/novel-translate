        <h1>Chapter 591</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Half a month later, Su Hao had already simplified the 'Chemical Source Vector' one more time based on Yashan's research results.</p><p></p><p>This time, the simplification wasn't perfect, but it was at least able to do so in a way that allowed him to freely combine and realize a wide variety of abilities, as well as strengths, through the fragments.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this combination was limited to the energy and mass systems.</p><p></p><p>Fantasy system abilities could currently only be imitated and could not be analyzed, which had to be said still made Su Hao very regretful.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually uploaded the simplified version into the universal assistant for Yashan and Feng Cheng's reference, as for whether the two of them could learn it or not, it was not something Su Hao could decide.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone masters a skill, the usage they are used to is different, the method that Su Hao finds convenient to use, Yashan and Feng Cheng may not necessarily like.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked out of the base small world and came to the coast, flipped his hand and took out a source bead, called out the source inside, and casually pointed out towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>''Searing Bomb''!</p><p></p><p>Like a huge torpedo exploding in the water, the seawater bulged violently.</p><p></p><p>"Wow~"</p><p></p><p>The not-so-large waves churned up and turned into waves that spread out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp gulp~"</p><p></p><p>Only a short while later, a large number of bubbles emerged from the seawater, surfacing and exploding as the water vapor rose up in a dizzying manner.</p><p></p><p>After another moment, many sea fish flipped their bellies and floated out of the sea, if someone used chopsticks to clip them, they would realize that they could be eaten at this time by sprinkling some green onions, fresh and fragrant.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao withdrew his finger with satisfaction, "This is the Source of Fire Mage, the transformed high temperature is a little stronger than the 'Fire Dragon' rune, and the launching speed is faster than the rune, and in specific scenes, it can play a not-so-small role."</p><p></p><p>Next, he once again drew out a strand of source before launching a palm forward.</p><p></p><p>'Thunder'!</p><p></p><p>A wrist-thick bolt of lightning emanated from his palm, connecting to the distant sea the moment it lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Boom-boom-boom-boom-"</p><p></p><p>The entire sea instantly boiled.</p><p></p><p>As if the sea ahead was covered with countless torpedoes, and these torpedoes detonated in turn, blowing up water splashes into the sky, it was very spectacular.</p><p></p><p>The commotion was countless times stronger than the 'incendiary bombs'.</p><p></p><p>When the sea surface regained its calmness, countless large and small sea fish surfaced, their bellies facing the sky.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the first time in their lives that their bellies were basking in the sun, and they looked very relaxed and cozy.</p><p></p><p>Normal seawater is struck by lightning, and will not erupt such a powerful movement, because the ocean is a huge conductor, although the lightning is powerful, but relative to the seawater is insignificant, will soon be dissolved by the seawater.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Su Hao's lightning strike triggered such a huge commotion was the result of his deliberate control.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Source Mage, not bad, whether it's the transformation efficiency or the launch speed, it's much higher than my runes. Unfortunately, something as special as a source simply cannot be manipulated at my whim as spiritual energy and blood qi are."</p><p></p><p>The energy level of blood qi was the lowest, but Su Hao could manipulate blood qi to accomplish many and its subtle microscopic operations, such as the preparation of 'gene modification liquid'.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy energy level was too much higher than blood qi, but there was no way to help him accomplish such fine operations, and the role of spiritual energy was more about prolonging the lifespan while serving as an energy source for launching runes.</p><p></p><p>As for something like a source, the energy level was much stronger than spiritual energy, but unfortunately, one could only control the transformation of the source with a specific spiritual frequency band, and could not even control the source's input of runes to try and activate them.</p><p></p><p>To summarize, the higher the energy level, the less controlled it is.</p><p></p><p>In this way, whether it was blood qi, spiritual energy or source, these three types of energy were all something Su Hao couldn't give up.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao used the source to test the various abilities of the energy and quality systems, all of which were easily used with undiminished power.</p><p></p><p>"Next, try Chief Lada's ability, Locking Fist! However, I prefer to call it 'kinetic energy increase and transfer'."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Su Hao clenched his right hand, raised his left palm, and slammed his right fist into the palm of his left hand.</p><p></p><p>There should have been a 'pop' sound from the clash of fists and palms, however, there was no sound whatsoever, as if the right fist was gently leaning against the left palm, but Su Hao had used most of his strength for this punch.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a floating white shark on the surface of the sea violently exploded, broken flesh and blood splashed in all directions, quickly dyeing the sea water red.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, the moment Su Hao punched his left palm, the 'Locked Fist' ability was activated, and all the power of the right hand punch attack, after being increased by the source, was transferred to the great white shark on the surface of the sea, and it blew up the great white shark with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Originally, as a powerful physical body of a Zongshi martial artist + [Fate Son] + Transformation God cultivator, the body strength was already very powerful, plus the increase of the source, blowing up the great white shark with a single punch was all Su Hao's light hand.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed a satisfied smile, "This ability is really good! So what if it is?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many of the sea fish in the sea ahead that had been locked by Su Hao's divine thought, their bodies violently trembled, and then they bounced a few times, floating out of the sea powerlessly.</p><p></p><p>In other words, within the range of divine thought perception, the creatures that were locked by him basically couldn't stop him from snapping his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The point was, this was a group attack skill!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a long breath and muttered, "I wonder if in the future, one of my ringing fingers will be able to blow up a planet!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his fist and slowly said, "Rattling fingers won't work, but if it's replaced with a fist, it should be fine!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On this day, Feng Cheng sent a reminder in the group chat, "Boss Wei, Boss Yashan, today is the day of our Wind Mountain Yang Stargazer Squad's usual gathering, are you guys still going over there today?"</p><p></p><p>The squad agreed to get together once a year to exchange some information with each other and bond.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three of them were initiated as source mages under Star Lookout, and it was only right to be grateful. Even for President Gu Yin, Su Hao had honored his original promise and sent her many boxes of source beads, making her instantly rich.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao had experienced a lot along the way, killing and setting fire to people and robbing their homes, he had not developed the kind of thinking that 'other people's help to him was a matter of course', and he would make what he could to give back when the conditions permitted it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it was beyond his ability or blocked him from seeking knowledge, then he could only say sorry.</p><p></p><p>These two people, Ah Xing and Ah Wang, had helped Su Hao, and he didn't mind helping them a hand to realize their dreams when conditions permitted.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned, ''Let's go! It's good to just relax and get together."</p><p></p><p>The three of them teleported to the outside of Huai Shui Town in turn, and then slowly walked into Huai Shui Town.</p><p></p><p>It had been more than eight years since Su Hao had been reincarnated into this world, and what Huai Shui Town looked like when he was reincarnated over was still what it looked like now.</p><p></p><p>How many times had the town been attacked by disasters, and the buildings and streets were mostly damaged, but the townspeople here were very stubborn and restored the damaged parts to their original appearance.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the incident of 'Luo Wang', Yashan personally buried many people who came to look for trouble, which made Huai Shui Town have a small reputation in the neighboring cities, but probably because of the bad reputation, resulting in the past two years, very few outsiders to this place, and only a variety of caravans will pass through this place.</p><p></p><p>This turned the quiet Huai Shui Town into a 'paradise'.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao and the three of them walked into the town, the townspeople all greeted Su Hao and the others warmly, simply because Su Hao and the others' reputation in the town was too big, reaching a level that no one knew about.</p><p></p><p>The 'Lucky Star Squad' was the only source squad that had successfully debuted in their Huai Shui Town!</p><p></p><p>Of course, being strong was only part of it, the key was still being handsome, each of the five were handsome and had their own specialties.</p><p></p><p>The team's five handsome in the entire Hengxuan District, but the popularity is extremely high, countless young girls in the boudoir are hanging their five handsome portrait ......</p><p></p><p>It is simply the dream god of the young girls.</p><p></p><p>Their 'Lucky Star Squad' has also caused many men to boycott them. Many young couples have quarreled because of this.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the five Lucky Stars gathered at the old place, Wyvern Tavern, and ordered the most luxurious set meal.</p>

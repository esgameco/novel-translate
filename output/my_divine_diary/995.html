        <h1>Chapter 995</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Very soon, mass production lines for the exiled avatars were created by the disciples of the two major sects.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, finished exiled avatars were continuously produced, entering the small world preset by Su Hao, automatically recorded in the pinball space, and then sent to unknown places by the 'Space Random Exile Transmission Array'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's work was simple - giving Xiao Guang more and more complete exploration functions, and then handing over all the exiled avatars for Xiao Guang to process.</p><p></p><p>Once this was done, Su Hao could enjoy the treasure trove of knowledge brought by this mechanism with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the exploration range of the disciples of the two major sects grew wider and wider, the life planets they harvested became more and more, and the interesting new phenomena they discovered also increased.</p><p></p><p>All these newly discovered cosmic phenomena, without exception, were thoroughly studied by Su Hao and integrated into his own system, becoming knowledge that truly belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>Slowly accumulating like this, the longer the time, the broader Su Hao's knowledge became.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of ordinary people, Su Hao's current state could already be called 'omniscient and omnipotent'.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao had long stopped caring about the opinions of ordinary people. The 'omniscience and omnipotence' in the eyes of ordinary people had no meaning to him.</p><p></p><p>Because he himself knew that as his knowledge expanded and his understanding of the universe deepened, he actually saw more of the unknown in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The more one understands, the more profoundly one realizes how much one does not understand.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a question in Su Hao's mind that he could not find an answer to for the time being: "I use my eyes, spiritual power, spiritual eye, galactic network, etc. to observe this material universe, but all my means of observation are based on matter. With material means of observation, I can only observe the material universe. So the question is, is there another universe independent of matter that I cannot observe?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed that such things did exist, but he had no way to truly perceive their existence with his physical body or machines.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to perceive does not mean non-existence.</p><p></p><p>Just like the special substance 'yuan qi' independent of the elemental sequence he encountered some time ago. If Su Hao had not encountered it on the Martial Arts Planet, he would never have known about the existence of this special parasitic substance.</p><p></p><p>Even the most brilliant mind has limitations in cognition.</p><p></p><p>What one has never seen, one can never imagine.</p><p></p><p>Just like in his first life on that planet, the 'aliens' he imagined were always created using Earth life as a template.</p><p></p><p>It was only because he had never seen real extraterrestrial life that he could not imagine what it would be like.</p><p></p><p>So how to deal with such a problem?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's solution was to wait.</p><p></p><p>Wait for millions of years, billions of years, trillions of years.</p><p></p><p>Wait until some opportune chance arises that allows him to break through the natural limitations of being a material observer, to observe this universe from a non-material perspective, and then follow this observational perspective to study this revolutionary cognition.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way.</p><p></p><p>After all, Su Hao did not know how to detach from matter to observe another non-material universe at present.</p><p></p><p>He was first and foremost a person composed of matter.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ant trying to think about problems the way humans do.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically impossible.</p><p></p><p>About this, Su Hao smiled and said, "Perhaps the pinball space is the breakthrough for me to observe the non-material universe? From my research on the pinball space over so many years, its existence seems to be an intermediate product between the material world and the non-material world, similar in nature to the intermediate product between matter and energy, the 'source'.</p><p></p><p>The reason it moves around may be due to the interaction between the material world and the non-material world..."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Su Hao's guess, and he didn't know the specifics.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called non-material world, Su Hao had no ability to confirm its existence.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pondered some messy questions, and unconsciously returned to the pinball space, strolling leisurely in this seemingly endless special space.</p><p></p><p>This place was like an unopened chaotic universe.</p><p></p><p>Only one corner appeared slightly different because he had built the 'Cosmic Light' there.</p><p></p><p>Every time he returned here, Su Hao always had a feeling of unreality, perhaps because of the illusion that he was the only one here?</p><p></p><p>When active in the outer universe, there were still Ah Shan and Feng Cheng helping with some research, so he would never feel alone. But it was different in the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>He did not allow anyone to interfere with his research on the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed at himself in self-mockery: "This is the contradiction between the 'solitude' of independent research and the 'unease' of collaborative research. I want someone to discuss with, but I'm also afraid of being upstaged. To a certain extent, I am indeed very hypocritical."</p><p></p><p>On this issue, Su Hao could accept being a little hypocritical.</p><p></p><p>"So, how to proceed and how far one can go ultimately depends on one's own exploration."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "Pinball space, what kind of existence are you? In this universe, might there be many similar pinball spaces? Might there also be many people like me who are lucky enough to have all their information recorded in the pinball space at the moment of death?"</p><p></p><p>He hoped there were, and hoped there weren't...</p><p></p><p>It was extremely contradictory.</p><p></p><p>After going through thousands of hardships, he had finally reached this step, with only the analysis of the pinball space left. Once this was completed, Su Hao would basically have no worries.</p><p></p><p>He could then devote himself entirely to the exploration of the unknown that he loved.</p><p></p><p>Of course, analyzing the pinball space was also part of exploring the unknown, but there was a difference between exploring the unknown with worries and exploring the unknown without worries.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao felt he preferred the latter.</p><p></p><p>After strolling in the pinball space for a while, Su Hao had a thought and summoned the little black room, taking out the consciousness packages he had prepared for reincarnation and checking their status again.</p><p></p><p>The result was that there were no problems.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as the pinball space went to a suitable intelligent civilization planet, these consciousness packages could find suitable reincarnators, complete the consciousness invasion, replace them for reincarnation, and then open a channel with the main body.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could then send his main body over at the fastest speed to search for the pinball space up close.</p><p></p><p>There was a certain probability that he could find the pinball space near the reincarnated body. Of course, it was also possible that the pinball space was right in front of him, but he just couldn't see it.</p><p></p><p>As for what to do after finding the pinball space, Su Hao was not sure either.</p><p></p><p>The best scenario was that after perceiving the pinball space, he could successfully attach a strand of spiritual tendril to the pinball space, making it a special 'positioning stone'.</p><p></p><p>If successful, Su Hao could then transmit himself to the vicinity of the pinball space anytime and anywhere through this positioning stone, perceive it, study it, and completely master it...</p><p></p><p>However, the difficulty was immense.</p><p></p><p>First, he was not sure whether the precious once-in-a-lifetime reincarnation he had waited for millions or tens of millions of years would allow him to clearly perceive the existence of the pinball space from the material world.</p><p></p><p>Second, even if he could perceive it, whether he could successfully attach a 'spiritual tendril' to the pinball space to make it a positioning stone.</p><p></p><p>Third, with the spiritual tendril, whether he could transmit himself to the vicinity of the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Each problem was full of uncertainty and extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, each reincarnation was extremely precious. If he failed, he might have to wait another million years for the next reincarnation when the pinball space carried his consciousness package.</p><p></p><p>And failure was inevitable in experimentation and research.</p><p></p><p>From his years of research experience, Su Hao's failures were too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>If he had to wait a million years for each failure...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head helplessly: "It's unimaginable how long it would take to solve the problem of the pinball space."</p><p></p><p>However long it took, as long as he could completely solve the problem, Su Hao would keep waiting.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, Su Hao sat down at that familiar desk again and opened his notebook.</p><p></p><p>Since failure was inevitable, he should make full preparations in advance to minimize the number of failures!</p><p></p><p>During this long wait for the successful reincarnation of the consciousness packages, this was the most he could do.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Su Hao began writing down his research plan for the pinball space:</p><p></p><p>"Step one, exhaust all means to strengthen my perception abilities to ensure that when my main body is transmitted over after the consciousness package reincarnates, I can perceive the existence of the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>In the next millions or tens of millions of years, I need to devote most of my time to researching and exploring perception.</p><p></p><p>Step two, strengthen my spiritual tendrils and find ways to enhance my spatial abilities to ensure that once I perceive the pinball space, I can attach the spiritual tendril to it.</p><p></p><p>Step three, enhance the spatial resistance of my main body and avatars, ideally making their bodies have spatial attributes..."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, in the long time ahead, Su Hao would spare no effort in enhancing the 'perception' and 'spatial' abilities of his main body and avatars.</p><p></p><p>He believed that with millions or tens of millions of years of dedicated focus, there would definitely be new breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Su Hao left the experimental base and got a life planet from Ah Shan.</p><p></p><p>He decided to complete the perception and spatial metamorphosis experiments on this planet.</p><p></p><p>Although it's late, I've finally written it out...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>No doubt, during the year they formed a team, the most common thing they heard from Ah Yang when doing missions was "I want to do some experiments"!</p><p></p><p>He was truly an experimental maniac! This was definitely some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p></p><p>Wherever Su Hao went, he was followed by a bag full of all kinds of small animals, quietly staying in the bag, not screaming or struggling.  </p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang were willing to call him the 'Father of Small Animals'!</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he suddenly burst open the ground beneath his feet, and "shou" he shot up into the high sky.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing sighed, casting an ability on himself and Ah Wang, allowing them to slowly float up and chase after him.</p><p></p><p>Ever since half a year ago, after Ah Yang developed this spell called 'explosive flight', he no longer needed Ah Xing's levitation spell and could fly around randomly by himself, flying much faster than Ah Xing, and most annoyingly, more stably too!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao swiftly glided through mid-air, his radar perception fully extended, allowing him to easily sense all kinds of life force reactions within a range of over 40,000 meters, and vaguely sense the approximate shapes of the corresponding creatures.</p><p></p><p>"Found it!"</p><p></p><p>In less than ten minutes, Su Hao locked onto the demonic beast that resembled a wild boar.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then turned around and quickly flew over to Ah Xing and Ah Wang, saying: "I've found that wild boar, follow me this way!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang glanced at each other, as if this mission had nothing to do with them...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Su Hao pointed down and said, "That wild boar is in that dense forest."</p><p></p><p>The two of them: "???"</p><p></p><p>Why couldn't they see or sense anything?</p><p></p><p>"Where is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Never mind if you can't see it, we'll talk after killing it!"</p><p></p><p>He reached behind and took out the bag, opening it and taking out half of the contents, saying: "Ah Xing, cast a levitation spell and send these little things over there."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ah Xing cast a levitation spell on the small animals, then threw them towards the wild boar's direction.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had recorded the consciousness information of these small animals earlier, throwing them down to see if they would go crazy after entering the wild boar's strange range, in order to observe the reason for going crazy.</p><p></p><p>These small animals landed smoothly, and half of Su Hao's consciousness entered the Bouncing Realm, constantly monitoring their changes.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, all these small animals went crazy, rolling on the ground and digging for food like pigs.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao quickly discovered something different.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness information of these small animals changed drastically in a very short time, becoming the thinking mode of a pig!</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's view, this was completely impossible - how could the consciousness information of mice turn into that of a pig in such a short time, and be able to think like a pig?</p><p></p><p>This violated his long-standing understanding of consciousness information!</p><p></p><p>Recalling those people who went crazy, a flash of light suddenly crossed Su Hao's mind, and he seemed to have figured something out!</p><p></p><p>In other words, those people who were affected by the wild boar's strange power and went crazy, it was as if a pig's consciousness was stuffed into their brains...</p><p></p><p>In the previous world, he had done similar experiments, but they all failed without exception, because the consciousness information of humans and pigs did not match.</p><p></p><p>But the scene unfolding before his eyes immediately overturned most of Su Hao's conclusions about consciousness information from the previous world!</p><p></p><p>After self-evaluation, Su Hao realized that if he was exposed to this wild boar's ability, he might turn into a pig from then on!</p><p></p><p>Even with the reincarnation ability of the Bouncing Realm, it would be in vain!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a great fear enveloped Su Hao!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was frightened for an instant, but immediately dispelled the fear from his mind and calmed down, returning to rationality.</p><p></p><p>At least he was still alive now, wasn't he? Nothing to be afraid of!</p><p></p><p>He also thought of another key point: 'And... it's not necessarily true!'</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he stretched out his finger and pointed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Pu!"</p><p></p><p>One of the small mice whose consciousness had turned into a pig's suddenly exploded in the dense forest below. He immediately entered the Bouncing Realm to observe the changes in that small mouse's consciousness information after its death.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Su Hao suddenly breathed a sigh of relief: 'The small mouse's consciousness information turned into a pig's, but after its body died, the consciousness information immediately reverted! In other words, even if I was affected, as long as my physical body dies, I, Su Hao, would still be Su Hao! But there may be aftereffects...'</p><p></p><p>This kind of consciousness transformation was similar to a projection, temporarily occupying another's body.</p><p></p><p>He admitted that he was a bit scared earlier, having raised the danger level of the demonic disaster to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to rewrite consciousness information is simply inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing curiously asked, "What's inconceivable?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly adjusted his mentality and said, "I mean, I seem to understand why those people went crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, they didn't go crazy. They just turned into pigs, behaving exactly like pigs in eating, sleeping, and defecating. All their behaviors were exactly like a pig's, the only difference being their bodies..."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang: "Huh? Turned into pigs?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the name 'Contagious Disease' for this demonic disaster is actually quite accurate. Because a pig's brain might just be a kind of disease, you know?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"I mean, the strange ability of that wild boar is to infect nearby humans or animals with its own pig brain. If a pig's brain is a kind of disease, then it can indeed be called a contagious disease. It brings the opponent's intelligence down to the same level as itself, and then defeats them with rich experience. Hahaha! It's really interesting."</p><p></p><p>Humans possess an extremely intelligent brain, but when brought down to the same level as this wild boar, it's really terrible - they might even lose their basic consciousness!</p><p></p><p>But for those creatures with lower intelligence, being able to turn into a pig brain is simply a blessing from heaven. To be able to think like a pig, what a great fortune in three lifetimes!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sighed, "What a pity! It's just a pig!"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang: "???"</p><p></p><p>They were getting more and more confused by this teammate!</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he stretched out his hand and pointed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>'Small Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>A huge spherical white light flashed on the ground, and then abruptly expanded and exploded.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an intense shockwave, a deafening boom resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The most formidable wild boar in history, perished!</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing curiously used his binoculars to look down, clearly seeing a pig leg flying high into the air. After it settled, he couldn't help but ask, "Has the wild boar's demonic disaster been resolved?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's experiment!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took out a small mouse, and Ah Xing, understanding, sent it down below.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waited for a long time, but found that the small mouse's consciousness information did not turn into a pig brain. After successively sending down some more, there was still no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It should be fine, but for safety's sake, let's wait a few more hours and check again!"</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Ah Wang suddenly said, "Look, there are people!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over to see those people who had previously turned into pigs had reverted back, their bodies filthy, their mouths already torn and bleeding from rooting in the ground, covered in mud from rolling around.</p><p></p><p>Those young female Source cultivators were crying piteously, having undoubtedly suffered a lot of indignity.</p><p></p><p>It seemed... they retained the memories of turning into pigs.</p><p></p><p>Truly an extraordinary experience.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 687</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The events that occurred during this period left the Octopus Clan in the small world feeling rather bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Even the ones reputed to be the most intelligent in the Cloud Ring system couldn't figure out what was happening.</p><p></p><p>The highest-ranking officer of the Octopus Clan's supply station was fortunate enough to come to Suhao's territory. All the surrounding Octopus clansmen looked at it with hopeful eyes, awaiting its orders and hoping it could create a miracle.</p><p></p><p>However, this highest-ranking supply station officer was no less puzzled than the other Octopus clansmen. In the end, it issued an order of 'no mistake' - observe the changes.</p><p></p><p>And that was the only thing they could do!</p><p></p><p>When faced with the unknown, they were accustomed to observing first, then summarizing the patterns, and conducting experiments if conditions allowed...</p><p></p><p>Now the only thing they could do was observe.</p><p></p><p>As for summarizing the patterns...</p><p></p><p>That terrifying human waved his hand to construct a huge enclosed partitioned prison, stripping off their armor and imprisoning them separately, unable to see each other.</p><p></p><p>At that point, they knew there was no chance to summarize the patterns. They had become prisoners of the humans, to be slaughtered at will.</p><p></p><p>For a while, a sense of terror pervaded the hearts of all the Octopus clansmen.</p><p></p><p>'Being captured by humans' was an extremely terrifying thing for them, and the tortures and suffering they would experience were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Being stripped naked and paraded through the streets, having dirty water forced down to humiliate them, having their auxiliary brains dug out to observe their reactions, having their tentacles burned and roasted, being dissected to study their body structures, being made into specimens for display...</p><p></p><p>Whenever they thought of the ordeals awaiting them, the Octopus clansmen wished they could die immediately. Even turning into a pile of white beads would be acceptable.</p><p></p><p>They howled in their cells, speaking a language Suhao couldn't understand - either begging for death, pleading for mercy, or hurling curses, who knows!</p><p></p><p>Suhao sectioned off a huge laboratory in the small world. After simply setting up some basic facilities, he brought an Octopus clansman that looked a bit dispirited into the lab.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the lab, its spirit immediately recovered to its peak state, even exceeding it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao restrained all the Octopus clansman's movements. No matter how its eight tentacles struggled, it couldn't move at all. Only its two large black eyes shook frantically, looking extremely terrified.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be saying, "What merits do I have to become his first experimental subject? Why don't you consider switching to another one?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao placed it on the experiment table and used the spiritual power of the Source Mage to spread out and fix its eight tentacles in place, observing its appearance.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus clansman's physique could be roughly divided into two parts: the head and the tentacles.</p><p></p><p>On its head were two huge eyes, and nothing else. From the front, the head looked round, but there was a pointed protrusion at the back - who knows what that was.</p><p></p><p>Overall, it had a large stature, standing nearly three meters tall normally, with each tentacle fully extended reaching four meters. Compared to humans, its size was enormous.</p><p></p><p>The eight tentacles extended out in different directions from a large fleshy ball. Each one was exceptionally thick, with the base as thick as a human's waist, gradually tapering until the very tip was slender, about as thin as a human finger, looking extremely dexterous.</p><p></p><p>To Suhao's eyes, every part looked novel. Finally, he couldn't resist reaching out to touch the Octopus monster's skin, sighing, "From a human perspective, this is a tentacle monster. I never expected it to be an intelligent race that developed such an advanced civilization - unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>When Suhao touched it, the tentacle monster couldn't help shuddering all over, but it was immobilized, thinking in terror, "What is this human going to do? So terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>After admiring it for a while, Suhao placed his hand on the tentacle monster's body, and his blood energy surged into it, recording all its physical and mental information into his spatial orb.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see the physical structure of the Octopus monster. With nine brains, which one is the main brain that carries consciousness? Are they all involved, or just one of them? I'll find out through experimentation!</p><p></p><p>One year should be enough time!"</p><p></p><p>Now Suhao had plenty of Octopus monsters in his prison, so he didn't mind wasting them. With so many experimental subjects, he could analyze the characteristics of the Octopus monsters from multiple angles.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After this series of events, the captain of the Yuanxing Ship judged that they must have attracted the attention of the Octopus Clan. To avoid being pursued by the Octopus Clan's fleet, after leaving the supply station planet, they traveled at maximum speed into space and then calculated the warp drive route.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the Yuanxing Ship activated its warp drive again, entering faster-than-light travel.</p><p></p><p>This time, it only traveled for a month before stopping. Now their task was to temporarily evade pursuit by the Octopus Clan, then find one of their supply stations or small military ports to replenish their energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>Before the Yuanxing Ship's energy blocks were fully recharged, they didn't plan to directly enter the territory of the Star-Devouring Worms.</p><p></p><p>Because without sufficient energy, going there would be a death sentence.</p><p></p><p>Half a month after the Yuanxing Ship deactivated its warp drive, a message reached the captain: "Two billion kilometers to the lower left, an Octopus Clan fleet has been detected, consisting of one Leaper-class mothership and four Raider-III combat ships. At our current travel speed, we estimate they will catch up in eighty hours. If we adjust course to travel in the same direction, they will catch up in one hundred and twenty hours."</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes widened in anger. "What? Why were the enemy ships not detected until they got so close? What is the scouting team doing?"</p><p></p><p>The reporter immediately explained, "According to analysis, the enemy fleet precisely locked onto our position and used warp travel to directly deploy near us, making it impossible to detect them in advance."</p><p></p><p>The captain took two deep breaths to forcibly regain his composure, then strode into the command center to view the images of the enemy fleet.</p><p></p><p>On the large screen were displayed five ships in total - one large and four small.</p><p></p><p>The largest was tremendously huge, estimated to be over fifteen times the volume of the Yuanxing Ship, shaped like an ellipsoid - it was the Octopus Clan's 'Leaper-class' mothership.</p><p></p><p>The other four ships were similar in size to the Yuanxing, narrow in front and wide in back, like a dolphin turned around, looking extremely powerful and agile.</p><p></p><p>The captain couldn't help cursing loudly, "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, he realized the Yuanxing Ship couldn't escape.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing's advantage was its strong stealth capabilities, but its speed and agility were weaknesses - it simply couldn't compare to the Octopus Clan's ships.</p><p></p><p>It was no use trying to escape by activating the warp drive either. They were too close to the Octopus Clan's warships!</p><p></p><p>If the enemy detected them activating the warp drive, they only needed to release spatial interference, which would cause the spatial bubble generated by the warp drive to collapse. Then the tremendous pressure would instantly tear the Yuanxing Ship apart.</p><p></p><p>Seen this way, the Yuanxing Ship had almost reached a dead end.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, the captain came up with a plan. "It's inadvisable to continue traveling at our current speed, and it's also inadvisable to travel in the same direction as the enemy, in case there are more enemy ships blocking our path ahead. So immediately adjust our heading - travel 30 degrees to the right and 30 degrees upward from our current direction."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking further, the captain added, "Bring Xu Shiqiang here."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Suhao arrived at the command center and learned about the situation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the imposing five warships on the screen, he directly said, "Captain, don't worry. I can handle these five ships. Just give me one of your better combat fighters, and I can fly over and shoot all the Octopus clansmen on those five ships."</p><p></p><p>Over the past two months, Suhao had been conducting genetic experiments on the Octopus clansmen in the small world. To quickly decipher their genes, he used a simultaneous group comparison experimental method.</p><p></p><p>So the consumption rate of Octopus clansmen was rather fast, and he urgently needed to replenish them. With the Octopus Clan warships conveniently arriving, that was perfect...</p><p></p><p>Hearing Suhao's words and recalling how he took down the Octopus Clan's Raider-II combat ship the first time, the captain couldn't help letting out a big sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But he still asked, "Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "There are three of our best 'Skybreaker-88' combat fighters in Hangar 3. They're yours now. Go familiarize yourself with their controls immediately - you have at most four days."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "I don't need four days, two hours is enough."</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>After praising him, the captain turned and waved his hand domineeringly, ordering with vigor, "No more running! Turn around and fight them!"</p><p></p><p>In any case, they had to battle. It was better to fight it out quickly.</p><p></p><p>If they could win, then they won. If they couldn't win, everyone on this ship would die.</p><p></p><p>There were only two possibilities: life or death.</p><p></p><p>As for protecting the human treasure Xu Shiqiang?</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter who was protecting whom.</p><p></p><p>The captain knew that if Suhao couldn't use pinpoint accuracy to defeat the enemy fleet, no one on the Yuanxing Ship could survive.</p><p></p><p>At least, he didn't think he could maneuver the Yuanxing Ship to victory against the enemy fleet.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 582</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao was completely unaware that the location of the base had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew, he wouldn't be too worried. The base was hidden within the small world, concealed by an array formation, so it couldn't be easily detected. Even if the island was full of people, they might not be able to find the entrance to the small world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as soon as someone set foot on the small island, Yashan would immediately sense it. They could relocate at any time if there was a situation, it was very secure. If they couldn't relocate, they could just eliminate the troublemakers.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao hid in the "second-level space" and secretly entered the main city of Yixuan's imperial palace, planning to find the emperor, princes, and ministers, record their consciousness information into the bouncing ball space, and then use their perspectives to collect information on the hiding places of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>This was a relatively simple method Su Hao had thought of.</p><p></p><p>As long as these royal family members still had connections with each other, all the information would be exposed to him.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Su Hao came out of the palace: "I've recorded fifty consciousness information pieces, that should be enough. I'll check again in a couple of days, and if it's not enough, I'll come back again."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was reading a book in a house inside the transit ball when a man in a tight gray outfit suddenly ran into the courtyard and was stopped by the ponytailed girl Xiao Hui guarding the door.</p><p></p><p>The gray-clad man hurriedly said, "Sister Xiao Hui, there's a big problem! I have important information to report to Brother Zhi Peng."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hui frowned, "But you can't be so reckless. It's not that urgent. Wait for me to report first, then we'll talk."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhi Peng's voice came from the room: "Xiao Hui, let him in! No need to be so restrained."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hui opened the door as instructed but kept her eyes fixed on the gray-clad man, preventing any contingencies.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, no matter who approached Zhi Peng, she had to be on guard to avoid any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng turned his chair around, put the parrot on his shoulder, and asked, "Ah, it's Xiao Xi. What happened? Tell me slowly."</p><p></p><p>The gray-clad man Xiao Xi forced a smile and said, "Brother Zhi Peng, according to the latest news, the president of the Radha Association, known as the 'Invincible Punch,' is personally leading a team to attack us! Many brothers from the Glory Association have been beaten down!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng stood up abruptly in shock, "They're attacking? Why so suddenly, without any prior information? How many people do they have?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xi said awkwardly, "Reportedly only five, and only President Radha has super combat strength, while the others are just there to serve tea and pour water."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng let out a sigh of relief, "That's good, five people are not to be feared. Gather our people to capture them, and then I'll hold a mobilization meeting for President Radha."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xi said, "The other team leaders thought the same, but the people they sent out never came back. Either they were killed by a single punch or knocked unconscious and couldn't be woken up!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng exclaimed in shock, "That strong? What about our Demon Source mages?"</p><p></p><p>"It's no use! They can't even get close. We only heard a voice from afar saying 'eat my punch,' and then they were down, either dead or injured, it's terrifying! Now we don't dare approach him, we can only sneak around.</p><p></p><p>Anyone detected by President Radha will be knocked down by a single punch, even hiding in the transit ball can't avoid it.</p><p></p><p>The key is, President Radha's perception range is extremely wide, over six thousand meters. In other words, within six thousand meters, he is invincible.</p><p></p><p>Brother Zhi Peng, what should we do now? Please take charge!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng frowned, "Where are they now?"</p><p></p><p>"They're heading towards Pingkong City! It won't be long before they arrive, and no one can stop them at the moment."</p><p></p><p>"Can we organize a large number of people to rush them together, force them to be distracted, and capture him in the chaos?"</p><p></p><p>"We've tried, it doesn't work. We only heard from afar 'eat my countless punches,' and everyone was down!</p><p></p><p>A group attack is simply impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh--" Zhi Peng sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that the president of the Hengxuan District Mage Association could be so terrifying. He asked, "Do you know what ability President Radha has?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xi said, "Not exactly clear, but there are rumors that it's the 'Locked Punch'! Meaning, as long as the location is locked, he can punch you no matter where you are."</p><p></p><p>"Locked Punch? It's probably not just that!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly racked his brain for a solution but found himself helpless.</p><p></p><p>The Glory Association did have many talented people with all kinds of abilities, but without exception, they all needed to get close to use their powers.</p><p></p><p>Now they had encountered someone who could attack from an extreme range, it was simply unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had an epiphany and thought of Mr. Jia Fengcheng, who would occasionally appear by his side to protect him. Perhaps Mr. Jia could deal with President Radha?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xi shook his head, "No, I haven't seen him for several days."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng thought for a moment, saw the parrot Number Seven on his shoulder, and said, "You all retreat. Just have the Demon Source mages' monitors observe their movements from afar, don't confront them directly. You go and pass on the order!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xi immediately ran out to relay the order.</p><p></p><p>After confirming no one was around, Zhi Peng turned to the parrot and said, "Number Seven, help me contact Mr. Jia Fengcheng. There's an emergency, I'm counting on you!"</p><p></p><p>The parrot spoke in a human voice, "Wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Fengcheng, who was making a "transit ball," received a new message notification from his all-purpose assistant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was a message from Su Hao, he immediately put down his work, opened the message which read: "Zhi Peng requests a conversation, accept?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately became more alert. What did Zhi Peng want from him? Surely not just to chat?</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhi Peng and Fengcheng started conversing through the parrot.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jia Fengcheng, we're in big trouble now..."</p><p></p><p>After Zhi Peng briefly explained the situation, he said, "No one in the Glory Association is a match for him, and most crucially, we can't get close. I don't know if you have a way to capture him, Mr. Jia?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately became interested, "Oh? The Locked Punch from over six thousand meters away? Heh, I'd like to see this so-called 'Invincible Punch' who can single-handedly defeat your entire Glory Association without you being able to resist. Heh heh, his strength seems quite formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng exclaimed joyfully, "Mr. Fengcheng, you have a way to capture President Radha? He's known as the world's strongest man, the 'Invincible Punch'!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng scoffed, "Invincible Punch? Ridiculous! Capturing him would be a flick of my wrist."</p><p></p><p>After reporting to Yashan, Fengcheng paused for a few seconds and teleported to Zhi Peng's side, smiling, "Tell me, where is he? I'll resolve this battle quickly so I can return to my work."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Xi happened to run back to report the situation. Zhi Peng immediately had Xiao Xi lead Fengcheng to the location.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! This bunch can't even withstand one of my punches, yet they want to eliminate the royal family? Hurry back home to eat!" President Radha threw his head back and laughed loudly, his cape fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Today he was extremely happy. Since becoming the president, he hadn't had such an enjoyable punching experience.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone was in awe of his might and dared not oppose him, to the point where he thought his Invincible Punch would never have a chance to demonstrate its power again.</p><p></p><p>He had decided that today, he would definitely have a thorough and satisfying punch session! No, not just today, but tomorrow, the day after, and many days after that... He would stay in the Glory Association's territory until he had scared everyone into submission.</p><p></p><p>To him, this was just a punching game, not even a battle. Who had ever heard of a battle where the opponent couldn't withstand a single punch?</p><p></p><p>At least Radha himself didn't acknowledge this as a battle.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish--"</p><p></p><p>Just as Radha was feeling smug, five golden rays shot from afar, each locking onto one of the five people, moving at an extreme speed, arriving in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Radha's expression changed drastically. He sensed a lethal threat from the five golden rays, and most crucially, he couldn't detect the enemy's presence within his range!</p><p></p><p>Radha raised his right fist high, the muscles on his exposed arm suddenly bulging, veins protruding, and then slammed it down heavily.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>There was no dull thud as expected, and the seemingly soft ground didn't have any crater either, as if Radha's fist had only lightly tapped the surface, giving an eerie feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>A faint cracking sound came from the five golden rays, which abruptly exploded in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Fengcheng, who was ten thousand meters away, let out a light exclamation.</p>

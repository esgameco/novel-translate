        <h1>Chapter 801</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo returned, once again bringing back a large amount of food, allowing the three young dragons to have a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao's stomach was still like a bottomless pit. Even after finishing the food, Mother dragon Shaduo could not see that look of satisfaction on the face of her third child, Leian.</p><p></p><p>This made her feel extremely guilty: I was unable to feed my child until he was full.</p><p></p><p>After resting in the cave for a while, the mother dragon came out to take away the leftovers from the young dragons and left the nest.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took this opportunity to return to the hatching room to refine his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, Suhao stopped, because refining too much blood energy would suppress the energy for physical growth, causing his physical growth to slow down. Compared to his dragon elder brother Chipu and dragon elder sister Moli, his body was much smaller.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the giant dragon clan, body size often represented a giant dragon's strength. Small adult giant dragons would be looked down upon by other giant dragons.</p><p></p><p>Even the naive young dragon Chipu felt very puzzled that despite his huge size, he was not a match for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "Let's stop here for today and let my body grow naturally. It's fine to be a bit bigger. The giant dragon gene has been fully decoded anyway, so I'll take the opportunity to design the giant dragon gene today and try to evolve into a 'Creator'."</p><p></p><p>That's right, Suhao did not plan to upgrade step-by-step from a 'Demigod'. Instead, he would evolve directly into a 'Creator' in one go.</p><p></p><p>Don't doubt it, he already had this level of technology now, and it was just basic technology. He could even modify a dragon egg or ostrich egg into a 'Divine Egg', which would then successfully hatch into a 'Divine Being'.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of years of research from his previous life were no joke.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suhao entered the bouncing realm and focused on designing the 'Creator' gene for himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two young dragons ran into the hatching room, wanting to play with Suhao again...</p><p></p><p>Suhao felt a huge headache, unable to understand why these two young dragons never learned their lesson. No matter how much he beat them, at most they would quiet down for a day, and then forget the pain of being beaten and come running back making noise.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao basically had to beat these two young dragons every day in order to have one quiet day.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these two young dragons thought getting beaten by Suhao every day was a special way of 'playing' with their 'third brother'?</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened his eyes and walked towards the two young dragons: "Nevermind, I'll treat it as exercise!"</p><p></p><p>Then the sounds of the young dragons' shrill cries echoed from the nest crevice.</p><p></p><p>"Owww!"</p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The cries of the young dragons traveled far out through the mountain crevices and reverberated among the mountains.</p><p></p><p>After the mother dragon left, members of the Fugold squad that had quietly approached to explore also faintly heard the young dragons' howls.</p><p></p><p>To their ears, it sounded less like young dragon howls, and more like the 'clink clink' sound of money, music to their ears.</p><p></p><p>They became excited.</p><p></p><p>"They really are red-gold young dragons! We didn't get the location wrong, the giant dragon nest is nearby."</p><p></p><p>"We're gonna be rich! This time I'm going to the top courtesan at the Golden Jade Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>"Dream on, the top one is mine!"  </p><p></p><p>"Listen to those young dragon cries, they clearly just hatched, no more than a month old! This trip is a sure thing."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the mother dragon's routine, we have at most two days to search. Two days later, no matter what, we must hide and wait for the next time the mother dragon leaves."</p><p></p><p>"Heheh! So what if the mother dragon comes back? There are so many of us, we don't need to be afraid of the mother dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"You fool, where are you getting that bravado from? You think you can challenge a mature red-gold giant dragon? Sober up, or you'll cause trouble during the operation."</p><p></p><p>"Tch! Coward!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the big-bearded Xibo heard the faint cries of the young dragons, he was also extremely excited, barely holding himself back from slapping Weiya's butt again, but Weiya shot him a fierce glare.</p><p></p><p>Big-bearded Xibo said: "Now move at full speed, quickly confirm the location of the giant dragon nest, most likely on the Heavenly Cliff."</p><p></p><p>The young fair-faced Geya suggested: "How about we split into four groups to explore? Two groups search below the cliff, and the other two search above the cliff."</p><p></p><p>The big-bearded man immediately approved: "Good, let's split into groups! Regroup in one day."</p><p></p><p>The group quickly dispersed to explore.</p><p></p><p>The Fugold squad was a highly professional dragon-robbing team skilled at tracking dragons and exploring nests. With the timely cries of the young dragons providing guidance, by the second day they had found the huge crevice between the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>After careful exploration, they finally determined the approximate location of the nest.</p><p></p><p>Big-bearded Xibo excitedly laughed: "This red-gold mother dragon really knows how to pick a spot! We've been roaming these Cloudy Mountains for so long and never discovered there was such a spacious crevice in the Heavenly Cliff."</p><p></p><p>Weiya looked up at the mist-shrouded heights and smiled: "I guess the nest is at least 1,500 meters up. We'll have to use grappling hooks to descend from the cliff top."</p><p></p><p>Big-bearded Xibo seemed extremely happy: "We all know, if it's Weiya's guess, it's definitely accurate to within 10 percent. So what are we waiting for? Take the detour, climb up the Heavenly Cliff, and bring our little red-gold young dragon treasures away!"</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so members of the Fugold squad chorused in agreement, carrying all sorts of professional dragon-catching equipment as they turned to head the other way.</p><p></p><p>They knew there was a less steep slope in that direction that would allow them to climb up the Heavenly Cliff.</p><p></p><p>As for flying...</p><p></p><p>That was a skill only higher-level soul guards had mastered. They were just petty dragon robbers, not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>What the Fugold squad members didn't know at all was that this dragon robbing trip would bring them something completely unexpected.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Suhao had completed the design of the 'Creator' gene. After repeatedly simulating and running it to ensure there were no issues, he decisively chose the flesh at the tip of his tail to cultivate the corresponding gene modification solution.</p><p></p><p>"Currently in this young dragon body, my body length is nearly 3 meters, which is quite massive compared to humans. So I'll need to cultivate more gene modification solution, it should be ready tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>He silently calculated for a moment and found the timing was perfect: "Tomorrow Mother Shaduo will likely bring food back, and I can fill my stomach first and convert more blood energy. After Mother Shaduo leaves, I can then evolve myself into a 'Creator'."  </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao immediately started the cultivation program for the gene modification solution.</p><p></p><p>And in this free time, he could make a simple gene modification solution filtration device.</p><p></p><p>"For the filtration equipment, there are suitable objects in the nest I can use. As for the injection device, I'll have to convert it from source beads."</p><p></p><p>As Suhao used the source beads stored in his body to convert into a syringe, the elder dragon brother Chipu and elder dragon sister Moli happened to witness it.</p><p></p><p>They saw their third brother stretch out a claw, then a milky white glow flashed above it, and in a moment, a strange cylindrical long tube appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the two young dragons dumbstruck!</p><p></p><p>Just stretch out a claw and hold it still, and you get things?</p><p></p><p>Let me try!</p><p></p><p>They opened their eyes, their claws empty.</p><p></p><p>Nothing?</p><p></p><p>They tried hard to recall Suhao's full posture: it seemed his other claw was hanging down, mouth closed tightly, and the tip of his tail was slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>Then they imitated the full posture, but still no result...</p><p></p><p>They racked their smart little brains trying to figure out why, why could their third brother do it but they couldn't? Just like how he had previously turned a large skull into those shiny, delicious pearl things.</p><p></p><p>This third brother could always do things they couldn't!</p><p></p><p>Suhao was completely baffled: "???"</p><p></p><p>He looked up and saw the elder dragon sister Moli also sticking her head in from outside, looking in with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought: "These two silly dragons, their bodies must be itchy again."</p><p></p><p>"Owww!"</p><p>"Waaah!"</p>

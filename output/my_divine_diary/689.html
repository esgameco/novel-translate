        <h1>Chapter 689</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After the fighter jet exploded, both sides were stunned.</p><p></p><p>At the human command center, all the officers saw the hero Xu Shiqiang's aircraft blown up by the enemy mothership, their morale was severely shaken in the first moment, their thinking fell into a brief pause.</p><p></p><p>The command center was dead silent.</p><p></p><p>Then two words popped into everyone's mind: "It's over!"</p><p></p><p>If Xu Shiqiang died, then the Starship had no hope left.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked ashen, a feeling of regret spreading from the bottom of their hearts, soon showing on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"If we had dispatched a large fleet to accompany Xu Shiqiang..."</p><p></p><p>"If we were more conservative, launching another attack amidst the chaos..."</p><p></p><p>"If..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All kinds of regretful thoughts surged in their minds, they all felt there could have been a more stable way to fight, yet they chose the most arrogant approach.</p><p></p><p>But is there a cure for regret in life? Everyone knew: No!</p><p></p><p>They had squandered a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The captain looked even paler, as if he had lost all strength, collapsing into the chair.</p><p></p><p>The Starship's failure was mainly his responsibility, he could hardly forgive himself.</p><p></p><p>"No! I can't be discouraged, I'm the captain of the Starship, everyone else can despair, but I cannot! If even I lose courage, then the Starship is truly hopeless."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the captain regained some fighting spirit: "Without Xu Shiqiang, we on the Starship can still fight on."</p><p></p><p>He stood up and slammed his fist hard on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>This loud noise startled everyone, they couldn't help but turn to look at the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain shouted loudly: "What are you all doing??? Look at your dejected appearance now, are you worthy of being human soldiers? All of you, lift up your heads, stick out your chests!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not dead yet! You're not dead yet either! The Starship hasn't died yet!"</p><p></p><p>"So what if Xu Shiqiang died? Are you all pinning the future hope of the Starship solely on Xu Shiqiang? As soldiers, where has your pride gone after Xu Shiqiang appeared? This is your disgrace!</p><p></p><p>Let me tell you, without Xu Shiqiang, we on the Starship are still invincible! Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone regained their spirit and shouted loudly: "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The captain glared with bloodshot eyes and roared: "Turn the ship, enter the asteroid belt, seize the chance to wipe out those eight-handed beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the command room of the Eight-Handed Race's mothership.</p><p></p><p>"The human fighter jet was taken down?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it has been confirmed destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>All the Eight-Handed Race members heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the pilots in the eight-armed fighters had died mysteriously, scaring them all.</p><p></p><p>If that fighter jet got too close, who knows if the Eight-Handed on the mothership would die inexplicably too.</p><p></p><p>The commander frowned: "What weapon destroyed it?"</p><p></p><p>Initially, all kinds of energy beams had no effect, just now in desperation they fired all weapons at once, successfully destroying the human fighter jet, meaning one attack method must have worked.</p><p></p><p>Someone immediately retrieved the footage and reviewed it repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Soon they had the result: "It was destroyed by an impact missile."</p><p></p><p>The commander felt something was off, if energy blasts couldn't even hit that fighter jet, how could an ordinary missile strike it?</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, who was hiding in stealth and rapidly blinking in space, neither side had noticed him, both thinking he had died in the previous battle.</p><p></p><p>A single human in space is far too tiny! Without careful scanning, it's impossible to detect Su Hao's small figure, let alone that he was also cloaked.</p><p></p><p>The detectors that could scan him only showed flickering, looking just like interference from cosmic rays, so no one paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's consecutive blinking speed was very fast, plus the enemy mothership was also heading his way, in just a few minutes he traversed the vast distance and arrived outside the mothership.</p><p></p><p>'Blink'!</p><p></p><p>'Experimental Subject Capture Technique'!</p><p></p><p>"This capture will be set for two thousand for now. Too many and I can't sustain them, after using up these subjects, if I still haven't successfully obtained [Divinity], then I'll find a chance to capture another batch!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Handed on the mothership soon reacted.</p><p></p><p>An Eight-Handed with eight wildly writhing tentacles rushed into the command room in panic: "Reporting to the commander, a large number of soldiers on the mothership have suddenly disapp..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, this reporting Eight-Handed vanished into thin air right there.</p><p></p><p>The commanders in the command room thought their eyes were playing tricks at first, but after confirming the reporter really disappeared before their eyes, they realized what he was trying to express!</p><p></p><p>"Disappeared suddenly!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, seeing the panic in each other's eyes. A similar situation had occurred before the supply station was breached.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Handed commander raised his tentacles and roared: "Stay calm!"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the words left his mouth, the commander himself vanished abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The command room fell dead silent. They did indeed calm down, but the commander was gone...</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, wanting to say something but unable to utter a word, then one by one vanished from their spots.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their companions disappear, the remaining Eight-Handed cried out: "I'm gone too!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the mothership, Su Hao looked at the small world brimming with experimental subjects and smiled with satisfaction: "Enough numbers, just have to finish off the rest."</p><p></p><p>He raised his fist and smashed it hard against the mothership's outer hull.</p><p></p><p>'Locking Fist'!</p><p></p><p>Through experiments earlier, Su Hao discovered the Eight-Handed Race's consciousness resided in the main brain, as long as their main brain was destroyed, their consciousness would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The eight sub-brains' main function was to cooperate with the main brain in controlling the eight tentacles separately.</p><p></p><p>For an Eight-Handed whose main brain was destroyed, from the consciousness level they were already dead, but from a physical perspective they were still alive, it's just that the eight tentacles lost the guidance of thought and became truly mindless tentacle monsters.</p><p></p><p>So after Su Hao's punch landed, the remaining Eight-Handed on the mothership all shuddered at once, lost their balance and started writhing madly. Soon they 'returned to normal', roaming aimlessly inside the ship.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the four nearby Scout Type III battleships noticed they had lost response from the mothership.</p><p></p><p>Apart from no response, the mothership appeared normal on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Could the mothership have died suddenly like the pilots on the eight-armed fighters?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be, that bizarre human fighter jet has been destroyed, maybe we've entered an area with no communications."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't seem right, should we go check it out?"</p><p></p><p>The four battleships discussed among themselves for a bit, soon reaching a decision. They opened a video communication, sharing video feeds, then dispatched one battleship to investigate the mothership.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious - upon approaching the mothership, all the Eight-Handed on that battleship instantly lost their minds.</p><p></p><p>They were familiar with this mindless state, wasn't it the manifestation of the main brain being destroyed?</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Handed on the remaining three battleships saw this scene and felt their eight tentacles go numb.</p><p></p><p>This scene was far too eerie.</p><p></p><p>One Eight-Handed captain lamented: "Ever since discovering this human cruiser, the things we've encountered have never been normal!"</p><p></p><p>"It's like watching a horror movie."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this is a human ghost cruiser?"</p><p></p><p>"Have faith in science, what are you made of to believe in supernatural nonsense?"</p><p></p><p>"What are your brains made of? To still have the mind to chat at a time like this, shouldn't you be thinking about what to do?"</p><p></p><p>"It's precisely because of the fear that we're chatting to ease the tension a little."</p><p></p><p>"Just like when getting intimate with a pretty Eight-Handed girl, you need to chat a bit first to dispel the awkward atmosphere."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The remaining three battleships were quite far apart, but it was no problem for Su Hao, as long as it wasn't a 'warp drive', no matter how fast the battleships moved, his blinking could keep up.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waited a while, but seeing the other three battleships showed no intention of approaching on their own, he stealthily blinked rapidly towards the nearest one.</p><p></p><p>"Since they're not coming over, then I'll have to make the effort to go to them."</p><p></p><p>He checked his physical state and couldn't help but praise: "The original quality of this body was already very strong, after my enhancements it has become extremely powerful. Continuous non-stop blinking and it can still endure!"</p><p></p><p>"But after this battle ends, I'll need a long period to rest and recover, might as well calmly conduct some experiments."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 614</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After calling Feixuan to his laboratory, Su Hao used every possible method to present the data on global disasters that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>This included latitude and longitude data, time data, disaster type data...He even personally built a huge planetary model using transformative vajra, and then marked the locations of the disasters with red dots, along with the times and intensities they occurred.</p><p></p><p>He even asked Feixuan if this way of presenting the data was clear enough, and said Feixuan could propose any method he wanted to display the data.</p><p></p><p>For Su Hao, comprehensively displaying the data was just a small problem, which surprised and delighted Feixuan.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand why this world-renowned expert was so invested in this disaster data, going to such lengths to present it personally.</p><p></p><p>Was there some incredible secret hidden in this data? The secret behind the disasters?</p><p></p><p>Feixuan could only wildly guess, as for the real answer, only Mr. Jia Wei knew.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had certain expectations of Feixuan, because he noticed that Feixuan's way of thinking was vastly different from his own. Perhaps by taking a different perspective, he could understand the things he couldn't figure out?</p><p></p><p>After looking at the other data, Feixuan finally focused on the planetary model Su Hao built with transformative crystals. Frowning in thought for a moment, he said, "Mr. Jia Wei, what information are you trying to obtain from this data?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I guess the disasters occurring on this planet follow a pattern, and the secret behind their source may be hidden in these patterns. So the information I want to obtain is the pattern in these disasters happening simultaneously all over the planet on the same day.</p><p></p><p>I have many sets of this kind of data, and have researched it for nearly half a year, but I haven't been able to find any useful patterns from the data. I thought maybe you could discover something."</p><p></p><p>Feixuan laughed awkwardly, "Mr. Jia Wei, you think too highly of me. If you couldn't find the pattern, how could I?"</p><p></p><p>While speaking humbly, Feixuan's heart had already exploded: "Ah! The difficulty my lifelong rival encountered, I can solve it, I can defeat him! Feixuan, it's time to show your true strength! As long as I crack the pattern before Mr. Jia Wei does, I'll be the strongest in this world! Charge!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Feixuan's face flush slightly, Su Hao asked with concern, "Feixuan, do you need to rest for a bit?"</p><p></p><p>Feixuan struggled to control his excited emotions, shaking his head firmly, "Rest? I don't need that at all, let me take a look first! Mr. Jia Wei, I need to go through all the data you've collected, including the earliest data."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his determination, Su Hao said approvingly, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Feixuan pointed to the huge computer center next to them, "Can I use the computers?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Do you know how to use them?"</p><p></p><p>Feixuan said, "Not very proficient, but I'll ask you if I have any problems."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Su Hao and Feixuan stayed in Su Hao's No. 1 laboratory to analyze the data.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't give up using his own methods for analysis. Although Feixuan's participation increased the chances of getting results slightly, he wouldn't put all his bets on Feixuan.</p><p></p><p>Feixuan was also processing the data using his own methods, while learning how to use computers at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The more he understood about computers, the more shocked Feixuan was by Su Hao's prowess: to be able to design and manufacture such machines, he truly deserved to be Feixuan's lifelong rival. Only by cracking the secret of this data did Feixuan have a chance to defeat him once...</p><p></p><p>"Just once would be enough!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, in the small world of the base, No. 1 laboratory.</p><p></p><p>The two, who had fallen into obsession, each analyzed the data in their own way.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao used a 'whole-part' approach to process information. In his underlying mindset, he subconsciously believed that this world was composed of 'parts' and a 'whole', inseparable from each other. Even the most mysterious 'system' of heating followed this principle.</p><p></p><p>Feixuan, on the other hand, used his usual way of thinking - 'breaking down intersections and viewing them independently'. This was also the thinking method he had tried to teach his teammates Xiangli and others: 'No matter how complex an event is, it is composed of lines. As long as you separate out all the events independently, everything becomes clear.'</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how many times he explained it, no matter how he broke down events for teaching, his teammates just couldn't learn even a bit of it. What a pity!</p><p></p><p>That's right, it was grouping. He really grouped the massive interrelated data one by one, just like playing the 'connect the dots' game.</p><p></p><p>It was at the moment he completed the grouping that a flash of lightning passed through his mind. When he looked at the data again, he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Feixuan suddenly leapt high into the air, trembling with excitement, his face flushed, veins bulging on his forehead, eyes protruding... He looked like he could die at any moment.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Feixuan was very excited, shouting loudly, "Mr. Jia Wei, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stood up abruptly and turned to Feixuan, "What?"</p><p></p><p>Feixuan took a deep breath and said, "Ellipse! It's an ellipse! More precisely, the foci of an ellipse! I've found that all the locations of the disasters can be seen as the foci of an ellipse!! This is the pattern I've discovered, it must be correct."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Feixuan finished speaking, Su Hao was struck as if by lightning, frozen in place. The messy data in his mind suddenly automatically organized itself into pairs.</p><p></p><p>He muttered, "Ellipsoid...foci...I understand! Heating to the extreme high temperature, heh heh!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he burst into laughter, "I understand how the 'system' heats up now, it's so simple. Hahaha, such a simple principle, yet I couldn't figure it out all this time. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>His laughter rang out loudly, traveling far, like a martial arts expert letting out a long shout after breaking through a realm, shaking anyone who heard it.</p><p></p><p>For example, Yashan and Fengcheng, who were also at the base, stopped their work upon hearing Su Hao's joyful laughter and came to the outside of No. 1 laboratory.</p><p></p><p>"The old master has broken through!" Yashan said excitedly, trying hard to suppress his joy for fear of disturbing his boss's performance.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he understood what Yashan meant by 'breaking through' - it absolutely wasn't a breakthrough in cultivation realm. If it was a cultivation breakthrough, the most Su Hao would say was "F*ck, I finally broke through!"</p><p></p><p>This kind of breakthrough must have been a problem that had plagued Su Hao for a long time, suddenly being solved, resulting in such joyful sounds.</p><p></p><p>As for what problem it was, Yashan and Fengcheng also knew. Recently, Su Hao had been trying to crack the secret of transforming matter into source energy, so he must have made a breakthrough today.</p><p></p><p>Cause for celebration!</p><p></p><p>Feixuan took deep breaths to calm his excited emotions.</p><p></p><p>He, Feixuan, had defeated Jia Wei, even if only this once, it was worth being proud of for his entire life.</p><p></p><p>As for what the foci of an ellipse could do...Feixuan didn't know. His task was just to help Mr. Jia Wei find the hidden patterns in the messy data!</p><p></p><p>However, what made Feixuan admire him was that as soon as he mentioned the key phrase "ellipse foci", Mr. Jia Wei immediately understood the pattern behind it. As expected of his lifelong rival, he was formidable.</p><p></p><p>Feixuan had wanted to wait for Mr. Jia Wei to inquire further, so he could explain his discovery process step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he missed out on a bit of the joy of explaining!</p><p></p><p>Feixuan's eyes suddenly lit up - another chance to show off had come.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 924</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>What Feng Cheng taught his students first, the same as Ya Shan, was the important skill of 'teleportation' + 'galactic network'.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - they wanted their disciples to start helping them explore the universe.</p><p></p><p>Because Su Hao had told the two of them that their ultimate goal was to explore the universe, to seek more knowledge and enrich their understanding of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The three most important factors for exploring the universe were: teleportation, the galactic network, and perpetual life.</p><p></p><p>As long as their disciples met these three conditions, they could help explore the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for whether these disciples had corresponding knowledge, it was actually not that important.</p><p></p><p>Not only because the knowledge Su Hao possessed was too vast to easily learn, but also because these disciples could explore and learn at the same time without conflict.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the hundreds of avatars of the three had been continuously exploring outwards, never stopping. They had discovered some life-bearing planets and provided Su Hao with many fresh things, but they had not found a second intelligent civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, the three were not in a hurry. Soon they would have a large group of disciples to help with the exploration....</p><p></p><p>At that time, the efficiency would naturally be very high.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng arranged various training tasks for his disciples, he found Ya Shan and said, "Big brother Ya Shan, I have two disciples here who can help us explore the universe. What about you?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Not many, just sixteen. My first batch of disciples is already exploring."  </p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng exclaimed, "Wow, impressive! How did you teach them, big brother Ya Shan?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled, "I crammed the knowledge into them, but they're not very proficient yet. Their skill usage is quite clumsy, probably not as smooth as your disciples. But it doesn't matter much, as long as they can do the tasks first. The issue of proficiency can be slowly resolved later."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng enviously said, "For some reason, I just can't seem to cram the knowledge into my students' heads. Never mind, it's fine, it's just a difference of a few hundred years. Big brother Ya Shan, I came here this time to discuss something with you about the exploration tasks."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan asked in surprise, "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Look, big brother, our disciples can already carry out tasks to explore a galaxy, but the premise is that we have to actively send them to the designated galaxy. The disciples themselves have no way to cross galaxies for exploration on their own.</p><p></p><p>In that case, doesn't it mean that for the disciples to explore, we have to go through everywhere first?</p><p></p><p>Big brother Ya Shan, you calculate it - the farthest we've explored is over 100 billion light-years away, but that's just in one direction. Within this spherical range, there are countless galaxies waiting to be explored. This range is so vast that even with our avatars running around, it would take no less than a hundred million years to cover it all. A hundred million years...</p><p></p><p>But if the disciples had the ability to cross galaxies autonomously, the result would be different. We'd just need to draw a circle for them and let them go wild on their own."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded, "That's true, but for these disciples to learn how to teleport across galaxies... I'm not belittling them, but their mental strength is too weak. They lack sufficient accumulation. Being able to learn teleportation within the local galaxy is already good. To learn how to teleport across galaxies, they'd probably need to practice for at least a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "So my idea is, can we create some kind of artifact to help the disciples shuttle between different galaxies? As long as they carry this artifact, they can teleport across galaxies. There's no real difference, and we can mass-produce it."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes lit up, "That makes sense. Come, come, let's figure out how to make this artifact. With what you said, I have an inspiration."</p><p></p><p>So the two delved into research, spending two full years on it.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan looked at the three-meter-long metal ellipsoid in front of him, his brow deeply furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "This shuttle craft already has all the functions needed to travel to the edge of a black hole. It can also assist disciples in entering the galactic network. The only thing missing now is how to calculate the destination point. Without Master Wei's authorization, we can't use the 'galactic network teleportation technique' at all."</p><p></p><p>The 'galactic network teleportation technique' was not something that could be achieved just by learning teleportation and the 'galactic network'.</p><p></p><p>There was another very important factor - precisely calculating the destination point.</p><p></p><p>Even Ya Shan and Feng Cheng didn't know how Su Hao had implemented this function. They only knew there was a calculation program in the assistant that could automatically calculate the destination.</p><p></p><p>But for this program, they only had usage rights, not granting rights.</p><p></p><p>In other words, without Su Hao's approval to grant them the authority to use the galactic network teleportation technique, no matter how powerful those disciples were, they would have no way to perform ultra-long-distance 'galactic network teleportation'.</p><p></p><p>The 'shuttle craft' they made was the same - it had all the functions, but was stuck at the core part.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan shook his head, "No, we can't find Master Wei for now. He's fully focused on researching a project and can't be disturbed. Let's wait until Master Wei emerges, it's not urgent for now."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "We can only do that."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "In the meantime, we should cultivate more disciples. I've discovered the benefits of having disciples."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "Me too."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a remodeled planet turned into an instance dungeon.</p><p></p><p>The palace under the mountain rocks had been reduced to ruins by war.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>A villainous wizard in tattered robes held up a brilliant crystal ball, laughing arrogantly, "You trial challengers want to seize this crystal ball from me, don't you? To have made it to my presence, this must be your final trial, right?"</p><p></p><p>The five haggard dimensional travelers in front stared in shock, unable to believe it, "How...how did you know?"</p><p></p><p>The villain ignored them and laughed uproariously again, "How did I know? You dare ask me how I knew?"</p><p></p><p>Laughing and laughing, his face became ferocious, "You're the tenth batch! The tenth batch, you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The five dimensional travelers were shocked again.</p><p></p><p>The villain almost cried, "Dammit, I was just being a good emperor of my own kingdom, not offending anyone. Yet these trial challengers keep coming in waves, messing up my life and my dynasty into a total mess.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, they actually made me the final villain trial, with this damn crystal ball popping up every now and then. I can't even throw it away.</p><p></p><p>Don't I have any face left? Huh? I'm so handsome, and a righteous person - where do I have even a hint of a villainous aura?"</p><p></p><p>The five dimensional travelers looked at the powerful opponent with pity, never expecting he would be so pitiful.</p><p></p><p>The villain took a deep breath, raised the crystal ball high, and ferociously said, "Trial? Heh! I'll kill every single trial challenger. No matter how many come, I'll kill them all and turn this place into a graveyard for challengers. Let's see just how many challengers you can send, ahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Any sympathy for the villain instantly vanished. The five dimensional travelers' expressions turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>The villain sneered, "Come on, the crystal ball is in my hand. I'll let you know what cruelty really means."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a female dimensional traveler suddenly took out an identical crystal ball and excitedly held it up, "My displacement swap skill succeeded! I got the crystal ball, mission accomplished, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The other four dimensional travelers also looked excited, "Great, let's hurry and leave this place, exit combat and return immediately."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the five turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The villain looked at the crystal ball in his own hand with disbelief, "What? I was tricked? When did that happen, I didn't sense it at all. It must have been that woman's skill."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand something and fiercely chased after the five, "I can't let them escape, I want them all dead!"</p><p></p><p>The villain was far stronger than the five dimensional travelers. Soon he caught up to them from behind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing they couldn't outrun him, the five immediately turned back and threw various skills at him.</p><p></p><p>The villain casually tossed aside the crystal ball in his hand, took out his long spear weapon, and in a few moves shattered all the skills, "Die!"</p><p></p><p>Then the villain saw the five rush back towards the 'fake' crystal ball he had thrown away.</p><p></p><p>The villain was stunned for a moment, "???"</p><p></p><p>But he quickly realized what had happened, "Damn, I fell for it!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately tried to summon the crystal ball back, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>He saw a man with extreme speed snatch the crystal ball, exclaiming excitedly, "Got it! This BOSS is an idiot, just a little trick and he fell for it."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the five got the crystal ball, completing the final task, they didn't hesitate and chose to return.</p><p></p><p>The villain looked around at the empty space, his mind echoing the dimensional traveler's final words:</p><p></p><p>"The BOSS is an idiot..."</p><p></p><p>"An idiot..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't catch his breath and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, "Puh!"</p><p></p><p>Holding his long spear, he feebly howled to the sky, "Ahhh—"</p><p></p><p>"The tenth batch—this is too much bullying—"</p><p></p><p>The villain's tears finally streamed down shamelessly as he cried like a 300-pound child.</p>

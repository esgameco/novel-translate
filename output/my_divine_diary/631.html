        <h1>Chapter 631</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Racing cars is actually not a very challenging thing for the four of them, who are extremely powerful cultivators. But just operating vehicles and competing in pushing their performance to the limit serves as a bit of diversion in their monotonous immortal lives.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Hao planned to call Axing and Awang, but seeing their declining vigor, he decided against it, worried he might throw out their backs...</p><p></p><p>In the end, the result of the four-person race was that all four cars were wrecked, but the four of them were completely fine!</p><p></p><p>Recalling the scene from countless years ago when he lost control of his car and died, he still felt regretful.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao forced himself not to reminisce about people and things from the past, not to recall the joys and sorrows of before. So many years had passed, surely all of that had dissipated like clouds.</p><p></p><p>On that blue planet, it was questionable whether there were still any humans left!</p><p></p><p>"Forward! Forward! Forward!"</p><p></p><p>Don't look back, can't look back, there is only one path ahead under your feet!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the laboratory, Su Hao sat upright on a chair, closing his eyes to enter the particle space to review his original plan.</p><p></p><p>The first goal of 'using matter to generate sources' had been achieved; the second of 'transforming sources into matter' was preliminarily completed; the third, finding the 'catastrophe system' with himself as the focal point, then controlling and resolving it, had not yet begun with no leads...</p><p></p><p>"The previous third goal was: finding a way to destroy a planet with one punch. Later, thinking my catastrophe was actually the focal system itself, I thought I could quickly detect clues and then crack it.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems I was too rash, I can't even sense the traces of the universe's energy flow..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a bit, then added a goal before the third: destroy a planet with one punch.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find the 'catastrophe system' and crack it, that meant in sixty years the asteroid might arrive, and with his current abilities, he could handle smaller planets but not massive celestial bodies!</p><p></p><p>Imagining is nice, but actually doing it is so difficult!</p><p></p><p>Convert a large amount of sources into energy to detonate?</p><p></p><p>Sources are powerful, but that requires having enough sources, and powerful enough spiritual energy to transform all the sources into energy.</p><p></p><p>Even with Su Hao's current spiritual energy, he couldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Su Hao inwardly said: "It seems I can only use the 'source chain reaction' method I thought of before to destroy it."</p><p></p><p>Design a system like a domino chain, where just pushing the initial piece causes the falling force to accumulate, eventually able to easily topple dominoes hundreds of meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Other than this, Su Hao couldn't think of any other way to destroy a planet for now.</p><p></p><p>But exactly how to design this 'source chain reaction', Su Hao had no clue.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, took out a source bead to carefully observe in his palm while pondering feasible solutions.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, he stood up and paced around the lab, but still had no ideas, so he muttered: "Forget it, these things just need a flash of inspiration. I'll go to space first and practice on a few planets! Who knows, maybe after pounding on them I'll figure it out? And I can land on the other planets in this star system to see their environments, maybe I'll gain something!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time since his reincarnations that he decided to land on lifeless planets! Crucially, no matter how harsh the environment, he was confident he could survive on them.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the planets had matter!</p><p></p><p>Just that simple, just that confident!</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was about to head to other planets to practice his punches, Yashan sent over a large file: "Old Master Wei, the framework design for the spacecraft is done, take a look first and see if there are any oversights."</p><p></p><p>Long ago, Su Hao had assigned Yashan the task of transforming the current 'base small world' into a fully functional spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>The space inside the base small world was immense, with the land diameter over 30 km - it was the original gourd world moved and stuffed entirely into Su Hao's small world.</p><p></p><p>But from the outside, the base small world only appeared to be 3 meters across!</p><p></p><p>In the future, the group would ride this spacecraft to venture into the vast cosmos.</p><p></p><p>But constructing such an enormously huge spacecraft was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just producing the framework design alone took a tremendous amount of time, the result of Yashan inviting a professional and massive mechanical design team to collaborate.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened the design and casually replied: "Let me take a look first! I'll give you feedback in the group chat after reviewing it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took the construction of the spacecraft very seriously, after all it would be their basis for survival for thousands of years to come.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the overall spacecraft design was critical - once the design wasn't done properly, it would be extremely difficult to modify after construction began.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Su Hao carefully examined the design Yashan sent over.</p><p></p><p>This design was just for the spacecraft's overall structure and framework, with many details still unrefined.</p><p></p><p>The design was divided into many parts, with various perspectives and a 3D model.</p><p></p><p>The overall design concept, which Su Hao had previously discussed with Yashan: take a spherical shape, divided into upper and lower sections. The upper maintains its original appearance as a small island, with a domed sky of blue and clouds, sun rising and setting. The lower section is hollowed out as a massive metallic world to house various necessary equipment.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had clearly followed Su Hao's instructions, producing an exquisite design that should be flawless. But after reviewing it, Su Hao still felt something wasn't quite right, that it could be further optimized.</p><p></p><p>Like the typical client looking at designs: I don't know what's wrong, but if you change it, it'll be right!</p><p></p><p>Rigidity was something Su Hao always disliked, preferring 'flexibility' and 'spontaneity'!</p><p></p><p>It's like the design of a three-bedroom apartment, with the rooms facing south, east and west respectively - you can sleep whichever direction you want, very good and powerful.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao wasn't satisfied. For example, if he was used to sleeping in the east-facing room but suddenly wanted the south one, did he really have to get up from bed, put on shoes, walk to the south room, and get into that bed?</p><p></p><p>So this is the problem with the three-bedroom design! Why can't the three rooms just move to the designated direction themselves? Does the owner really need to move around?  What's even the point of three rooms then?</p><p></p><p>That's rigidity!</p><p></p><p>Yashan curiously asked: "What needs to be changed?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Su Hao switched to the Heart Source Priest's skills, pulling the room into his mind's dreamscape. With a casual tap, a model of the base small world floated before them.</p><p></p><p>"Yashan, look, this is your design. Overall it has no issues and can fully achieve the functions I want. But one point still needs changing - the entire spacecraft is too 'rigid', with no room for adjustment. Everything must proceed step-by-step, without any freedom."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was completely baffled, staring blankly as he couldn't understand what Su Hao meant by 'rigid'.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Su Hao projected another base small world model, continuing: "What I mean is, divide the planet into regular cubic modules that can move along set tracks, able to swap positions at any time...</p><p></p><p>Let the interior of our spacecraft flow like water..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan, do you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan immediately got it, clapping his hands together: "I understand now, Old Master Wei! It's just like that sliding puzzle game 'Klotski' I used to play, following certain rules to move pieces and get the designated tile to any position."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Exactly that concept!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan admired: "As expected of Old Master Wei, how did I not think to design it this way?"</p><p></p><p>It's not that he didn't think of it, but that his OCD wasn't deep enough...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked: "Will this design be difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan pondered for a moment, then said: "It will be difficult, but difficulties are worth taking on as challenges. Don't worry Old Master, I'll work on it first, and consult you if any problems come up."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled with satisfaction: "Once you complete this task, you can truly call yourself a master designer!"</p>

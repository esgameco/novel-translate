        <h1>Chapter 761</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The war between humans and the Eight-Armed Race was proceeding as Su Hao had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race also inevitably met their curtain call, which was irreversible.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the moment Su Hao opened his eyes in this world, the outcome of today was already decided.</p><p></p><p>The historical trajectory of the Cloud Ring System in the universe had completely diverged, heading towards another unknown.</p><p></p><p>After arranging the final mission for Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, he entered the second-level world again, coming to the Pinball Space to begin upgrading the 'Light of the Universe'.</p><p></p><p>He no longer paid attention to matters outside after that.</p><p></p><p>What he did not expect was that not long after, the Avatar [Eight-Armed God] controlled by Ya Shan and Feng Cheng suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan coughed and said, "Well, Master Wei, the Eight-Armed Race's warships had space interference devices activated the whole time, greatly limiting our spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>Although we could still teleport and flash thanks to our powerful spiritual force, our flexibility was greatly reduced. After destroying many of their warships, they found our weakness and blasted us to pieces...</p><p></p><p>The more times we did it, the more they found our patterns. It became increasingly difficult to fight, so we just came back.</p><p></p><p>We originally thought [Eight-Armed God] could crush their warships, but it turned out not to be the case. In the vast universe without free spatial abilities, [Eight-Armed God] was at a clear disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said, "Right! I also felt that without spatial abilities, we would be at a disadvantage against the Eight-Armed Race's warships. The few times I got taken out was because my spatial abilities were restricted."</p><p></p><p>"The space interference ability again?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had also suffered a loss before against the Eight-Armed Race's space interference, and now encountering it again, he thought to thoroughly solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's understanding of space, through years of research, was incomparable to before. After some thought, he had a plan to counter it: "The principle behind the Eight-Armed Race's space interference device is essentially using energy blocks to vibrate space, which works well against 'curvature navigation' by disrupting the balance needed for ships to successfully enter curvature navigation state.</p><p></p><p>As for our abilities like 'teleportation', 'flashing', 'second-level space' etc., it happened to affect the oscillation of our spatial modules by chance, preventing us from using them smoothly.</p><p></p><p>So, as long as we solve the issue with the spatial module's oscillation, it'll work."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan curiously asked, "How do we solve it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "The isolated space structure of the mini-world can reduce the vibrations from space interference to some degree."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan didn't understand, "But Master Wei, I tested it before, space interference makes the mini-world very unstable..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Stability is not needed, the purpose of the mini-world is just to isolate the space interference vibrations. As long as you can use it as a springboard to use various spatial abilities, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao's guidance, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng had a flash of realization.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Master Wei, you mean before using spatial abilities, we temporarily set up a mini-world structure around ourselves first. It doesn't matter if it's unstable, as long as it can temporarily isolate the two spaces.</p><p></p><p>This way, we can ensure the stability of the area we're in, and successfully use all spatial abilities."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Exactly, the mini-world cannot last long under space interference, but it doesn't matter as long as it's temporarily useful. Moreover, as long as you grasp the timing, you can ensure an undefeated position."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Previously without an external brain, such multi-threaded operations could not be used in the ever-changing battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different, operations that seemed very complex could be split up and completed separately by them. Turning complexity into simplicity.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Try it?"</p><p></p><p>The two grinned, "Let's try!"</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao and the two came to a vast space.</p><p></p><p>"Kaka ka!"</p><p></p><p>The pink crystal armor encased Su Hao, then formed a special formation which immediately emitted a faint glow once formed, with a special vibration spreading outwards from the formation.</p><p></p><p>It was the Eight-Armed Race's 'space interference' vibration.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng immediately felt something different, the surrounding space modules became chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The two worked in perfect sync, activating their core runes and coordinating with their spiritual tentacles to instantly form a mini-world structure around themselves, isolating the inner and outer spaces.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the space they were in immediately stabilized in that instant.</p><p></p><p>'Flash'!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two simultaneously flashed and disappeared from their original spots, reappearing 100,000 meters away.</p><p></p><p>The skill activation speed was extremely fast and smooth to use, without any clumsiness from the space interference.</p><p></p><p>They flashed again, appearing in front of Su Hao, mentally transmitting: "Master Wei, it really works! The whole process just added one step of setting up the mini-world structure, not affecting usage at all."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Good, go find the Eight-Armed fleet and get some payback!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng left excitedly!</p><p></p><p>Many seemingly difficult problems could be solved with some thought, and seemingly powerful opponents could be defeated by changing perspectives.</p><p></p><p>"I have become so powerful now."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, Su Hao finished upgrading the 'Light of the Universe'.</p><p></p><p>The core code remained unchanged, just reclassified and reorganized based on his own abilities, while optimizing the original system structure to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the 'Black Room' upgrade met his ideal requirements.</p><p></p><p>In addition to strengthening the Black Room's defenses, he utilized his ability to decipher consciousness information to add a program called 'Insinuation'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the Black Room gained a reconnaissance function that would stealthily guide the consciousness using the Black Room's capabilities if the scanned consciousness information met certain conditions, cleverly hiding the Pinball Space from the target's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to someone looking for a cup one second, then getting called by someone, turning around, and forgetting what they were doing when they turned back.</p><p></p><p>Through extensive experiments, Su Hao found that under 'Insinuation', even if the cup was placed right in front of the test subject, they would selectively ignore it. When 'Insinuation' was canceled, the test subject would suddenly discover a cup in front of them in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Besides test subjects, he also did a timed experiment on himself.</p><p></p><p>The result was that during 'Insinuation', he almost forgot he had something called the 'Pinball Space'...</p><p></p><p>After adding this function, the Black Room became incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>During these five years, the Eight-Armed fleet was almost completely wiped out, with only a few ships fleeing the human domain and returning to their colony planets, relentlessly pursued by human warships, as if vowing not to stop until the Eight-Armed Race was extinct...</p><p></p><p>It seemed this game of cat-and-mouse would continue for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps just like how the Eight-Armed Race chased humans and the Compound Eye Race years ago, except now the roles were reversed - humans became the big cat, and the Eight-Armed Race the little mouse.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the era of the Eight-Armed Race had ended!</p><p></p><p>It was only now that Su Hao asked Ya Shan about the progress of his research.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan first shared the current research results, then explained: "Master Wei, referencing the neural module of the Mother Bug, I successfully built an external spiritual brain and tried connecting the spiritual external brain to my nervous system.</p><p></p><p>The computing power could be greatly enhanced, but I could not produce 'sub-consciousnesses' like the Mother Bug's neural module.</p><p></p><p>Nor did I get that feeling of 'omnipotence' from the expansion of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>From the test results, the spiritual external brain seems much weaker than the neural external brain."</p><p></p><p>After reviewing Ya Shan's data, Su Hao found no issues with the spiritual external brain he made, which could completely simulate the functions of neural cells. But he didn't know why the results were not as imagined.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Hao shook his head: "Take it slow, perhaps for the brain, we can't just consider functional issues. Compared to nerves, the spiritual external brain may lack initiative."</p>

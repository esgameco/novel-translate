        <h1>Chapter 945</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>While Yashan and Fengcheng were chatting idly, Yashan's disciple found his miniature avatar staying in the palace.</p><p></p><p>The elf king Vari paid his respects, saying, "Greetings, master. Master, after careful verification, we have completed the task of building the 'World Passage Hundred-Person Team'. Now there are a total of four hundred and thirty hundred-person teams capable of carrying out the space passage construction task. The extra portion is because after some disciples completed the construction of the first batch of hundred-person teams, they started a mentor-mentee program to recruit more disciples."</p><p></p><p>Yashan opened his eyes with a pleased expression, "Very good, you all have exceeded my expectations."</p><p></p><p>He sent Vari the latest version of the 'World Passage', saying, "This is the updated latest version, which should be the final confirmed version. Take it and have all the disciples practice and familiarize themselves with it, and prepare to put it into practice."</p><p></p><p>After receiving it, the elf king Vari asked, "Do we need to continue recruiting for the hundred-person teams?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied without hesitation, "Of course, keep recruiting, it would be best if we could double the current number."</p><p></p><p>Vari said, "Understood, master."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Hao, who was in the experimental base, looked at the coin-shaped metal block in his hand with an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this newly made 'invisibility coin' can achieve the effect of invisibility in the ill-fated system. Well then, let's go out and try it!"</p><p></p><p>After years of research, he found a way to transmit 'error information' outward with his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>That was to create an 'invisibility device' that could match his consciousness information, and integrate it with his underlying consciousness to form a complete whole.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the focus of the ill-fated system would no longer be just the consciousness, but the 'consciousness + invisibility device'.</p><p></p><p>And this invisibility device connected to the consciousness had only one function: to synchronously output 'useless signals' pointing in different directions with the consciousness, disrupting the entire 'ill-fated system', and allowing the focus, the traveler, to become 'invisible'.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the balance of the run-line would still be broken, and under the inertia of the galactic correction, the energy would still be fed back, but without a focus, all the fed-back energy would be dispersed over a larger area, and the resulting chaos could even be ignored.</p><p></p><p>It's like the same force applied - the larger the area it acts on, the smaller the pressure.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the force, once dispersed across an entire galaxy or even an entire galaxy cluster, it would become negligible.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao went to a galaxy with a balanced run-line, found a planet with not too harsh an environment, casually took out a [Divine] avatar, installed a spirit brain, then retrieved an ordinary consciousness information from the 'recycle bin', and slowly imported it into the [Divine]'s spirit brain, sealing off some of the spirit brain's powerful functions.</p><p></p><p>After checking that everything was correct, he hid his form and observed from the side.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the [Divine] avatar woke up and opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I... I am Cao Shilang, I'm not dead? Where is this? Why am I here, where are my teammates?"</p><p></p><p>He was full of confusion, trying to get up, but completely unable to control this powerful body, and soon the body lost control, with crimson crystal vines spreading everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang: "???"</p><p></p><p>He was completely dumbfounded, highly suspecting that he had transmigrated into a non-human species, his mind filled with thoughts of 'what to do'.</p><p></p><p>He started trying to control the body, quickly retracting the spreading crystal armor, stretching out his hand and clenching it, delighted: "Successfully controlled the hand, let's keep trying."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed from the side for a long time, and after confirming that this experimental subject had indeed been locked onto by the run-wave, he casually tossed out the 'invisibility coin'.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>With a crisp sound, Cao Shilang suddenly found an extra smooth double-sided coin in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang was astonished, turning his head to look around. Here there was nothing but yellow sand and exposed rocks, not a single blade of grass in sight, like a dead land.</p><p></p><p>He raised the coin in front of his face to examine it carefully: "The question is, where did this coin come from?"</p><p></p><p>He felt that something was amiss, whether it was his body, the environment, or the coin that had suddenly appeared in his hand, everything seemed strange.</p><p></p><p>But with even his body not under his control, he was powerless to do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a moment, Su Hao thought to himself: "It has automatically connected to his consciousness and started releasing 'useless signals'. Just need to wait for a while to see the results."</p><p></p><p>While Cao Shilang was puzzled for a moment, he still had no clue, so he put away the coin and focused on mastering control of his body.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, he had basically mastered the basic usage of the body, regained a human form, and randomly chose a direction with the wind to explore further.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what this place is, it's all yellow sand and rocks, without even a trace of moisture. I must leave here as soon as possible and find a place with people, otherwise continuing like this, I'll eventually die.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this body I've transmigrated into is extraordinarily powerful, and it seems to have many more functions waiting for me to discover. It's as if I've occupied an abandoned celestial body, unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>The body he now possessed contained immense power, which made him secretly delighted, feeling like he had hit the jackpot.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he learned the art of flight, controlling the body to fly rapidly, hoping to find a trace of life on this land.</p><p></p><p>However, he failed. Even after flying continuously for a month, he not only found no sign of life, but not even a drop of water, and if not for his powerful body, he would have died of thirst long ago.</p><p></p><p>"What is this place? Why is there not a single person, not a single living creature, nothing but yellow sand and rocks, and the endless yellow wind..."</p><p></p><p>He had flown up into space, looking down at the entire planet, and after a simple calculation, he realized that at his flying speed, he had already circled the planet more than a dozen times.</p><p></p><p>It was this discovery that gradually plunged him into despair.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I'm trapped on a desolate planet, and I may gradually walk towards death in this loneliness and despair..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao was stationed in a corner of the planet, quietly observing the state of the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that Su Hao finally confirmed that his 'invisibility coin' had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not rush to make a conclusion, but instead planned to continue observing the subsequent changes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Hao revealed his form, flashing to appear beside Cao Shilang.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang stared blankly at Su Hao, joy gradually spreading across his entire face, excitement causing his whole body to tremble uncontrollably. He opened his mouth, but seemed to have lost the ability to speak.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is one of my experiments, observing some things through you. I need you to live here alone for two years. After two years, I'll take you away from this place and gift you this body, teaching you how to fully master it."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he casually tapped Cao Shilang's forehead, leaving a double-ringed imprint.</p><p></p><p>"I've opened a personal space for you, where you can take enough supplies to survive. Of course, there's also a red trigger in the space. If you find the loneliness unbearable, you can press that red trigger and choose to end your own life.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and that coin on your body, don't lose it, keep it with you at all times."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Su Hao added, "If you really can't stand it, you can vent your frustrations on this planet. See you later."</p><p></p><p>With that, Su Hao transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang raised his hand and made a grasping motion, his eyes flickering with a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>He threw back his head and let out a loud roar, venting the despair he had felt over the past month. At this moment, his heart was filled with hope.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was still hope, two years was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>What he feared most was wandering alone on this planet, dying in silence.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the experimental base, Su Hao spent another year manufacturing over a thousand 'invisibility coins', then put the 'invisibility coins' up for sale in the newly arrived travelers' mall, allowing those who had just transmigrated to exchange for these coins.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he renamed the coins 'Lucky Goddess' Lost Currency'. Effect description: Negates luck and ill-fortune, maintains normality. Price: 10 merit points.</p><p></p><p>If they really work well, he can raise the price later...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly transmitted to the Cruciform Star, entering the soul force network's heaven, and sent a message to the eighteen deities: "Honorable deities, shall we gather?"</p><p></p><p>When the deities suddenly heard Su Hao's summons, they were almost overjoyed to tears.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god! Lord Leian hasn't forgotten us!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 790</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng, who had been playing wildly outside, finally returned.</p><p></p><p>The two of them excitedly told Suhao about the interesting things they had encountered over the past few decades out there.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was fine, he just changed his identity to an ordinary person's avatar and traveled around the galaxy, engaging in various interesting activities like skiing in the mountains, diving, surfing, and other high-tech stunts.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was more exaggerated - he reverted to his true nature, relying on his good looks to go philandering on various colony planets, seducing all kinds of breathtakingly beautiful women. He became a new age Casanova, even seducing many top celebrities famous throughout the galaxy. He was exposed for having multiple lovers at once, causing a huge scandal.</p><p></p><p>On the internet, some cursed him as a philanderer, but he also had many adoring fans who respectfully called him "Brother Hai."</p><p></p><p>It even got to the point where many girls considered it an honor to be seduced by Fengcheng...</p><p></p><p>Truly, the moral decay of the times.</p><p></p><p>Even Yashan couldn't stand it anymore: "Fengcheng, how many innocent girls have you corrupted? Don't you have a conscience?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng spread his hands helplessly: "Well...it is a bit unconscionable, but it was all consensual, passion overtaking reason..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said speechlessly: "You're just too passionate."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng coughed and said, "Ahem! It's just a personal hobby, haha, a hobby!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan suddenly asked, "Did you leave any children behind?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was startled: "No, no, I'm careful about that sort of thing, how could I possibly leave children behind?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Then why did I see many women online bringing their children to ask you to acknowledge paternity?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this made Fengcheng angry: "Those weren't mine...how shameless of them to bring other people's children to ask me to acknowledge paternity, damaging social mores, people's hearts have become so depraved..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed and said, "Fengcheng, if you're curious, having a child isn't impossible, haha. I can help you arrange for any talents you want."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "No need, Master. Beautiful women are one of my hobbies, but raising children isn't. I'm fine being alone, it would feel very strange to suddenly have a child out of nowhere."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought of his own few children and disagreed: "Fengcheng, you're still young, you don't understand. Some things, feeling averse or afraid of them is meaningless. Whether good or bad, you need to really try it yourself to know if you want it or not."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked in surprise: "Big brother Yashan, I remember you mentioned having children before? It's hard to imagine you as a father."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily: "I have two daughters and two sons. But it's been so long, they must have passed away already!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng muttered: "In that case, should I consider raising a child just to try it out?"</p><p></p><p>As he thought about it, he shuddered and shook his head vigorously: "Never mind."</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly with them for a while, Suhao said, "Have you had enough fun? Are you in the mood to do research now?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng seemed to have had their fill of fun for now, and answered in unison: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded and sent them each a task: "Yashan, your task is to research how to defend against the particles ejected from a black hole eruption, by any means necessary as long as it's effective. Think about the specific plan yourself.</p><p></p><p>"Fengcheng, I'm assigning you to research more powerful 'gravity arrays'. I've sent you my previous research on gravity arrays and experimental processes for reference. Keep optimizing them."</p><p></p><p>As Yashan and Fengcheng received the materials from Suhao, they answered in unison: "Received, Master!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, fifty years passed.</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi consecutively traversed three worlds, testing the new 'spirit brain' developed by Suhao.</p><p></p><p>This almost made Niu Yingzi think that he had a special ability to keep traversing different worlds. What he regretted was that the rules in each world seemed different - the superhuman abilities he learned in the previous world became useless after traversing to a new one.</p><p></p><p>This made him very puzzled: why was this the case? What was the deal with these strange worlds he was traversing?</p><p></p><p>Niu Yingzi's spiritual realm gradually elevated. His goal shifted from 'living happily with the ladies' to the current 'exploring the world and unraveling the secrets of reincarnation'. His thinking also became more mature.</p><p></p><p>This made Suhao laugh wryly: "Niu Yingzi's experiences are similar to mine! The two of us have similar experiences, but the essence is different. Simply put, I have more opportunities and a higher ceiling, while his opportunities are few and the ceiling he can reach is not high."</p><p></p><p>As for whether Suhao had ever suspected that there was another pair of eyes watching him from outside the universe, he had of course considered it more than once in his deductions. The conclusion he reached was: no.</p><p></p><p>He was the most special one.</p><p></p><p>If this structure was extended like a pyramid scheme, then Suhao believed he was at the very top.</p><p></p><p>For him, this should be good news.</p><p></p><p>At least he didn't have to worry about someone suddenly appearing to end his journey of exploration.</p><p></p><p>The results of Niu Yingzi's experiments greatly disappointed Suhao.</p><p></p><p>The conclusion from the three experiments was: the spirit brain had extremely powerful learning and thinking abilities, but could not produce spiritual power like psychic tentacles or psychic thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Suhao then thought that this might be related to the human 'spiritual power gene', but still could not find the key.</p><p></p><p>After much research, he still could not find the crucial factor, so he thought: "Perhaps there are too few experimental subjects. I need to increase the number of consciousness data samples. I can gather more consciousness information and place a group of people in the same world to compete with each other. Maybe someone can break through the spiritual power barrier. For the sake of comparison, I'll divide them into three experimental groups - one continuing to use neural brains, one using spirit force brains, and one using spirit brains."</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it would be a group traversal...</p><p></p><p>With more experimental subjects and more objects to observe, there might be unexpected surprises.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Then one day, Niu Yingzi suddenly found himself traversing to a new world again. </p><p></p><p>This was already the fourth traversal. He calmly got up and observed the surrounding environment, analyzing strategies to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the youths lying around him also gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this? Didn't I die?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are there only brats here who haven't even grown hair yet?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember dying, but I guess I didn't die completely. Hahaha, I'm just too tough to die, screw it!"</p><p></p><p>"What the fuck, who can tell me where the hell this place is? Daring to play tricks on me, are you tired of living?"</p><p></p><p>"Shit, why did I become a girl? Where's my little brother down there?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over at the girl in unison: "???"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream rang out.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze was drawn over again to a tall, square-faced youth who was screaming: "Why did I become a guy? The thing in my pants is so disgusting!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was so shocked their eyes almost popped out.</p><p></p><p>And Niu Yingzi was completely dumbfounded, staring at these cursing youths, as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>He tentatively said, "Ahem! Is it possible that we've all traversed to another world?"</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>One by one, the traversers stated which planet in the Cloud Ring system they were from, confirming that everyone present was from there.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone was excited about traversing and thought about how to make a big splash in this new world, doing whatever they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the one who had accidentally become a girl cursed as he walked up to the tall, square-faced youth: "You bastard, did you possess my body? Otherwise, why would I become a girl?"</p><p></p><p>The square-faced youth was tall and powerful-looking, but unfortunately a complete coward. Startled, he let out a shriek: "Ah, pervert!"</p><p></p><p>Then he instinctively thrust his palm forward.</p><p></p><p>*Bang!*</p><p></p><p>The male-turned-female was slapped and spun around twice before crashing heavily to the ground. No matter how he tried, he couldn't get back up, just whimpering.</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh——"</p><p></p><p>Everyone jumped back in fright, retreating far away from the female youth.</p><p></p><p>Only Niu Yingzi's expression darkened as his mind raced, unable to make sense of the current situation.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the others, thinking inwardly: "These people might cause trouble, maybe I should find an opportunity to get rid of all of them...No rush, I'll observe for a while first, at least until I figure out why there are suddenly so many traversers."</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his violent thoughts and naturally put on a warm smile: "By the way, is it possible we're all from different eras? What year did each of you die?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After launching the virtual world, Suhao no longer cared what these traversers planned to do. He would just occasionally observe and collect information.</p><p></p><p>The important thing was to collect data from the various brains two or three decades later, compare the differences between neural brains and spirit brains, and find the reason why spirit brains could not give birth to multi-dimensional spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>As for why Suhao had female avatars modeled as males, and vice versa for males as females - </p><p></p><p>This stemmed from one of his guesses: perhaps by having females and males swap bodies, they could break through the spirit brain's limits and successfully unleash spiritual power?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Suhao thought this possibility was low, but it was worth a try.</p><p></p><p>So when adjusting the virtual world settings, he casually swapped them.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he didn't think too much about it.</p>

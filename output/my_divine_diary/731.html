        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The crisis of this invasion by the Octopus fleet has been completely eliminated.</p><p></p><p>After this, an inexplicable confidence arose in the hearts of all humans. Everyone's eyes shone with brilliance, and scenes of revelry were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In many human settlements, the night curfew was exceptionally lifted. People sang and danced at night, praising the achievements of the 'Heavenly Savior Xu Shiqiang'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, legends about a 'God descending to the mortal realm' spread...</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao refused a series of celebratory activities, but this did not affect Xie Qingjun and others from holding a grand celebration, while sparing no effort in singing praises of Xu Hao's might.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, humans received a message from the Compound Eye race, full of praise for the humans' strength, while also expressing doubts: Why have humans become so powerful? Are they hiding something from the Compound Eyes, their qualified allies? This is not proper ally behavior.</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun and others learned of this, they smiled faintly. Communication was decisively cut off before the war, but right after victory they proactively reached out, accusing humans of hiding capabilities - playing the game of seeking benefits and avoiding harm exquisitely.</p><p></p><p>Were it not for the Compound Eyes' special nature and some remaining usefulness, Xia Qingjun would not have bothered engaging with them.</p><p></p><p>However, humans were no longer the Compound Eyes' underlings. The situation was different now - if not their superiors, humans at least held a relatively equal and leading position.</p><p></p><p>What had previously most concerned Xia Qingjun was that once humans became extremely powerful, the Compound Eyes might steal human teleportation technology and pass it to the Octopuses as a means to counter humans...</p><p></p><p>As long as humans kept growing stronger, this was entirely possible.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed the Compound Eyes had failed to obtain complete human teleportation technology.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun chuckled, "It appears our encryption technology has had an effect. The years of investment in the 'Compound Eye Screening Program' have paid off."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be careless. The Compound Eyes may be finding ways to get our technology!"</p><p></p><p>Another person also laughed, "The Compound Eyes demand we share the technology with them. Heh, I don't think they have the intelligence to understand it even if we gave it to them!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"We can create some false impressions, give them some seemingly plausible but fake stuff to ponder over! Real or fake, fake or real!"</p><p></p><p>"Good idea!"</p><p></p><p>"Can we locate the Compound Eyes' home planet?"</p><p></p><p>"We've narrowed it down to around 1,200 suspected planets. We could pinpoint the location if we wanted, but we're not acting on it yet to avoid arousing their suspicion."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, we must remain vigilant."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two years later, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng returned.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan reported, "Captain Wei, we've cleared out all the Octopus colonial planets, big or small, within 800 light-years. A total of 223 colonies, no stragglers left according to human calculations."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smacked his lips, "Those 'Star-Shattering Cubes' are ruthless. Every time I saw an entire planet destroyed by a tiny cube, my hair stood on end."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded in agreement, "Indeed, this must be the power of knowledge! Captain Wei once said true power is but a manifestation of knowledge. Before witnessing the Captain's 'Star-Shattering Cubes', I wouldn't have believed anyone could so easily destroy a massive planet."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng expressed some regret, "The colonies the Octopuses chose were not bad - mostly seized from other spacefaring races after exterminating the natives.</p><p></p><p>These planets each had unique characteristics, far superior to the ones we encountered in our previous life. It's such a pity to simply destroy them like this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Feng Cheng, Xu Hao realized he was right - it was indeed a great pity to so easily destroy so many habitable worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, the Octopus colonies were too numerous, their population rivaling even the Star-Devouring Worms...</p><p></p><p>Clearing them out one by one would be enormously time and labor-intensive, and success was not guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Xu Hao said, "The seventh-level Demonic Human ability 'Fierce Child' from the [Residual Toxin] sequence has a chance to awaken a 'Gene Virus' capability that can identify and precisely kill lifeforms with a specific gene segment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps we can approach this from that angle, studying the Octopuses' 'Pesticide' technique and combining it with the 'Cubes' dropped on colonies. We could exterminate the Octopuses without impacting the colony's ecology and environment."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes lit up, "Good idea! Wasn't the destruction of the Source Planet in the previous life due to a chain reaction in the atmosphere? We can design 'Atmosphere Modification Cubes' to disperse this gene virus into a colony's atmosphere to carry out the purge."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao nodded as he formed a complete modification plan in his Sphere of Possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng, with his keen perception, grasped the crux during this simple conversation. Stunned, he muttered, "The two Captains are truly formidable. A weakling like me can only feel 'regret', 'pity', 'helplessness' when facing problems...</p><p></p><p>True experts seek solutions when confronted with problems, while super-experts can find solutions at the fastest pace.</p><p></p><p>I need to learn from the two Captains and become a super-expert myself."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao and Ya Shan clearly heard Feng Cheng's self-murmuring and chuckled, "Your learning ability has greatly improved! In the past, you wouldn't have noticed these subtleties."</p><p></p><p>Human growth appears to happen through sudden transformations after major setbacks, but is actually the accumulation of tiny day-to-day progressions that eventually reach a critical tipping point.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng had been growing all along, which Xu Hao and Ya Shan could perceive.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed sheepishly, "Indeed, I have improved. It's precisely because of this improvement that I realize the gap between the two Captains and myself!</p><p></p><p>No matter how intelligent a [Prophet] I am, the gap is just too vast. As I strive to catch up, I find that while I'm making efforts, the two Captains are also constantly progressing..."</p><p></p><p>What frustrated Feng Cheng most was that his pace of pursuit might not even exceed the Captains' pace of advancement...</p><p></p><p>So when would he ever catch up?</p><p></p><p>"We might as well take this opportunity to study the Octopuses' 'Pesticide Cubes' technology."</p><p></p><p>Once this technology matures, Xu Hao would possess not just the ability to exterminate the Octopuses, but any species whose gene segment he obtains - provided they are lifeforms that store information genetically.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this assumes the species uses genes as an information storage medium.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao asked Feng Cheng, "Any results on locating the Compound Eye home worlds that I tasked you with previously?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng replied, "There are over a thousand suspected planets. I've eliminated 600 of them. In a few more years, I should be able to pinpoint their location."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said, "Good! Once you find it, don't alert them first. I have great use for this race."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In just half a year, Xu Hao had developed 'Pesticide Cubes' specifically targeting the Octopuses. He handed them to Feng Cheng, saying, "Feng Cheng, go test these out on an Octopus colony."</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Feng Cheng's report came back: "Captain Wei, it's highly effective. Within a day, all the Octopuses on the planet were wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, I haven't seen any spaceships around the Octopus colonies I've encountered recently! I suspect the larger Octopuses had already fled on ships, leaving the poor and powerless ones stranded on the planets to die."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed, "That must be it. Who wouldn't flee in such a situation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao sent over some materials, "This is the simplified manufacturing process for the 'Pesticide Cubes'. Pass it to Xia Qingjun and have him mass produce qualified products to be sent here for final sealing into Source Pearls. Let them handle the task of clearing the Octopuses from now on!</p><p></p><p>Oh, and just to be safe, have them quickly establish enough teleportation arrays between the Blue Light and habitable planets, so they can rapidly evacuate if anything goes out of control."</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Ring system was far too vast. Limited by human numbers, completely clearing the Octopuses would take hundreds if not thousands of years. Xu Hao and his companions only needed to maintain the overarching direction to prevent any major changes.</p><p></p><p>The day human fleets could deploy teleportation arrays across the entire Cloud Ring system would mark humanity's dominance over it.</p><p></p><p>And once humans dominated the Cloud Ring, Xu Hao would gain immense conveniences:</p><p></p><p>Like being able to move freely through the Cloud Ring via the human teleportation network.</p><p></p><p>Like accessing information humans collected from life-bearing planets to filter out useful technologies...</p><p></p><p>The crisis of this Octopus fleet invasion has been completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>After this, an inexplicable confidence arose in all humans' hearts. Everyone's eyes shone brilliantly, with scenes of revelry everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In many human settlements, night curfews were exceptionally lifted that night for singing, dancing, and praising the achievements of the 'Heavenly Savior Xu Shiqiang'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, legends of a 'God descending to the mortal realm' spread...</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao refused a series of celebratory activities, but this did not stop Xie Qingjun and others from holding a grand celebration while sparing no effort singing praises of Xu Hao's might.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, humans received a message from the Compound Eye race full of praise for human strength, while also expressing doubts: Why have humans become so powerful?

Clearing them individually would be enormously laborious and time-consuming with no guarantee of success.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Xu Hao said, "The 'Fierce Child' seventh-level Demonic Human ability from the [Residual Toxin] sequence has a chance to awaken a 'Gene Virus' that can identify and kill life with specific gene segments.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps we can approach this from that angle, studying the Octopuses' 'Pesticide' technique and combining it with colony-dropped 'Cubes'.

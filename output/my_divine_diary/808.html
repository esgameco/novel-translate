        <h1>Chapter 808</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>To the north of the Heavenly Prairie was the Clouds Dividing Mountain Range, and even further north beyond the Clouds Dividing Mountains was the ocean.</p><p></p><p>The place where Mother Dragon Shaduo brought the three young dragons including Suhao was right at the intersection of the Clouds Dividing Mountains and the ocean.</p><p></p><p>This was the farthest place Shaduo could think of from humans and danger.</p><p></p><p>The cliffs here were not like ordinary flat coastal cliffs. They were not only immense and seemingly endless, but also appeared even more complex due to erosion by the seawater.</p><p></p><p>In Shaduo's view, this place could hide her three children.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still not completely safe, not only because many human ships passed through these waters, but also because her previous experiences told her not to stay in the same place for too long, otherwise the evil humans would easily discover them. They had to move to a new location every month.</p><p></p><p>Mother Dragon Shaduo led the three young dragons through the intricate hollowed-out cliffs and quickly found a suitable location.</p><p></p><p>It was an inconspicuous cave hidden among the rocks. Calling it a cave was inaccurate, as from the outside it looked like a long ledge, like two uneven stones stacked together, with a crevice formed in between. However, inside the crevice was a spacious grotto, even more spacious than their previous nest.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this was the nesting place of a group of giant sea eagles. After the arrival of the red-gold dragon Shaduo, the giant sea eagles politely vacated the location, and this secluded grotto became the nest of Shaduo's family.</p><p></p><p>After getting off Mother Dragon Shaduo's back, the eldest dragon brother Chipu and second sister Moli happily frolicked in their new home, clearly very satisfied with this larger space.</p><p></p><p>Shaduo instructed the three young dragons not to play near the edge of the crevice to avoid falling into the sea. She then lay down at the edge of the crevice and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The night's flight carrying the dragons had almost exhausted her strength.</p><p></p><p>After the mother dragon fell asleep, Suhao explored inside the cave and surprisingly found a giant sea eagle's nest deep inside, with three olive-sized eggs in the nest.</p><p></p><p>Suhao picked up the three eggs, his eyes gradually lighting up: "These are three freshly laid eggs, which can be used to create [Divine Eggs]. Let me see if there are any more." </p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to go look, he noticed the two young dragons waddling over.  He was about to say "Don't play with and break these bird eggs," but knowing their mischievous nature, telling them not to do something might make them want to do it even more.</p><p></p><p>So he decided it was better to just transfer the eggs directly into his pocket dimension.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the two young dragons, Suhao transmitted the three eggs into his experimental pocket world.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons stared blankly again.</p><p></p><p>They ran around Suhao, as if trying to see where he had hidden the eggs.</p><p></p><p>But the giant dragon's body was bare, so where could he possibly hide such large eggs?</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother Chipu curiously asked, "Third brother, where are the eggs?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled and stretched out his paw in front of him, saying, "Right here!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a huge egg appeared out of thin air on Suhao's paw.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chipu was about to touch it with his paw, the egg suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>This time he saw clearly that the egg had simply disappeared into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Suhao sent out his spiritual sense, and with Xiaoguan's assistance, quickly located the other bird eggs in the cave and swiftly transferred all of them into his pocket world. Including the previous three, there was a total of twenty-five eggs.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-five eggs. Even excluding any that may be damaged in failed experiments, it's enough for me to successfully obtain [Divine Eggs]."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take out an egg to begin his research, he suddenly remembered that there were more than a dozen "dragon poachers" imprisoned in his other pocket world.</p><p></p><p>So he sent his spiritual sense into that world to observe for a moment and found that these people, apart from being somewhat dispirited mentally, were still in decent physical condition. Most importantly, they still had some water, so they could probably hold on for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>"Since Mother Shaduo is here, I can't teleport away or she might worry too much. I'll wait until she leaves before dealing with these people and learning about their soul arts."</p><p></p><p>Suhao found a dry, flat area, took out one of the eggs, infused it with his blood essence, and recorded its information into his dimension of marvels.</p><p></p><p>Then he put away the egg, entered the dimension of marvels with his consciousness, and began analyzing the egg.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the two young dragons were each holding a stone in their paws, practicing the skill of making things disappear...</p><p></p><p>In the end, they found the only way to make the stones disappear was to close their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As long as they closed their eyes, the stones instantly vanished. When they opened their eyes again, the stones reappeared - an ability remarkably similar to their third brother's.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As evening approached, Mother Dragon Shaduo woke up. She knew she had to go out and find food now.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, she gathered the three young dragons and slowly said, "During the time I'm out, you are not allowed to roar loudly, or you may attract powerful predators who could snatch you away. On this outing, I will return before the sun sets tomorrow at the latest.</p><p></p><p>Children, we are the great and mighty Golden Dragon Clan, but you are still too young to protect yourselves well. So you must hide yourselves well until I return."</p><p></p><p>Then she specifically instructed Suhao, "Leian, my child, you are the most intelligent and sensible one. If Chipu and Moli make noise, you must stop them. If an enemy you cannot resist invades, take your brother and sister and flee. We are born swimmers and can escape into the sea to evade enemies. But do not go too far from the shore, for there are also many ferocious enemies in the ocean. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "I understand, Mother Shaduo."</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Mother Dragon Shaduo had left, Suhao flashed into the pocket world where the humans were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons watched in bewilderment as Suhao suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After entering the pocket world, Suhao found the more than a dozen people lying scattered about, looking listless and dejected - a far cry from the arrogant demeanor they had just days ago.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Suhao, they mustered some spirit at the urging of the big-bearded Xibo and struggled to their feet, forming a ragged line.</p><p></p><p>Suhao spoke in the human language, "You all look rather weak. Are you hungry and thirsty?"</p><p></p><p>His grammar had some errors, but big-beard Xibo and the others understood Suhao's meaning and were stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed possible for a dragon to learn the human language after using the "Language Soul" technique. </p><p></p><p>But this red-gold young dragon, judging by its size, was at most a month old. For a one-month-old dragon to know the human language? Preposterous.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, big-beard Xibo and the others had a guess: "Could it be that this young dragon already has a master who used the 'Soul Rebirth' technique to revive it?"</p><p></p><p>If so, everything would make sense. The abilities they had witnessed earlier were not the dragon's own, but rather the "soul arts" possessed by the person who had used "Soul Rebirth" on it.</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of soul art could unleash such powerful and miraculous abilities, and why the reborn being could master such formidable power so quickly...</p><p></p><p>The prowess of a great figure was something these "dragon poachers" could not fathom.</p><p></p><p>This guess resolved the doubts they had harbored for days. At the same time, they inwardly lamented their misfortune - why did they have to capture this particular dragon?</p><p></p><p>Big-beard Xibo almost instantly understood the key points and unconsciously forced an ingratiating smile onto his face: "Your Eminence, this lowly one named Xibo has poor eyesight and offended you unforgivably. We deserve to die for this transgression. This bit of hunger and thirst is simply our deserved punishment."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he took the lead and knelt down, prostrating himself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the members of the Golden Horde team did not hesitate and also knelt down in unison. Even the soul cultivator Weiya knelt down decisively.</p><p></p><p>When the situation favors others, it's best to lower one's head, and perhaps they could live. Moreover, bowing to an eminent figure was not shameful.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had not expected this outcome either, but since these people were willing to submit, all the better. He did not explain anything further.</p><p></p><p>The golden scales on his feet rippled, and a long table and more than a dozen stools rose up from the ground. Bowls, plates, and cups gradually appeared on the table, enveloped in a radiant glow that turned them all into a metallic luster.</p><p></p><p>Big-beard Xibo and the others could not help but look up, puzzled: "What is this young dragon eminence doing?"</p><p></p><p>But before their doubts could fully form, they heard Suhao say, "Let me get you some food first. Eat your fill and regain some strength, then I have some questions for you to answer truthfully."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Suhao channeled a large amount of source energy from the source pearl within his body. Amid swirling rainbows of light, the energy transformed into pure water, filling the cups on the table.</p><p></p><p>The sound of water splashing into the cups reverberated in the hearts of big-beard Xibo and the others.</p><p></p><p>But it did not end there. Flashes of multicolored light continued to appear above the table, and when the light faded, numerous white cube-like objects precisely landed on the plates.</p><p></p><p>Suhao retracted his paw and calmly said, "These are nutritional substances that can quickly replenish your strength. Eat something first, and I will return later."</p><p></p><p>With that, he flashed away from the pocket world.</p><p></p><p>Big-beard Xibo and the others were utterly numb by this point: "..."</p><p></p><p>Xibo's face twitched uncontrollably as he inwardly berated himself: "Damn it, I was wrong. This is no mere eminence - it's clearly a divine being!"</p><p></p><p>But no matter how Xibo racked his brain, he could not think of any deity capable of creating objects from thin air.</p><p></p><p>His heart was shaken: "Just what is this young dragon...and why would it reincarnate into such a feeble young form?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 880</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister carefully recalled the journey they had taken, immediately realizing the strange things about Su Hao and the other two.</p><p></p><p>For instance, where did they get their food and water? Those three horses seemed to have never stopped to eat grass. The road was rugged, yet the carriage was incredibly steady. Those powerful mountain bandits who fell for no apparent reason...</p><p></p><p>The siblings were terrified. Taking advantage of Su Hao and the others not paying attention, they quietly left.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao and the other two, they didn't mind. After arriving in the Western Kingdom, they idled about, grasping the basic situation of this world within a few days.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was very satisfied with this world, smiling and saying, "The human foundation in this world is quite good. As a dimensional traveler, it should be very suitable.</p><p></p><p>I was worried before that this world was in a backward old era, that the people here were sluggish and uncivilized, with too low an ability to accept new things, making it difficult for the Crucis to grow smoothly. Now it seems my worries were unnecessary."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also said, "With a martial foundation, it is indeed much better."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Old Master Wei, what kind of people will you take over?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wasn't sure either, "It depends on fate, whether they are suitable or not, we'll have to try to know! I'll just pick some young people on the verge of death to take away. Alright, I'll handle this matter, you two go back and mind your own business!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng soon left the Blue-Purple Star, while Su Hao concealed his form, rising into the air. His divine consciousness enveloped the entire planet as he began screening suitable 'dimensional travelers'.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the first step had to be taken.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At dusk, two young people with short hair were chased into an alley by a group of people wielding knives. They ended up in a dead end, completely blocked in.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Chicken, we can't run anymore, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken tightened his grip on the bloodied knife, saying solemnly, "A Zhi, it seems our brotherhood ends here today. Having you as a brother in this life, I have no regrets."</p><p></p><p>A Zhi cried emotionally, "Brother Chicken, I'll fight them, you find a chance to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken shook his head, "What are you saying? A Zhi, let's kill to our heart's content for the last moments of our lives!"</p><p></p><p>With a ferocious roar, he charged at the opponents with his knife. A Zhi also rushed forward with red eyes behind Brother Chicken.</p><p></p><p>Three seconds later, Brother Chicken and A Zhi were hacked down, soon losing their lives.</p><p></p><p>That group of people sheathed their knives mockingly, "Just a couple of wild brats, daring to freeload at the Red Flower Building? And even violently attacking our people, pah! Deserved to die."</p><p></p><p>The concealed Su Hao retracted his hands from Brother Chicken and A Zhi's heads, murmuring, "Recorded a freeloading youth. Need to collect some more, accumulate more materials."</p><p></p><p>Those dying from jianghu vendettas, poisoned by jealous husbands and adulterous wives, killed for witnessing thefts, falling from heights, battling mountain bandits, illness, fright, choking, suffocation...</p><p></p><p>In this world, at almost every moment, there were always some unlucky souls quietly passing away.</p><p></p><p>In just a month, Su Hao had recorded the consciousness information of hundreds who died from all sorts of causes, with very diverse experimental samples.</p><p></p><p>"The current number is enough, time to return to the Crucis and test the effects!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was about to transmit back to the Crucis, he suddenly paused, involuntarily turning his head in one direction, "Oh? Isn't that the Cong siblings? How did they end up nearly beaten to death in just a few days, so tragic."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flashed over, recording the consciousness information of the brother and sister.</p><p></p><p>"These two assassins from the Meng Kingdom were quite tricky, I almost fell to them."</p><p></p><p>"Daring to impersonate the Princess and Prince Consort's children, that's the first time I've seen such a strange pretext to get close."</p><p></p><p>"With the esteemed Prince Consort recently injured, there are bound to be many assassins trying to take this opportunity to make an attempt. As the Prince Consort's guards, we must be more vigilant. If anything happens to the Prince Consort, we'll be in deep trouble."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, hey! They still have a breath left, hurry and finish the job."</p><p></p><p>In her last moments, Cong Shuleng heard the guards' conversation and tears of anguish slid from the corners of her eyes, her heart extremely puzzled, "Why did this happen? Is the Western Kingdom really that good? Why didn't you go back to see mother? Why didn't you come back to see us? I want to tell you in person that I hate you! I'm not resigned to this..."</p><p></p><p>The siblings were soon dealt the final blows, dying completely.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was not Cong Shuleng, unable to empathize with her experience and pain, only able to lament the vicissitudes of life.</p><p></p><p>No matter which world, it was extremely difficult to find something perfect.</p><p></p><p>Injustice, suffering, adversity, even despair, these were all very common occurrences. The reasons for such adversities befalling one could not be explained by anyone.</p><p></p><p>This was also why many believed in 'past lives'.</p><p></p><p>If one acknowledged not having done anything unrighteous in this life, yet unfair adversities kept descending, feeling the pain of being born in this world at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Other than believing one was an extremely evil person in a past life, and this current life was spent enduring suffering to atone for past sins, what other solution was there?</p><p></p><p>On this point, even Su Hao found it hard to explain why it was so.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I'm just an ordinary person struggling amidst fate as well."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head to dispel these thoughts, he transmitted back to the Crucis.</p><p></p><p>"Time to prepare, the first dimensional traveler to the Crucis - Chicken! Hope you don't let me down."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>*Ding dong*!</p><p></p><p>With excitement and curiosity, the deities opened their task panels:</p><p></p><p>"'Birth of the Child of Worlds':</p><p></p><p>Task: Constantly monitor the World Will's actions. Ensure the World Will grows smoothly without being detected by it.</p><p></p><p>Time limit: Fifty years.  </p><p></p><p>Reward: 10,000 merit points for every ten years survived.</p><p></p><p>Notes: 1. The birth of the World Will will definitely not be smooth sailing, it must go through all kinds of adversities. So the deities must constantly observe it in secret, not letting any danger take the World Will's life. Of course, you also can't let the World Will's growth be too easy, give it suitable difficulties and pressures at times to spur its active growth.</p><p></p><p>2. The World Will's name is Luo Lin Ma Di, sometimes calling itself Brother Chicken.</p><p></p><p>Please accept the task promptly."</p><p></p><p>"Whew - 10,000 merit points, gonna get rich!"</p><p></p><p>"What World Will, I've never heard of this before? Is there really such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>"The task description says after we remade the world over a thousand years ago, it allowed the World Will a chance to awaken. Meaning we're all the World Will's parents, we'll have to be called father and mother later."</p><p></p><p>"Feels quite interesting, we'll jointly raise a child together?"</p><p></p><p>"Speak properly, what nonsense is this. Can't you see we're bodyguards and villains? Don't add your own subplots. You guys can play family if you want, I have no interest, don't drag me into it."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, protecting it from accidental death is being a bodyguard; giving it difficulties to experience setbacks is being a villain. Simply put, we're just a bunch of high-level labor."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, as long as there are enough merit points, even being low-level labor is fine."</p><p></p><p>"Let's accept the task first, we can discuss how to go about it. Hehe, I've thought of many ways to create difficulties, definitely going to make the World Will miserably pained and crying out loud."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see where this Luo Lin Ma Di, Brother Chicken is? Oh my, quite a spirited little fellow."</p><p></p><p>Under the deities' keen attention, on a gold panning settlement of the Celestial Meadows, a five-year-old boy slowly opened his eyes and quickly scrambled up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I'm...not dead? I remember taking at least ten stabs, one chopping into my neck, one stabbing into my heart, there's no way I could still be alive. But honestly, the girls at the Red Flower Building were amazing, being able to have that fling was worth dying for this wretched life."</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken quickly checked his body, soon finding something amiss, "Why did I...turn into a child?"  </p><p></p><p>Pulling down his pants to check, he was relieved to see it was still there, "Phew, the fun is still there."</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder what exactly happened, a clamor came from afar, in a strange language that he mysteriously understood.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, call someone! Just now there was a cave-in at a gold mine, someone got buried inside, any later and they'll die!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry hurry hurry!"  </p><p></p><p>"Seems it was Mick Mardy's gold mine."</p><p></p><p>"Shovels, quick get the shovels..."</p><p></p><p>Curious, Brother Chicken followed the voices to watch the commotion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the person buried inside was pulled out, but had already stopped breathing.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly a bearded man walked over to Brother Chicken and said, "Little Mardy, your father met with misfortune. We all tried our best. You know, doing this kind of work, these things happen from time to time. Just last month I had to send off an old friend, never thought it would be your father's turn today.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, your father struck quite a bit of gold these past few days, enough for you to live on for a long while. Little Mardy, your father was my best friend, his passing grieves me deeply. If you're willing, you can come live with me, I'll raise you like my own son."</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken was completely dumbfounded, "That's my father lying there?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luo Lin Mardy's dazed look, the bearded man sympathized, "Of course, I'll also take care of your mother."</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken: "......"</p><p></p><p>Brother Chicken said nothing, his mind a jumbled mess, completely unable to make sense of what was happening.</p><p></p><p>He had an extremely familiar feeling towards these people before him, yet was lucidly aware he didn't actually know any of them, much less the dead man lying there.</p><p></p><p>"Previous life? Past memories? Reincarnation? The afterlife?"</p>

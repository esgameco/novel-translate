        <h1>Chapter 700</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>'How popular was the name "Super Hero Xu Shiqiang" on Planet Blue?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps using the word "popular" itself is inaccurate, the word "blazing hot" would be more fitting.</p><p></p><p>The name "Hero Xu Shiqiang" had already reached the level of being known to everyone several years ago, with a reputation that had almost reached the pinnacle for humans.</p><p></p><p>He had also become the true idol in countless people's hearts. No one didn't dream of one day being able to pilot a spaceship and blast the Octopus Clan into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Of course, dreaming is one thing, but having the courage to actually do it is another matter.</p><p></p><p>But this did not affect their admiration for Xu Shiqiang at all.</p><p></p><p>Not long after "Hero Xu Shiqiang" became blazing hot, the video of Su Hao completely annihilating five Octopus Clan warships came back, causing all of humanity to seethe with excitement.</p><p></p><p>They no longer called him "Hero Xu Shiqiang", but instead called him "Super Hero Xu Shiqiang"!</p><p></p><p>And today, the Yaostar Warship has returned! Super Hero Xu Shiqiang is back!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not know that his return had made human emotions soar. He just calmly observed this special planet through the video inside the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>This was another miracle star in the universe that could naturally evolve life.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "So, what's so special about this planet?"</p><p></p><p>He did not know much about Planet Blue, only having a simple understanding from the fragmented memories of the original Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>Such as 'The Human Republic is the unified administrative organization of humans', 'Military and civilian technology are highly advanced', 'Life is regular and convenient', 'Everyone can find the meaning of their existence', 'Lights and activities are prohibited at night', 'Everyone is a good person worth protecting', 'Parents and younger sister don't want me to become a starship soldier', 'I want to prove my courage', etc.</p><p></p><p>There were only general concepts, with more scattered trivial matters, unable to form a complete understanding of Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>To gain more understanding, Su Hao would have to go and learn about it himself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Captain Yan and Xiao Chang came to Su Hao's side and watched the video together with him.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan suddenly said, "Da Qiang, you don't seem happy to be back on Planet Blue. Don't you want to come back?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled lightly, "Of course I want to come back, but coming back was within my expectations, so there's nothing to be happy about. Or rather, what makes me happy is elsewhere, not just being back on Planet Blue."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang glanced at each other, both seeing the puzzlement in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan spread his hands, "I really can't understand the thought processes of you geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang said, "Perhaps it's because he was too excited before, so now he's in a period of excitement fatigue, in a state of neither desire nor sorrow, neither joy nor sadness. Just like me, when I had just finished warp travel, I was excited for three days and three nights, but afterwards I became listless."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said, "Then why are you still so excited now?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang: "Just thinking about how famous I've become makes me uncontrollably excited! Captain Yan, imagine, everyone who sees me looks at me with admiring eyes, then praises me, especially those beautiful ladies...I can't take it!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan struck back: "What does it have to do with you? The famous one is Da Qiang, you're just a supporting role next to the hero."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang laughed foolishly, "Being a supporting role is good enough, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao suddenly asked, "Captain, let me ask you something. This time when I return to Planet Blue, I want to resign. Do you know how to apply for that?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang were both stunned: "Huh? Resign?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "Yes, after this patrol mission, I found that I'm more suited to be a scientist researching technology rather than a soldier. So, I plan to apply for resignation and join the Science Academy."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang: "Huh? From a soldier to a scientist?"</p><p></p><p>This is like a great wizard suddenly telling everyone one day that he is actually more suited to be a warrior.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I think my learning and research abilities are quite strong. For example, the 'superpowers' you learned are my research achievements. My future life plan is to become a scientist."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan finally digested this and couldn't help cursing, "Damn it, Da Qiang you really are a jack of all trades, able to do anything. I can't figure out how you do it. I'm in awe! No wonder you're the badass who took down five Octopus Clan warships single-handedly."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang said, "I'm in awe too! My dad said a genius is someone who can do things ordinary people can't even imagine, that's why they're called geniuses. My dad named me Xiao Chang, hoping I'll always remember that I'm just an ordinary person, so I don't get carried away. He was absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan thought for a moment, then said, "Generally speaking, you can't resign until a certain number of years of service. But if you have outstanding achievements, you'll get one chance to apply for resignation. Da Qiang, you definitely meet the requirements. After we return, go to the Military Affairs Office to apply, there are standard procedures and templates. However..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang widened his eyes curiously, "However what?"</p><p></p><p>"However, if Da Qiang wants to join the Science Academy for research, you don't necessarily have to resign from the military. You can completely keep your military position and join the Science Academy. This way, you'll get even better treatment, and your studies and research will be much more convenient. I heard you can even apply for resources that ordinary scientists can't get approved for."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang widened his eyes, "It can be done like that? Then maybe I'll participate in scientific research too! I feel like I have a certain talent for scientific research."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan looked at Xiao Chang in shock, "You have a talent for research too? What have you researched?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang said, "For the past few years, I've been researching the 'Hypnosis Combat Method'. Using this method, I found that during combat, I can enter a highly focused state, similar to the trance when cultivating 'superpowers', yet different...Anyway, it's hard to explain clearly in a short time."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan was greatly discouraged. It turned out that among the squad, he, the captain, was the most inept. Then he asked himself, "What have I researched?"</p><p></p><p>Answer: Researched how to indulge himself after returning to Planet Blue.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Joining the research institute while keeping my military rank? That's a good idea, I'll adopt it!"</p><p></p><p>Joining the research institute was not Su Hao's goal. Su Hao's goal was to reach a deal with humans under an identity that humans could accept, in order to obtain all of humanity's technology.</p><p></p><p>What identity would be most suitable? Of course, the identity of a human researcher would be most suitable.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he easily obtain all of humanity's technology, but he could also use human power to help him complete his research projects with their assistance.</p><p></p><p>It was that simple.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he could not successfully learn what he wanted to learn, he could also use absolute violence to force the Republic Organization to cooperate with him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had come to this planet.</p><p></p><p>So from this day on, this planet would be under his control.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The spaceship landed.</p><p></p><p>The cabin door opened.</p><p></p><p>The captain led the way, the crew disembarked in an orderly line, stepping onto this land with their best spiritual demeanor.</p><p></p><p>In whatever formation they had boarded the spaceship, they now disembarked in that same formation.</p><p></p><p>Even if some squads had many vacant spots in the middle, those were the positions of fallen soldiers who had died. Although they were gone, they would forever be part of the Yaostar crew, their names forever bound to the Yaostar, recorded in human history.</p><p></p><p>This was the largest human spaceship military port, where ordinary people could not enter. The scene the crew had imagined of crowds welcoming their return did not appear.</p><p></p><p>Those welcoming them were the human leader and a group of high-ranking Republic Organization officials. As the Yaostar crew disembarked, the human leader and the others greeted them with a salute throughout the process.</p><p></p><p>The respect shown to the crew was indeed given in full.</p><p></p><p>"Attention!" The captain turned and barked loudly.</p><p></p><p>The Yaostar crew, with solemn expressions, saluted the welcoming group in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome the heroic soldiers of the Yaostar Warship on their return, the motherland welcomes you!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The return of the Yaostar Warship followed the highest standard welcoming ceremony protocol.</p><p></p><p>This was not a privilege that every returning warship could receive.</p><p></p><p>Only warships like the Yaostar, which had killed countless enemies and brought glory to humanity, had such special treatment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this welcoming ceremony was broadcast live globally.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like just the officials welcoming the heroes' return, but in reality, it was all of humanity welcoming the heroes back in their own way.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to the soldiers and officials at the welcoming site, there were also various photographers holding cameras.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao was quite puzzled to find that these photographers kept shoving their cameras in his face.</p><p></p><p>If they kept doing this, he wouldn't stand for it!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the photographers had their difficulties in repeatedly shoving their cameras in Su Hao's face.</p><p></p><p>Don't you see, the live broadcast chat was filled with messages saying: "I want to see Super Hero Xu Shiqiang!"</p><p></p><p>As photographers, respecting people's opinions is politically correct!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 747</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Not only did Suhao conduct research on the Planet of Gods and the Compound Eye Race, but the human side also dispatched a massive team to participate.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Suhao fully approved and told the captain that if the human side encountered any difficulties or progress, they could communicate with him.</p><p></p><p>Because what Suhao wanted was to unravel the mechanism of the 'Star Observation World' and integrate it into his own ability system, rather than monopolize the 'Star Observation World' for himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was destined to delve deep into the vast cosmos, his sights not limited to this small nebula system.</p><p></p><p>However, the human side's research did not proceed smoothly because although the Compound Eye Race had surrendered, they still held utmost reverence for their God Planet. Even in death, they would not cooperate with the human research.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Compound Eye people, the human research behavior was desecrating the divine.</p><p></p><p>Unable to defeat the humans, they had no choice, but to let them cooperate with the evil human research was impossible.</p><p></p><p>In the research process, whether the experimental subjects cooperated or not made a huge difference.</p><p></p><p>During Suhao's research break, the captain precisely found Suhao.</p><p></p><p>He asked with a hopeful face: "Great One, do you have any progress in your research on the Compound Eye Race? Have you figured out how they observe other planets?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded: "There has been some progress, but the specifics still need further research."</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes lit up: "Progress? What progress?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "I have successfully entered the 'Star Observation World' described by the Compound Eye Race through the Dream Stone. Indeed, as the Compound Eye Race said, one can clearly see the events happening on most planets in the nebula system.</p><p></p><p>However, I still don't know the principle behind producing this effect. It seems quite difficult to fully understand the principle for now."</p><p></p><p>The captain was dumbfounded: "Wh...what? Great One, you've already successfully entered the 'Star Observation World'?</p><p></p><p>How did you do that...the bunch of snobbish researchers we sent are still studying the 'Geo-Eye' of the Compound Eye Race..."</p><p></p><p>The captain knew Suhao's research ability was extremely strong, but he could still refresh his perception time and again.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, with the comparison, he realized where the gap lay.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "It's quite simple, just use spiritual power to enter the body of a Star Observation Priest, then you can see the 'Star Observation World' through its 'Geo-Eye'."</p><p></p><p>The captain realized: "I see, that's why...wait, no!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of a problem - using spiritual power to enter a Star Observation Priest's body and borrow its body to observe...isn't that essentially possession?</p><p>How is that even possible? It can't be done, right?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Suhao doubtfully: "Enter the Star Observation Priest's body?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao explained: "I forgot to mention, this is a new superpower I've acquired. I can use spiritual power to enter a Star Observation Priest's body. It's very normal, but you may not be able to do this."</p><p></p><p>The captain: "......"</p><p></p><p>He was speechless, feeling it was ridiculous to believe it, yet also feeling Suhao was telling the truth, very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Suhao added: "Captain, the Star Observation World is closely related to the Dream Stone, but not so much to the Compound Eye Race. The Compound Eye Race simply evolved the 'Geo-Eye', obtaining a ticket to enter the Star Observation World.</p><p></p><p>Our research direction need not focus on the Compound Eye Race. Not having a 'Geo-Eye' doesn't matter - we can just transplant one.</p><p></p><p>It's like not having a ticket to a concert - just snatch one.</p><p></p><p>So I think our research focus should be on the Dream Stone. Its properties gave rise to the Star Observation World."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded in agreement, then said: "But I heard the research team has already tried, and found nothing valuable from the Dream Stone. It's just like an ordinary blue crystal, with some special energy..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "That's normal. Our current understanding of many substances is very superficial and one-sided.</p><p></p><p>With our limited means, we can only know the limited physical properties, while the characteristics and connections buried within the substances remain unknown.</p><p></p><p>Previously, I also researched some Dream Stone samples individually and found nothing special either.</p><p></p><p>But the lack of findings doesn't mean the Dream Stone is just an ordinary stone. What we need to do is unearth what's hidden within."</p><p></p><p>The captain's plump face showed some confusion. As a career military man, he didn't understand this stuff. He just asked bewilderedly: "Then...Great One, what do you suggest we do?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "Since conventional methods don't work, we'll use a 'hypothesize-disprove' approach to gradually lock down its characteristics."</p><p></p><p>This method wouldn't work for researching ordinary substances, but it can work for the Dream Stone.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are ready-made 'Star Observation Priests' as verification tools.</p><p></p><p>The captain: "This...right!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't care whether the captain understood or not, and continued: "Later I'll organize my understanding of the Star Observation World, my comprehension of the Dream Stone, and the research strategy, then send it to you. You can pass it on to those research institutes for reference. If they have any findings, just feedback to me."</p><p></p><p>The captain understood this, which was precisely why he came to find Suhao this time. He smiled and said: "Rest assured, Great One, I'll notify you immediately of any findings."</p><p></p><p>After leaving Suhao's miniature world, the captain immediately found Xia Qingjun and briefly summarized the key points of what Suhao said.</p><p></p><p>However, Xia Qingjun's focus was slightly different from the captain's. The first thing he asked was: "Can we humans master this amazing reconnaissance technique?"</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately nodded: "According to Great One, yes! The Compound Eye Race's 'Geo-Eye' is just a ticket to enter the Star Observation World. We can snatch one if we don't have it!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's mood instantly soared. Slapping the table with his big hand, he said: "Good! With Great One's word, I'm reassured.</p><p></p><p>From now on, allocate more resources to the Star Observation World research project and quickly master this ability.</p><p></p><p>Also, do as Great One says. Whatever he tells us to do, we'll do it. If anything happens, he can handle it."</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Compound Eye Race had been deliberately causing trouble. The intelligence provided by the Star Observation Priests to humans was a mix of truth and falsehood, difficult to judge which was useful.</p><p></p><p>This also gradually caused humans to lose control over the Octopus Race, with the latest news about the Octopus Race stagnating at over a year ago.</p><p></p><p>So Xia Qingjun was also eager to quickly have human 'Star Observation Priests' to regain a grasp of the dynamics in the nebula system and gradually erode the Octopus Race's forces!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xia Qingjun's fundamental goal had some subtle differences from Suhao's fundamental goal.</p><p></p><p>What Xia Qingjun wanted was just for humans to enter the Star Observation World to observe the Octopus Race's movements, while what Suhao wanted was to thoroughly research the mechanism of the Star Observation World and eventually make it his own.</p><p></p><p>However, since the processes didn't differ much, Xia Qingjun wouldn't care too much about it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xia Qingjun's words, the captain's eyes narrowed into slits with a smile: "Great One can indeed handle anything. This big thigh of his is thick and fragrant. It even changes our way of doing things to be so blunt, from the previous subtlety."</p><p></p><p>However, he quite liked this bluntness.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Compound Eye Race would be happy with the upcoming various research efforts, that was something Xia Qingjun and others could not control.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they could do for this former ally was to ensure the continuation of its race and civilization.</p><p></p><p>But this would require paying a certain price in exchange.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Suhao successfully unraveled the neural structure of the Compound Eye Race's 'Geo-Eye' and mastered the technique of bridging the 'Geo-Eye' to his own brain's neural network.</p><p></p><p>But 'transplantation' was not Suhao's goal. What he wanted was for his own nerves to function like the 'Geo-Eye' and help him enter the Star Observation World.</p><p></p><p>So he further researched the 'Geo-Eye' neural cluster and soon made a discovery: the sensory nerve endings of the 'Geo-Eye' contained a special substance distinct from ordinary nerve cells.</p><p></p><p>Then he extracted this special substance from the 'Geo-Eye' nerve cells.</p><p></p><p>Research showed that this was a substance for sensing special signals.</p><p></p><p>This substance was very common on the Planet of Gods. He guessed it was a byproduct of the Dream Stone, able to sense special signals from the Dream Stone.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the principle of the 'Mind's Eye' Suhao had previously created, except that it could sense information within the blue crystal instead of fluctuations in the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Suhao called substances that could sense information from objects 'Seeker', and named the substance extracted from the 'Geo-Eye' nerve cells as 'Seeker One'.</p><p></p><p>Because he believed that in the cosmos, there would not only be 'Seeker One', but also 'Seeker Two', 'Seeker Three'...</p><p></p><p>Just like 'Perceiver'.</p><p></p><p>"Next, following the neural structure of the Compound Eye Race's 'Geo-Eye', I'll integrate 'Seeker One' into the neural system of my Octopus Race avatar, allowing it to possess the ticket to enter the 'Star Observation World'.</p><p></p><p>Then, I'll try creating a second Dream Stone using Source!</p><p></p><p>I think the Dream Stones on the Planet of Gods are not the only special ones."</p><p></p><p>As for fully researching the entire 'Star Observation World', Suhao knew he couldn't rush it.</p><p></p><p>It was like solving a math problem - he needed to first read through the question and find all the given conditions before he could gradually deduce the final result...</p>

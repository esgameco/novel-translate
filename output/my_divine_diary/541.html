        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Originally, I thought exchanging all the spirit pearls I had for money would be more than enough, but facts proved that I was overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>Relying on income from working a job to custom order a large piece of machinery...just the thought of it.</p><p></p><p>So, to really get rich and not worry about money, working a job won't cut it. Even if it's a high-risk, high-paying job like being a spirit master.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I need to find another way to make money!"</p><p></p><p>Legitimate businesses don't seem easy to do in this world. Robbing would be faster, but it also seems quite dangerous in this world with all kinds of bizarre abilities popping up everywhere, making it hard to guard against...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how to make money, Su Hao returned home and entered the billiard room space to look through the recorded books.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, Ya Shan sent a message: "Boss Wei, the mechanical design drawings are done. It's divided into 'spiritualization station', 'processing', 'sorting', 'synthesis', and 'encapsulation' sections. I've made it as compact as possible. Take a look first."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the files, Su Hao gave an acknowledgment, then carefully examined them. Finding no issues with the design, he began translating and annotating it in this world's language, then headed out.</p><p></p><p>Whether he could afford it or not, he still needed to get a quote from the manufacturer first. With a target in mind, it would be easier to go make money.</p><p></p><p>He first bought a thick stack of paper, then used composite runes to draw the various component diagrams onto the paper. After numbering and organizing them, he set off with the design drawings to the address provided in Gu Yin's letter of introduction.</p><p></p><p>Walking would take about two days, but since Su Hao could fly, he didn't even need to transform into his Celestial Body form - just casting a wind technique was enough.</p><p></p><p>There were plenty of spirit masters who could fly, so he didn't need to worry about standing out too much.</p><p></p><p>The factory Gu Yin introduced was called Huchang Changqing Factory, located in the eastern suburbs of Huchang City.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had been to Huchang City before when he was looking for suitable hosts for Ya Shan and Feng Chengzai.</p><p></p><p>After a little over an hour, Su Hao landed outside a factory compound in the eastern suburbs. After circling around, he found the main entrance with a sign that read "Hengxuan District Huchang City Changqing Advanced Giant Machinery Manufacturing Group".</p><p></p><p>Sounded very powerful. It seemed they should have no problem manufacturing the machinery for Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he approached, someone immediately came to block him: "Hey kid, what are you doing here? Scram!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao directly took out the letter of introduction to explain his purpose, saying: "I'm here to commission some machinery from the factory. Please help pass the message to the person in charge."</p><p></p><p>Without the letter of introduction, Su Hao might have had to force his way in. But with the letter bearing the Association's seal, it was different.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the letter, the person no longer obstructed him, instead pointing in a direction: "Go in that way, you'll see a reception room where someone will receive you."</p><p></p><p>A portly middle-aged man who introduced himself as Old Hu warmly received Su Hao after seeing his letter, providing tea and all proper hospitalities without slighting him for his young age.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't bother with niceties, directly handing over the design drawings: "These are the designs for the machinery I want to commission. If possible, please give me a rough quote so I have an idea of the cost."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan had already removed the critical parts from these drawings, leaving only common mechanical components for sorting and synthesis. So Su Hao didn't need to worry about the drawings being leaked.</p><p></p><p>The value of these drawings was simply that the structure was ingeniously designed, clearly the work of a master - nothing too special. Even if they took the drawings, it didn't really matter.</p><p></p><p>Old Hu was inwardly shocked when he looked through the drawings. He had originally thought it was just some young master wanting to make some toys and planned to give a casual quote to brush him off. But he never expected it to be so serious.</p><p></p><p>The designs were clear, neat, and extremely ingenious. All the parameters were very detailed, and the mechanical structures were unprecedented. With his experience, he could tell the imaginative designs were undoubtedly from a master's hand.</p><p></p><p>Although not a professional himself, after being in the industry for so many years, he had a decent eye for this. He said: "Please wait a moment, I need to call in our professional mechanical design engineers to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Then he left with Su Hao's drawings.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a balding old man rushed in hugging Su Hao's drawings, directly addressing him: "Are you the one wanting to make this machinery? Who did these designs? It must be a top designer! It's hard to imagine what kind of genius, with a mind containing the universe and stars, could create such an ingenious design!</p><p></p><p>When I first saw these design drawings just now, you may not know, but it was like my mind was opened. All sorts of brilliant design ideas came rushing out, almost setting this old bones ablaze..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Old Hu: "......"</p><p></p><p>Old Hu awkwardly explained to Su Hao: "He's our factory's chief designer, Old Ying. He's always been like this, Young Master Su, please don't mind him."</p><p></p><p>Old Ying glared: "What do you know? Do you understand the value of these designs? If you don't, then don't speak."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man: "......"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao directly asked: "Chief Designer Old Ying, if I want to produce this whole set of equipment, how much would it cost?"</p><p></p><p>Old Ying waved his hand dismissively: "What cost? If you have it made at our factory, it'll be free!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged Old Hu was shocked: "Hey hey hey! Old Ying, Old Ying, you need to calm down! How can we not charge for something like this? With a wave of your hand, we'd be out millions! Can you really just wave your hand like that? How are we going to pay the workers' wages? Even if we don't count labor, there are still material and energy costs - that's money!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately put on a smile for Su Hao: "Young Master Su, please don't take offense. Old Ying doesn't understand anything. Let's continue our discussion, I'll handle this."</p><p></p><p>Old Ying immediately started ranting again: "Nonsense! What do you know? Can the value of the ideas and structures in these designs be measured in money? Do you know that the innovative ideas here could spark a whole wave of revolution in machinery? A few million? Are you stupid? Could a few million buy these designs? Just absorbing the innovations in this machinery alone could increase Changqing's revenue by tens of billions at least!"</p><p></p><p>Old Hu was almost coughing up blood from being berated, hurriedly saying: "Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. But could we discuss this later? Let me first give a quote and settle on a price..."</p><p></p><p>Old Ying: "Are you an idiot? What price..."</p><p></p><p>Old Ying then went on another rant berating Old Hu, leaving Old Hu questioning his life choices.</p><p></p><p>Old Ying used to seem quite normal before. Why was he suddenly acting so erratically today, like he was possessed? And while the designs were indeed valuable, couldn't he have waited until after the client left to slowly discuss it?</p><p></p><p>At his age, he still didn't understand the principle of making a fortune quietly. He really was barking up the wrong tree!</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao heard the mention of "a few million", he couldn't help but feel pained. This whole setup would cost millions? Even Lingyuan currency wasn't that worthless!</p><p></p><p>He had previously learned he obtained over two million and felt a secret delight - he had finally made a decent sum through his own hard work.</p><p></p><p>Turns out he was overthinking again! He couldn't even afford a single machine!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao finally gave up on the idea of getting rich by working as a spirit master clearing disasters. To make money, he would still need to form a team and earn it legitimately!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao made a firm decision: "How about this? I'll provide the materials to make the machinery, then have it produced at your factory. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Old Ying immediately agreed: "Deal! On the condition that you introduce me to this designer."</p><p></p><p>The increasingly bald Old Hu was losing more hair: "Hey hey hey~ no need to be rash, let's discuss this properly..."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Old Hu, Su Hao said: "The designer? That's easy, his name is Jia Ya Shan. He doesn't talk much, I'll introduce you two later. But I only have two hundred million, will that be enough?"</p><p></p><p>Making the introduction would save a lot of trouble, so why not?</p><p></p><p>Old Ying waved his hand grandly: "Enough! You don't need two hundred million, one hundred million is enough!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Good, deal!"</p><p></p><p>Old Hu said helplessly: "Old Ying, this...how do I explain this to the factory director?"</p><p></p><p>Old Ying: "You stay out of it, I'll handle the explanation."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao left Changqing Factory feeling very satisfied. He never expected this trip to go so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's spirit herb cultivation was already showing initial results. Once the machinery was successfully produced, they could mass-produce spirit pills in large quantities. At that point, the time needed to reach the Celestial Being realm would be greatly reduced!</p><p></p><p>In a light mood, he opened Ya Shan's communication log: "Ya Shan, I've introduced you to a temporary job where you can supervise the production line at this factory."</p><p></p><p>Then he casually snapped a photo of the factory.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "What? A temporary job? [Dog head question mark]"</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling he was about to go work at a factory.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 805</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The members of the Fugui squad who were closely watching Su Hao's figure were all stunned: "The young dragon? How did it suddenly disappear? Were we seeing things through the crystal?"</p><p></p><p>Before they could figure it out, the next second the young dragon reappeared in front of them with a 'swoosh'.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo and the others: "???"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, they could see Su Hao's figure flashing back and forth in the hatching room, faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo's eyes were dazed.</p><p></p><p>What was that move?</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo roared in his heart: "What the hell is this 'young dragon'? To hell with this young dragon! I'd rather face ten adult dragons than deal with this kind of young dragon!"</p><p></p><p>From then on, Big Beard Xibo developed a phobia towards this creature called a 'young dragon'.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao became more and more proficient with 'flashing', his flashing speed increased, and he was no longer confined to the giant dragon's nest.</p><p></p><p>'Flash'!</p><p></p><p>With a brief glance, he saw many dangling ropes.</p><p></p><p>Then, he activated the 'perception' rune, and within two seconds, he sensed all the aura reactions within a six thousand meter range.</p><p></p><p>The two Fugui squad members who had run away were three thousand meters away.</p><p></p><p>'Flash'!</p><p></p><p>The two skinny guys were so startled by Su Hao's sudden appearance that they leapt backwards, staring at Su Hao's appearance, as if wondering whether to try and capture him.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao didn't waste words with them, raising his paw.</p><p></p><p>'Level 2 - Lightning'!</p><p></p><p>The two collapsed limply to the ground, their weapons clattering as they slipped from their hands.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took two steps closer and struck them with two more lightning bolts, leaving them shuddering uncontrollably, unable to even groan.</p><p></p><p>Then with one in each hand, he used his aura to construct balancing spells and flashed back to the hatching room.</p><p></p><p>To the astonished gaze of Big Beard Xibo and the others, he casually tossed the two down.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Big Beard Xibo and the rest were utterly hopeless, having been completely captured with no prospects. Their lives were shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>From now on, they could no longer view the 'young dragon' creature with normal eyes.</p><p></p><p>This 'dragon theft journey' of theirs was more fantastical than a fantasy novel.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo, Geya and the others thought to themselves: "I'm never doing this 'dragon thief' job again..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao lightly tapped his feet, using the Transformative Adamantine Shell to seal the two, then ignored them and tried to construct a 'small world'.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not a core rune imprinted on the body, using it still feels a bit awkward and unnatural, lacking that smooth feeling. But if I slow down, I can still build the small world properly."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a small world with only a five kilometer diameter was constructed, held in Su Hao's hand and appearing only basketball-sized.</p><p></p><p>The light from the crystal dome lamp shone down, entering the small world and being refracted by the spatial structure, revealing the basketball-sized small world.</p><p></p><p>Then another scene that shattered the Fugui squad's perception of reality appeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually picked up a crystal-encased human and tossed them into the small world.</p><p></p><p>"Tossed...tossed them in?"</p><p></p><p>If not for the crystal shell, they would have popped their eyes out.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to say something, but their mouths were blocked, unable to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>Then came the second one.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao reached out to grab that Fugui squad member, the man was terrified, eyes bulging with bloodshot veins, breathing rapidly and growling something from his throat.</p><p></p><p>That fear was like being dragged into hell for torture.</p><p></p><p>However, the terror was useless - unlike in comics, he couldn't unleash some hidden power, break the crystal shell and escape. He was smoothly tossed into the small world by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "I can't teleport everyone into the small world at once, so I'll have to stuff them in one by one. It's troublesome, but there aren't many people!"</p><p></p><p>But to Big Beard and the others, this scene was utterly terrifying. What was that small crystal ball? What horrible thing was inside that a huge person could be stuffed into it without resistance?</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that before dying, they would suffer such mental torment.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Fear comes from the unknown about one's own cruel future fate. Knowing might make them less afraid?</p><p></p><p>Ahem! Or maybe not, knowing some things could make the fear even greater.</p><p></p><p>After stuffing everyone into the small world, Su Hao flashed to the cliff and found a spot with loose soil. He transformed his Adamantine Shell to cover that large patch of soil, then controlled it and stuffed it into the small world, laying down a thick layer of earth.</p><p></p><p>After roughly settling the dozen or so humans, he brought the small world back to the cave nest.</p><p></p><p>The cave was now in disarray, with the young dragons Chipu and Moli still unconscious and tightly bound in chains.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao released the two young dragons from their bindings, but didn't wake them up, thinking: "When Mother Shadu returns, she'll definitely notice the abnormalities in the cave. I'll just maintain the current state and truthfully explain the situation. That way, she won't mind how I dealt with those people or where they went."</p><p></p><p>With that decision, he stopped thinking about it and entered the small world instead.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so humans wrapped in adamantine shells were now lying haphazardly on the dirt, and upon seeing Su Hao enter, they looked at him like a devil.</p><p></p><p>After recording all their consciousness information into his Bouncing Space, Su Hao removed the crystal shells restraining them.</p><p></p><p>After being freed, the Fugui squad members didn't rashly try to attack Su Hao. Instead, they retreated and huddled together, regarding Su Hao warily.</p><p></p><p>After all, having witnessed the many unbelievable things this young dragon could do, they no longer had confidence in defeating it.</p><p></p><p>Being able to stay alive was a blessing from the golden god Bali.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully examined the group of people, finding some subtle differences from the humanoids he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>First was their physique - they appeared taller and more muscular, each covered in bulging muscles like a powerful buffalo.</p><p></p><p>Second was their pale skin tone, thick body hair, wavy brown hair and light green irises, giving them a foreign feeling.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they all had a slightly protruding round bump on their foreheads above their brows, like a closed third eye.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, this race of humans didn't seem too different from regular ones, but there were many subtle distinctions upon closer inspection.</p><p></p><p>"Another race? Perfect, I can take the time to properly study how they differ from regular humans. But not right now, I'll wait until Little Light deciphers their language first."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's gaze finally fell on the sole female soul cultivator of the Fugui squad: "Perhaps I can learn something from her."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao withdrew his gaze and teleported away.</p><p></p><p>These people trapped here wouldn't die or escape anytime soon. With their physiques, they could probably go a few days without food, so there was no rush.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the small world holding the humans, Su Hao created another small world base. He went outside the cave, found suitable materials to transform into origin, stuffed them into the base world, and entered to focus on transforming origin.  </p><p></p><p>Seven or eight hours later, Su Hao opened his eyes and casually fired a small shockwave at the materials he had transformed into origin.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>After a flash of white light, a large amount of origin pearls burst out and scattered across the ground in the small world.</p><p></p><p>"So many origin pearls, enough for me to break through to the Yuan Ying realm in one go. Next, I'll transform them into the more versatile 'spirit' form."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao roughly calculated, thinking: "Mother Shadu should return tomorrow, and before she does, I should be able to break through to the Yuan Ying realm."</p><p></p><p>In other words, tomorrow Su Hao would be a Yuan Ying young dragon.</p><p></p><p>Cause for celebration.</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was focused on transforming origin into spirit and absorbing it into his body, the young dragons Chipu and Moli had already woken up.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons wandered around the nest, utterly bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"What...happened? Where's the third brother?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 632</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After communicating with Yashan, Su Hao planned to take action and explore other planets to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>As he was preparing to act, Feng Cheng sent a message saying: "Chief Wei, Zhi Peng says he wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Zhi Peng?" Su Hao suddenly remembered that since the Glory Society had become the administrative organization of this world, he hadn't seen Zhi Peng for a long time and had left everything to Yashan and Feng Cheng as agents.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, there hadn't been any major issues, so things could be said to have gone smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Now Su Hao didn't have anything particularly urgent either, so since Zhi Peng wanted to see him, he might as well meet with him!</p><p></p><p>"Feng Cheng, bring Zhi Peng to my reception room," Su Hao instructed, then went to the reception room to brew tea and wait.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Feng Cheng brought Zhi Peng over by teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was now an over seventy-year-old old man, with white hair, an aged face, and even the light in his eyes had faded quite a bit, only his straight back remained as upright as ever.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Zhi Peng did when he saw Su Hao was to greet him respectfully: "Mr. Jia Wei!"</p><p></p><p>This meeting still greatly shook the prepared Zhi Peng - after all these years, why could the three of them still maintain their youthful appearance...</p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to a seat next to him and said, "Zhi Peng, sit!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng sat down as instructed and examined him carefully, sighing: "Mr. Jia Wei, it's been so many years since we last met, but you haven't changed at all! My old friends and I have all become old men and women!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "That's just natural selection. Who can stop the aging of the flesh? I can't either! Every moment, my body is aging and my life is gradually fading away - this is unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng nodded: "Indeed. Mr. Jia Wei, I've always known you were very busy, so I didn't dare disturb you all these years. But there has been a question lingering in my mind that I wanted to ask you about, I just never found the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>I'm old now, not knowing how much longer I'll live, so I've shamelessly come to find you, just hoping I won't waste too much of your time."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand: "I was busy with research for a period, so I didn't have free time. Now that my research has reached a stopping point, I actually have some spare time, so we can chat slowly about whatever it is."</p><p></p><p>At this stage, time is even more precious for Zhi Peng, because his life has entered an unknown countdown - be it ten years or thirty years, it will end.</p><p></p><p>With only this little time left in life, what can he do?</p><p></p><p>Even if there are things he wants to do, at this point, he lacks the energy despite having the desire.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng showed a smile, clearly happy that Su Hao was willing to listen to him speak slowly.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng said: "Then I'll voice the question in my mind!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Jia Wei, it's been nearly fifty years since the Glory Society was founded. Overall, its development has been very smooth. With this trend, there's no doubt the Glory Society will lead people to achieve even greater accomplishments in the future.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how strict the rules I set, no matter how closely I watch at every moment, the situation I was worried about still happened, and not in small numbers.</p><p></p><p>From what I can foresee, the Glory Society will eventually degenerate into the form of the Eighteen Empires. Or perhaps, the degree of rot will still exceed that.</p><p></p><p>Over these decades, I've tried every means, I've killed many people, even only those with a heart for justice and light.</p><p></p><p>But I failed, bit by bit, it became an unimaginable form.</p><p></p><p>It's like an inescapable curse, constantly repeating in cycles, ultimately returning to the origin point.</p><p></p><p>So I wonder, if it's destined to be so, then what's the point of me killing off all the royal families of the Eighteen Empires, overthrowing their rotten rule, and using the Glory Society I spent so many years establishing? It would be better to just let the previous form persist for thousands or tens of thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng slowly voiced the doubts in his heart, finally asking: "Mr. Jia Wei, I want to know, who exactly is my enemy? I've fought for so many years, but in the end it was all for naught, I don't even know who my enemy is!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at his troubled expression and calmly smiled: "This was something I foresaw long ago. For the Glory Society to maintain this 'relative purity' for so many years is already quite difficult."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng laughed bitterly: "You flatter me, Mr. Jia Wei. If I wasn't still alive and my friends didn't give me some face, I'm afraid it would already be out of control now."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "In my view, before societal productive forces reach a certain level, this is an unsolvable dead cycle, it's just a matter of time - the Glory Society is like a newborn life, seeming vigorous now because this is its growth period, but you must understand, as long as it's a life, it will inevitably go through 'birth, aging, sickness, and death.' Just like you now, you've aged!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng caught the key point keenly: "So you mean, as long as societal productive forces reach an extremely high level, this dead cycle can be broken?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "Not necessarily! Reaching an extremely high productive level is only the basic condition. The most important thing is the human heart."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng frowned: "The human heart?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Specifically, it's 'being above others'! Most people want to be above others, they want to step on others through hard work and struggle, they want to prove they're superior to others...even 'living a good life' isn't what they pursue, what they want is to 'live better than others.'</p><p></p><p>This characteristic is imprinted in the human genes, difficult to eliminate."</p><p></p><p>"Being above others..." A light suddenly shone in Zhi Peng's eyes, as if he understood everything. His enemy was the 'being above others' in people's hearts!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the light in his eyes faded, and he said helplessly: "Mr. Jia Wei, is there really no solution? In the end, it's the common people who suffer..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head: "At least I don't know of any way to solve this problem, because you can't permanently eliminate people's obsessions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this characteristic rooted in human genes isn't necessarily bad, people's strong desires aren't necessarily bad.</p><p></p><p>Or do you want a human society without desire, motivation, or vitality? That would be a disaster for humanity."</p><p></p><p>Receiving Su Hao's clear response, it was as if all the color drained from Zhi Peng's body, leaving him dark and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao rarely consoled: "Zhi Peng, you don't need to worry too much about whether the Glory Society will rot, or doubt the meaning of what you're doing.</p><p></p><p>So what if the Glory Society rots in the future? The future belongs to the people, whatever life they want, they'll explore and search for it themselves, it has nothing to do with you Zhi Peng, your era has already ended.</p><p></p><p>If one day people don't like their world anymore, don't like the Glory Society, then they'll overthrow it themselves and rebuild a world they do like. It's that simple.</p><p></p><p>Aren't you Zhi Peng the one who established the Glory Society because you didn't like the previous world?</p><p></p><p>What you said about cycles isn't wrong, but you should realize that in the process of cycling, this society is evolving. One day, it will evolve into what you want, as long as you leave behind the 'cycling tools.'</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the process of evolution, countless people will suffer calamities for it!</p><p></p><p>Death itself is the most normal thing, you can't define it as unforgivable just because you fear it!</p><p></p><p>Everything you've done is meaningful to you."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng was successfully convinced by Su Hao, because Su Hao clearly told him that his era had ended, and everything he did was meaningful.</p><p></p><p>For Zhi Peng, that was enough!</p><p></p><p>"You're right, Mr. Jia Wei, let the people of the future worry about the future! Whatever world they want, they can reshape it themselves."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Zhi Peng left, Su Hao remained in the reception room, silently pondering the question Zhi Peng had asked, finally laughing wryly: "'Being above others'? Being above others!"</p><p></p><p>Deep in his heart, wasn't Su Hao the same?</p><p></p><p>Today's farewell to Zhi Peng would likely be their final parting.</p><p></p><p>With today's conversation, he had also given a complete ending to the "Glory Society" he had helped establish.</p><p></p><p>As for what happens next, as he said, it's up to the people to decide.</p><p></p><p>After all, there weren't many things left that required the assistance of the Glory Society and the Wizard Association.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 562</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The situation was not supposed to escalate to this extent, but when two people with completely opposite attributes collided, it was like gunpowder meeting a spark - it exploded without any room for turning back.</p><p></p><p>For Su Hao, if he had maintained the right attitude and communicated properly to exchange views, it would not have come to this. But from the very start, the other party looked down on him with an extremely arrogant attitude, making him feel very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>For him, the way to resolve discomfort was simple - just stay away. He would go wherever he felt at ease, without clinging to anyone. But unexpectedly, Luo Wang and others threatened him. Well then, no need for more words - he would just bury them directly.</p><p></p><p>As for subsequent troubles, he was never afraid of troubles. He would clean them all up in one go if needed. He had done such things many times before. The key was, not only had he now recovered all his power from his previous life, but he also mastered an even more destructive source. He could be considered fearless. Of course, most crucially, he had developed a skill specifically to counter bizarre abilities - the Second Dimension.</p><p></p><p>Current tests showed that the 'Second Dimension' could allow him to evade the lock-on of bizarre abilities, rendering even the most bizarre abilities ineffective against him.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to Su Hao's recklessness was Luo Wang's confidence in the power he held.</p><p></p><p>He believed in his identity and authority as a member of the royal family. No one would dare challenge the prestige of the royal family. As long as he revealed his royal identity, everyone would have to give him face, as had always been the case. He did not believe these rural folks would be an exception.</p><p></p><p>Arrogance was precisely the innate quality of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>So this time when he came to Huaishui Town in person, it was with sincerity. And the Lucky Star Squad had to reciprocate his sincerity - they had no right to refuse.</p><p></p><p>If it were cultivators from a larger town rejecting him, that would be understandable. But this was merely a small town with just over a thousand residents, basically just a village. What qualifications did the people from such a place have to refuse a member of the royal family like himself?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Not long after Su Hao and the others left, Luo Wang led his team back to their reception room, gritting his teeth and saying, "Pack up, we're returning to Mingchuan."</p><p></p><p>His personal attendant immediately followed the order. Two maidservants gently massaged his shoulders from behind, but still could not dispel the gloom in his heart. This gloomy feeling began to condense in his chest as the small carriage entered the bumpy road, and had now almost reached its peak, making him so vexed that he felt like vomiting blood.</p><p></p><p>One tall and sturdy cultivator guard, and one short and stout one, both clad in thick armor, looked at each other in astonishment. The tall one said, "We're going back just like that? Shouldn't we teach that arrogant brat a lesson first?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang glanced at the tall guard and sneered, "You think the Lucky Star Squad got their famous name for nothing? Although their name has 'lucky' in it, if you think they rose to their current fame just by good luck, then you're dead wrong. With just the people we have now, we're not even worthy opponents for them."</p><p></p><p>The guard felt a bit unconvinced. In his view, no matter how big the Lucky Star Squad's reputation was, they were after all just a newly rising rookie team, made up of a bunch of youngsters who hadn't even grown all their hair yet. He didn't believe that as a veteran high-level cultivator, he couldn't defeat them.</p><p></p><p>However, since his boss had spoken, he couldn't really object. He just forced a smile and said, "Then what should we do? Just let that brat off the hook?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang said coldly, "Let him off? Hmph, he's just an ignorant rural brat, someone I could crush with a casual effort. How dare he refuse me? If he can refuse me, wouldn't everyone start following suit?"</p><p></p><p>The driver attendant quickly finished packing up and couldn't help asking upon hearing this, "Then what are Your Highness's plans?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang rarely showed a smile as he said, "Of course we'll return first, then I'll dispatch a few stronger squads to form a combined team. They'll come back here personally to capture all five members of their squad, then I'll make proper arrangements for them and make them regret everything they did today."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness is wise!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang's party of eight soon left Huaishui Town, returning the way they came. The bumpier the road, the more resentful Luo Wang became in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he had known this would happen, he wouldn't have made this trip in person. Weren't all those cultivator squads eager for him to extend personal invitations? Giving them enough face, they would gladly accept.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that the Lucky Star Squad would refuse him so bluntly!</p><p></p><p>However, since the Lucky Star Squad was unwilling to accept his invitation, then their luck would end here!</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang frowned and asked, "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The attendant said warily, "Your Highness, someone is blocking the road."</p><p></p><p>By now, Luo Wang's two high-level cultivator guards had taken positions at the front of the convoy, shielding Luo Wang behind them. One was a short and stout Gold Cultivator, the other a tall and sturdy Lightning Cultivator. Working together, no one could approach within two hundred meters of their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>They looked closely and realized - ah, weren't these members of the Lucky Star Squad? The ones who had watched them with ill intentions throughout the earlier incident, leaving a deep impression.</p><p></p><p>The attendant frowned and said, "Your Highness, it seems to be cultivators from the Lucky Star Squad, one called A Shan, the other called A Feng."</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang's brow furrowed as he said, "Go ask them what they want to do."</p><p></p><p>But in fact, there was no need to ask - they soon found out what A Shan and Feng Cheng intended to do by blocking the road.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng turned and asked, "Leader A Shan, how should we bury them?"</p><p></p><p>A Shan smiled, "Kill them first, then bury them underground with the Adamantine Armor. Watch me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, A Shan's body grew taller as the thick Adamantine Armor enveloped him, transforming him into the [Conqueror] form in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Streams of Adamantine Armor surged from under his feet, forming at least fifty flying swords hovering in mid-air, all exquisite magic weapons emitting a dazzling golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>The two guards exchanged a grave look, having noticed the solemnity in each other's eyes. The tall and sturdy Lightning Cultivator drew the large sword from his back and swung it a couple of times like swinging his arms, saying, "Their intentions are not good. Kill them directly, cover me."</p><p></p><p>With that, he gripped the sword in both hands and let out a ferocious roar.</p><p></p><p>"Haah--"</p><p></p><p>Streaks of lightning flashed across his body, gradually merging into a single mass. Numerous lightning snakes writhed and leapt around him, making his figure appear taller, like a small giant. His hair flew upwards, curling yet straight, while his skin visibly turned brown under the glow of the blue-purple lightning, taking on a distinct hue.</p><p></p><p>Like a frenzied berserker warrior, the sword in his hand could destroy anything, leaving nothing unscathed.</p><p></p><p>He swung his long sword and his voice became exceptionally hoarse, "I'm going in!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he abruptly blasted a large crater under his feet and vanished from his original spot, charging at extreme speed towards the crystal-armored figure in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The short and stout Gold Cultivator didn't say much either. He thrust his long pike towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle~"</p><p></p><p>The sound of metal scraping against stone came from underground.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the ground heaved violently, sheets of metal spikes bursting out, flanking the charging Lightning Cultivator on both sides. These metal spikes were excellent conductors, quickly turning this entire area into their domain where they feared nothing.</p><p></p><p>The tall and sturdy Lightning Cultivator let out a wild laugh as he thrust forward at blistering pace, baring rows of sharp teeth. This was the feeling of power, his whole body boiling. In just two more seconds, the sword in his hand would be able to tear everything apart.</p><p></p><p>Whether the opponent was an Energy Cultivator or a Material Cultivator, as long as he could get close enough, the omnipresent lightning would paralyze all foes. Just one swing of his sword could pulverize even the hardest metal into tofu!</p><p></p><p>Unless an Illusion Cultivator showed up, he was invincible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Wang sitting in the rear carriage looked utterly incredulous: "What are these lowly commoners trying to do? They dare attack Your Highness? Don't they know the consequences of attacking a member of the royal family?"</p><p></p><p>A sense of dread arose in Luo Wang's heart: if the Lucky Star Squad killed them all here...</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the two high-level cultivator guards I brought are elites I hand-picked. They must be able to protect me without fail!"</p><p></p><p>A chill ran up Luo Wang's spine, gradually giving rise to a tinge of fear, immediately followed by boundless rage: "Damn commoners, you're all dead! How dare you ignore the majesty of the royal family and attack me? You're doomed! When I get back, I'll mobilize manpower immediately to kill every single person in this godforsaken place! Unforgivable that they dared attack me!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A Shan watched the movements of the two men in the distance and remarked in surprise, "This Lightning Cultivator looks rather ferocious, but his speed is still too slow. He can barely reach the level of a Golden Dan cultivator, probably can't beat one either."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Indeed. He does look quite ferocious, but it's useless. His lightning probably can't even break through the most basic Wind Spirit Shielding Technique."</p><p></p><p>The two didn't know if their evaluation had reached the ears of the tall and sturdy Lightning Cultivator - it might just make him cough up blood from rage.</p><p></p><p>A Shan brought his fingers together and casually flicked them out, "Go!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish--"</p><p></p><p>Golden light burst forth from around him.</p><p></p><p>When the light dissipated, the scene was in disarray. The small carriage and two horse carriages had been completely shattered, debris scattered all around.</p><p></p><p>As for Luo Wang and the others, they had all perished.</p><p></p><p>A Shan said, "Next, bury all these traces a thousand meters underground, better make it so deep even we can't find them. Then restore the road to its original state. Done!"</p><p></p><p>Streams of Adamantine Armor surged from under A Shan's feet, spreading outwards to envelop the various debris and slowly sinking them into the depths.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he restored the road surface to its previous appearance and retracted the Adamantine Armor.</p><p></p><p>The sky was bright and breezy, as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng realized, "I see."</p><p></p><p>He had just mastered another burial skill.</p>

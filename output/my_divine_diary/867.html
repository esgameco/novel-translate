        <h1>Chapter 867</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the soul seeds entered the brains of Yashan and Fengcheng, under their conscious guidance, they quickly merged with the brains.</p><p></p><p>In less than a day, they reached the level of astral projection. This was thousands or even millions of times faster than ordinary people cultivating the 'Xiu Hun Lu' scripture.</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's expectant gaze, two golden light clusters suddenly emerged from Yashan and Fengcheng's heads, emitting a faint glow. In a moment, they transformed into human shapes.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not ask about their feelings, only observing their 'yuanshen' (primordial spirits) from the side.</p><p></p><p>These two luminous golden light clusters carried all their conscious information.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought to himself: "Perhaps what the youngsters cannot sense, the perceptive Yashan and Fengcheng can detect."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng observed his current state and marveled: "Is this my soul? It's so miraculous. I feel like I've lost my physical body and the tremendous power that came with it, but my mind can still clearly perceive the surrounding situation. However, the feeling is a bit ungrounded, like..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan interjected: "Like dancing naked amidst a crowd?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "Yes, yes, that's exactly the feeling."</p><p></p><p>Yashan also marveled: "In the past when I studied the spiritual brain, I thought cognitive operations required at least a brain. But now with soul power, it overturns my idea - one can think without a brain. Perhaps in the future we'll discover even more wondrous things, allowing us to operate without spiritual power or vital energy."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "But in this current soul state, I've lost my 'five thousand mini-me' ability. Not only that, my cognitive power has greatly diminished and become dull. I feel very uncomfortable. I originally thought astral projection would allow me to transcend physical limits and undergo an even stronger, freer metamorphosis. I never expected it to be so different from what I imagined. It seems I need an even better body and brain."</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded: "Indeed, although the soul state feels novel, I don't want to linger in it."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Su Hao pointed to the spiritual brain bodies he had prepared for them and said: "If that's the case, then enter the spiritual brains I've prepared and complete the 'soul-brain' metamorphosis."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yashan and Fengcheng spun in mid-air and burrowed into the two bodies, falling into a brief stillness.</p><p></p><p>Not only were Yashan and Fengcheng eagerly anticipating the enhancements from this transformation, but Su Hao felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>After all, the brains in the bodies he prepared for Yashan and Fengcheng were super products he had handcrafted through his own studies and research.</p><p></p><p>His survival could now be completely self-controlled. He no longer needed to wander the universe relying on the Bouncing Realm, nor did he need to seek out intelligent life by chance.</p><p></p><p>And this was the moment Su Hao had long awaited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yashan and Fengcheng perfectly integrated into the soul brains and awoke.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then brought them to a quiet area of space in a certain galaxy: "Come, try out your former abilities and see if you can use them all."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he no longer cared about being exposed and affected by the 'yun bo' (cosmic ripples).</p><p></p><p>A brief exposure shouldn't cause much trouble, right?</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng immediately began. First the 'core perception rune', then the various physical abilities of their [Shen] bodies, followed by numerous spatial abilities, source abilities, array construction, 'omnipotent mini-me', 'galactic network and transmission', 'star light travel', 'star light destruction'...</p><p></p><p>They used all their abilities without any obstruction, even more smoothly and naturally than when they had 'flesh brains + external brains' before.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could even sense their consciousness information violently fluctuating through the Bouncing Realm, appearing extremely restless inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After carefully experiencing it for a moment, Fengcheng finally couldn't help but exclaim exaggeratedly: "It's too perfect! I can't even describe my current state. Only through comparison do I realize the power of this soul brain - the external brain is incomparable."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "Compared to before, there is now a very important metamorphosis - control over the self. Initially, after infinitely stacking 'external brains', I felt a sense of my perception and consciousness sinking into an illusory world, unable to control the explosive growth in computing power.</p><p></p><p>But now, even though the number of mini-me's is greater than before, I can control them at will. This state is true omnipotence.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially..."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to a planet in the distance: "Just as the great ancient said, combined with the core perception rune, my mind can now encompass an entire planet. I can clearly perceive any part of it - a rock, a grain of sand, the direction of a storm..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao believed Yashan and Fengcheng's perceptions and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>From Fengcheng, he sensed an outburst of emotion, indicating that after becoming a soul brain, his personal preferences and desires were maintained due to soul power.</p><p></p><p>From Yashan, he sensed the most direct advantage of the soul brain - completely crushing the original brain in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>This final experiment was a success.</p><p></p><p>Next it was his turn to swap to a soul brain and experience the power of this 'handcrafted product'.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Su Hao only attempted a brain swap near the end of his physical lifespan. But this time, he didn't plan to wait that long.</p><p></p><p>One reason was he had 100% confidence in succeeding. The other was that by doing it now, he could promptly modify any defects encountered during the long period of use.</p><p></p><p>Without truly using a soul brain, it would be difficult to guess the exact situation just from others' descriptions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Yashan and Fengcheng successfully swapped brains, Su Hao stubbornly waited a year for their detailed feedback. Only after they reported back "incredibly good" a year later did Su Hao finally decide to get a new brain for himself.</p><p></p><p>"This dragon body of mine has overall attributes far superior to a human body. It should last for tens of thousands of years without issue. After that long, I'll swap to another body."</p><p></p><p>With that decision, he immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>He took out a pure soul seed and inserted it through his brow.</p><p></p><p>The soul seed easily passed through his skull and external brain into the center of his main brain, slowly taking root. Under Su Hao's guidance, it spread outward, gradually merging with the main brain.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao thought: "Step one, planting the soul seed, is complete. Next is step two - nurturing the brain's soul seed to grow, covering the entire brain in a specific structure and fully integrating with it."</p><p></p><p>Amplifying his soul power was exceptionally simple for Su Hao. With a soul seed core, he could easily proliferate vast amounts of soul power.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he completed covering his entire brain, including the external portion, with soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Step three, engage in extensive meditation to transfer all conscious information from the brain to the soul power."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities of this world had long mastered this step. Su Hao only made slight improvements to make it his own technique.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Su Hao sensed deep within: He could now control all the soul power integrated into his brain with just his consciousness alone.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he didn't need to use psychic power - pure willpower alone could manipulate his soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the feeling of a soul? No, it's more appropriate to call it a 'yuanshen'. My 'yuanshen' can now astral project."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao settled his mind to adapt for a while longer. Once he detected no omissions, a thought stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Huh!"</p><p></p><p>A golden, spiky light cluster leapt out from his original head position and quickly transformed into a small human shape.</p><p></p><p>It hovered in mid-air as he couldn't help but control his 'yuanshen' to spin around twice, experiencing his current state.</p><p></p><p>"Thoughts and power feel sealed, plummeting drastically. Light and empty, this miraculous feeling also lacks a sense of security, as if my most private core is exposed, just as Yashan accurately described - 'like dancing naked amidst a crowd'."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't linger in this 'naked' state. Locking onto his target, he entered the prepared spiritual brain body.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao opened his eyes.  </p><p></p><p>"The briefly sealed power has returned."</p><p></p><p>Not only returned, but his perception felt even stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>As time passed and he gradually adapted to his current state, he sensed the 'omnipotence' Yashan described.</p><p></p><p>He expressed it more directly: "Thoughts mixed and unobstructed, transforming infinitely with a single thought. All things present down to the smallest detail. 'I' am natural and at ease."</p><p></p><p>"I am...different now."</p>

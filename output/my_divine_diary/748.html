        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>One year later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao successfully integrated 'Seeker One' into the neural system of [Eight-Armed God], allowing [Eight-Armed God]'s neural system to gain the ability to enter the Star-Gazing World.</p><p></p><p>On that day, he came before the blue crystal dream-entering stone, and stretched out his hand to grasp a protruding dream-entering stone.</p><p></p><p>Dense clusters of nerves grew out from all over his palm, tightly adhering to the dream-entering stone.</p><p></p><p>It looked extremely like moldy bread carelessly tossed onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a large amount of information surged into Su Hao's brain through the neural tentacles, gradually becoming ordered from disorder, changing from a grayish-white to a space filled with planets of various colors.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his own abilities, Su Hao once again entered this 'Star-Gazing World'.</p><p></p><p>This also confirmed Su Hao's conjecture from the side: The 'Star-Gazing World' is not an ability unique to the Compound Eye Race, but an objectively existing phenomenon on this planet.</p><p></p><p>However, the existence of the Compound Eye Race was indispensable. If it weren't for the Compound Eye Race's 'Geolore Eye', even if the dream-entering stones were placed in front of Su Hao, he wouldn't know what they were.</p><p></p><p>This time, after entering the Star-Gazing World through his own abilities, he did not quickly exit, but instead freely roamed and traversed within the Star-Gazing World.</p><p></p><p>Because this time, he had a very important matter to confirm: whether the planets here were limited or infinite.</p><p></p><p>This was very important, directly affecting whether his subsequent judgment on the operating mechanism of the Star-Gazing World would be correct or not.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao purposefully and directionally traversed within the Star-Gazing World, recording all the planets he saw, while simultaneously drawing an identical star map in the Pinball Space according to the positions of the planets he observed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long had passed, but the planets he encountered became increasingly sparse. Suddenly at one moment, the space in front of him became vast, no longer seeing densely packed planets.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had suddenly emerged from the sea.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned his head to look back, the planets floating behind obstructed his vision, while ahead was a vast empty region, devoid of anything.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the end?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao tried to fly towards the empty region, but just like being unable to enter the interior of a star, he was forced to stop after not being able to advance very far.</p><p></p><p>The unseen empty region ahead seemed to have an invisible wall, cutting off his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>It was like encountering the world boundary when playing games.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao tried various methods again, but to no avail, so he temporarily gave up trying, and instead 'squinted' his eyes to gaze into the distant emptiness......</p><p></p><p>"It seems...there is still something there."</p><p></p><p>He could vaguely see some points of light, but they were indistinct and blurry......</p><p></p><p>It was the same feeling as when his eyes were strained from looking at something.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gazed for a while, but still couldn't see clearly. He guessed that this had to do with the mechanism of the Star-Gazing World, perhaps everyone who came here would see the same scene.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dwell on this, but instead turned around and flew along the boundary between the planets and the void, intending to test whether he would return to the original point if he kept flying like this.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao flew while recording, at a rapid speed, able to cross countless planets in the blink of an eye to arrive at a completely new location.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's perception, this visual transition had no speed limit. As long as he knew which planet he wanted to go to, he could see the planet he wanted to see in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to know the position of that planet.</p><p></p><p>Flying straight along a line like this, doing his best not to change the straight direction, after a long time, Su Hao returned to his previous original point.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "Elliptical?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't stop, but instead turned around and flew in another direction, then circled back to the original place again.</p><p></p><p>Turn again, fly again!</p><p></p><p>When zoomed out, it looked like a dried persimmon cake.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the rough shape, Su Hao didn't continue circling, but instead plunged into the cluster of planets in the Star-Gazing World, roaming in an orderly manner...</p><p></p><p>Repeating this process, after a month.</p><p></p><p>In the Pinball Space, Su Hao successfully depicted the overall structure of the Star-Gazing World into a simple star map.</p><p></p><p>He also stopped his roaming activities and exited the Star-Gazing World.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's spiritual tentacles slowly retracted, and after a moment, he opened his eyes and let out a long breath of turbid air: "Completed drawing the star map of the Star-Gazing World. Next, I'll compare it with the Cloud Ring System!"</p><p></p><p>A long time ago, humans had already made a detailed star map of the Cloud Ring System, and updated the positions on the star map every year, keeping it essentially real-time updated.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao easily obtained it.</p><p></p><p>He recorded the star map information into the Pinball Space, and after conversion, gave Little Light the instruction: "Little Light, compare the positions of the planets in the Cloud Ring System and the Star-Gazing World."</p><p></p><p>"Little Light received, please wait."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Little Light gave the result. By matching some of the nodes recorded by Su Hao with the Cloud Ring System star map, it simulated the effect of the Cloud Ring System transforming into the Star-Gazing World.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Ring System was like a large cotton-like disk that had been squeezed into a ball.</p><p></p><p>The vast distances between stars and stars were as if they didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Yet they maintained a certain distance from each other.</p><p></p><p>Compact, yet orderly.</p><p></p><p>A flash of delight flickered in Su Hao's eyes: "Just as I expected, the Star-Gazing World is the accumulation of the various celestial bodies in the Cloud Ring System. Then...let me conduct some more experiments to verify."</p><p></p><p>He immediately messaged Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, take a Shattered Star Cube and drop it on Planet 'Gateway-Trench-7125'. Then shoot it towards the Star Devourer Domain."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng quickly replied: "Got it, Old Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't say much more, immediately putting down what he was doing, taking the Cube, and transmitting to the human base closest to that planet via a transmission array. He then flew into space, activated 'Starglow', and headed straight for the planet specified by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Twenty days later, Feng Cheng finally arrived at this unremarkable and desolate planet, and without hesitation dropped the Cube and activated the 'Shattered Star' program.</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, the entire planet had become an ocean of the Planetary Virus, and after transformation, formed a white expanse of 'Source Pearls' floating silently in space.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's eyes lit up as he looked at the Source Pearls - that was all energy!</p><p></p><p>Too many good things became cumbersome. It was like if someone possessed as much money as an entire planet, that money would be of little use to them...</p><p></p><p>After choosing the direction, he unhesitatingly dropped the 'Igniter', converting all the Source into pure energy that erupted outwards.</p><p></p><p>A huge golden light lit up on the planet formed from the Source Pearls, gradually spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>Countless energy and matter spewed forth at nearly the speed of light, shooting towards the Star Devourer Domain.</p><p></p><p>The true Stellar Greatsword!</p><p></p><p>Even he could potentially lose one of his [Divine] avatars in the massive planetary explosion if he wasn't careful.</p><p></p><p>And what he was seeing now was just the beginning of the Stellar Greatsword, the force erupting from the Source Pearl planet would only grow stronger later on.</p><p></p><p>It could even affect the balance of this star system.</p><p></p><p>After another three days, until this planet had completely disappeared from this space.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng messaged Su Hao: "Old Master Wei, Planet 'Gateway-Trench-7125' has been completely sent away by me."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "I saw it. Alright, you can come back now!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Feng Cheng chuckled and transmitted back to the small world.</p><p></p><p>While Feng Cheng was sending away an entire planet, Su Hao had been staying in the 'Star-Gazing World' the whole time, keeping watch in front of Planet 'Gateway-Trench-7125', staring at this planet intently.</p><p></p><p>Drop the Cube - complete invasion by the Planetary Virus - transform into Source...</p><p></p><p>Then, this planet gradually disappeared from the Star-Gazing World.</p><p></p><p>The vacant position left in the Star-Gazing World was filled by the surrounding planets squeezing and moving inwards.</p><p></p><p>When everything calmed down, the Star-Gazing World restored its even spacing.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Su Hao noticed that the planet disappeared from the Star-Gazing World after the matter transformed into Source.</p><p></p><p>In other words, in the Star-Gazing World, one couldn't see 'Source'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's highly developed brain rapidly computed, the excitement in his eyes growing denser, one question after another being unraveled in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had a great realization and laughed heartily: "The 'Star-Gazing World'!</p><p></p><p>I never imagined that behind the universe visible to the naked eye, there would be such a world hidden!</p><p></p><p>"The Star-Gazing World most likely originally existed, having nothing to do with the Compound Eye Race or the dream-entering stones.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Compound Eye Race could enter the Star-Gazing World was completely due to two coincidences happening to intersect, allowing this facade of the Star-Gazing World to manifest before me in this form."</p><p></p><p>"Star-Gazing World, you can't escape now!"</p>

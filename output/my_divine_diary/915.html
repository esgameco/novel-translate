        <h1>Chapter 915</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The eighteen divine beings' bodies of white jade were now the 'extraordinary pillars' of the entire Crucis Galaxy world. If they were released, the entire extraordinary system that had been built over more than a thousand years would face collapse.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Su Hao could not possibly release the white jade bodies of the eighteen divine beings.</p><p></p><p>But he also could not permanently seal these eighteen gods in a small space. If one day they didn't want to play games with Su Hao anymore and actively tried to destroy things seeking death, that would also be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's idea was to separate the main consciousness of these eighteen divine beings from their white jade bodies, and place them into another "divine" body, allowing them a certain degree of 'freedom'.</p><p></p><p>As for the eighteen remaining white jade bodies, he would input an automated program into them to maintain the basic pattern of the Crucis Galaxy world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the information energy of white jade was the best carrier for a complete program.</p><p></p><p>Using automation to replace manual operation...</p><p></p><p>This idea had a certain feasibility.</p><p></p><p>The key point was how to construct the artificial intelligence and corresponding programs.</p><p></p><p>For this, Su Hao already had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Gentlemen, don't get too excited. For me to create the eternal, all-powerful bodies you want has conditions."</p><p></p><p>The gods heaved a sigh of relief. As long as there were conditions, it was fine. If there were no conditions, they wouldn't dare easily agree to Su Hao's request.</p><p></p><p>The Salvation God of Hundred Bodies immediately asked, "What conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Similar to the first task, first modify your own white jade bodies and build a specific structure. Then, follow the prompts from the system to input an automated program.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, you need to modify your own white jade bodies into a machine that can automatically maintain basic operations. Once this machine can replace your work, you can leave.</p><p></p><p>Do you understand what I mean? The root of the extraordinary pattern of this world lies in your white jade bodies. If I let you leave, the extraordinary world will completely collapse. So as long as I still need to use the extraordinary world, your white jade bodies cannot leave.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if you want to leave, you need to complete the construction of the automated program for the white jade bodies. After it is built, you can separate from the white jade bodies and enter the bodies I provide. Then you can do as you please."</p><p></p><p>The gods immediately began whispering in the group chat. After a long while, their opinions finally reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Bali, as the representative, said, "Lord Leian, we are willing to build the automated program and switch to an eternal body you provide. However, we have a small request."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Bali said, "After we switch bodies, can we still have the system for playing games? We also want to keep the Little God Learning Machine. Additionally, we also want a mall system like the World Will!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Of course, as long as you like."</p><p></p><p>There weren't many such self-motivated handymen for miscellaneous tasks.</p><p></p><p>The gods had no more objections and all expressed their agreement.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "No need to rush this. I need some time to design the plan. At the same time, you should quickly learn about programming knowledge to facilitate future maintenance."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Night God suddenly had an idea, "Lord Leian, I want to ask, for some daily maintenance tasks, can we assign the people enjoying blessings in heaven to participate? Simply put, provide them with some job positions to earn points, which they can use to redeem a body and return to live in the Crucis Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao grinned, "That's a good suggestion."</p><p></p><p>After leaving heaven, Su Hao returned to the base small world and entered the pinball space to start thinking about how to build an 'fully automated crosser guidance program'.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully build it, he could achieve automated production of qualified talents in the future...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Su Hao casually opened a plan outline and wrote four words as the title: Divine Lord Plan.</p><p></p><p>Then he continuously added expected functions in the items: exchange mall, point system, evaluation system, settlement system, task system, detection system, punishment system, transmission system, recycling system, intelligent management system...</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely massive project.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng arrived at the Crucis Galaxy and with his divine sense, locked onto the locations of his two disciples.</p><p></p><p>After locking on, he flashed and appeared beside them.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, deafening bar music poured into his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Dun~ dun~ da~ All friends get high with me~ High~ High..."</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the swaying multicolored lights, everyone here was dancing wildly like crazy, passionately flaunting their youthful energy and unrestrained wildness.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Cong Shuling, Cong Renfe, and a group of others knelt obediently before Feng Cheng, hanging their heads in apology, "Master, we know we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King stood by blankly, staring at this scene in a daze, "What's going on? We were just drinking and getting into the groove..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfe's disciples also knelt down, glancing at Feng Cheng with shock in their sidelong glances, "So this is our master's master, our grandmaster? Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to the shock, there was even more curiosity.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence must one be to become the master of the Divine Twins?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng waved his hand, "What's wrong? Get up! Our Dual Sword Sect does not kneel. Pursuing happiness is human nature. It's just that you have neglected your studies, which pains me greatly!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood up obediently.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfe said awkwardly, "We got carried away and couldn't control ourselves. As for the matter of studying, we know we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded in understanding, "You're young with robust vigor, which is normal. But studying is the top priority. You must not neglect your studies due to desires. I hope you remember this. If one day you stop studying and improving, instead indulging in temporary desires, our master-disciple relationship may come to an end."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Cong Shuling and Cong Renfe felt panicked, hanging their heads unable to speak, looking pitiful.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples didn't even dare breathe loudly.</p><p></p><p>Only the Crimson Demon King said confusedly, "Um, Gail's master? Ahem, I'm Gail and Tali's good friend, so I won't disturb your master-disciple reunion. Please let me leave!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King felt very anxious in his heart. He recognized this place as his third brother's 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits' small space.</p><p></p><p>He had no confidence in being able to escape from this kind of space, and was also convinced that he would not be a match for the person before him.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, stemming from his fear of his third brother Leian, he was also filled with an indescribable fear towards Feng Cheng, not daring to have the slightest thought of resistance.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one was, the more he could understand the terrifying nature of his third brother.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng turned to look at the Crimson Demon King and smiled, "Crimson Demon King, right? How about becoming my third disciple and learning from me?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King: "Huh???"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and her brother were also stunned, then frantically gestured to the Crimson Demon King, as if saying, "Hurry and agree, you'd be a fool not to!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King had mixed with the two siblings for a long time and knew their minds were sharper than his, so he didn't think too much about it and nodded, "Okay...okay!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling snorted, "Call him Master, you fool dragon."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King obediently said, "Master."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "Today your emotions were a bit unrestrained. Stay here for now to calm down and recover your spirits. If you have anything else, I'll talk to you about it tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Feng Cheng transmitted away, leaving behind Cong Shuling and her brother, the Crimson Demon King, ten crossers, and six ordinary disciples - eighteen people and one dragon in the small world, looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling, as the most authoritative among them, exhaled deeply and said, "As our Master instructed, let's sit in meditation again to calm our spirits."</p><p></p><p>With that, she closed her eyes and began meditating to regulate her breath, quickly entering a state of concentration.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others also sat down cross-legged and calmed their spirits.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King thought inwardly, "I guess I'll take a nap?"</p><p></p><p>Then he also lay down and fell into a dream...</p>

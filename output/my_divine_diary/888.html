        <h1>Chapter 888</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After breakfast, a middle-aged man and woman went out to labor in pairs, making a point of explaining to their older brother, Gail, "Gail, we're going out, you take care of your sister, Tali."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled naturally and said, "Ok Father, Auntie."</p><p></p><p>After the middle-aged man and woman left, the two remaining siblings stared at each other, and the atmosphere once again fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling suddenly said, "Brother, didn't you say that you had arranged to go on a trip with friends? Why don't you go?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei wanted to go out, but was a little hesitant, he was worried that his sister was running around, if she fell into the lake again like before, wouldn't it be bad? Not every time could be so lucky, the most crucial thing was that perhaps inheriting some of the previous owner's feelings, he was still very loving towards his sister.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cong Shuling's hesitation, Cong Renfei said, "Don't worry, I'll stay at home and not go anywhere."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked curiously, "What are you staying home for?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "Girls' things, are you so curious?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei awkwardly walked away and came to a deserted place, secretly saying, "This place is a place I had my eye on for practicing martial arts a long time ago, no one should be able to notice it, and even if they do, it doesn't matter, just say that it's for physical exercise."</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he adjusted his breathing and moved his physical body first, followed by two sets of proper fists, strong and powerful, but not lacking in swiftness, scratching the air around him with a whirring sound.</p><p></p><p>"This body has a good base, very strong."</p><p></p><p>Then he sat down on a platter, relaxing and settling down, all his thoughts united, searching for that trace of internal energy opportunity in his body.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he opened his eyes and wondered, "Why didn't I find that feeling of practicing kung fu? It shouldn't be!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was puzzled, a crisp voice came from the depths of his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>'Dingdong'!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterward a concise blue panel popped up in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Cong Shuling, who was secretly practicing at home, froze and looked at the blue panel in front of him, somewhat at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Her first reaction to the system that suddenly popped out of her mind was one of ten thousand skepticism, and she suspected that the reason she was able to awaken from death had a lot to do with this so-called system.</p><p></p><p>But with her barren level of cognition, it was hard to understand what it was.</p><p></p><p>The experience of her last life had made her much more mature, she didn't easily ask the doubts in her heart out, and instead asked about another matter, "Diligent, do you know why I can't feel the internal energy?"</p><p></p><p>The Diligent Assistant reached, "You lack a corresponding talent, you can exchange for a specific talent in the Points Mall."</p><p></p><p>"Talent?" Cong Shuling understood the meaning of martial arts practicing talent, in her last life, she and her brother could be martial arts practicing geniuses, at a young age they were second-rate masters, and in the future it was not impossible to reach the top of the first-rate tops, it's just a pity that ......</p><p></p><p>She followed the assistant's guidance and opened the mall.</p><p></p><p>"Cold Weapons, Enchanted Weapons, Hot Weapons, Nuclear Bombs, Energy Weapons, Bloodlines, Talents, Techniques, Skills, Soul Power Fruits, Experience Energy Packs, Household Items, Electronic Products, Food and Drinking Water ......"</p><p></p><p>One item regimented down, dazzling her.</p><p></p><p>"What is all this stuff?"</p><p></p><p>She stated that she couldn't quite read it, and after searching for a while, she finally found the 'Talents' column that her assistant was talking about, and then with a thought, it was as if a finger had tapped on it.</p><p></p><p>"Ta!"</p><p></p><p>A new page popped up, with a stack of items arranged from above.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Immortal Emperor Talent, SSS grade, 1 million points;</p><p></p><p>Everlasting Immortality Talent, SSS grade, 1 million points;</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Immortality Cultivation Talent, S grade, 200,000 points;</p><p></p><p>[God] Talent, S rank, 200,000 points;</p><p></p><p>Contract Summoner talent, A rank, 100,000 points;</p><p></p><p>Magician talent, B rank, 50,000 points;</p><p></p><p>Inner Qi Talent, Grade E, 1,000 points;</p><p></p><p>......"</p><p></p><p>After each talent, there would be a detailed description.</p><p></p><p>It dazzled Cong Shuling.</p><p></p><p>For example, the most expensive 'Supreme Immortal Emperor Talent', once exchanged, one would immediately be able to obtain an 'Immortal Body', obtaining a natural lifespan of 8,000 years, and with the supporting Immortal Cultivation Technique, then the speed of cultivation would be able to grow by thousands of miles a day, and within a short period of time one could fly up in a white sun, achieving the fruits of the Dao, and enjoying eternal life.</p><p></p><p>There is also the so-called 'stellar child' talent, even able to survive above the scorching sun, natural life expectancy of one million years, supporting the learning of the corresponding skills, will be able to obtain an incomparably powerful and magical power ......</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling couldn't help but marvel, "Too strong!"</p><p></p><p>Soon she saw the 'Inner Strength Talent' she was looking for ......</p><p></p><p>How could it be so trashy that it was only sold for a thousand points!</p><p></p><p>Although she couldn't understand what S, D, and E meant, the cheaper the trashier it was, the right.</p><p></p><p>She had never thought that the martial arts secrets that she treated as supreme treasures were one of the lowest level talents inside this mall ......</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Cong Shuling gave birth to a trace of dislike for the martial arts she practiced, then merely stared at those SSS grade talents, "If ......"</p><p></p><p>Then she asked, "Do I need points to change talents? Then how should I get the points?"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings were like this, inexplicably having something to want, a goal to strive for in this life, and without realizing it, falling into the first plot that the deities had woven for them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they received their first quest:</p><p></p><p>Mission: to explore a theft case and learn the specifics from the person who was stolen.</p><p></p><p>Reward: 10 points, one lucky draw.</p><p></p><p>......"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said incredulously, "Only 10 points? Wouldn't you have to do a hundred quests to exchange it for the Inner Strength talent?"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly felt that the Inner Strength Talent she once had didn't seem to be very trashy.</p><p></p><p>The assistant said, "Different mission difficulties reward different points, the higher the difficulty, the more points."</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the gods' nerves gradually tightened, staring intently at the two world wills: "It's about to officially begin, the first 'Artificial Controllable Crisis'."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the performance of these two World Will, the deities all gained a lot of confidence, "These two World Will acted very cautiously, not being too reckless, but observing the environment as soon as possible, adapting to the environment, and the first thing they thought of was to restore their power to defend themselves, this is very good, and it's much better than those World Will before. There's a chance!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a large piece of 'Foraging Zero' that was used to observe the transportation waves, and came above the Cross Star space, and then observed the changes in this large piece of 'Foraging Zero'.</p><p></p><p>After a period of time, it continued to increase the amount of foraging zeros, and in the end, it nearly reached a diameter of twenty kilometers, just like a satellite on a planet.</p><p></p><p>The transport waves generated by the activities of the two siblings would have a certain fluctuating influence on the foraging zero, and the regularity of this fluctuating influence was the fundamental reason why Su Hao was able to observe the transport waves.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's gaze was tightly fixed on the Foraging Zero, and his powerful divine thoughts were also focused on the Foraging Zero at the same time.</p><p></p><p>As his brain analyzed it, he muttered wordlessly under his breath, "'Foraging Zero', this translucent substance, the way it moves, is somewhat similar to the 'Star Key Blue Crystal' that I used to observe the 'Galactic Network'. ' Somewhat similar, both are able to pick up the influence of 'transportation waves' within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>As the volume of the Zero Foraging increases, the range of transport waves I can observe increases as well.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Zero does not allow me to observe the entire Kettle Galaxy like the 'Blue Crystal of the Star Key' does, and I can't observe the part of the star system that is beyond this one, no matter how many Zeroes I add or how much I increase the gravitational pull of the Zero's location... ...... "</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but rub his chin, "At most, I can only observe the range of a star system ......"</p><p></p><p>A bright light suddenly crossed his mind, "What if I send enough doppelgangers to every star system in the Kettle System and then try to observe the transport waves at the same time?</p><p></p><p>It's like peeking at a leopard in a tube, but as long as the number of tubes is larger, it's more or less possible to guess the general shape of the leopard.</p><p></p><p>Either way, it's worth a try. As for the split question ......"</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was able to split up to 10,000 ego splits, and exceeding the part would seriously affect the speed of thinking.</p><p></p><p>And 10,000 bilocations could only take care of 10,000 star systems, which was a rather small point for the huge Xiangpu system with hundreds of billions of stars.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to rush, record as many as you can first, trying out my idea to see if it works is the key."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao immediately activated the massive [God] bilocations in the small world, and they all set out to the surrounding star systems.</p><p></p><p>In just a short amount of time, Su Hao utilized the 'galactic network' to cast the bilocations to the designated star system.</p><p></p><p>Each bilocation had quite strong autonomous properties, transforming the source beads locally, and then utilizing the source beads to create foraged zeros.</p><p></p><p>Once ready, the nerves connected to the Foraging Zero and attempted to observe the transportation waves.</p>

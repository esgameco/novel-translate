        <h1>Chapter 652</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao wanted to break through from his current state to a new higher spiritual realm, but the difficulty was extraordinarily high.</p><p></p><p>During the time he was stuck at the Yuan Ying realm in the cultivation world, he had carefully researched methods to improve his spiritual power, but found no feasible solutions. Eventually, he took an unconventional path and created the 'Mind Platform', an 'external brain' that could transfer part of his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the amplification of Suhao's perceptive abilities by the spiritual sense was only 200,000 meters, which was the limit.</p><p></p><p>Suhao understood the reason clearly - the radiation range of the 'spiritual force wave' was 200,000 meters!</p><p></p><p>Radar perception was Suhao's rune radiating an invisible ripple outwards, which could rebound when encountering vital energy, just like a bat's sonar system.</p><p></p><p>However, after Suhao gained 'spiritual force' and 'spiritual sense', the radar underwent some changes and became more powerful, but the perception method did not change.</p><p></p><p>This meant that while Suhao's perceptive range was greatly expanded by spiritual force, it was also affected by the length of the 'spiritual force wave'.</p><p></p><p>After exceeding 200,000 meters, the spiritual force wave weakened to an imperceptible degree, which was the reason why Suhao's perceptive range was only 200,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>But visual observation was different.</p><p></p><p>The eyes passively receive light information. As long as there is light, the eyes can transmit the signal to the brain and form a corresponding picture scene.</p><p></p><p>Such scenes can be seen even across billions of light-years, as long as the light successfully enters the eyes!</p><p></p><p>So the eyeball, an organ evolved by nature, and the innate 'spiritual power' of humans, are truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>Through constant experimentation, analysis, and hints from his eyes, Suhao also found a new direction for 'beyond the Deity Realm'.</p><p></p><p>That's right, he wanted to change his previous approach to cultivating spiritual power and learn from the eyes instead.</p><p></p><p>He no longer tried to actively enhance his spiritual power and then use it to spread out and perceive the environment.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he wanted to create another pair of 'eyes' with his spiritual power, or a set of 'tools' to perceive various cosmic signals.</p><p></p><p>He would then continuously optimize it, allowing it to perceive fluctuations that the 'eyes' and 'spiritual sense' could not detect, and then convert them into specific signals to transmit to the brain, just like a normal organ.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he greatly increase his perceptive range.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, no matter how powerful his spiritual power was, could it really sweep across an entire galaxy? Dream on!</p><p></p><p>He believed there must be a way to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Since the existence of light allowed nature to evolve eyes, and the existence of sound waves allowed the evolution of ears...if those fluctuations could be perceived by humans, then other fluctuations must also be perceptible.</p><p></p><p>The problem was, how should spiritual power transform and evolve to perceive those invisible fluctuations?</p><p></p><p>Just like the mind techniques in the Martial World that could control vital energy, or the spiritual tentacles grown through the 'Fushi Mental Training Method' that could sense space for teleportation, or the 'spiritual sense' in cultivation that could expand the perceptive range and control spiritual force...</p><p></p><p>There must be a spiritual form that could perceive cosmic information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After much analysis, Feixiao shared his proposal with Suhao: "Mr. Javic, as you said, the essence of spiritual power is the bridge connecting consciousness and the world. Following your line of thought, I further subdivided spiritual power at a more fundamental level.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's consciousness, spiritual power, or the world, the essence of their interaction is 'motion'.</p><p></p><p>For example, when the eyes see light, it's essentially the light entering the retina and causing motion in the photosensitive substances. This motion is transmitted back to the brain, allowing us to see things.</p><p></p><p>"So, can we assume that in this world, there must be some substance that can produce specific motions when exposed to those imperceptible cosmic rays and fluctuations?</p><p></p><p>If we can find that special reactive substance, we can find the corresponding fluctuation. Just like how we can't see magnetic fields, but we can determine their existence through magnets..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Suhao's eyes lit up: "Indeed, this method is feasible."</p><p></p><p>There are two key points here: the reactive substance and the corresponding fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>As long as we find the reactive substance and construct it into a specific structure to be installed in the brain and connected to consciousness, wouldn't that be a new perceptive organ?</p><p></p><p>If all else fails, we can just throw a 'Star Shattering Cube' onto a planet.</p><p></p><p>Feixiao said: "The current difficulty lies in not knowing what substance will react to the various cosmic rays and fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>This is the challenge of materials science.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "If we can't figure it out, we'll just try one by one. Yashan wants to join our research, doesn't he? Now we need his help."</p><p></p><p>Feixiao was surprised: "How do we try?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Yashan is currently researching various 'source materials'. You happen to be looking for a special substance, so you can work together!</p><p></p><p>Tell Yashan the substance you want, and he can try to transform it for you. You can also analyze the data together and look for patterns in the fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>When Yashan learned that Suhao wanted him to participate in the 'Beyond Deity Realm' research, he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The very next day after Suhao's words, he excitedly moved into Lab No. 1 and didn't seem to plan on returning to his own lab.</p><p></p><p>"Yashan, can't you just go back and sleep? Why are you squeezing in here?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan grinned: "Master Feixiao, this way I can immerse myself in work the moment I wake up every day!"</p><p></p><p>The overall research direction was determined, but no one knew how long it would take to actually achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Suhao's research progressed rapidly because it was built on the vast accumulation of civilization.</p><p></p><p>There was a wealth of existing knowledge for him to learn from; he merely needed to integrate and apply what he had learned.</p><p></p><p>But now, without the accumulation of civilization, it would be extremely difficult for him to find a substance that could react to the fluctuations of the Doomsday System.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Four more years passed, and Suhao, aboard the Initial Ship, made the final one light-year jump, abruptly appearing outside the Yukata Galaxy and rapidly approaching it.</p><p></p><p>The stars in the Yukata Galaxy had twice the mass of the star in the Source Star's galaxy, and their immense gravitational pull had captured ten massive planets orbiting around them in cycles.</p><p></p><p>In the cockpit, Yashan projected the Yukata Galaxy and pointed to the fourth planet from the inside: "Master Feixiao, based on the volume and mass of the Yukata star and Planet Four, the environment of this planet seems relatively friendly to life. Do you think we might find traces of life on Planet Four?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also said: "It would be interesting if we actually discovered a civilization on Planet Four."</p><p></p><p>Having spent time with everyone, Feixiao no longer felt so distant and joked: "Then we should stay for a few years and kidnap some beauties for Teacher Feng Cheng."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook his head: "No, we're not even sure if they're human. Let me make it clear, I only like humans!"</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing the Yukata Galaxy for a while, Suhao said directly: "Then let's go to Planet Four first and take a look around for any discoveries."</p><p></p><p>Everyone then excitedly transported near Planet Four, parked the ship on one of its moons, and successively flashed into the planet's atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, not a single trace could be found - it was just an ordinary planet without even liquid water on the surface.</p><p></p><p>There was no life, let alone any civilization.</p><p></p><p>The entire galaxy was silent and desolate.</p><p></p><p>Although they had expected this, everyone still felt a tinge of disappointment from their unmet expectations.</p><p></p><p>If only there was a civilization, how wonderful that would be!</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Let's search the planet first and see if there's anything special. Stay on full alert."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, Master Feixiao."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Mr. Javic."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 950</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The huge Red Pu the Great Demon King was no stranger to the Eighteen Deities.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Red Pu's massive body, all sorts of old memories surged into their minds, leaving them with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>Especially the God of Order - Redlight, whose gaze couldn't help but glance at Red Pu's feet. His avatar worth 100 merit points back then was crushed by the Red Golden Dragon's foot right after leaving...</p><p></p><p>It was an utter humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Now the enemy was right in front of them...</p><p></p><p>The God of Eternal Night - Yongshi saw many deities with gloomy expressions and couldn't help but smile: "Don't forget Red Pu's identity, fellow deities. He's not someone we can afford to offend now."</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold - Bali also immediately said: "That's right, not only that, Red Pu has taken Lord Feng Cheng as his master. His status is not the same as before. We'd better forget the past grievances and treat him normally."</p><p></p><p>The God of Order - Redlight took a deep breath but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Huffâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Just as the deities were whispering, Red Pu flashed in front of them and curiously asked, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The deities were startled by Red Pu, clenching their buttocks tightly. Looking up at the massive being in front of them, they instinctively stepped back: "Whoa...holy crap! Red Pu has learned to flash!"</p><p></p><p>They didn't even understand teleportation yet.</p><p></p><p>The deities instantly realized that the Red Pu before them was no longer someone they could look down upon.</p><p></p><p>Facing Red Pu's inquiry, the deities quickly devised the best plan - to get on his good side.</p><p></p><p>The God of Heavenly Order - Nati cleared his throat and said, "We know you, the famous Red Pu the Great Demon King."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu nodded. It was normal for them to recognize his renowned name.</p><p></p><p>Nati then pointed at himself and the others, saying, "As for us, we are the eighteen most trusted and capable assistants of the great Lord Jiavi. We are here on an important mission from Lord Jiavi to inspect the work situation. Ah, what a coincidence to meet the great Red Pu. It's an honor."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu was surprised: "You are Lord Jiavi's subordinates? No wonder your aura is similar to my master's, so peculiar."</p><p></p><p>He then counted and asked curiously, "Aren't there nineteen of you?"</p><p></p><p>Nati pointed at Cao Shilang: "He doesn't count. He's our junior."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang: "..."</p><p></p><p>The God of Bathing Light - Yi suddenly added, "Lord Jiavi, that is, Lord Lei'an."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu was stunned: "What...what? Who is Lord Jiavi?"</p><p></p><p>"Lei'an Oakes."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu's eyes almost popped out: "My third brother is Lord Jiavi???"</p><p></p><p>Yi thought to himself, "Indeed, Red Pu is Lord Lei'an's brother."</p><p></p><p>Nati was very surprised: "Oh? You didn't know?"</p><p></p><p>Red Pu's mind raced as he connected everything, suddenly realizing: "I see, I should have figured it out earlier..."</p><p></p><p>The problem now was, when he meets Suhao later, should he call him 'Lord Jiavi' or 'Third Brother Lei'an'?</p><p></p><p>Red Pu soon started chatting with the Eighteen Deities. After they introduced themselves, Red Pu's head was spinning.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why do your eighteen names all sound so familiar, as if I've heard them somewhere..."</p><p></p><p>He scratched his head with his paw, muttering, "Nati ~ Fuli ~ Gu ~ Anji ~ Qiao..."</p><p></p><p>As he scratched, his paw suddenly froze, and he looked at the eighteen in disbelief: "You...could you be the ancient Eighteen Deities? The God of Heavenly Order - Nati of the Golden Dragon Clan, the Goddess of Beauty - Fuli, the God of Myriad Thunders - Gu, the God of Storms - Anji, the God of Dreams - Qiao of the Black Dragon Clan, and the various deities of the Human Clan..."</p><p></p><p>Nati and the others exclaimed happily, "Haha, we didn't expect Red Pu to have heard of our titles. But that was a long time ago, no need to mention it. We dare not call ourselves deities now."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu was shocked: "You really are the ancient Eighteen Deities! Weren't you imprisoned by my third brother? Back then, the Red Pu Demon King Army was dedicated to rescuing you eighteen deities from the clutches of the Lei'an Demon King to bring peace to the world!</p><p></p><p>I never expected you to become Lei'an's subordinates. Our Red Pu Demon King Army's efforts were wasted all those years.</p><p></p><p>You should have told us earlier that you defected!"</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities: "???"</p><p></p><p>What nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Red Pu then said, "It's all in the past. I just didn't expect to meet the ancient Eighteen Deities here. This trip wasn't for nothing. Do you have a system? Let's add each other as friends. My username is 'Whirlwind Golden Dragon Shadow Wing Red Pu the Great Demon King'. Try searching for it."</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone added him as a friend. Red Pu pointed at the construction site and asked, "Do you know what they're doing over there?"</p><p></p><p>Nati was surprised: "Red Pu doesn't know? It seems they're building a world passage to connect all worlds into one vast land, according to Lord Jiavi's instructions. We came here specifically to observe this, following Lord Jiavi's orders."</p><p></p><p>Red Pu's eyes widened: "What? They didn't inform me about such a major event? I need to go back and find Cong Shuling. I want to be involved in this too."</p><p></p><p>With that, he teleported away, leaving the envious Eighteen Deities behind.</p><p></p><p>"When will we be able to come and go freely like Red Pu? Using a teleportation array for teleportation always feels so cheap. Who still uses teleportation arrays for movement these days?"</p><p></p><p>The abandoned Ji Ding and four others looked at each other, unsure why they had come here and what to do next.</p><p></p><p>After the construction began, Suhao, Yashan, and Feng Cheng wandered around observing the disciples building the world passage, overall very satisfied with the progress.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "Old pal Wei, at this rate, all existing life planets will be connected within a century, realizing your vision of an infinite land. However, I'm still undecided about how to protect the world passage. Although we've hidden the core deep underground where it usually won't be discovered or disrupted, I'm worried some troublemakers might intentionally sabotage it.</p><p></p><p>We can prevent accidents, but not malicious intent!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Preventing accidents is enough. When this infinite land is completed, there won't be any 'malicious intenders' wanting to destroy it."</p><p></p><p>The two were puzzled: "Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "By then, I'll spread a soul force network across the entire infinite land. All newly born intelligent life or beings with potential on this land will be imbued with a strand of soul force containing memories, programs to prevent the destruction of the world passage and planets, as well as basic information about the world."</p><p></p><p>Yashan was stunned at first, then understood Suhao's meaning and realized, "Indeed, we can't guarantee the world passage's absolute safety from violence, but we can control the organisms' desire to commit violence against it."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Not just that, we can even do some 'suggestions'. When they have the thought of destroying the world passage, we can directly make the world passage invisible to their consciousness through suggestions, unable to perceive its existence. Even if they pass through it, they won't realize it's the world passage."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng exclaimed from the side, "Amazing, Old Pal Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course, there are limitations. This system can only imbue newborns with soul force, not existing life. And when their consciousness power exceeds a certain level, they may be able to break free from the soul force's suggestive power."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought of something and couldn't help smiling, "Are those experts the so-called 'those who transcend the Three Realms and go beyond the Five Elements'?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also laughed, "Won't those beings born before the infinite land's formation be like the legendary 'Primordial Beings'?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 927</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and her brother were on vacation, sunbathing on the beach, when they suddenly received a mission from their master Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei jumped up and said, "We have a mission, sister. The master says to go see him now. I'll go back and change clothes first."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it wouldn't be appropriate to see their master wearing colorful beach shorts.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling also crawled out of the sand, shaking off the grains, muttering in puzzlement, "The master has never assigned us missions during our vacations before. This time must be different from usual."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she also transmitted away.</p><p></p><p>After they had cleaned up, when they arrived at Feng Cheng's palace, they found that eight other disciples were already waiting there.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they all assembled, Feng Cheng appeared and waved his hand, causing ten blue positioning stones the size of chicken eggs to appear before them.</p><p></p><p>"I'm giving you an urgent mission. Take these positioning stones in front of you and go separately to the following ten star systems. Contact me directly using the 'Double Sword Seal' when you arrive."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the other disciples responded in unison, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>They then transformed into streaks of light, flying towards the transmission hall.</p><p></p><p>The transmission formation there could directly connect to various distant star systems.</p><p></p><p>Waiting in front of the transmission formation, Cong Renfei couldn't help but ask, "Sister, whose positioning stone is this? Could it be the master's?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling rolled her eyes at him. "How would I know? But the master's positioning stone doesn't look like this. This is the first time I've seen a positioning stone like this. It seems much more advanced than ours."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei grinned. "I'm just asking you to guess."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said in a low voice, "I guess it's probably from one of our senior masters, you know which one I mean."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling paused slightly, glancing at her younger brother. Of course she understood what he meant. Their senior master Yazhan had his own disciples, so there was no need to assign this mission to them. He could just arrange it for his own disciples if needed. So her brother's implication was clear - the positioning stone in their hands belonged to their senior master Wei.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, an exceptionally handsome face with a faint smile involuntarily surfaced in Cong Shuling's mind...</p><p></p><p>Their senior master Wei was extremely mysterious. Even though they were among the earliest disciples accepted by Feng Cheng, after crossing over to the Crossed Star, they had never seen this legendary senior master Wei.</p><p></p><p>The reason they recognized Su Hao's appearance was solely from the impression left during their tea and porcelain studies on the Blue-Purple Star.</p><p></p><p>"Senior master Wei? Just what kind of person is he?"</p><p></p><p>She looked down at the positioning stone in her hand, speculating about everything regarding Su Hao, but at this moment she only had a vague impression. Even when in close contact during the tea and porcelain studies, she could not see Su Hao's true self clearly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her younger brother approach the transmission formation, Cong Shuling reminded him, "Little Fei, don't make baseless guesses, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei just grinned mischievously without answering, directly activating the transmission formation. After a flash of light, he disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling sighed, "Ai, Little Fei is becoming more disobedient. Is this the so-called rebellious phase of youth? He'll grow up eventually, but I can't control him anymore."</p><p></p><p>She then also entered the transmission formation, selected the designated code to input, and activated the transmission.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the scene changed. She arrived at a huge underground palace - this was the transmission formation left behind by disciples who had explored here before, maintained regularly.</p><p></p><p>She scanned with her divine sense, preparing to flash out and appear on the surface of this planet in two seconds.</p><p></p><p>This was a rocky planet with a relatively stable environment, not too violent, which was why it was chosen to build the transmission formation here.</p><p></p><p>She then enveloped herself in a faint yellow protective shield outside her body and flew up into space as a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>After carefully verifying she was in the right place, she sent a message to her master Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have arrived at the designated star system."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately replied, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>A few seconds later, a tall figure suddenly appeared beside Cong Shuling, giving her quite a fright.</p><p></p><p>She whipped her head around, and this exceptionally handsome face overlapped with the image of senior master Wei in her mind. Her eyes and mouth opened wide as she stammered, "You...You are senior master...Wei?"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Cong Renfei's speculation earlier, she had harbored a slight thought - if this really was senior master Wei's positioning stone, then there was a chance to see the elusive senior master Wei again?</p><p></p><p>She never expected this thought to become reality. In front of senior master Wei, the 'stillness of mind' she had cultivated over hundreds of years of practice was instantly shattered, leaving her feeling rather flustered.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned and smiled at her with a nod, but his attention was then focused on the 'Seeker's Spiritual Eye', trying to observe any possible fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>This was still a violently active star system, yet he did not observe any fluctuations around Cong Shuling.</p><p></p><p>In theory, for this region of stars, Cong Shuling should be considered a dimensional traveler. The moment she appeared in this realm, fluctuations should have immediately occurred.</p><p></p><p>However, there were none.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but break into a brilliant smile, thinking to himself, "My conclusion was correct. But I should conduct some more experiments and tests."</p><p></p><p>He turned to Cong Shuling and said, "You move back a bit."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling retreated a few steps upon hearing this, though she didn't fully understand what 'a bit' meant. But he didn't explain further, since as a Spirit Realm cultivator, she should be able to protect herself in any situation.</p><p></p><p>He casually took out a star-fragment cube given to him by Yazhan and tossed it onto the planet's surface, activating it with a thought.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao patiently waited in place.</p><p></p><p>Watching Su Hao's actions, Cong Shuling was full of puzzlement. "What is senior master Wei doing?"</p><p></p><p>She was extremely curious about this enigmatic senior master, wishing she could immediately know everything about him. This curiosity even surpassed her curiosity towards Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>The unattainable is always alluring.</p><p></p><p>As a Spirit Realm cultivator who had also received the external neural implant from Feng Cheng, giving her formidable power, her eyesight was naturally very sharp. She clearly saw the small cube Su Hao had thrown down, which eventually disappeared into the ground. But she didn't understand what it was.</p><p></p><p>Nor did she see any movement on the planet's surface.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Though puzzled, she didn't dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she noticed the planet's abnormalities. "It seems...there's an earthquake. Did senior master Wei throw down a bomb? But how could such a small bomb cause this effect?"</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour, she suddenly noticed something different. "The planet...seems to be in turmoil?"</p><p></p><p>A moment later, her mouth gradually opened wider. "The planet seems to be expanding. The entire planetary surface is undergoing violent changes, with lava erupting - a scene of utter devastation. Just what is happening?"</p><p></p><p>An hour later, she stared in astonishment at the scenes unfolding on the planet.</p><p></p><p>The entire planet was like a boiling pot, with countless metal spheres packed densely together, bouncing and pulsating like insect eggs. It was enough to make anyone with a phobia of tightly packed things break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Most critically, compared to before, the planet had expanded by no less than ten times its original size.</p><p></p><p>A sense of dread emanating from the planet shook her heart.</p><p></p><p>Ever since gaining greater power, she had not felt such trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Yet she never expected that upon seeing this senior master Wei again, she would once more experience this feeling of fear.</p><p></p><p>Her mind was full of bewilderment. "Just what did senior master Wei do? Why did it turn out like this...?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned to observe Cong Shuling, still not sensing any fluctuations around her, and couldn't help but burst into hearty laughter.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's heart skipped a beat. "Why is he laughing while looking at me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Alright, I'm going to another place now. Can you get back yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling nodded dazedly, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Then go back yourself!"</p><p></p><p>He then disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "..."</p><p></p><p>Staring at this planet covered in metal insect egg-like spheres, she felt a chill down her spine. Just as she was about to leave, she suddenly thought of the transmission formation issue. "The transmission formation seems to be destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>She sighed. "Never mind, I'll find another planet to rebuild a new transmission formation."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao had already transmitted to another star system, appearing beside one of the disciples.</p><p></p><p>This was a star system that had achieved dynamic equilibrium, possessing 'fluctuation lines'.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Su Hao saw this, he burst into hearty laughter.</p><p></p><p>Because he observed fluctuations around this disciple.</p><p></p><p>"All my years of planning and analysis have not been in vain. I've finally figured out what this 'Catastrophe System' really is - it's a dynamic equilibrium! Next, I'll research how to grasp and control this dynamic equilibrium. I believe it will definitely be useful for me."</p>

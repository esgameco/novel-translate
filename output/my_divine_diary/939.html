        <h1>Chapter 939</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The force that knocked us off the bridge came entirely from ourselves. In other words, we pushed ourselves off the tightrope bridge. This marvelous device merely collected our own force and reflected it back to us in a special way."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong opened his hands in amazement, exclaiming, "It's simply...too incredible!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er's eyes sparkled as she said, "And the most incredible part is that after we fell off the tightrope bridge, those balls quickly returned to stillness."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "That's right. I knew Shuangjian University was hiding something extraordinary, but I couldn't find any clues no matter how hard I looked. It turns out it was here. Perhaps after we solve this game, we can unveil the school's mysterious veil."</p><p></p><p>Since enrolling, Gong Jia'er had challenged the professors multiple times but failed miserably every time. However, she didn't feel embarrassed at all and flexibly changed her strategy: learn first.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhu Changdong's words, she nodded excitedly, "That's right, it seems we came to the right place this time. Confident, Changdong?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two made plans to go to the 'Balance Game Hall' after class every day to try and solve the tightrope bridge game.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what method they used, they failed without exception.</p><p></p><p>That day, the two walked out of the game hall with furrowed brows, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong scratched his head and muttered, "There's no avoiding it, we're bound to hit the balls. Once we do, it's already destined that we'll be knocked down by our own force. It's an unsolvable dead loop!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er also pondered, "The school wouldn't design such a game for no reason. There must be a purpose behind it. Perhaps if we find the purpose, we can find the solution."</p><p></p><p>"The purpose? Could it be to train our agility? No, that doesn't seem right. The more agile we are, the harder we'll fall. I think it wants us to find a way to avoid touching the balls, but avoiding the balls is impossible..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's think about it another way. What if we try to touch the balls without affecting the other balls?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong pondered and nodded, "That's very possible...touch the balls without affecting the others...the Balance Game?"</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, they had walked over to their motorcycles and were about to put on their helmets.</p><p></p><p>"!!!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of light struck Zhu Changdong's mind, leaving him dazed as if struck by lightning. He kept muttering, "Touch the balls without affecting the others...the Balance Game..."</p><p></p><p>He immediately put down his helmet, steadied his motorcycle, grabbed Gong Jia'er's hand and ran towards the game hall. "Jia'er, I think I understand something. Come with me, let's try again."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er followed Zhu Changdong in amazement, not understanding what he had realized but not asking to avoid disrupting his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Once on the platform, Zhu Changdong carefully stepped onto the tightrope bridge, highly focused on sensing the movement of the surrounding balls. He fell into the pool many times but kept getting up to try again.</p><p></p><p>After about 50 attempts, he finally burst into laughter. "Jia'er! I can solve this problem."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er looked at him in amazement. "How?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong urgently grabbed her hand and ran out. "Come with me, let's ask the school to use the manufacturing workshop. I need to make a 'cloaking device' so we can solve this game."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the next two months, Zhu Changdong shuttled between the manufacturing workshop and library, even applying to suspend his classes. Gong Jia'er became his assistant, helping him research and make auxiliary devices.</p><p></p><p>What shocked them most was that they could find any materials they wanted in the library and any machine tools in the workshop.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but marvel at Shuangjian University's profound heritage.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, with Gong Jia'er's help, Zhu Changdong donned a strange spacesuit-like device and slowly stepped onto the tightrope bridge.</p><p></p><p>The bridge wasn't very wide, and the device was quite heavy, but it didn't deter Zhu Changdong. He worked hard to maintain his balance and slowly walked inward.</p><p></p><p>"Dang dang dang!"</p><p></p><p>Numerous balls struck the special device, making dull thumping sounds as the entire space of balls began moving.</p><p></p><p>Though the impacts varied in force, they weren't enough to knock Zhu Changdong down in the device.</p><p></p><p>He walked deeper and deeper, reaching areas he had never been before. Excitedly, he shouted, "We did it! I can cross this tightrope bridge."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was extremely excited, a ball struck him, nearly causing him to lose his balance and fall.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong immediately fell silent and continued forward. Soon, he completed the tightrope bridge amidst the chaotic balls and stepped onto the opposite platform.</p><p></p><p>The moment he set foot on the opposite platform, the surrounding structures made "kaca kaca" sounds as the wires holding the balls retracted, slowly raising all the balls to the dome ceiling.</p><p></p><p>Then a beam of golden light shone down from the dome, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong waved at Gong Jia'er excitedly, "Jia'er, look! My 'cloaking device' worked!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er also jumped up and down excitedly, looking at the shouting young man with sparkling eyes. Such a boy was truly dashing.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Su Hao, who was organizing data in the Pinball Space, sensed something. "Huh? The Balance Game has been solved?"</p><p></p><p>He exited the Pinball Space and teleported to Shuangjian University. With his divine sense, he immediately located the two excited students and smiled, "So it was these two little fellows. Let me see how they solved this game."</p><p></p><p>As for whether he could gain inspiration for his 'Track Line' research, he didn't have high expectations.</p><p></p><p>After Gong Jia'er helped Zhu Changdong remove the device, Su Hao appeared before them with a faint smile. "Congratulations on completing the challenge."</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The two were startled by Su Hao's sudden appearance, jumping high as Zhu Changdong instinctively shielded Gong Jia'er behind him, looking at Su Hao in shock. "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He was certain there had been no one there before, so the sudden appearance of this man was a huge shock to his worldview.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to the tightrope bridge. "My name is Jia Wei. I set up this Balance Game. When I sensed you completed the challenge, I came over."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong exhaled in relief. "Appearing so suddenly, you nearly scared me to death."</p><p></p><p>He looked around, as if searching for where someone could hide or what entrance Su Hao could have taken to get near them so quickly. He still had many doubts about Su Hao's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to Zhu Changdong's device. "Can you explain how you crossed the tightrope bridge?"</p><p></p><p>At this, Zhu Changdong immediately smiled proudly. "It's quite simple! I discovered these balls have a certain targeting function that inexplicably allows them to find my precise location and then knock me down. So I made this 'cloaking device' to prevent the balls from determining my position, allowing me to avoid their impacts and cross successfully."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao became interested. "A cloaking device? How did you cloak yourself from these balls?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong glanced at Gong Jia'er to seek her approval. Gong Jia'er smiled happily, "Go ahead and tell him!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong grinned, "I tried crossing this tightrope bridge at least a few hundred times. I discovered an amazing phenomenon - after I fell off the bridge, these balls would quickly and mysteriously stop moving. After repeated testing, I roughly guessed the reason. I think it's because after losing its target, the system goes through complex internal changes to self-adjust and regain balance.</p><p></p><p>So I thought, as long as the balls can't find me, they'll naturally restore balance themselves. During this process, the impact force of the balls would rapidly weaken and be unable to knock me down."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Then how did you prevent the balls from finding you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong smiled even more brilliantly. "It's actually quite simple. As long as I give these balls that hit me incorrect feedback, they won't be able to lock onto my position."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's mind raced as he seemed to grasp the youth's thinking. "Incorrect feedback? Go on, how did you give the balls incorrect feedback?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "Let's make an assumption. There's an unsupported bicycle perfectly balanced and standing upright on the ground. If we gently push it from one side, what will happen?</p><p></p><p>For the balls, it's the same. When I walk across the tightrope bridge and the balls strike me, what will be the result? Naturally, they'll either rebound or be cushioned by my soft flesh and stop. No matter the manifestation, there will be a reaction in accordance with basic physics.</p><p></p><p>I guess these balls use this physical reaction to lock onto my position, though I don't know how they do it so precisely.</p><p></p><p>But then the question arises, if we install a gyroscope on that bicycle, turning it into an unridable toy, and I push it again, will it still fall over to the other side?</p><p></p><p>You see, as long as I install a gyroscope, I can easily deceive anyone watching me push the bicycle. They'll think it will fall over, but it won't.</p><p></p><p>So..." He grinned and pointed to his 'cloaking device'. "Jia'er and I installed 'gyroscopes' on this device in all directions. When the device is struck, it immediately gives the impacting balls incorrect rebound forces. If it should rebound backward, I make it go left instead. If it should stop, I make it go right. Basically, I don't let it react the way it naturally should.</p><p></p><p>This way, I disrupted the entire system, and it couldn't find my position. Then it would automatically rebalance and dissipate its force, allowing me to cross the tightrope bridge smoothly. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the bridge. "Your Balance Game is good! If I hadn't gained inspiration for balance from motorcycles, I probably wouldn't have solved it for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled at the two students, then suddenly said, "Do you remember the banner outside mentioning a 'grand prize'?"</p><p></p><p>The two immediately widened their eyes at Su Hao. "A prize? What prize?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to himself. "I can take you as my disciples."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er froze. "Just that?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Just that!"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, utterly speechless.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong asked, "Then what can you teach us? To be honest, we've already self-studied everything from the university."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Normally speaking, I can teach you whatever you want to learn."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er thought inwardly, "Damn, we've encountered a braggart."</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er, being quicker with words, smiled and said, "What if I want to learn immortal cultivation and eternal life?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong secretly gave Gong Jia'er a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's naturally possible."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er: "???"</p>

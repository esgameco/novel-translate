        <h1>Chapter 857</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>While the eighteen deities were exploring the red giant star, Suhao modeled the environment of the red giant based on the feedback from the deities and the information observed from the 'Galactic Network'.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the simulation became more and more refined.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he started designing a small world and rune formation to simulate the red giant environment.</p><p></p><p>With his analysis of soul power over the years, as long as he could find the environment where Baijia was born, it would not be difficult for him to create many 'coincidences' through his own means, independently generate soul power.</p><p></p><p>The most feared thing was having no clue or direction.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had found Baijia's gathering place, he was only a large amount of time and extensive experiments away from simulating soul power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the eighteen deities could truly find the newly born Baijia, the time for this experimental attempt would be even shorter.</p><p></p><p>For this, Suhao actually did not have high expectations. The red giant was simply too huge. Not to mention two years, even if it took twenty years to find a newly descended Baijia, Suhao thought the eighteen deities would just be incredibly lucky.</p><p></p><p>Suhao gave the deities two years, thinking that finding things was often not about blindly wandering around, but about employing proper methods and techniques. If they were willing to use their brains, it was not impossible to find it within two years.</p><p></p><p>Whether they could find it or not depended on the deities' own performance.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they could find it or not, Suhao had a nonchalant attitude: as long as I have no expectations, I won't be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to pinning his hopes on this group of deities to find the conditions for Baijia's birth, he was more willing to believe in his own extensive experiments and analysis.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The deities became more and more anxious as they searched, because they had been looking for a long time for the second task but had no clues. On such a huge red giant, how difficult it was to find a newly born Baijia.</p><p></p><p>So the anxious deities regathered to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't we find it? There are so many Baijia on the red giant, there's no way we can't find where they are born!"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Suppressing Heaven, Nati, seemed to have an idea and his eyes lit up: "Do you think Baijia might hatch from eggs like our dragon race? Maybe we've been looking in the wrong direction. We should go look for Baijia eggs."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Myriad Thunders, Gu, couldn't help mocking: "Use your dragon clan's brain for once, please. Our dragon race's face has already been lost, we're just short of being labeled as 'unintelligent'."</p><p></p><p>Nati was so angry he almost wanted to jump up and beat Gu: "It's just a guess, don't you understand guessing? It's normal to guess wrong, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Myriad Thunders, Gu said: "Baijia generally come from individual fission, just like our dragons hatching from eggs. But notice, the task doesn't ask us to find a dividing Baijia, but to find a 'naturally born' Baijia.</p><p></p><p>This is the hardest part, it's like asking you to find a hatching dragon on the Shizixing, which is very simple, but asking you to find a 'spontaneously generated, naturally born' dragon, how would you plan to find it?"</p><p></p><p>Nati asked doubtfully: "Yeah, how would we find it?"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Salvation, Baishen, laughed: "You simply can't find it."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Revivification, Zhuxia also said: "That's right, even if you turn over the entire Shizixing, you can't find a naturally born dragon race. Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Order, Hongguang, had a dark aura around his body: "If that's the case, what does Lord Leian mean by asking us to find it?"</p><p></p><p>Then he lowered his voice: "Is he playing with us?"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Bathing in Light, Yi said coquettishly: "That's not the case. Don't you all notice one characteristic of what's born on the red giant? That is, monotony - there is only one species, the Baijia, completely different from the diverse species on our Shizixing. In other words, it's not appropriate to compare the Baijia race with the creatures on our Shizixing. Besides fission birth, there is a high possibility that Baijia also have natural birth."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Golden Light, Bali, secretly messaged the Deity of Eternal Night, Yongshi: "What Lord Yi said seems to make sense. Lord Yongshi, as the chief deity, don't you want to express your opinion and liven up the atmosphere a bit?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi was too lazy to respond to him.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Myriad Thunders, Gu snorted: "So you're saying, Lord Yi has a way to find the newly born deities?"</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Bathing in Light, Yi shook his head: "No. But if we change our search target, we might discover something."</p><p></p><p>The deities asked curiously: "What target?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's find the place on the entire red giant where Baijia are most densely concentrated. I think if there is a birthplace for Baijia, there must be a massive gathering of Baijia around it, whether to protect the birthplace or because the environment is suitable. The possibility of Baijia gathering at the birthplace is very high."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yongshi expressed a different opinion: "Although Lord Yi's method is worth trying, I want to say that the more precious something is, the fewer people obtain it, and the more hidden it is kept. It has always been this way. Of course, I'm just expressing my own opinion and don't object to searching for places where Baijia gather."</p><p></p><p>Bali sent Yongshi another message: "Lord Yongshi, since you don't object, why do you still need to express your opinion?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi: "Bali, shut up."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Salvation, Baishen laughed: "Then it's decided, we'll focus on finding places where Baijia gather in large numbers."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A year and a half later, Suhao received a notification from Xiaokuang that the eighteen deities had submitted a task completion report.</p><p></p><p>Suhao seemed very surprised: "The task is completed? Their luck is too good! My 'small world rune formation' simulating the red giant environment has just taken shape, and I haven't officially started the experiments yet..."</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled that it seemed like besides Yashan, he had the worst luck. Even that seemingly silly guy Fengcheng had ridiculously good luck.</p><p></p><p>Suhao entered the Pinball Space and pulled up the specific data. He found the eighteen deities surrounding a huge cavern, looking at the manifested assistant screen with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After casually sending a message saying 'Verifying, please wait', he reviewed the data submitted by the eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>The deities had two discoveries. One was that a massive number of Baijia had gathered around this huge cavern, which could be considered the place they found the most Baijia on the entire red giant. The other discovery was this bottomless pit - when the deities went inside, they sensed an ocean of soul power violently pressing against their bodies, as if it were a sea of soul power.</p><p></p><p>Although it was an ocean of soul power, they did not feel comfortable at all when inside. Instead, they felt dizzy, as if...drunk on oxygen?</p><p></p><p>Suhao inwardly criticized: "These deities are too casual in doing tasks, submitting the task without even finding the specific target?"</p><p></p><p>However, after reviewing the deities' exploration results, Suhao also agreed that this place had a 90% possibility of being Baijia's birthplace.</p><p></p><p>"The reason we can't see any newly born Baijia now may be because after tens of millions of years of evolution, the environment here has changed drastically compared to before and no longer naturally gives birth to Baijia. It's also possible that the birth of Baijia takes a very long time, so we can't detect any abnormalities for now and need to wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>In any case, this was an unexpected surprise for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as long as he didn't have any expectations of the deities, when there were gains, it brought surprise...</p><p></p><p>Suhao immediately gave the deities his response on the task: "Task completion degree judged: 60%. Reason: Did not find a specific newly born Baijia. Reward halved: Unlocked group chat function."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities were speechless: "......"</p><p></p><p>How did they not know there was a task completion degree?</p><p></p><p>If they had known there was a completion degree, they would have definitely continued to try their best within the time limit to find the newly born Baijia, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late to say anything now.</p><p></p><p>After the group chat function was opened, the deities quickly figured out how to use it and soon began accusing and flaming each other in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Whose idea was it to just submit the task like that? Step forward!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Hongguang's, I think?"</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense and slandering me. Throughout the whole process, I didn't say a single word, okay? Don't just accuse me with prejudice before anything is clear!"</p><p></p><p>"Then it must be Lords Yongshi and Bali. Those two like to back out at the last minute the most, and they really enjoy instigating others in an underhanded way. Very insidious."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense, it does seem to be those two. What kind of stuff are they up to?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone trading accusations back and forth, Bali was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Then the Deity of Eternal Night, Yongshi, who had been silent, uploaded the video record of their previous chat and said, "Oh, I discovered this group chat seems to have a video upload function, so I uploaded the record of our previous chat. You all can take a look."</p><p></p><p>The deities were shocked: "There was a chat record?"</p><p></p><p>Well, no problem then!</p><p></p><p>The topic shifted away from dwelling on who initially proposed submitting the task.</p><p></p><p>Bali was full of admiration for Yongshi and couldn't help giving him a thumbs up repeatedly in private messages, praising: "Lord Yongshi is still the best, he really doesn't take any losses. By the way, how do you upload videos? Please teach me."</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, the third task Suhao had arranged for them had arrived: "Delve into the 'Birthplace' space, unlock the new 'Exploration' function, and record the full view of the 'Birthplace'. Time limit: 5 years. Reward: Virtual Battle Royale, Mysterious Game Item x1."</p>

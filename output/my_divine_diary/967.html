        <h1>Chapter 967</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei did not intend to easily show hostility when facing the martial artists of this world.</p><p></p><p>First, they represented the face of the Double Sword Sect and the Infinite Land. Second, as outsiders coming to this planet, they first brought goodwill, and only decided to show malice if the other party did not accept their goodwill.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the two of them had remained restrained since arriving in this world. If they could be friends, there was no need to be enemies.</p><p></p><p>The saying "No fight, no acquaintance" was often difficult to put into practice in many cases.</p><p></p><p>Once they started fighting, it would no longer be a matter of just saying a few words to resolve the issue.</p><p></p><p>For these martial artists who had been fighting for years, once they took action, their ultimate goal would inevitably be to thoroughly defeat the enemy, fighting with all their might.</p><p></p><p>Although Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei, the brother and sister, had lived in the Infinite Land and Infinite Starry Sky for many years and had personally taken many lives, under Feng Cheng's influence, they still maintained a certain respect for life and would not easily deprive others of their lives under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the other party was unwilling to be friends, that would be another matter - the two of them were not gentle people either.</p><p></p><p>Now was the most difficult time for communication between the two sides. Taking rash action could easily make the other party mistake it for an attack.</p><p></p><p>For example, the two clusters of faintly yellow glowing "language soul force packets" in Cong Renfei's hands looked very much like energy ball attacks in this world.</p><p></p><p>Throwing them over directly could hardly avoid provoking a violent reaction from the other party.</p><p></p><p>What should they do?</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "......"</p><p></p><p>Attract attention? Did she have to dance awkwardly on the spot?</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling immediately said, "This won't work. When the language packets make contact, they will definitely arouse the other party's vigilance. It's no different from a sneak attack. Give me the soul force packets, and let me handle it!"</p><p></p><p>After taking the soul force packets from Cong Renfei, Cong Shuling first made various gestures to show that she had no malicious intent. Then she pointed to her mouth, indicating that the two clusters of soul force could solve the communication problem. Finally, regardless of whether the other party could understand or not, she casually gave one of the language packets a light push, sending it drifting over.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man Gao Qi and the spiky-haired Tai Cheng looked at Cong Shuling's gestures with utter confusion, finally staring at the slowly floating language packet.</p><p></p><p>The spiky-haired Tai Cheng couldn't help but say, "Gao Qi, what do they mean? I don't sense any malice from them, and what is this thing? It doesn't seem to have any aura."</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man Gao Qi frowned and said, "It seems they can't understand what we're saying. Is this their way of communicating?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the language packet floating in front of them, Tai Cheng said, "Let me try."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gao Qi's objection, he reached out and grabbed the language packet, holding it in his hand. Nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>As the two of them looked on in bewilderment, they saw the woman gesturing for them to stuff the soul force packet into their brains.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Tai Cheng followed Cong Shuling's example and stuffed the language packet directly into his own brain.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man Gao Qi's eyes nearly popped out as he scolded, "You idiot Tai Cheng, how could you so easily trust strangers?"</p><p></p><p>The spiky-haired Tai Cheng looked at Gao Qi in confusion, "Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi fixed one eye on Tai Cheng and the other on Cong Shuling and her brother, full of vigilance, and asked, "Is everything all right?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng said, "I feel a bit dizzy, but I'll be fine after shaking my head."</p><p></p><p>The two sides remained silent for a moment, neither taking any action.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, An Mingwang and Lv Yijiang were still fiercely fighting, plowing through the surrounding land over and over again.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, Cong Renfei tried asking, "Hello, can you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p></p><p>The spiky-haired Tai Cheng looked at Cong Renfei in amazement and pointed at himself, asking in the local language that Cong Renfei couldn't understand, "Are you talking to me?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said again, "Can you understand me now? If you can, just nod your head. That cluster of light mist was our unique ability to allow others to understand what we're saying. We mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng nodded and said, "I understand. This is too amazing. What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired Gao Qi asked in confusion, "What's going on? Tai Cheng, what are you saying?"</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng replied, "Gao Qi, I can understand what they're saying. They said that thing allows us to understand them, and they mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cong Shuling threw over the other language packet, "This is another language packet. Let your friend receive it, then we'll be able to communicate."</p><p></p><p>Tai Cheng immediately translated for Gao Qi. Although skeptical, Gao Qi trusted his friend wouldn't lie to him, but he was torn about whether to accept the language packet.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he thought inwardly, "As a martial artist, perhaps it's because I'm so indecisive that I've fallen far behind Yijiang. Even Tai Cheng is more decisive than me in this regard.</p><p></p><p>My master once said that a true martial artist has absolute self-confidence and absolute trust in their own judgment and intuition, while I... I rely more on my brain and common sense. This is where I fall short compared to Yijiang...</p><p></p><p>Damn it! How can I let them outdo me? I must also trust my intuition instead of my brain!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Gao Qi grabbed the language packet and slapped it against his own head.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei curiously messaged Cong Shuling, "Sister, did you see that guy's face changing expressions?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "No idea."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two sides were able to communicate successfully. An additional language suddenly appeared in their minds, leaving Gao Qi utterly astonished - he had never heard of such a martial art before.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Two friends, try using the new language to communicate with us. We can't understand your language."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"We come from the Infinite Land. It's hard to explain everything to you right now. Just know that we're from a different place.</p><p></p><p>We have no need to deceive you. As you can see, I can't even understand your language, which proves it from the side.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we mean no harm. We only want to befriend you and have a good exchange to broaden our horizons. Perhaps we can all gain something from it.</p><p></p><p>You are very strong, but my thin arms and legs pose little threat to you. There's no need to be wary of us."</p><p></p><p>After Cong Renfei's long explanation, he nearly confused Gao Qi and Tai Cheng, but there was one thing they understood - the two people claimed to be very weak and posed no threat to them.</p><p></p><p>After comparing their muscles, heights, and "qi", Gao Qi and Tai Cheng agreed with this point.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi stammered, "No matter who you are, this place is dangerous. You should leave quickly to avoid getting caught up in it."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said, "Don't worry, these are just our projections. Our true bodies are not here, so we won't be affected by the battle."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a large number of stone fragments exploded towards them, passing through Cong Shuling and her brother without causing any harm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng's eyes narrowed. "Projections? Truly an amazing martial art."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they still didn't understand what Cong Renfei meant by the "Infinite Land" and "different place". They subconsciously assumed the two came from some small island, a hidden village, or an unknown small town.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei pointed at the two people fighting madly and asked curiously, "By the way, what are those two doing? It feels like they're going to shatter this entire area."</p><p></p><p>At this, Gao Qi's expression turned grim. He turned towards the battlefield and clenched his fists. "An Mingwang intends to use his evil powers to rule this world. He wants to drag everyone into darkness to become tools for his pleasure.</p><p></p><p>He has already destroyed fifteen cities that resisted him, and countless people have died at his hands. We're trying to stop him, and we must stop him."</p><p></p><p>The spiky-haired Tai Cheng also said, "But none of our strength is a match for An Mingwang. He's too powerful. Right now, only Lv Yijiang can fight him. In such a battle, we don't even have the right to intervene. Lv Yijiang is the hope for all of us now."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei realized, "Oh, I see. The righteous companions are trying to defeat the great Demon King and save the world. This is the most critical final battle.</p><p></p><p>If they win, the world will gain freedom and peace. If they lose, the world will tremble under the Demon King's cruel rule."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi said solemnly, "That's right."</p>

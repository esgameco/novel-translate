        <h1>Chapter 663</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao first named this substance 'Seeker Zero'.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was that this space journey sought the starting point of matter.</p><p></p><p>Then he recorded the characteristics and structure of this substance into the Ballistic Space using his blood aura, recording everything about it.</p><p></p><p>Next, he analyzed the energy coefficient and other data of 'Seeker Zero', trying to directly transform it using the Source.</p><p></p><p>The goal was to ensure that the next time he was reincarnated into another world, he could successfully manifest this substance, without having to wait for a major catastrophic energy to return and form it naturally.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he used this substance to create the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye', embedding it into the 'Spiritual Ring', and then observed how the catastrophic system's energy operated.</p><p></p><p>And he sought a way to counteract it.</p><p></p><p>Once he saw it, he would not be far from understanding it. And once he understood it, how far away could breaking through it be?</p><p></p><p>As long as Suhao could break through the catastrophic system, it meant that in the next world, he could truly survive for over five thousand years without having to worry about other messy things, or worry about suddenly stopping thinking one day for no reason, only to open his eyes and find himself in another world.</p><p></p><p>In other words, only he would cause trouble, trouble would not be able to find him!</p><p></p><p>"The catastrophe that has haunted me all along, embrace me!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A year later, Suhao completed the task of directly transforming 'Seeker Zero' using the Source.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty was higher than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>This 'Seeker Zero' substance was different from the ordinary substances he was familiar with. It was a 'mixture', with a microscopic structure that was both tightly bound and loose, with a large number of neutrons inside the atomic nuclei, which was the reason for Seeker Zero's extreme mass. What caught Suhao's attention was that Seeker Zero had very few free electrons, making it difficult to shield and reflect photons, giving it a semi-transparent, crystal-like appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was also because its structure was too complex that it took Suhao a long time to find its pattern and transform it using the Source.</p><p></p><p>"Next, create the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye'! But without a high-precision workshop, the difficulty is not small."</p><p></p><p>If he were on a spacecraft, it would probably take about a month to complete successfully.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was like being on a desolate planet, without any foundation. To manufacture a high-precision product was no ordinary difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"If I could use spiritual power or runes to directly simulate the characteristics of the 'Seeker' series of materials, separating from the material itself, and thereby realizing the observational power of the 'Spiritual Eye', it would be much more convenient."</p><p></p><p>The idea was wonderful, but how long it would take to truly realize it was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Although it was difficult to create the 'Spiritual Eye' at this time, Suhao had already made plans: use the Source to transform specific metals or other necessary materials, and then let Xiaolite cooperate to pinch a small workbench by hand.</p><p></p><p>Starting from scratch to make a workbench was not something Suhao had never done before.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was studying genetics in the Zhuhuo Human World, the conditions were even more difficult than this.</p><p></p><p>Next, Suhao started acting according to the plan he had made, working almost non-stop, enduring as much as he could, even more hardworking than 007.</p><p></p><p>After another three years, Suhao finally obtained the first 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye', a diamond-shaped crystal that looked neat and beautiful, with a large number of tiny needles pointing downwards like a computer CPU.</p><p></p><p>Suhao connected it to an instrument and tested its operation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he revealed a rare smile and muttered to himself, "Operation successful! Then, start decoding the signal of this Spiritual Eye. It will probably take two years!"</p><p></p><p>Having the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye' was useless. Only by converting its specific wave signals into brainwave signals that the brain could process could one perceive the corresponding fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao had to take the next step, which was to write a signal conversion program to achieve seamless connection of all signals.</p><p></p><p>And this was the most complex step in creating the Spiritual Eye. Only someone like him, who had decoded more than 40% of consciousness information, could do this.</p><p></p><p>Even Ayashan and Fengcheng, with their technical skills to create the 'Spiritual Eye', would not be able to write a program to make it run.</p><p></p><p>Suhao carefully picked up the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye' with his hand, then placed it in front of his forehead. The Vajra armor on his head automatically surged out, wrapping around it and swallowing it into his brain.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Suhao carefully controlled the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye', moving it into a groove in the Seeker Ring inside his skull, with the needles aligning seamlessly into the groove.</p><p></p><p>"Click!"</p><p></p><p>It sounded like there was this sound, or maybe not!</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, "Good! Next, let me see what this 'catastrophic system' that has been playing with me for so long really is!"</p><p></p><p>No more hesitation.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>As if it took less than a second, yet also as if a long time had passed, Suhao's 'Seeker Zero' senses gradually lit up, filling his spiritual vision.</p><p></p><p>"This is......"</p><p></p><p>What the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye' perceived, Suhao found it difficult to describe with words. The moment he perceived it, he realized that such a scene should not be seen by human eyes, but could only exist in the imagination, or even beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>It was like a vortex, or like a chrysanthemum blooming wildly, and he was at the center of this vortex and chrysanthemum. Strands, wrinkles, curved surfaces, or twisted cubes from the void were connected to his body like chains, binding him in place.</p><p></p><p>Or from another perspective, it was as if his body was covered with all kinds of strange, winding things reaching out into the unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was like a person being caged - from his perspective, it was actually the whole world that he had caged.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed at the center of the vortex, but this vortex was special - things did not converge from the outside towards the center, but rather extended outwards from the center.</p><p></p><p>The moment Suhao saw it with the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye', he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The first impression was 'vastness'.</p><p></p><p>It was like a person gazing at the brilliant starry sky for the first time, that kind of profound and distant feeling that made one breathless, that kind of ultimate beauty that also made one marvel.</p><p></p><p>When Suhao came to his senses, he let out a long breath and muttered, "That's right, it's it! I just didn't expect that there would be such a thing on me, which I couldn't sense at all before, and didn't even dare to imagine!"</p><p></p><p>However, he knew that what he was seeing now was not the full picture of the 'catastrophic system', but only the motion form that he had transformed into something perceptible using a special method. Its true appearance might be vastly different from what he perceived.</p><p></p><p>Suhao observed for a moment, then tried to cut off the perception.</p><p></p><p>The moment the perception was cut off, the scene he perceived gradually dimmed, and the world returned to its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Suhao tried to observe according to the feeling he had just perceived, using his physical eyes, divine consciousness, and spiritual tentacles, but he could not find the slightest trace.</p><p></p><p>All his senses conveyed one signal - nothing!</p><p></p><p>Suhao reactivated the 'Seeker Zero Spiritual Eye', and that vast feeling entered his perception again.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the energy wave of the catastrophic system? What kind of thing is it that can trigger such a huge particle flood and instantly destroy an entire spacecraft!"</p><p></p><p>Even though he could now perceive its existence, Suhao still didn't understand what this thing was.</p><p></p><p>It was like a primitive man seeing a bolt of lightning strike down from the sky, but not knowing what lightning was.</p><p></p><p>"Test it first!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao gave this catastrophic system energy wave a name, calling it the 'Run Wave', which was an abbreviation for the catastrophic system.</p><p></p><p>Since the Run Wave extended outward with him as the focus, it must change with his movements.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Suhao could no longer find a second life at the moment, so he could not sense whether other lives would have this 'Run Wave'. He could only observe it in the next world.</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened his eyes and compared the Run Wave with what he actually saw, finding that the Run Wave could almost ignore the influence of real matter, passing directly through the planet and spreading into the distant starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Can it ignore all real matter?"</p><p></p><p>After carefully comparing it again, Suhao found a slight anomaly: "No, it will be slightly affected by the gravitational pull of matter...let's put aside the research on this point for now!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he instantly teleported to another location.</p><p></p><p>The moment he reappeared, Suhao was very puzzled: "What's going on here......"</p>

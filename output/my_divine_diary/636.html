        <h1>Chapter 636</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>How powerful was Su Hao's body after all?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao himself actually didn't have a standard to measure it.</p><p></p><p>First, he was a grandmaster martial artist, then he had the cells of a Level 7 Anomaly [Destiny Child], as well as the spirit body with cultivated inner energy, and the source body enhanced by source amplification...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this didn't include all kinds of miscellaneous amplification effects.</p><p></p><p>With such a physique, it was almost impossible for viruses to invade Su Hao's body.</p><p></p><p>Even if they succeeded in entering through the mouth and nose, they could not fool Su Hao's powerful immune system.</p><p></p><p>So before injecting the virus, he very thoughtfully injected himself with an immune system suppressor first, lowering his own immune function to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, under Su Hao's careful care, the virus successfully broke through Su Hao's cells and began replicating in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>And Su Hao grasped the entire process of the virus damaging the body.</p><p></p><p>This microscopic battle shook Su Hao greatly.</p><p></p><p>A very, very long time ago, Su Hao had died once from contracting the plague. Later, when he had the opportunity, he specially studied viruses for a period of time. But as his physical quality gradually improved and he almost became impervious to viruses, he stopped paying attention to them. He had never before observed the process of a virus invading his own body from multiple angles like he was doing now.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but exclaim again: "This is the wisdom of nature!"</p><p></p><p>Life always finds unexpected ways to survive, and these ways contain the highest wisdom.</p><p></p><p>In the bouncing space, Su Hao repeatedly played back the process of the virus invading the cells - deceiving the cell membrane, invading the cell, then replicating massively inside using the cell's functions, finally breaking out of the cell and releasing more viruses to invade other cells...</p><p></p><p>This was the 'chain reaction of source' that Su Hao was looking for!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly drafted a plan for the 'Planet Virus' in the bouncing space: "The core of the Planet Virus must contain two parts - one is a 'powerful focus system' that can rapidly convert specific substances into source, and the other is a 'source conversion system' that can convert source into specific substances and energy.</p><p></p><p>With these two major systems, it can complete the task of destroying a planet.</p><p></p><p>The 'focus system' can convert the substances on the planet into a large number of source pearls, while the 'source conversion system' can convert the source pearls into specific substances and energy, forming a closed loop.</p><p></p><p>The substances are used to construct new 'focus systems' and 'source conversion systems', forming new 'Planet Viruses'...</p><p></p><p>The energy is used to drive the spread and operation of the new 'Planet Viruses'...</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it is a creator that can infinitely replicate itself by utilizing surrounding substances.</p><p></p><p>When the entire planet turns into 'Planet Viruses', it can activate the preset self-destruct system, converting all 'Planet Viruses' back into source, becoming pure energy beams radiating into the depths of the universe..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the clearer Su Hao's ideas became, and he soon grasped the core of the 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exited the bouncing space, opened his eyes flashing with a brilliant light terrifying even to planets: "'The focus system' is relatively simple, the difficult part is the 'source conversion system' - how to convert source into new 'Planet Viruses'...It's time to absorb the knowledge of source devices! Source devices can solve my problem!"</p><p></p><p>Although there were no pure replication source devices, there were countless source devices related to 'replication'.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I don't need to obtain actual physical substances, 'temporary material products' are enough. It doesn't need to be as complicated as converting spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>After all, 'temporary material products' have properties similar to physical substances, and can be maintained for two hours!</p><p></p><p>Two hours is enough time for the 'Planet Virus' to complete its mission.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After finding a feasible approach, Su Hao resumed his life of half-lying by the pool pavilion studying materials.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Yashan's research on source devices had become very in-depth.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao needed to do was fully absorb Yashan's research results, and then design the 'source conversion system' for the virus himself.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was currently in the small world base, leading Feng Cheng and Fei Diao in commanding the construction of spaceships. If he encountered anything unclear or too complex and time-consuming, he could directly ask Yashan to come over and demonstrate it.</p><p></p><p>Three years later, not only had he absorbed all of Yashan's research results, but he had also designed the first version of the 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>This was a metal sphere as large as a truck, shaped like an ellipsoid, looking like a huge deep-sea bomb.</p><p></p><p>"Let's test its effect first!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao brought this 1.0 version of the 'Planet Virus' to Jian Star, then pointed with his hand to blast a deep hole on the surface that went straight through to the planet's interior, and dropped the metal sphere into the hole.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have high hopes for this 'Planet Virus', as long as it could operate, that would be considered a success.</p><p></p><p>After the 'Planet Virus' entered the planet's interior, Su Hao activated the trigger mechanism with his spiritual sense while closely watching the operation process. Failure didn't matter, what was important was knowing where it failed.</p><p></p><p>The metal sphere activated, splitting into two halves that drilled in two directions. After reaching a certain distance, they stopped.</p><p></p><p>Next, numerous holes opened up on the metal shells, and countless tadpole-like metal devices emerged from the holes, densely penetrating the rock layers and forming an ellipsoid around the focus point, jointly forming a huge 'focus system'.</p><p></p><p>The positions of the two metal sphere halves were right next to the foci...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed closely, and when he saw this, he thought: "The source conversion system is set up, full power output. It will only take two minutes to obtain a large amount of 'source', then the next step is..."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Hao could think further, the two hemispheres of the 1.0 version 'Planet Virus' suddenly flashed with sparks and started smoking.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "..."</p><p></p><p>Okay, failure was to be expected! If it didn't fail, that would be going against heaven.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pulled out the two damaged hemispheres and inspected the cause of the damage.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for him to find the problem: "There was a slight deviation in setting up the focus system, causing the focus point to be locked inside the machine, resulting in the machine being damaged! It seems the positioning system I designed was too crude. Let's stop here for today, I'll go back and update the positioning system, then make version 1.1."</p><p></p><p>Four months later, Su Hao reappeared on Jian Star at the same spot, unhesitatingly dropping the enormously large 'Planet Virus' into the planet's interior.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>"Failed again, that's normal! The loophole from last time was fixed, but this time the problem was with the energy distribution - simply put, the 'source conversion system' converted too few source pearls, not enough to complete the next task, so it shut down..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and optimize the energy system, boost the 'source conversion' power to the maximum!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao went back again.</p><p></p><p>A few months later, he reappeared above Jian Star, dropping another enormously large metal ellipsoid as before.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for a moment...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, failed again, no problem, there's progress."</p><p></p><p>Initially, from Su Hao's design to production, it took about four to six months to make one 'Planet Virus', which was very time and labor intensive.  </p><p></p><p>But due to the many failures, Su Hao's manufacturing skills improved year by year. Five years later, it only took two months to produce one.</p><p></p><p>If it failed again, his manufacturing efficiency would soon reach one per month!</p><p></p><p>This day, Su Hao carried a metal ellipsoid even larger than before and came to Jian Star again.</p><p></p><p>By now, the fixed location on Jian Star had been completely ruined by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, dropped the 'Planet Virus', activated it, and waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>Three minutes later, Su Hao exhaled: "As expected! Failed again! Okay, I'm not in a rush, I'll just go back and keep tinkering slowly!"</p><p></p><p>Another ten years later, Su Hao's skills had greatly improved, and he had sorted out which parts were important and which were not.</p><p></p><p>The production speed was now as fast as one every fifteen days.</p><p></p><p>As the production speed got faster and faster, Su Hao's 'Planet Virus' became more and more refined. By now, he had solved the key problem of 'self-replication'!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely at this time when Su Hao was about to test it again that Feng Cheng sent Su Hao a message: "Master Wei, Zhi Peng has passed away. The good news is that most of his 'friends' died before him, so it didn't cause much turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to my observations, after Zhi Peng's death, the source ability effect he had disappeared. The remaining 'friends' were mostly dazed for a while, and then realized that they had been controlled by Zhi Peng's source ability all these years.</p><p></p><p>These people did not show the sadness that friends should have towards Zhi Peng's death.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, they had years of friendship, so they won't go overboard."</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao heard this, he paused thoughtfully: "The spiritual anomaly disaster didn't change the essence of the spirit, did it? Just like that 'infectious disease' behemoth pig, perhaps it was only a projection on a certain dimension. Dimension... what is that again?"</p>

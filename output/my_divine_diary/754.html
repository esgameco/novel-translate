        <h1>Chapter 754</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Thus, Su Hao conducted 20 years of dedicated research on the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>He basically cracked the secrets of the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>For example, his research on bluegems found that bluegem concentration was positively correlated with the clarity of the 'Planetary Network', allowing him to obtain miniaturized blue crystal products;</p><p></p><p>For example, his research on gravitational waves and space-time curvature allowed him to determine the minimum curvature required to access the network, giving him confidence to connect to other galactic networks...</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the experimental micro-world, Su Hao was modifying an [Eight-Armed God]. </p><p></p><p>"To access the 'Planetary Network' anytime, anywhere, a high bluegem concentration blue crystal needs to be implanted in the body.</p><p></p><p>Embedding it in the bones should work well, but that would be a bit cumbersome."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts shifted, and he had a new idea: "Let's just replace the skull! We can also install a mind's eye on the blue crystal skull, killing two birds with one stone."</p><p></p><p>He thought of even more benefits: "It can also directly attach to the brain nerve cells, saving the step of extending nerve clusters to attach..."</p><p></p><p>"Crucially, the blue crystal is quite hard, so it should work as a skull, just need to engrave a 'hardness' rune to reinforce it. Then I won't have to worry about getting my head blown off easily."</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao pondered, he worked on the modifications.</p><p></p><p>Implanting the blue crystal was quickly completed, but interfacing the nerve clusters was a bit complex.</p><p></p><p>After connecting the nerves, he still needed to write a suitable signal conversion program.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until ten days later that...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao exhaled: "Okay, let's test the effects next."</p><p></p><p>He exited his current body and entered the modified [Eight-Armed God] through the small black room.</p><p></p><p>The [Eight-Armed God] that was just lying on the experiment table suddenly opened its eyes, stood up, and muttered, "Need to adapt first."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the vast space of the Cloud Ring system, Su Hao's figure suddenly appeared, ending his 'starlight travel'.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and saw that this was his destination - an abnormally empty space.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the rune arrays on his pink crystal armor adjusted slightly and then lit up, releasing enormous energy output that distorted the surrounding space-time and radiated outwards.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this [Eight-Armed God] body also endured tremendous pressure.</p><p></p><p>However, this level of pressure was still within the [Eight-Armed God]'s tolerance range.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thousands of 'mini-mes' entered the 'Planetary Network', roaming on different planets.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao's main consciousness remained in space, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the real universe and the 'Planetary Network' merged in his mind, making it seem as if he could see planets light years away as if they were right in front of him!</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely wondrous feeling, like the fabled 'eyes that see thousands of miles' in myths.</p><p></p><p>The parallel thinking provided by the external brain, combined with the multi-perspective 'Planetary Network' and the model solidified by his imagination...</p><p></p><p>It made Su Hao feel as if he was hovering above the Cloud Ring galactic disk, looking down, with all planets within his sight unable to hide.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, observing within the 'Planetary Network' and observing from the outside could happen simultaneously without conflict.</p><p></p><p>"What a marvelous visual experience!</p><p></p><p>I can see crowds on the Blue Light Planet, flying vehicles coming and going in the sky, like an ant kingdom in a glass bowl...</p><p></p><p>I can also see the cities on the Geodian Planet where the Multieyes and humans live together, and many unknown corners where large Multieye groups gather, clamoring to 'expel humans and reclaim the Geodian Planet'...</p><p></p><p>There's also the Eight-Armed homeworld Rockback, a planet that's mostly ocean. Seems the Eight-Armed are a cave-dwelling marine race... Oh? Looks like they're researching how to deal with humans?</p><p></p><p>And the Starvelings' planet - in just 20 years, the Starvelings have devoured hundreds more planets, their speed is indeed fast...</p><p></p><p>It's quite possible that the ultimate fate of the Cloud Ring system is to be devoured by the Starvelings. Whether humans, Eight-Armed or Multieyes, they all pale in comparison to the Starvelings' massive size."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stood motionless in the empty space, yet could perceive the entire situation of the Cloud Ring system. Any planet he wanted to see, its appearance and details would immediately appear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Crucially, his extremely enhanced brain could also easily process such a massive amount of visual information.</p><p></p><p>Such divine abilities, on par with cosmic gods and demons!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Hao felt he was invincible in the universe!</p><p></p><p>One could say that up until now, what he had gained from being reborn into this world had far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment, then said, "Though invincibility isn't my goal, I've somehow become invincible, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>As for the threat of the 'Doom System', let it come find Su Hao later!</p><p></p><p>Before resolving the 'Doom System', it wouldn't affect his change of attitude to enjoy this leisurely research process. He felt both proud and confident.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, his mentality had become 'younger' again.</p><p></p><p>The change in mentality brought by power made him a bit giddy.</p><p></p><p>But to be honest, the giddy feeling was quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stopped distorting the surrounding space-time and also exited the 'Planetary Network', teleporting back to the experimental micro-world.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's try using the vast 'Planetary Network' for teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao didn't think it was very reliable, what if it worked?</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was starting another research project, a multi-planetary network alliance conference was taking place on the Eight-Armed homeworld Rockback.</p><p></p><p>And it was an 'encrypted' conference to prevent the Multieyes from learning the specific contents.</p><p></p><p>In an extremely large spherical conference hall packed with Eight-Armed of all sizes...</p><p></p><p>At the head sat an enormous and aged Eight-Armed dressed entirely in orange, wearing a crown studded with gemstones like the night sky. It looked very solemn.</p><p></p><p>It was the 'King of Rockback' elected by the vast Eight-Armed planetary alliance, and held in extremely high esteem among all Eight-Armed.</p><p></p><p>Beside the 'King of Rockback' was a slightly smaller Eight-Armed, who summarized the current threat humans posed to the Eight-Armed, labeling humans as the highest level nine threat - an existential crisis.</p><p></p><p>"The massive fleet of the Cloud Ring System Alliance was devastatingly struck by humans over 40 years ago. To ensure the survival and leading position of our alliance in the Cloud Ring system, we decided to completely eliminate all alien races...</p><p></p><p>From each alliance, we selected the most elite 80 million technicians of this era to participate in researching and cracking human advanced weapons, and accelerated developing the newest weapons to counter human invasion...</p><p></p><p>Through the day and night efforts of our elite technicians, we have finally achieved a breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"Woah ——"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, all the attendees were stunned, unable to hide the excitement in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Over these decades, the speed of human expansion had given the Eight-Armed quite a scare. If this trend continued, the Eight-Armed domain could be devoured within a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>After the commotion settled, that Eight-Armed continued reporting: "We've found the weapon humans used against us - a mysterious 'energized beam' that can trigger premature detonation of energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>Our previous fleet was destroyed by this.</p><p></p><p>Now, we've also mastered the same 'energized weapon', and ours can shoot farther and has a wider range! It can even attack from outside a star system.</p><p></p><p>We've also researched devices to counter the 'energized beam'...</p><p></p><p>So in the war with humans!</p><p></p><p>Our Cloud Ring System Alliance will definitely win!"</p><p></p><p>After the report, the 'King of Rockback' finally spoke, and all Eight-Armed eyes locked onto that solemn figure.</p><p></p><p>In a slow tone, it said: "Twenty years for preparation. During this time, all allied planets will proactively contract and not provoke.</p><p></p><p>After twenty years, we will organize all forces and strike without giving humans any chance to react, utterly destroying them!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 775</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the Holy Lord still looked at Yuan Tan with a threatening expression, indicating that if it didn't speak, it shouldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>It confirmed that it was no match for Su Hao. If Su Hao learned the secret of the Divine Mother's Pool, it could be foreseen that it would completely lose all rights over the Divine Mother's Pool.</p><p></p><p>It absolutely would not allow such a thing to happen, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Su Hao nodded and said, "If you don't cooperate with my work, then your only use will be as an experimental subject."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao casually waved his hand, and the Holy Lord abruptly disappeared from its original spot, thrown by Su Hao into the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>The allied forces of the three tribes fearfully retreated together.</p><p></p><p>But in contrast, the Winged Divine tribe appeared especially excited, each one howling towards the sky, as if wanting to charge up to Su Hao and fight him, to avenge their Holy Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>The long cries of the Winged Divines rose and fell, and there really were some Winged Divines who were not afraid to die. Dazzling purple light burst out from various parts of their bodies as they charged towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed his hand out.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of golden light flashed by, piercing through the heads of the charging Winged Divines.</p><p></p><p>"Puff puff puff!"</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the struck Winged Divines shuddered before softly collapsing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom!"</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed and spread out.</p><p></p><p>A total of fifteen Winged Divines lost their lives in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Including the ones preparing to charge up, all the dragons instantly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After that, Su Hao's questioning proceeded very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan explained, "In fact, what the Holy Lord said about the innate talents of the Winged Divines does have some truth to it. The Winged Divine tribe is able to use the magic power of the 'Divine Mother's Pool' very naturally, while the Overlord Dragons and the other two tribes cannot use the magic power as smoothly as the Winged Divines.</p><p></p><p>This is also the main reason why the Winged Divine tribe is recognized as the 'Divine Race' rather than the 'Dragon Race'.</p><p></p><p>However, I do not agree with attributing the ability to use the Divine Mother's Pool's magic power solely to the innate talents of the Winged Divines."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's interest was piqued and he curiously asked, "Why do you think so?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan smiled and said, "I believe that whether it's the Winged Divines, Overlord Dragons, Elemental Dragons, or Rock Dragons, they are essentially the same. None of them are innately more noble than the others.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Winged Divines are able to use the magic power of the Divine Mother's Pool more easily is because the Winged Divine tribe has lived on the Divine Marsh Mountain for a long time, in long-term contact with the waters of the Divine Mother's Pool. They have been influenced by the magic power of the Divine Mother's Pool and gradually adapted to coexisting with it..."</p><p></p><p>He said this much, then hesitated slightly and asked, "Do you understand what I'm saying, Lord Jia Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Of course, if I don't understand something you said, I'll naturally ask you about it."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan seemed very enthusiastic, as if delighted to have someone listen to his inner thoughts, "The Holy Lord of the Winged Divines does not agree with my view. Not only does it not agree, but the vast majority of Winged Divines also do not agree. Even the few Winged Divines willing to listen to me cannot understand the meaning I'm trying to express...</p><p></p><p>However, what is gratifying is that the Overlord Dragon, Elemental Dragon, and Rock Dragon tribes fully agree with my view. They also believe that the Winged Divines are not innately the Divine Race. If any of their own tribes gained access to the Divine Mother's Pool, they would also be able to naturally and skillfully use its magic power."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Hao let out a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan understood the implication behind Su Hao's laughter, but it did not care about such minor details, indifferently saying, "Of course, I also know that this is a matter of the standpoint of the Overlord Dragon tribes. From their standpoint, they cannot possibly admit that they are weaker than the Winged Divine tribe.</p><p></p><p>And from the standpoint of the Winged Divines, they would naturally view the Overlord Dragon and other two tribes as inferior races.</p><p></p><p>But I don't care about their respective standpoints. I only want to know what the real answer is.</p><p></p><p>So I took a large amount of the 'Divine Mother's Pool' water down the mountain to verify my guess.</p><p></p><p>The result was very clear - I was right.</p><p></p><p>As long as the other three tribes are given enough time to adapt, they can also skillfully use the magic power of the Divine Mother's Pool."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked, "So just because of this, you led the armies of the three tribes wanting to overthrow the Winged Divine tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan shook his head, "No, what I want is a truly fair world without prejudice or discrimination. Prejudice and discrimination only bring endless harm."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao meaningfully said, "But the premise for all this might require being under the same race..."</p><p></p><p>To Su Hao, talking about fairness, justice and respect between different races seemed a bit like the pot calling the kettle black.</p><p></p><p>It was like, I'm human and you're a pig, and I should respect you before eating pork...</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan really wanted to refute Su Hao: 'That's prejudiced!'</p><p></p><p>But under Su Hao's intimidation, he didn't dare say it out loud, so he could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "I can't act recklessly and anger Lord Jia Wei, losing my life. I still have more important things to do! Even if no one understands me, I don't care! I must endure! Endure!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with this idealist, Su Hao didn't want to say much more either, as long as he cooperated with the work.</p><p></p><p>He continued to ask, "What is the source of the 'Divine Mother's Pool'? Why does it have magic power?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan shook his head, "I don't know. I only know that drinking the pool water when young can awaken one's magic power. Any more information than that is beyond what I can know. After all, even though I'm from the Winged Divine tribe, I cannot easily approach the Divine Mother's Pool.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it is a blessing from the Divine Mother upon learning of the world's suffering. Or perhaps it is a single teardrop left behind by the Creator God, unwilling to leave this world..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Yuan Tan's description of the Divine Marsh Mountain and the Divine Mother's Pool, Su Hao judged that the dragon race's understanding of the world was still at an exploratory stage, with 'created by the gods' still being the mainstream thought.</p><p></p><p>After asking some more detailed questions, Su Hao left the small world and came to the purple pool at the top of the Divine Marsh Mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was called a 'pool', but its area was actually quite large, with a maximum diameter of eight hundred meters, far exceeding the scope of a 'pool' and more comparable to a small lake.</p><p></p><p>The water had a rich purple hue, its depth indiscernible. There was no visible outlet or source.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was simply a pit at the mountaintop that happened to have some water not yet dried up inside.</p><p></p><p>At this high altitude, there was constantly a biting cold wind blowing, causing the lake's surface to ripple slightly. Under the sunlight, it reflected an enchanting purple glow.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it did indeed seem extraordinarily mystical.</p><p></p><p>As if some astonishing power was contained within.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked up to the edge of the pool and scooped up a handful of water to observe up close.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he recorded the pool water into his spatial orb, then released his hand, allowing the purple water to flow back into the pool.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to enter the pool waters to take a look."</p><p></p><p>According to Yuan Tan, the Winged Divine tribe had also previously entered deep into the Divine Mother's Pool many times to explore the secrets of its power.</p><p></p><p>But as the depth increased, the purple glow in the water became more concentrated, and also more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>After diving to a certain depth, even the powerful Winged Divines would quickly dissolve and die, as if corroded by the magic power of the Divine Mother's Pool.</p><p></p><p>There were some Winged Divines who managed to resurface, but the power within their bodies would suddenly surge for a short period before they were invaded and killed by the surging magic power.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao was not afraid of this.</p><p></p><p>He had personally tested it - this kind of purple radiant energy could not break through his defenses to harm him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he died, it didn't matter, he could just switch to another body clone.</p><p></p><p>"Crack crack crack~"</p><p></p><p>The pink crystal water quickly enveloped Su Hao, forming a magnificent crystal armor. Then various arrays lit up one after another, generating layers of powerful defenses.</p><p></p><p>He lightly leapt up and dove straight into the pool waters.</p><p></p><p>Visibility was poor, but his vast divine sense swept through, allowing him to grasp everything within the pool waters.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he went, the more he could feel something trying to break through the crystal armor's defenses and arrays to enter his body.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao ignored it all.</p><p></p><p>He continued diving deeper.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense had already found the entrance leading further underground at the bottom of the pool.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was about five meters in diameter, not very spacious, located under a rock.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this entire pool was water gushing out from this underground cavern passage.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao followed the cavern downwards, and unexpectedly, it gradually became more and more spacious the deeper he went, like an immense underground aquatic world.</p><p></p><p>He rapidly explored this underground aquatic world, trying to find its boundaries.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he discovered an astonishing fact: the scale of this underwater world might even exceed his imagination.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper, the purple hue gradually faded away, and the surrounding water became clear.</p><p></p><p>Faint glimmers of bioluminescence could be seen in the distance, like distant starlight.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao knew that was the glow emitted by aquatic lifeforms living here to lure prey.</p><p></p><p>Just like the deep sea, teeming with life.</p><p></p><p>He marveled, "Beneath the surface world, deep underground within the rock layers, there is actually another massive underwater world hidden away. If I didn't personally come down here, I would never have discovered it."</p><p></p><p>This planet was immense, and the underwater world also exceeded the range his divine sense could perceive.</p><p></p><p>He had been focused only on the surface world before, never imagining that deep underground like this, there was another realm of life.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he never imagined it, perhaps the native dragon denizens of this planet had never conceived that beneath them was another aquatic world!</p>

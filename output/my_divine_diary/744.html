        <h1>Chapter 744</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eye race was completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>They wanted to rebel, but all of their advanced weapons were provided by humans. When facing the threat of war and trying to activate their warships, they found that all warships and weapon equipment had been locked down.</p><p></p><p>The Compound Eyes raged: "Damn! The humans actually tampered with these weapons."</p><p></p><p>Not only could the warships not take off and the large weapons not be opened, even the energy blocks on the planet had mysteriously shriveled and lost their function.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they had prepared early, and not all facilities on the planet were powered by energy blocks.</p><p></p><p>There was still room for resistance. Even if they perished, they would take the humans with them.</p><p></p><p>So they activated the 'energy burst wave' that humans had installed for them!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Compound Eyes pressed the button to send a data package to the Eight-Handed race, claiming the Eight-Handed race had already obtained humans' most advanced technology.</p><p></p><p>And they organized the Compound Eye race to carry out defensive counterattacks on this planet, trying to drag down the humans and drive them away.</p><p></p><p>What they were met with was a group of human warriors with all kinds of superpowers.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, the Compound Eye race surrendered unconditionally, and their planet also came under human control.</p><p></p><p>Under absolute strength and oppression, war was just that simple. Their strong will to resist was rendered completely futile in the face of artillery fire.</p><p></p><p>The outcome of being backward was simply unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>From another perspective, if it weren't for Su Hao's appearance, humans might have ended up in this way when facing the Eight-Handed race, or perhaps even more tragically.</p><p></p><p>At least after the Compound Eyes surrendered, humans did not carry out a genocide, but rather gave them a certain degree of freedom.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the other high officials were leisurely drinking tea in the conference room, each with a smile on their face, casually chatting, with no shortage of praise for Xia Qingjun's incisive judgment of future situations.</p><p></p><p>Today, everyone rarely got to sit together and enjoy this leisurely time, with relaxed smiles on their faces. Usually their minds were always preoccupied and they couldn't stop.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the idle chatter, Xia Qingjun smiled without speaking, thinking to himself: "If it weren't for Da Qiang and the other two supporting me, I wouldn't dare act so recklessly! So you could say, having foresight and high control over the situation development is just a prerequisite for being 'formidable'. The essential reason is actually the 'wanton behavior' without any worries."</p><p></p><p>When talking about the Compound Eyes' formidable reconnaissance 'Compound Eyes', everyone marveled: "I had always thought the Compound Eyes' reconnaissance means were some special organ on their bodies! I never imagined it was not the case - this really opened my eyes that there could be such a wondrous planet in the universe."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the mysteries of the universe are unfathomable to humans."</p><p></p><p>"This Compound Eye race occupied such an amazing planet, yet they couldn't develop and dominate the Nebula early on. They were pathetically weak, and being exterminated by another race was what they deserved."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly! The Eight-Handed race has endless energy blocks, the Compound Eyes have such a miraculous planet that can observe the universe, but what do we humans have? Nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Everyone laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said leisurely: "How can we have nothing? We humans have Xu Shiqiang."</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent, then everyone realized: "The leader speaks rightly."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning Su Hao, Xia Qingjun suddenly said: "Oh right, have the materials collected from taking over the Compound Eye planet been handed over to Xu Shiqiang yet?"</p><p></p><p>The secretary immediately replied: "The materials were organized and proofread at the first opportunity after obtaining them, and have been given to Jia Fengcheng."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun nodded and picked up his tea cup again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Hao had already become fluent in the Compound Eye language. He was accompanied by his two Compound Eye minister 'friends', entering the most sacred place of the Compound Eyes - the Star Observing Underground Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Star Observing Underground Temple was built deep underground. Like most Compound Eye structures, it didn't look out of the ordinary - the Compound Eyes had clearly disguised the true nature of this temple.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had wandered on this planet for so long, yet never discovered its special aspects. Instead, there was an ostentatious 'Underground Temple' on the surface for the Compound Eyes to worship.</p><p></p><p>This world, no matter which race, had truly mastered the art of deception to the extreme for the sake of survival.</p><p></p><p>The two mushroom-like ministers led the way, one elderly and one middle-aged. Both wore white and gold robes influenced by human style - simple, concise and formal. Their exposed skin was deep blue, giving off a soft glow under the lights.</p><p></p><p>The elderly minister's tail drooped limply behind his head. As they walked, he explained to Su Hao about their Underground Temple: "The Star Observing Underground Temple was originally called the Underground Temple. Later, when our tribesmen discovered they could observe the stars in the sky through the temple, it was renamed the 'Star Observing Underground Temple'.</p><p></p><p>However, only a minority know this fact. The vast majority of our tribesmen do not know that our Compound Eye race can observe the stars through this temple. Moreover, most tribesmen do not have the talent to observe the stars.</p><p></p><p>Those with the talent are selected at a very young age. Through dedicated training, they become the 'star observing priests' of our Compound Eye Underground Temple."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to the 'bud' at the tip of their tails and asked curiously: "What is this thing? Does this so-called star observing talent have anything to do with it?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly mushroom person nodded: "Indeed it does. We call the tail behind our head the 'Ground Tendril', and the node at the end is called the 'Ground Eye', or 'Compound Eye' in short - hence our race's name, the Compound Eye race.</p><p></p><p>As for the main function of the Ground Eye...ahem, you are my friend, so I won't hide it from you. It is used to find food and attract mates, while star observing only developed as a hobby later on.</p><p></p><p>Our Compound Eye race relies on the Ground Eye to sense all kinds of things within the vast Nebula system.</p><p></p><p>As for the reason why, we actually don't know ourselves. It is attributed to the blessing of the great Ground God - this is the talent bestowed upon our Compound Eye race."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged mushroom person nodded: "Our planet is called the Ground God Planet, and we believe in the 'Ground God' who is supreme. The Underground Temple is also the most sacred place.</p><p></p><p>If you weren't my friend, even if it cost me my life, I would never bring you humans in here. The secrets of the Underground Temple cannot be known to outsiders!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "One should be generous when treating friends."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged mushroom person said: "You're right, my friend!"</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao chatted idly with the two Compound Eyes, they soon went deep underground and arrived at a spacious underground cavern.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that people frequently came and went here, but the Compound Eyes had deliberately kept it uneven and bumpy, just like an ordinary cave - plain and unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as Su Hao entered, he was drawn to the position at the center of the underground space.</p><p></p><p>There was a huge circular platform, with an enormous azure crystal embedded in the middle, its edges sharp and giving off a pale blue glow that illuminated the entire underground space in bluish light.</p><p></p><p>Around the outer ring of the platform were evenly embedded many fist-sized pale blue crystals, with the exposed portions smooth and elliptical in shape.</p><p></p><p>The elderly mushroom person pointed at the blue crystals: "These are the 'Dream Stones' we use to communicate with the Ground God. Through them, we can see whatever we want to see."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao scanned it with his divine sense and immediately realized that the exposed crystals were just a small portion - the main body was like an iceberg, incredibly massive, with most of it buried deep underground.</p><p></p><p>He became curious, as he had sensed similar things before with his divine sense but thought they were just ordinary rocks and paid no extra attention. He never expected them to be so special.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes narrowed slightly as his divine sense expanded outwards, instantly covering the scene within a 200km radius.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he could not perceive the limits of this crystal.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he sensed, the more massive the azure crystal became.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Su Hao unleashed multiple layers of 'divine sense' that instantly formed a huge perception beam piercing through the planet, reaching the other side...</p><p></p><p>After a while, he changed directions, extending his divine sense outwards again.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, he opened his eyes and murmured: "This azure crystal is distributed throughout the entire planet's crust..."</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's initial perception, the azure crystals varied in size and were interconnected in a web-like pattern throughout the planet's crust, to the point they could be considered a single whole entity.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a huge cage had been casually tossed into the universe, and under the forces of gravity and time, formed into this planet...</p><p></p><p>But exactly how this planet formed, Su Hao did not know. Even with his vast knowledge, he could not imagine the conditions required for its formation.</p>

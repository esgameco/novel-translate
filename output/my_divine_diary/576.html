        <h1>Chapter 576</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Source Master Association acted swiftly. With a wave of Grand Master Lada's hand, various professionals from the association took the stage, entering the robbed artifact chamber to collect clues and analyze traces. Everyone was eager to be the one to crack the case.</p><p></p><p>For these professional source masters, this was the best opportunity to make a name for themselves. The artifact chamber case was the biggest incident to occur in over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>If they could solve this brazen case, their names would become household names, even written into textbooks for others to study...</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxiao squad that had floated over the Hulu Dao area also joined in, becoming one of the most inconspicuous teams.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed woman Xiangli entered the artifact chamber with her squad. Originally a forbidden area, it was now an empty, vast underground chamber with not even shelves for holding the source artifacts remaining - isn't that strange?</p><p></p><p>After circling around inside, Xiangli didn't find anything and exclaimed softly, "Who could have done this? They're too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>One of her teammates corrected her quietly, "Xiangli, you should say they're too daring! No matter who it is, I think they're doomed."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli turned to look at her teammate Feiyao, seeing him frowning in deep thought. Itching with curiosity, she wanted to ask if Feiyao had discovered anything.</p><p></p><p>Feiyao glanced at Xiangli, scratched his messy curly hair, and said helplessly, "Xiangli, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli exclaimed happily, "Ah, Feiyao, you've figured it out! What did you discover?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "I did."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't tell you."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli's eyes widened. "Huh? Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao ignored her and looked around at the various source master investigation teams before heading out, saying, "Let's go, we'll leave here first."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, we're not investigating anymore? Feiyao!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "How many times have I told you, don't add your own imagination when thinking about a problem. Did I say we're not investigating anymore? No, right?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao really couldn't understand why his teammate was so single-minded and never tried to be flexible. He also really couldn't understand why others couldn't grasp things that seemed so simple to him!</p><p></p><p>He was tired of having to answer all sorts of weird questions for others!</p><p></p><p>After arriving at a quiet place, Feiyao finally couldn't stand Xiangli's pestering anymore and said, "What's the rush, I'm not saying I won't tell you."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli applied what she learned, "But you just said you wouldn't tell me."</p><p></p><p>Feiyao was speechless and changed the subject, "I said I wouldn't tell you because there were too many people around, it wasn't convenient to say."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli said, "I understand, trade secrets, the others are all competitors."</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said expressionlessly, "No, the artifact chamber was robbed, there's a 50% chance it's indirectly related to us, so to avoid trouble, I didn't say it directly."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli and the rest of the team were shocked, "What? Related to us? It's not like we stole it."</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "This is just a guess, there's a possibility, but it may not be true! We can analyze it - in recent years there have been three cases of large venues mysteriously disappearing in this area.</p><p></p><p>The first was the Changqing Factory disappearance case in the suburbs of Huchang City four years ago. The second was the disappearance of the island we were searching for a few days ago. The third is today's robbery of the association headquarters' artifact chamber.</p><p></p><p>While not exactly the same, these three cases share the commonality of being able to teleport huge objects elsewhere, just like the 'Arbitrary Space Door' artifact number 37 in the first row collected in the artifact chamber.</p><p></p><p>So it's not hard to guess that these three cases were done by the same person. No, it should be the same organization!"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli's eyes lit up with wisdom, "You mean 'Scrape the Earth Kai'? Wow! Feiyao, you're so amazing, you cracked the case just from walking around in there! We solved the case!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao thought to himself, "Am I really that amazing? I don't think so..."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli then asked doubtfully, "But what does it have to do with us?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "The timing! The artifact chamber was robbed right after we returned to the association and submitted our report. In other words, we can't rule out that the thief followed us to the association and took the opportunity to teleport the artifacts away."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli and the others stared wide-eyed, "Followed us..."</p><p></p><p>Feiyao continued, "But that's not the main point. The main point is that he has likely realized that we know about him now."</p><p></p><p>Xiangli became a bit flustered, "Then what do we do? Will we get implicated?"</p><p></p><p>However, Feiyao completely ignored her and showed a rare look of excitement, "I guess he would have robbed sooner or later, but he chose this timing intentionally to let us know of his existence - he's taunting us!</p><p></p><p>Heh heh, Scrape the Earth Kai is really arrogant, I like that! I will definitely be able to hunt him down! Let's go, back to the association!"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli asked, "Go back to do what?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyao said, "Announce our discovery and tell him we're aware of his taunting, and officially declare war on him! We can't let him look down on us!"</p><p></p><p>This fired up Xiangli and the rest of the team, as if they were about to experience all sorts of complex, thrilling investigation actions culminating in an epic battle to capture "Scrape the Earth Kai."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Su Hao himself was unaware of any deeper meaning behind his casual actions.</p><p></p><p>After acquiring a large number of source artifacts, he immediately began researching them.</p><p></p><p>"Through studying the source beasts previously, I've already learned about the relationship between source artifacts and the 'system', overcoming a major hurdle. Now with so many source artifacts, it's perfect to shift my research subject from source beasts to the artifacts!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought, quickly organizing his work plan:</p><p></p><p>Step one, test the functions of these source artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Step two, record the motion states of all the artifacts within one hour in the pinball space, compare with findings from the source beasts, and summarize patterns.</p><p></p><p>Step three, backtrack to find the 'system' hidden somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Step four, analyze the principles.</p><p></p><p>Just testing the artifact functions in the first step opened Su Hao's eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>'Harmonious Atmosphere' 'Free and Unrestrained' 'Inside Out' 'Come Chase Me' 'Bullseye' 'Startling Roar'...</p><p></p><p>All sorts of bizarre abilities left Su Hao dazzled - he couldn't even imagine some of these nonsensical abilities that appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The key was that each one was more ridiculous than the last, defying all reason!</p><p></p><p>But then again, the "source" as the critical existence between matter and energy was itself an unreasonable existence, right?</p><p></p><p>So there was no "most ridiculous", only "more ridiculous"!</p><p></p><p>A month later, Zhi Peng contacted Su Hao through the parrot to report progress: "Mr. Jia Wei, I have currently gathered over 2,000 source master friends concentrated in the geographically complex coastal Pingkong City. Next, we will use Pingkong as our first base.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, my actions to gather friends were still detected by the Source Master Association. The remaining 2,000 or so friends have been controlled by the association, so I can't contact them for now and can only see how things go later."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Over 2,000 source masters is enough actually. Moreover, leaving the remaining 2,000 friends in the opponent's camp may produce some unexpected effects in the future. Don't hesitate, officially launch the second phase of the plan! Seize Pingkong City and turn it into your absolute domain."</p><p></p><p>Over 2,000 source masters gathered in one place could exert a force far beyond imagination, comparable to the largest city's source master association in the world. It was a force no one could ignore.</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining his plan, Zhi Peng asked with some doubt, "Mr. Jia Wei, the Glorious Church's target is the royal family, not the Source Master Association. I think the association's existence benefits this world, so I don't want to destroy it. But as long as I set my sights on the royal family, I'll inevitably come into conflict with the association. How should I handle these relationships?"</p><p></p><p>If this question was posed to Ah Shan, he wouldn't have asked it and would have just bulldozed through before rebuilding.</p><p></p><p>But Zhi Peng was not Ah Shan after all. Although he had been hurt by this world, his heart was still full of love for it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "From what I know, it's not entirely a conflict. In fact, there is a 'reformist' faction within the Source Master Association that advocates natural development and is neutral, even making up the majority of source masters. There may be an opportunity to win them over as your supporters.</p><p></p><p>The seeming conflict is only because the force you've shown is not strong enough yet! If the cost of opposing you exceeds their limits, then they won't choose to oppose you. Instead, they'll become your friends.</p><p></p><p>So you just need to think about how to gain greater strength. As long as you have strength, no problem is a problem."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had written out plans for how the Glorious Church should build its organization and gradually develop into a world-class behemoth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Zhi Peng was also very clear on the next steps, but without Su Hao's acknowledgment and approval, he still lacked confidence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was like someone telling him "Do this, then that, then this, and finally that, and you'll earn a million dollars" - no matter if it was true or false, without personally experiencing the complete process, every step filled him with trepidation and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had received Su Hao's verbal affirmation of "Don't hesitate", he felt much more at ease.</p>

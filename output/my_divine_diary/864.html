        <h1>Chapter 864</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after, following his conception of the soul force structure, Suhao updated the latest version of the 'Cultivation of the Soul Manual'.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, after completing the step of receiving and adapting to the soul force, one begins to construct the initial soul force structure, similar in principle to the 'Foundation Establishment' realm in cultivating immortality.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Suhao provided methods for constructing different structures in the 'Cultivation of the Soul Manual'. Practitioners of soul force could create various styles of structures based on their own imagination.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, over time, these soul force cultivators might even create structures superior to the physical body structure of the White Dwarfs?</p><p></p><p>Natural evolution produces natural exquisite treasures, but they must undergo human processing and polishing to become tools convenient for human use.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until two years later that among that batch of psychic youths, a young man named Aze finally succeeded in his cultivation, able to reach the level of astral projection and roaming with his spirit soul.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of pale red light mist emerged from Aze's brain.  </p><p></p><p>The core of the red mist was brightly lit, while the outer edges appeared somewhat dim, forming radiating spikes like a curled up porcupine.</p><p></p><p>The red mist rotated twice above Aze's head, then directly penetrated through the dome of the laboratory, arriving in the airspace of the small world.</p><p></p><p>The other youths cast envious glances at him.</p><p></p><p>They all knew this was the first talented person to succeed in cultivation, who would surely gain the favor of the Divine Lord, with unlimited prospects.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they secretly encouraged themselves: "I have a feeling I'll break through to the 'Spirit Soul Realm' very soon."</p><p></p><p>After swirling for a while, that red light gradually transformed, surprisingly turning into a tiny human form with many antennae, excitedly dancing in mid-air, as if wanting to shout but unable to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself: "The deities have a technique of soul force vocalization, I should also record it in the 'Cultivation of the Soul Manual'."</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Aze's physical body, went over to examine it, and found that his brain was in an unconscious state, with all conscious information carried out by the soul force, leaving only disordered information and some biological instincts inside the brain.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, Aze seemed to feel fatigue, flying back down and re-entering his own body, disappearing from sight. About ten minutes later, Aze slowly woke up, but appeared somewhat lacking in spirit.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao standing beside him, he looked quite embarrassed and said: "Divine Lord, I overdid it a bit on my first astral projection, resulting in my current lack of energy. My deepest apologies."</p><p></p><p>After examining him, Suhao realized the reason for his fatigue was that restarting the unconscious brain consumed a great deal of energy. He just needed to rest for a period of time to naturally recover.</p><p></p><p>So he said: "No matter, congratulations on completing the first step of the 'Cultivation of the Soul Manual'. Rest well for now, and in two days I'll guide you to the next stage of the experiment."</p><p></p><p>Aze was so moved that his whole body trembled lightly as he knelt down, saying: "Thank you for the Divine Lord's blessing."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied: "This is what you deserve."</p><p></p><p>If there were no problems, it would be a blessing. But if problems arose, then it could be something else. To obtain good things from Suhao, one must accordingly bear a certain risk.</p><p></p><p>Didn't those little round rats used to lie forever in his laboratory?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Suhao was now an extremely skilled researcher. No matter what problems arose, they would be difficult for him. From this perspective, being one of Suhao's experimental subjects was a stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Suhao implanted a spirit brain into a physical body, bridged all the neural networks, and then called Aze over, saying: "Aze, you have succeeded in astral projection. Now I'm providing you with a better body. Try projecting your soul into this body to complete the body swap."</p><p></p><p>"Change bodies?"</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the Spirit Soul Realm, Aze had thought about using astral projection to possess someone else's body, but it was only a thought in his mind that he absolutely dared not express - it was extremely evil to him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Divine Lord was actually telling him to actively possess a body!</p><p></p><p>Aze looked at the body beside him, his eyes lighting up: "This body is much more handsome than mine, and looks younger too. Possessing it would definitely be a great deal."</p><p></p><p>He immediately expressed his gratitude again for Suhao's generosity, then closed his eyes to prepare for astral projection.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a small red human figure leapt out from the top of his head, danced in mid-air, and finally entered the spirit brain body, becoming motionless.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Suhao closely observed the changes in Aze's soul will and the spirit brain.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit brain is structurally different from a flesh-and-blood brain. When Aze's soul entered the spirit brain, it was initially somewhat unsuited, as the fusion speed wasn't as fast as with his original body, revealing the issue. But Aze quickly overcame the discomfort and found the most comfortable way to gradually fuse with the spirit brain. It seems to be an initial success..."</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Aze, who had entered the spirit brain body, gradually woke up. He opened his eyes, slowly stood up, and tried walking a few steps.</p><p></p><p>He marveled: "This body... is amazing."</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes again to sense it, saying: "Even with my eyes closed, I can sense everything far away, with every detail vividly perceived, as if I have countless eyes seeing everything. This is too miraculous. What's going on? Did my soul force naturally upgrade after changing bodies? Or is this an innate ability of this body? The Divine Lord said he'd give me a better body, and indeed it is - this body is incredibly powerful. Not only that, I can also clearly sense my own will, I can clearly perceive what 'I' am and where 'I' am."</p><p></p><p>After reveling in it for a while, Aze suddenly remembered something, opened his eyes, and abruptly knelt before Suhao: "Thank you for the Divine Lord's blessing. Aze's physical body and soul will both belong entirely to the Divine Lord. Your will shall be Aze's direction to move forward."</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to lose this current body, and he also knew who had bestowed all this upon him.</p><p></p><p>Suhao only asked: "Aze, try moving around and see if there's any discomfort. Try recalling past experiences and see if there are any omissions."</p><p></p><p>Aze immediately did as instructed, then replied: "Reporting to the Divine Lord, Aze senses no discomfort at all, everything is unprecedentedly good. Moreover, I can vividly recall every past experience, with absolute clarity. Not only that, I feel I have gained a photographic memory. I can even describe it as: the essence of my life has been elevated. I clearly perceive that I am no longer an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Suhao clearly sensed the difference in Aze's behavior before and after.</p><p></p><p>Aze was still Aze, his way of thinking was the same, but his thoughts were clearer, understanding the cause-and-effect relationships of many things.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining an extremely powerful brain, he could comprehend many 'truths' that he had been vaguely aware of based on his past experiences. He also realized how reckless it had been for him to foolishly join the 'Starry Sky Exploration Team' because of Mr. Feng's advertisement.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his deepest realization was the power of the deities.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily: "If you were to astrally project now and return to your original body, would you still be an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>Aze's body trembled imperceptibly, and he dared not move, truly not wanting to leave this body anymore. He even wanted to selectively forget the ability of astral projection, preferring never to use it again from now on.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at his original physical body, which he had originally thought was so tall and mighty, practically a gift from the heavens, but now he looked at it with utter disdain.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't particularly care what Aze was thinking. He smiled and said: "Don't worry, since I said I'd give you a new body, then I've given it to you. If you like it, it's yours. Go on back now, and starting tomorrow, come see me once a day to report your condition. Oh, and this body is yours - if you don't want it, just leave it to me."</p><p></p><p>Tears of joy nearly spilled from Aze's eyes, his mind filled with Suhao's words:</p><p></p><p>"It's yours."</p><p></p><p>"Yours..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't just like this current body, he simply 'loved' it, loved it to the point of obsession, wishing for an eternal union, to be together forever and ever, a blissful marriage...</p><p></p><p>Aze kept knocking his head hard on the ground, his hoarse voice saying: "Praise to the great Divine Lord, everything of Aze's belongs to you."</p><p></p><p>After Aze left, Suhao entered the Ballpit Dimension to carefully observe and compare the differences in Aze's soul before and after astrally projecting into the spirit brain.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, he let out a deep breath and muttered: "Success! The eternal life I've pursued for so long is right before my eyes."</p><p></p><p>He only needed to take one step forward to package his consciousness and upload it into the spirit brain to form a new soul brain.</p><p></p><p>But the closer he was to success, the calmer he became.</p><p></p><p>Was he in a hurry to take that final step?</p><p></p><p>The answer was clearly: No rush!</p><p></p><p>The current 'Cultivation of the Soul Manual' and soul brain were not yet the best he could achieve;</p><p></p><p>Aze had just completed his brain swap, with many potential risks still waiting to be exposed over time;</p><p></p><p>The success of one person did not mean everyone could succeed - unless it was 100% successful, he was unwilling to casually attempt it;</p>

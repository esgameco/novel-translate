        <h1>Chapter 785</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, if a sacred and great figure from 6,000 years ago suddenly appeared before you and revealed their identity, would you believe it?</p><p></p><p>If faced with this situation, most people probably would not believe it.</p><p></p><p>Why do I say most people instead of everyone?</p><p></p><p>Ahem! After all, there may be some people with unusual thought processes who would believe it.</p><p></p><p>Just like if someone said "I am Qin Shi Huang, give me money!"</p><p></p><p>Would anyone really give money to someone claiming that? Who would dare believe it?</p><p></p><p>The master of the immortal cultivation holy land, renowned as having the pinnacle personal martial arts strength in the universe, the mighty Fourth Celestial Emperor, had actually lost on his own turf.</p><p></p><p>Losing is losing, victory and defeat are common in immortal cultivation. The key was he had absolutely no ability to fight back, like an unarmed 3-year-old child facing a fully armed grown man.</p><p></p><p>He was beaten black and blue!</p><p></p><p>Instant movement!</p><p></p><p>Teleportation arrays had already become widespread among the upper realms of the universe, applied in various fields, no longer a secret. Even they had corresponding teleportation artifacts.</p><p></p><p>So they could accept being moved by a teleportation array, but this young man in the white shirt was able to teleport without any aid.</p><p></p><p>This was quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>When had such an transcendent expert appeared in the Cloud Ring System?</p><p></p><p>So what if he believed this person was Xu Shiqiang for once?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor thought to himself: "Moreover, besides believing he is Xu Shiqiang, I don't have any other choices. Whether he is Xu Shiqiang or not, I have fallen into his hands now. My life and death are in his mind. Who he is no longer matters to me. What's important is whether I want to live or not."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the facts, there were not many paths left for the Celestial Emperor. His mind raced, convincing himself as quickly as possible that the person before him was Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor calmed his mind and said solemnly: "Sacred Xu Shiqiang, what do you want to ask?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed lightly: "I haven't returned to the Cloud Ring System for nearly a thousand years. I just want to understand the progress of human immortal cultivation over these past thousand years, it's that simple.</p><p></p><p>From my interaction with you just now, I realize the spiritual power you use has deviated greatly from the realm of ordinary spiritual power, and is extremely different from the spiritual power cultivated thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>You can tell me about the development process of your immortal cultivation, as well as how you apply it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand, and a stone table and chairs rose from the ground. He casually pointed and said: "Sit."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he took a seat first. With a flip of his hand, a teapot and two teacups materialized from nothing, gradually forming. Soon, steaming vapors were billowing out, and after a moment, the aroma of tea filled the air around them.</p><p></p><p>This series of actions left the Celestial Emperor gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Even as one of the top figures in the entire Cloud Ring System, he had never witnessed such an ability to create objects from nothing before.</p><p></p><p>The shock he felt was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>He muttered in disbelief: "I didn't see it wrong, but this...how is it possible..."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor sat rigidly across from Su Hao, as if he had lost his soul.</p><p></p><p>If earlier he had convinced himself that this youth was Xu Shiqiang, then now his heart had confirmed - the person before him was indeed the Sacred Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>A person being extremely powerful didn't represent anything. Could a powerful person randomly claim to be the Sacred Xu Shiqiang? Only a fool would believe that.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Ring System was too vast, with too many humans. In this era where almost everyone cultivated supernatural abilities, all sorts of bizarre, strange powers existed. There were many people who excelled tremendously in certain areas.</p><p></p><p>But besides the legendary, all-powerful Sacred Xu Shiqiang, he couldn't think of anyone else capable of creating objects from nothing.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the other two Sacred Ones of the Three Human Sages could also do this?</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Emperor's view, the abilities possessed by the Three Sages 6,000 years ago still remained an unsolved mystery even now.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Three Sages' most famous "hit every mark" ability was simply omnipotent;</p><p></p><p>The mysterious "small world" from the legends was still an unresolved scientific enigma;  </p><p></p><p>As for the current teleportation arrays, no one could decipher the meaning behind the symbols inscribed on them or how they enabled teleportation. However, by analyzing the arrays, many small practical symbols were extracted and gradually developed into the talisman scripts used in immortal cultivation now.</p><p></p><p>When the Celestial Emperor looked at Su Hao again, his eyes involuntarily held more shock and reverence.</p><p></p><p>This person before him had lived over 6,000 years...</p><p></p><p>The legends said the immortal cultivation methods of the Eternal Primordial Immortal were learned from the Three Sages.</p><p></p><p>Living over 6,000 years was not impossible. After all, before the Eternal Primordial Immortal passed down his cultivation techniques, no one could have imagined a person's lifespan could reach two to three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even with the most powerful life-extension drugs modern technology could produce, a person could only live 900 years at most.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled what Su Hao had said earlier: "It's been nearly a thousand years since I returned to the Cloud Ring System!"</p><p></p><p>So Xu Shiqiang did not randomly die back then, but had left the Cloud Ring System to explore the outer universe...</p><p></p><p>Went to the outer universe?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor struggled to steady his wavering mind and suppress the intense shock within. He quickly organized his words and answered slowly: "You've asked the right person, Sacred Xu Shiqiang. If you asked others about the history of immortal cultivation, they may not necessarily know or be able to explain it clearly to you. After I became the Fourth Celestial Emperor, I had the authority to read the records passed down from the previous Celestial Emperors, so I know about the many transformations that occurred at the immortal cultivation holy lands.</p><p></p><p>From over 5,000 years ago when the Eternal Primordial Immortal widely accepted disciples at the holy lands and passed down the immortal lineage, to the present where the holy lands became one of the five major powers in the Cloud Ring System, there have been four transformations in total.</p><p></p><p>The first was called the 'Flesh and Blood Spirit Power' transformation.</p><p></p><p>Around 5,000 years ago, after cultivators reached a certain level, they could no longer produce enough spirit power to meet their cultivation needs through mechanical means. In order to obtain more spirit power to break through their current realms, cultivators successfully synthesized spirit power from the flesh and blood of animals. However, the demand for flesh and blood led to a rapid expansion of the holy lands' forces, laying the foundation for their status in the Cloud Ring System at that time.</p><p></p><p>The second transformation occurred 4,000 years ago and was called the 'Imprint Spirit Power'.  </p><p></p><p>Although the Flesh and Blood Spirit Power greatly alleviated cultivators' need for spirit power, spirit power was still relatively costly to produce. Somehow, people discovered it was simpler to directly plunder other cultivators' spirit power rather than converting it from animal flesh and blood. This sparked a crisis of trust among cultivators, with massacres breaking out as they killed each other to rob spirit power. The holy lands were no longer holy lands of cultivation, but immortal cultivation hells. At the most critical juncture, the Eternal Primordial Immortal created a technique called the 'Cultivator Imprint' that prevented a cultivator's spirit power from being used by others. This technique fundamentally resolved the crisis.</p><p></p><p>The third transformation was called the 'Essence Spirit Power' around 3,000 years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Cultivator Imprint allowed cultivators to return to the Flesh and Blood Spirit Power, but it could not meet the demands of the increasing number of cultivators. Countless cultivators researched spirit power tirelessly, hoping for a better solution. Finally, a brilliant genius emerged - the First Celestial Emperor. He carried out an ultimate simplification of spirit power, completely removing the impurities and retaining only the highly condensed essence, which could exist independently. He called this essence 'spiritual essence'. Most crucially, spiritual essence could be industrially mass-produced to meet the needs of countless cultivators. After that, the Eternal Primordial Immortal passed the holy lands to the First Celestial Emperor to oversee their transformation. From then on, cultivators no longer cultivated spirit power, but spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>The fourth transformation was called the 'Renaissance Spirit Power' 800 years ago.  </p><p></p><p>This transformation arose because the Essence Spirit Power could not allow cultivators to break through to higher realms - they had been stuck at the Spirit Condensation realm for 2,000 years without any breakthroughs. The Renaissance Spirit Power solved this problem, allowing breakthroughs past the bottleneck to the 'Spirit Crystallization' realm. I, the unworthy one, proposed and oversaw this Renaissance Spirit Power transformation, which is why I became the Fourth Celestial Emperor of the holy lands."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Fourth Celestial Emperor paused, as if seeking the Sacred Xu Shiqiang's approval.</p>

            <p>The deities' main bodies were also extremely powerful, still above the sub-will, but they would rarely use their main bodies to fight, as it involved their core life, and if they were not careful, they would fall completely.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the moment his main body was discovered, Natty's first reaction was to escape, transferring his main body as quickly as possible and hiding it again.</p><p></p><p>As for how the location of his own main body was exposed, he couldn't think about that for the moment now, and could only talk about it after getting rid of the enemy as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>If his main body was entangled by the enemy, the other seventeen deities would most likely discover where his main body was, thus striking out together to completely exterminate him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think that this was too much to worry about, rather this possibility was still very high.</p><p></p><p>The moment he realized that his main body had been found, the God of Heaven Suppressor-Nati recalled all of his sub-wills in order to focus his strongest power, while at the same time, his main body acted quickly to activate the transfer program.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that given a few seconds, he would be able to shift tens of thousands of miles away from the unknown enemy's trail.</p><p></p><p>The speed of divine light was unrivaled.</p><p></p><p>Then the next second, he found himself in a strange place ......</p><p></p><p>It was precisely at this moment that the sub-will, which had suddenly disconnected before and was suspected by him to be dead, reconnected, and the two wills instantly fused together, rapidly exchanging information ......</p><p></p><p>This not only did not let him understand what had happened, the doubts on the contrary became more.</p><p></p><p>This series of unexpected events happened extremely quickly, instantly winding him up.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't matter if he was dazed, Nati knew that it was imperative that he activated his 'Instantaneous Miles' skill to escape as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>After another four seconds, Nati successfully activated 'Instantaneous Miles', his whole body emitted various colored lights, which became more and more abundant, and finally, just like a dandelion blown by the wind, it shot in one direction and gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He breathed a long sigh of relief, "Skill activated successfully, it's safe, with my speed nowadays, no one will be able to catch up with me unless the deity itself."</p><p></p><p>After such a state lasted for nearly two minutes, he sensed something wrong: "With my speed, by all rights, I should have already left the planet, but why is the perceived environment not space-like?"</p><p></p><p>After continuing for another moment, he terminated his escape state, and a dot of light lit up in mid-air, gathering more and more, just like the dandelions that had been blown apart before regrouping together again to form a large light cluster.</p><p></p><p>Soon the light converged, revealing Natty's main body.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he had the opportunity to take a good look at the current bad situation: below is ordinary dirt earth, there is a humanoid creature full of crystal armor and a giant dragon split, above the dim as a rainy day, the surroundings are like smoke shrouded can not see the specific situation, the powerful spiritual perception continues to spread into the distance, but there is no end to the powerful spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>"What is this place? This humanoid crystal creature, in my perception, it is that young dragon is Reian Oaks, his body still has my soul seed imprint, he really has an oddity, the current scene, it can't be dissociated from Reian Oaks ......"</p><p></p><p>Just when he was unsure but felt greatly bad, he saw the crystal man below him uttering an exclamation, "Is this the original ten-colored plate of the gods? It's incredible, so colorful and beautiful, so different from what I imagined. It's unimaginable that there could be such amazing beings in the universe."</p><p></p><p>One could only see a multi-plate assemblage of multiple colors of flowing light floating in mid-air, beautiful and special.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the essence of the God of Heavenly Suppression-Nati, the Ten Color Plate, also known as Divine Light.</p><p></p><p>The 'Ten Color Plate' shape looked very peculiar, as if it was stitched together from many separate plates of light that were not connected to each other, appearing to radiate outwards.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a suspended conical magnet that had absorbed iron sand, while each light plate floated out of thin air and had different shapes.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the many radiating light plates, there was a sphere emitting seven-colored light, on which various colors alternated with each other and flowed rapidly, unusually gorgeous and peculiar, like the core of this life.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to the holy light creature 'Naru' in the world of Warcraft, yet it was extremely different.</p><p></p><p>If this was a life, then Su Hao admitted that this was the most beautiful life he had ever seen, bar none.</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was enjoying the dazzling colors of the deity's essence, the God of Zhentian-Nati's attention was focused on Su Hao, and he let out a puzzled voice in a very strange voice: ''Lei-Ann Oaks? It seems that you know something that also concerns you, what exactly is going on, can you shed light on it for me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly floated to the same height as Natty's main body, the 'Ten Color Plate', and tried to observe where the front of this creature was, but it seemed to be the same?</p><p></p><p>Natty did not let his guard down because of Su Hao's words, and he queried, "Your world? What is the meaning of this."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao explained, "It means that this is an infinite loop world created by me, everything here is up to me, it's no longer in the same location as the planet you're staying on, and it's also impossible to communicate, all information will be blocked. If you want to go out from here, you need to have my consent, otherwise you will stay here forever, until eternity."</p><p></p><p>Natty's brow gradually furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually shot an attack in any direction, and after that attack penetrated the hazy boundary, it shot out from another direction and was casually flicked out by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"As you can see, no matter which direction you intend to escape from, you will end up returning from the other side."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Su Hao personally entered it in either direction and emerged from the other, a wide smile pulled out stiffly on his face filled with pink crystals.</p><p></p><p>A serpent of light separated from Natty's main body, the 'Ten Color Plate', and drilled into the giant dragon's doppelganger standing on the ground, and in the next moment, the giant dragon opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Natty once again detached a split will, controlling the giant dragon doppelganger to act. After glancing at Su Hao, he took a step and rushed into the hazy boundaries around him.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it drilled out from the other direction directly opposite.</p><p></p><p>The God of Heaven Suppressor-Nati kept pondering in his mind which deity the crystal-armored man in front of him was, but he searched through all the known deities and couldn't find anyone who was the right match. This made him speculate that the crystal-armored man in front of him might not be one of the deities he knew.</p><p></p><p>He was silent for a moment before saying, "Rayan Oaks, who the hell are you and what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "My name is Rayan Oaks, of course, you can call me Javi, I'm just a young golden dragon who is curious about the gods. Of course, I know you don't believe me, although what I said is true ...... but I can guarantee that I have no malice towards you, I want to know the secrets about the gods. As long as you cooperate with me, I will soon let you go."</p><p></p><p>The God of Heaven Suppressor-Nati obviously wouldn't believe Su Hao's words so easily, "Don't try to deceive me with lies, the greatness and power of the deities is beyond your imagination. Do you think that this narrow space can confine me? As long as I want to, I will soon be able to completely destroy this place and break away from it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was surprised, "Oh? Is a deity actually this powerful? Come, please start Your Excellency's performance, I also want to try what kind of method that can break through my space."</p><p></p><p>The God of Heavenly Suppression-Nati stuttered, this was not what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>But he was wanting to try out this place, what kind of bizarre existence it was.</p><p></p><p>He let out a cold snort, and the dragon below began to mobilize its power, opening its mouth, and a ball of piercing golden light burst out from the dragon's mouth, growing more and more prevalent, and finally spewing out violently.</p><p></p><p>"Whew..."</p><p></p><p>The white-gold blazing flame transformed into a pillar of light, shooting forward from the giant dragon's mouth and shooting across the hazy boundaries of space.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The incandescent flame didn't penetrate the space and drill out from the other direction, instead, it erupted in a violent explosion at the boundary, and the burst of energy raged at the junction point, a wave of heat spreading out and pouncing on Su Hao's face.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't do anything, the space in front of him seemed to be connected to the other side, the impact of the explosion came perfectly from the other direction, filling the entire space with blazing waves of air.</p><p></p><p>The God of Zhentian-Nati wasn't discouraged, and the giant dragon doppelganger spread its wings and flew up, before his feet condensed a sea of golden light, and he landed heavily, violently stomping on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>This heavy stomp shattered the entire earth, and the dirt and rocks fell apart and were thrown upwards.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the giant dragon violently stabbed downwards ......</p><p></p><p>Finally the huge body fell from the sky. It looked very bizarre, but it didn't help.</p><p></p><p>The main body and the doppelganger made quite a few more attempts in tandem, but without exception, they all failed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the land within this one space was tossed into bits and pieces.</p><p></p><p>After Natty stopped, Su Hao tsked, "Your Excellency Natty, your attacks are really sharp, but it doesn't seem to work too well to break through my world."</p><p></p><p>Natty was silent for a moment, and his doppelganger dragon stared at Su Hao and slowly said, "Lei An Oaks, I can't break open this place, but I can finish you off, and as long as I finish you off, the world you've created will naturally crumble, and I'll be able to get out without any problems."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Whether or not this place will collapse after my death is not mentioned first, how do you plan to finish me off?"</p><p></p><p>Natty: "Don't forget, after you completed the soul power awakening ceremony, everything you are, already belongs to me, including your soul. And I, as the deity you respect beyond measure, will be in control of everything you do."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Natty activated the soul seed in Su Hao's brain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's body instantly stiffened, and at the same time, a golden ray of light violently sprang out of Natty's main body and drilled into Su Hao's skull.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the crystal man opened his eyes, grinned a smug smile, and muttered, ''What do you think, a deity? This marvelous world of yours, everything you have, will be mine! And I, I am still that invincible Golden Dragon Clan God of Heavenly Suppression-Nati. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>After the laughter ended, the Crystal Man's brow furrowed, "There is something strange about this brain, it doesn't seem to be very suitable for the operation of a divided will, moreover, it is surprising that there is so much emptiness within this brain, there is no information whatsoever....... How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Crystal Man's mouth unexpectedly spoke without his control, "Out of my expectation, Your Excellency Nati was able to take my body away, too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The God of Zhentian, Natty: "???"</p><p></p><p>Natty didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>　I want to add more~ but I can't hold it in when I'm writing here!</p><p></p><p></p>

            <p>After Su Hao instructed Yashan and Feng Cheng to target the various qualities of spiritual power and start categorizing and researching them, he opened a new research function for the two of them - the psychokinetic simulation function.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, it meant that Yashan and Feng Cheng could scan through their divine thoughts and record the information of the experiment subject's mental movement within a small period of time in their respective 'knowledge platforms', and then the small light in the ball space would provide the arithmetic power to extract the corresponding data from their knowledge platforms, carry out a real-time simulation, and display it.</p><p></p><p>This function didn't seem like much, but when combined with their divine thoughts, it was very powerful, and was equivalent to Su Hao giving the two of them the boot.</p><p></p><p>It was more than enough to be used to study the spiritual physique.</p><p></p><p>It was just that what Su Hao didn't expect was for Yashan to lock onto a specific spiritual frequency band so quickly.</p><p></p><p>What was a spiritual trait?</p><p></p><p>Among Su Hao's definitions, spiritual power traits were not the often said 'loser', 'good guy', 'gentleman', 'dashing ' 'bandit' 'coward' and so on.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it is a kind of thinking movement after the manifestation of the nature of the reality of the appearance, as magnets have a magnetic field, matter has a gravitational force, water has a solid-liquid-gas three states, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The existence of every thing will inevitably follow certain rules of the universe, and the same goes for spiritual power, since it exists, it will also abide by certain rules and exhibit specific traits, what Su Hao has to do is, to find this trait and then categorize it for him, one by one, to try to react with the source.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao finished describing it, Yashan immediately comprehended what he meant, and discussed with Su Hao about how he should categorize the spiritual power trait.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Feng Cheng, who was on the side, listened in confusion, secretly saying: ''Worthy of being Boss Wei and Boss Yashan, what are they discussing, I can't believe I'm listening in confusion ......</p><p></p><p>What 'the manifestation of spiritual power, the essence is a regular movement', 'different minds have different ways of movement, and different ways of movement produce different force field effects', 'to find spiritual traits, we first need to categorize the thought movements are categorized and then continuously subdivided', 'naming different movements as spiritual bands' ......</p><p></p><p>It feels like they're chatting so awesome, I want to join them! Well, I'll have to make time to study hard after I get my chores done! The gap with the two bosses is too big."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng, after this casual conversation between Su Hao and Yashan, a sense of urgency rose, as in his previous life when he had just started cultivating Immortality, and was thrown off by Boss Wei's self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>He even once again wondered if he was stupid ......</p><p></p><p>In these six months, in addition to the spiritual power and source of the two Guile Source Mages, Xiao Hui and Ah Ming, to conduct experiments and record data, he opened the Universal Assistant, according to the study plan given by the Universal Assistant, crazy learning to do practice, can be said to be a rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>However, with the [Prophet Man] genius brain, he was fast in science, but after learning 'Philosophy', Feng Cheng was once again stuck!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention how Feng Cheng spent one night of study, Su Hao, after learning that Yashan had initially screened out the spiritual frequency bands that had great relevance to the source, immediately put down the information in his hands and directly found Yashan and asked, "Is it certain that it's the specific manifestation of the spiritual thought movement process that has a guiding influence on the source? Tell me in detail."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Boss Wei, now can only determine and special spiritual movement related, as for whether it is the movement process generated by the fluctuation of the source to have an impact, can not be determined, because even the divine mind, but also can not observe that kind of invisible fluctuations, can only be summarized through the phenomenon of counterpropagation, is expected to use a very long time.</p><p></p><p>But the good news is that I've already circled out that particular band using the cross-validation method, located right in the middle of the movement of the thirty-second block, which directly indicates that our guesses about the spiritual traits, are correct, and next, as long as we keep on subdividing it, and eliminating it one by one, we'll be able to lock in on the final, small band."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's true, in this way, it makes sense that some animals can smoothly master the source, guiding the transformation of the source to play out a variety of effects doesn't need to have a brain as smart as a human's at all, as long as the brain happens to have that particular piece of the frequency band it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Under the condition of turning into a disaster, creatures that possessed the special frequency band corresponding to the source would be able to metamorphose into powerful source beasts, capable of freely controlling the source formed within their bodies, while creatures that did not have that special band would gradually evolve into natural disasters, unconsciously affecting their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Indeed, but if we want to lock that piece of the most crucial frequency band, the experimental body still has to be a source mage to be able to do so, ordinary source beasts are simply unable to cooperate with our experiments, the difficulty is too high."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "How many experimental subjects are expected to be needed, and when will we be able to lock the final frequency band at the latest?"</p><p></p><p>Locking the final frequency band did not mean that one could control the changing forms of the source at will, there was also a systematic categorization and research to be done, which also required a lot of time and energy to test them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I need at least a total of a thousand source mages from each system to cross experiment and provide sufficient data. If there are enough experimenters, it is expected that the final band will be locked in three years at the latest."</p><p></p><p>Although locking a piece of the mental frequency band greatly narrowed the scope, the complexity of the human mind was beyond imagination, and just this small piece, which could continue to be subdivided into small pieces in billions of units for experiments, was simply not something that could be accomplished overnight.</p><p></p><p>Three years time, Su Hao can accept, nodded and said, "OK, the matter of experimental body, I will think of a way for you, Zhi Peng has a lot of friends, there should be no shortage of our more than a thousand experimental body."</p><p></p><p>For friends can do both, for friends to become a district experimental body, that is not happy to the extreme?</p><p></p><p>As soon as he mentioned Zhi Peng, Yashan revealed a trace of smile, obviously Yashan's senses to Zhi Peng is not bad, let him as if he saw himself when he was still Zhu Yuanshi, the same unfairly harmed, the same passionate want to change the world by himself, the same very fortunate to have met his True God Wei Boss.</p><p></p><p>So many things in common, almost make Yashan become Zhi Peng's good friend!</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Hey, with this Zhi Peng guy, our experiments are progressing unexpectedly fast!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed an inexplicable smile, "Even without Zhi Peng, our experiments won't be slow, there are so many source mages, there will never be a shortage is all."</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "That's true."</p><p></p><p>There were quite a number of source mage teams that ran to Huai Shui Town one after another to investigate the Luo Wang incident in this half year, and those that dared to be unreasonable were all captured by him for experiments, of course, the kind with too much of a strong temperament, Yayasan had already forgotten where they were buried.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought about it, and then opened the function of using the universal assistant to talk to the parrot on Zhi Peng's shoulder for Yashan, so that he could contact Zhi Peng at any time, and then obtain a constant stream of experimental bodies from Zhi Peng.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yashan certainly would not use the word 'experimental body' to describe Zhi Peng's friends, packaged a little, it can become: your friends in the future are to help you clean up the king's family, but the strength is too poor, first sent to the gourd dao up, we help you to all-around conditioning a little bit, and will soon become a qualified 'Guangyao Society' member.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, Yashan gradually matured and could already be considered an excellent helper. To use the old saying, it was a great general who could stand alone.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao very pleased, finally it was not in vain that he had focused on cultivation for so many years.</p><p></p><p>The reason for handing over the research of spiritual power qualities to Yashan was because Su Hao himself had a more important project to research, that is, how to transform matter into a pure source.</p><p></p><p>This was what he was most concerned about, directly involving the next world, whether he still had a way to obtain the source or not, it was about his metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, even if the spiritual bands were researched and he mastered the source abilities of all the faculties, but there was no way to transform the matter into a source, then after arriving at the next world, it would be equivalent to nothing. The hundreds of years of research in this world would be all useless.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if he had researched the method of transforming matter into source, then even if he hadn't mastered the spiritual bands, the next world would still have a great opportunity to slowly research it.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, regarding this aspect of his research, he had made some progress, but he was stuck in a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Trying to transform matter into pure source was harder and more complicated than expected!</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are the conditions for matter to be transformed into a source?"</p>

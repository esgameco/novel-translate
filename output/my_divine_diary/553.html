        <h1>Chapter 553</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>What kind of thing can freely transform between 'matter' and 'energy'?</p><p></p><p>According to his understanding, matter and energy can transform into each other, and even a mass-energy equivalence formula can be used to calculate the conversion between energy and mass.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that in the process of mass-energy conversion, there would be something in a critical state called the 'Source'.</p><p></p><p>That's right! After some experiments and observations, Su Hao made a guess: the Source is the critical thing between matter and energy.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could no longer use the word 'matter' to describe the 'Source'. Using the word 'thing' is more accurate, because the essence of the 'Source' is likely not matter, but an objectively existing thing like 'space' and 'time'.</p><p></p><p>This thing is highly unstable. In most parts of the universe, it is invisible, either transforming into stable 'matter' or ubiquitous 'energy'!</p><p></p><p>It's like the zero between positive and negative numbers.</p><p></p><p>As for what this special environment is, whether it's a feature of this planet or this region of the universe, he doesn't know yet. But he can confirm that this will be his main direction of future research.</p><p></p><p>If he can master the way of stable conversion between 'mass' and 'energy', Su Hao can be said to be an 'rudimentary version' of omnipotence!</p><p></p><p>Over the past two years, Su Hao has collected many books from around the world, which contain many related speculations and descriptions, and can cite all kinds of cases and facts to support and prove them. It has almost become the consensus of most people.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the people of this world do not have the tools to observe and study the Source. They cannot observe the changes of the Source in the microscopic world. The conclusions they have reached so far are just guesses.</p><p></p><p>Limited by their understanding of this world, the way they use the Source is only superficial, unable to unleash the essential abilities of the Source for their own use.</p><p></p><p>Is the whole world pursuing the so-called powerful 'Source Masters'? Looking at it now, it is really ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Possessing mountains of gold and silver, yet unable to use them, is a great tragedy.</p><p></p><p>And coincidentally, Su Hao has arrived, and even more coincidentally, he has mastered the powerful observation tool of 'Divine Thought'.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the secrets of the Source will be unveiled.</p><p></p><p>Until now, Su Hao felt gratified.</p><p></p><p>What if he was reborn into this Source world first, and then reborn into the Cultivation world?</p><p></p><p>After all, an environment so special that it allows the critical state of matter and energy conversion to be stably preserved may be the only one in the entire infinite universe.</p><p></p><p>Missing it would be an eternal loss!</p><p></p><p>He did another experiment at sea, wasting some fish, and then flashed back to the experimental base, calling Yahan and Fengcheng over: "Yahan and Fengcheng, how is your cultivation progress now?"</p><p></p><p>Yahan said, "Master Su, in about half a year, I should be able to break through to the Celestial Being Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also said, "It may take me a little longer. I've spent some effort practicing the 'Teleportation' technique, so my cultivation speed has slowed down a bit. But at most it should take a year!"</p><p></p><p>"Fengcheng, how is your teleportation practice going?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed and said, "Not bad, let me demonstrate for you!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he held his breath for more than ten seconds, and then suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang~"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Yahan heard the noise and looked over to see Fengcheng sprawled on the ground, tangled with a pile of stuff.</p><p></p><p>He jumped up, extremely embarrassed, and said, "Master Su, Senior Yahan, this was a mistake. It wasn't like this when I practiced before. Maybe I was too excited and nervous. Let me try again..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said, "It's already very good that you've practiced to this level in two years! As long as you can teleport, you don't need to demonstrate. Also, I've broken through to the Celestial Being Realm today and have the ability to study the Source. From now on, I will devote myself fully to researching the Source. I'll either stay in the lab to experiment or go out and seek various disasters. In other words, our research has officially started.</p><p></p><p>You two should also get ready. Tomorrow I'll send you to awaken as Source Masters. You'll need to quickly familiarize yourselves with the characteristics of the Source. After you both break through to the Celestial Being Realm, come back and assist me in the research."</p><p></p><p>For the research on the Source, just him as an Explosive Source Master is not enough. He needs data from more Source Masters, preferably gathering all nine types of Source Masters to his lab.</p><p></p><p>He just hopes that Fengcheng and Yahan's awakened Source abilities won't also be Explosive Source Masters like him.</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng's eyes lit up, and they said in unison, "Understood, Master Su!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The reason Su Hao arranged for Yahan and Fengcheng to awaken as Source Masters now is because he couldn't wait to study the other transformation methods of the Source, especially the Illusion Source Masters.</p><p></p><p>Once Yahan and Fengcheng awaken as Source Masters, they can immediately cooperate with him to start the research work.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered his lab with a smile, taking out the Source artifact 'Processing Knife' and placing it on the experiment table.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I need to personally confirm one thing - whether my blood energy and spiritual power can really transform into the 'Source' under the radiation of the Source artifact. If so, then the conclusion that the Source is the critical state between 'mass' and 'energy' will be further proven!"</p><p></p><p>He slowly infused his blood energy into the Source artifact, focusing all his Divine Thought's attention inside, waiting for the blood energy to transform into an unknown thing under the effect of the 'Source Field'.</p><p></p><p>As time passed second by second, the Source artifact gave off a faint glow, and a tiny portion of the blood energy escaped Su Hao's control and disappeared, recorded in the Particle Space.</p><p></p><p>However, to Su Hao's surprise, the expected Source did not form!</p><p></p><p>Under his Divine Thought's observation, that tiny portion of uncontrolled blood energy did not disappear, but remained still in its original place. The Particle Space could no longer record its information.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was stunned: "What's going on...it didn't transform into the Source, but kept its original form?"</p><p></p><p>Then a thought occurred to him, reminding him of the process of Source Bead formation. It seemed that after destroying the 'Guidance' nucleus, the 'Source' emitted a white light before unifying into a Source Bead.</p><p></p><p>Could this mean that his blood energy had actually transformed into the Source, but still lacked some necessary conditions to immediately transform into a Source Bead?</p><p></p><p>He thought about it again and mused: "Perhaps the amount of my blood energy transformed into the Source is not enough for it to coalesce into a 'Source Bead'. So I need to try more."</p><p></p><p>There were two experimental plans: one was to continuously maintain the blood energy saturation state until a large amount escaped his control and transformed into the Source; the other was to directly go find various disasters in the wild and use ready-made sources for research.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao preferred the second option because the efficiency of blood energy transforming into the Source was not high. To obtain enough Source would take at least several days, so it was faster to find disasters directly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Su Hao brought Yahan and Fengcheng to Huaishui Town and went straight to the Source Masters Association hall. Under the astonished gaze of the front desk girl Gulan, they went to the office of the Association President, Gu Yin.</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Yin's puzzled expression, Su Hao said seriously: "President Gu Yin, a year ago when I did a disaster mission, I accidentally rescued two homeless youths. They unexpectedly saw how powerful I was and how good-looking, so they insisted on following me.</p><p></p><p>At that time, no matter what I said, they wouldn't agree. I casually mentioned that I was a Source Master from Huaishui Town, but I didn't expect that after a year, they actually found me. They keep calling me 'Big Boss'. I'm at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Then I thought, since Huaishui Town is short of Source Masters anyway, I might as well bring them to you. President Gu, could you take some time to awaken them as Source Masters? If they have talent, it will be introducing new talents for our Huaishui Town. If not, just drive them away. It won't take too much time either way."</p><p></p><p>President Gu Yin listened with her eyelids twitching, looking at Su Hao in disbelief, as if saying: "Keep making it up!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Of course, they also sincerely brought gifts."</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Fengcheng then each opened a box filled with high-quality Source Beads and placed them in front of President Gu Yin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin's eyes lit up, but she still held back.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "Oh, they've also paid attention to physical training since childhood, just like me. Chopping steel rods with kitchen knives is no problem for them. Come on, Yahan and Fengcheng, give President Gu a demonstration."</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them took out kitchen knives and steel rods from somewhere and swung them down.</p><p></p><p>"Ding ding~"</p><p></p><p>The two steel rods were immediately cut in half and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin: "......"</p>

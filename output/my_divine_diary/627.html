        <h1>Chapter 627</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At night, in the castle, Zhipeng rarely appeared in person, meeting with the newly appointed 'Master of Harmony' Lada.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhipeng dared not easily show himself in front of others. Only now, after the overall situation was settled, did he dare to appear openly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, most of the key power systems of the Glorious Society had been replaced by him with the new generation of young people. Even if he died now and his friends dispersed, this world would still be able to operate normally.</p><p></p><p>In summary, Zhipeng felt that he was actually no longer important. The meaning of his life had been achieved, with no regrets in this life.</p><p></p><p>More than a decade had passed, and the Grand Master Lada's hair had also grayed a little. He no longer looked as vigorous as before, appearing much more restrained. The pipe in the corner of his mouth was still the same one from before, smoked until it was caked.</p><p></p><p>However, that calmness was completely shattered as soon as he opened his mouth: "Damn it, that old Master of Harmony has finally passed away! I've been waiting for him for years to hold this spirit hall."</p><p></p><p>Although his words were full of curses, he could not conceal the sadness on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng had also become a middle-aged man. He forced a smile, causing the crow's feet at the corners of his eyes to wrinkle.</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng sighed, "Birth, aging, sickness, and death are normal! The Master of Harmony lived to nearly ninety, which is considered a long life. This is a joyous occasion."</p><p></p><p>Lada subconsciously raised his hand to slam the table but forcibly stopped himself. His joints creaked like rusty metal as he struggled to withdraw his palm, saying, "This table belonged to the old man. He said it was quite precious. I can't bear to smash it!</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, we will completely annihilate them. President Zhipeng, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng nodded, "Many years ago, we had already locked onto the locations and bases of the Restoration Society. As long as Master Lada cooperates, it will take no more than five days to annihilate them."</p><p></p><p>Lada stretched out his palm with five fingers spread, "Five hundred transit balls! With these, it won't take five days."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng thought for a moment, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Lada suddenly smiled and suggested, "Damn it, how could the Glorious Society have such a good thing? Why don't you give the Mage Association a hundred of them?"</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng flatly refused, "No way! When they're used up, they must be returned without a single one missing."</p><p></p><p>Lada complained, "Zhipeng, you're a grown man. Why are you so stingy? Don't you know what the Mage Association is like? Give us some on the side. In the future, if the Glorious Society becomes corrupt, I can help you take down those corrupt bastards!"</p><p></p><p>That made some sense...</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng hesitated again and again, "I have to ask Mr. Jia first!"</p><p></p><p>Lada sneered, "Tsk! You coward, if it were me, I wouldn't ask!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ever since Yashan compiled 'magic' into books and handed them to the Master of Harmony, the way mages fought in this world underwent a tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>The original distinctions between lightning mages, fire mages, air mages, metal mages, and so on were no longer obvious.</p><p></p><p>Any mage, as long as they mastered the corresponding spells and successfully changed their spiritual frequency, could unleash any skill, whether from the 'material system' or the 'energy system', and even the most profound 'fantasy system', although the difficulty was very high.</p><p></p><p>Of course, different people had different talents, and the spells they were skilled at unleashing also varied.</p><p></p><p>So what would be the effect of casting spells across systems?</p><p></p><p>For example, in tonight's 'Operation to Annihilate the Restoration Society', a powerful mage initially used a skill called 'Meteor Shower' for an area attack on the Restoration Society's base.</p><p></p><p>The 'Meteor Shower' skill belonged to both the material system and the energy system, a combined technique of metal mages and fire mages. But now, a single mage could chant the spell, adjust their spiritual power, and unleash this powerful magic.</p><p></p><p>This was something unimaginable in the past.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>From high in the sky, huge fiery meteors kept crashing into a courtyard, reducing the entire courtyard to ruins in a moment.</p><p></p><p>But the Mage Association knew that this powerful spell could only take out a small portion of the mages. More mages used metal covers to block the impact of this powerful spell.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mage Association's attack did not end there!</p><p></p><p>'Thunder Realm'!</p><p></p><p>After the black clouds formed, streaks of lightning flashed intermittently within the black clouds, illuminating the courtyard as bright as day, revealing the terrified faces of many mages within.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Crack! Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>One bolt of lightning after another began to strike down from the black clouds, the sound deafening and unceasing! It was unimaginable what fate awaited those caught within.</p><p></p><p>Creating the clouds was originally the specialty of air mages, while thunderbolts were the unique skill of lightning mages. But now, a metal mage had unleashed them all, with a force even greater than an ordinary lightning mage's full-power lightning strike.</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association's attack did not end there.</p><p></p><p>'Corrosive Rain'!</p><p></p><p>'Explosive Fireball'!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One spell after another rained down indiscriminately, extinguishing any hope for the Restoration Society.</p><p></p><p>Only after the last enemy's aura disappeared from their senses did the Mage Association's people stop this frenzied bombardment.</p><p></p><p>"I never knew fighting could be so exhilarating! This is a feeling I've never experienced as a metal mage before! So this is how exciting it is for you energy mages to fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey! The Mage Association didn't restrict the use of source gems tonight, so of course it's exciting! We're using the Mage Association's source gems now. You used to use your own, so you can experience it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, these spells really pack a punch. Just five-circle spells can unleash such tremendous power. I can't imagine how powerful the highest ninth-circle spells must be."</p><p></p><p>"I saw there's a ninth-circle spell called 'Light of Peace'. I wonder how formidable it is!"</p><p></p><p>"Work hard to contribute and earn points to redeem and try it out! Hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The passing of the Master of Harmony and the annihilation of the Restoration Society symbolized the end of the old era for many mages.</p><p></p><p>More or less, everyone had a vague feeling in their heart: The times were calling!</p><p></p><p>As time passed, many people suddenly realized that the 'calamities' they often discussed seemed like events from the distant past.</p><p></p><p>Calamities appeared to have completely disappeared from this world.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not mean absolute safety, as many people discovered that powerful beasts with all sorts of abilities had emerged in the wilderness, roaming everywhere. Those unlucky enough to encounter them faced life or death.</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association had given these powerful beasts a new name: demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was said that they were animals from the wilderness that had absorbed a great deal of magic power and transformed, weaker in strength than the previous 'source beast calamities' but formidable in their large numbers.</p><p></p><p>At this point, those who were invaded thought of the Mage Association, which they had almost forgotten in a corner!</p><p></p><p>From then on, mages once again became the guardian deities protecting humanity, a profession that everyone aspired to!</p><p></p><p>The mages exterminated many demonic beasts roaming around the cities, driving them into a vast, uninhabited mountain range...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Wind Return came back, he briefly reported the situation to Su Hao: "Chief Wei, the Master of Harmony has indeed passed away. Now Grand Master Lada has taken over the position of the new 'Master of Harmony'. I guess the reason Lada was chosen is because his adopted son Fei Yao has been by our side all along, and the Master of Harmony wanted to use this relationship to ensure we give the Mage Association more support."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "In the agreement we signed with the Mage Association, there was a clause stating that as long as we're alive, we'll ensure the continuation of the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to play these little tricks. As long as we're around, we'll naturally ensure the Mage Association's continuation."</p><p></p><p>Wind Return said, "That old man looks kind and honest, but he's actually quite petty-minded."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I can understand the Master of Harmony's actions. As the leader of an organization, it's his responsibility. Even knowing he was going to leave, he still couldn't rest assured about the association he devoted his life to."</p><p></p><p>Wind Return was surprised, "Old Master Yashan, could it be that you were once the leader of an organization yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied, "Wrong! Not one, but many!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Return exclaimed, "Impressive! I would never have guessed. So the 'slap management method' you taught me before was real!"</p><p></p><p>After some casual chat, Su Hao asked the question he cared about most: "Wind Return, has your astronomical team observed any abnormalities with asteroids or meteors?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Return shook his head, "There are some minor differences every year, but those are normal movements. There haven't been any abnormalities worth noting. Everything is normal."</p><p></p><p>No abnormalities...</p>

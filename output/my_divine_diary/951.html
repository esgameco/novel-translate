        <h1>Chapter 951</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said, "You can understand it this way, essentially there is no difference. After thousands or millions of years pass, the existing creatures on this land will inevitably have changed, and by then the entire land will be under the shroud of the soul power system."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the soul power system will only provide simple guidance and suggestions, and will not have any negative effects on the creatures. On the contrary, it will endow the creatures with certain potentials, allowing them to gain more knowledge and have the opportunity to become stronger, and then join our team exploring the universe."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded, "This is indeed an excellent method that can avoid the destruction of the Infinite Lands as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "Of course, nothing is absolute. Having the soul power system doesn't guarantee there won't be any issues, as those who become powerful enough will still have the ability to cause destruction. So we need another safeguard."</p><p></p><p>"What safeguard?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually took out an invisible coin, "Do you remember the 'lost coin of the Goddess of Fortune'? Not only can I make these with this special metal, but in the future I can also use soul power to achieve the same function. When suggestions don't work, the soul power implanted deep in their consciousness will activate a specific program, turning them into targets of karmic attacks. In other words, the so-called 'misfortune'. It will make it clear to them through actions that this thing cannot be done."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng were shocked again.</p><p></p><p>There was even such a method!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "Of course, I don't fully understand karmic forces yet, so this function cannot be realized for now. But it should be developed within the next ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng had never imagined soul power could reach such a level. They had thought being able to gain eternal life was already an exceptionally powerful ability, but Su Hao had come up with all kinds of applications, leaving them dazzled. At the same time, they were once again amazed by Su Hao's "development" talent.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were strolling when they suddenly saw the native races of the Trial Stars rushing the construction site and being imprisoned and driven away. Ya Shan thought of something and asked, "By the way, Great Lord Wei, there are currently 315 different races across the hundreds of Trial Stars. Once the World Passage opens, these different races will inevitably come into contact, and wars of conquest are bound to occur. It's not hard to imagine that some weaker races may face extinction.</p><p></p><p>But these races were painstakingly created by us after all. Wouldn't it be such a pity for them to be exterminated so easily?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "The purpose of me creating these Infinite Lands is to allow all the races to merge together, isn't it? The exchanges and collisions between different races will inevitably produce different sparks, and those tiny sparks are exactly the crystallizations I want to obtain.</p><p></p><p>War will promote the fusion and expansion of knowledge, developing many different applications. Although we now grasp the source of power, we are still lacking in the application of that power. Let them interact freely! I believe that after thousands or millions of years, it will bring us surprises."</p><p></p><p>He paused, then continued, "As for the issue of extinction, no race can last forever. Even if I don't open the World Passage, without our supervision, they would disappear after countless years.</p><p></p><p>The conquest between races seems cruel, but it gives every creature the opportunity to transcend. Without fusion and interaction, the passage of time will turn everything into decay. What meaning would that have for us?</p><p></p><p>Of course, I will leave a glimmer of hope for every race. After the Infinite Lands are generated, I will also search for some life-bearing planets in the universe and transform them into 'Outer Worlds'. If any race is truly unsuited for conflict and wants to retire, I can let them leave the Infinite Lands and migrate to the Outer Worlds on their own.</p><p></p><p>As long as we continue to explore various parts of the universe, the lands will be an infinite resource for us."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng felt some reluctance towards the races they had personally created, but as Su Hao said, these races were created for the purpose of gaining more knowledge, and they could not protect them forever.</p><p></p><p>The conditions given now were already quite generous.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "Of course, we won't fully open the World Passage right away, but rather weaken it every hundred years until it is completely open after ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after the Infinite Lands are built, I will make an official announcement to all races on the Infinite Lands, letting them understand the development trend ahead, so they can make preparations.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years of buffer time is enough. Let everything change gradually!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan nodded, "I understand, Great Lord Wei."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed, "I'm really curious, out of these 315 different races, who will be able to persevere until the end and become the protagonist of these Infinite Lands? Shall we place some bets?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Haha, we can certainly bet. Out of all these races, the one I favor the most is the humans."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was surprised, "Why? I don't think humans have many advantages compared to the other races."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed, "Why even ask? It's because we are human!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "......"</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to say "I'm not."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he recalled the legends spread by the disciples, thinking to himself, "Could Great Lord Wei be the divine embryo born at the beginning of the universe? It's very possible! Great Lord Wei must be a primordial deity!"</p><p></p><p>The three chatted and laughed, soon returning to the Blue-Purple Star. They sat down for tea on the luxurious balcony of a high-rise building.</p><p></p><p>In this star domain, they had discovered many life-bearing planets, but their favorite was the Blue-Purple Star because this planet had a strong modern atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>They treated it as their headquarters, often coming here to relax when they had nothing to do, watching movies or visiting clubs.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, they decided not to incorporate this Blue-Purple Star into the Infinite Lands, but rather let it develop independently.</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao fiddled with the tea set, he said, "After the Infinite Lands are completed, some of the disciples involved in building the lands will remain to maintain the World Passage and fix any issues, while the other disciples can be dispatched to explore more star systems.</p><p></p><p>In any case, exploration is our main theme.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Lands can only be described as a fortress we have built with our current knowledge. No matter how magnificent this fortress ends up, it is still operating within the same system and won't allow us to make any substantive breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>If we want to gain more knowledge, we can only go out and search for it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Haha, that's what I think too. After the Infinite Lands are built, I'll go out and explore personally, searching for civilized planets. I've already discussed it with Old Master Ya Shan - I'll focus on exploring enough life-bearing planets, while Old Master Ya Shan will study the newly discovered planets. We'll work together to gain more knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said helplessly, "Mainly because my luck is bad..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Fifty years later.</p><p></p><p>The massive project connecting over five hundred life-bearing planets was nearing completion.</p><p></p><p>Lands were connected to lands, oceans to oceans, lands to oceans...</p><p></p><p>A huge world mixing lands and oceans was built, officially named the 'Great World' by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Su Hao brought the eighteen deities and over five hundred prepared soul power sub-machine devices to a Trial Star. He personally guided the deities on how to secretly implant the soul power devices on this planet and how to connect the sub-machines to the soul power network of the Cruciform Star.</p><p></p><p>After teaching them, Su Hao smiled, "Then you can independently complete the remaining five hundred plus planets. Try to finish it within two years."</p><p></p><p>"Once this task is done, I'll unlock the 'Flash' ability for you, redeemable at zero points."</p><p></p><p>"Flash!!!"</p><p></p><p>The eighteen workers immediately perked up, wishing they could finish everything right away.</p><p></p><p>Two years later, the entire Infinite Lands successfully connected to the soul power network of the Cruciform Star.</p><p></p><p>The massive soul power network underwent a metamorphosis, and the inner worlds of "Heaven" and "Hell" from the two soul power networks also exploded in scale, transforming into an almost infinitely large network world, officially renamed the "Celestial Palace" and "Underworld".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a wisp of soul power quietly merged into the newborn infants at the moment of their birth. The first generation of life with "souls" in the "Great World" was born.</p><p></p><p>Another two years passed.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Great World, all creatures felt something and looked up at the sky, hearing a voice echoing from the depths:</p><p></p><p>Most Great World creatures: "Was that just an auditory hallucination? It must have been!"</p><p></p><p>But when they saw the expressions of those around them and discussed it, they realized the voice was real.</p><p></p><p>A thought emerged in their minds: "Where is the World Passage? What is the Great World?"</p><p></p><p>Soon they gave up thinking about it: "Does it have anything to do with me? No, right..."</p><p></p><p>Only the world sovereigns muttered inwardly, "The Great World?"</p>

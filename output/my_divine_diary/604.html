        <h1>Chapter 604</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The old emperor went missing, and the new emperor ascended the throne. The doomsday cannons were secretly constructed as scheduled. Once completed, they were transported through the top-level source device 'Gate' to the Dragon Heart region closest to Pingkong City. They would then be slowly pushed towards Pingkong City and the surrounding cities.</p><p></p><p>Each gate was aimed at one city, with a total of ten doomsday cannons, meaning that with just one command, ten cities could be destroyed simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>One day, Feng Cheng posted a message in the group: "Big Boss Wei, Big Boss Ya Shan, the other side has delivered the doomsday cannons to us. It's time to receive them. However, those huge things that look like watchtowers, I may not be able to move them back alone. I still need the two big bosses to lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he casually posted a photo in the group.</p><p></p><p>The doomsday cannon as a whole resembled a cylindrical fortress, estimated to be ten meters tall, supported by four large wheels at the bottom that allowed it to roll forward. The top was a semi-spherical shape with a thick barrel protruding from it, pointing forward.</p><p></p><p>In Feng Cheng's words, it was extremely ugly!</p><p></p><p>It lacked any sense of beauty that a cannon should have. The designer of the doomsday cannon's appearance should change professions; perhaps demolition work would suit them better.</p><p></p><p>Compared to construction, destruction might be more suitable for them.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan casually replied: "You can't even handle a few of these things? Feng Cheng, you're too weak. There's no need for Big Boss Wei to step in; I'll take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Then, in the late evening, ten bizarrely shaped doomsday cannons appeared at the base.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"What? The doomsday cannons were robbed? Who did it, are they courting death? Don't they know whose property that is?"</p><p></p><p>Chaotic roars echoed in the Bund Conference Hall, filled more with exasperation and anger.</p><p></p><p>The ones speaking were not the emperors of the various regions but rather the representative teams sent to negotiate matters.</p><p></p><p>The old emperor went missing precisely because he came to the Bund for a meeting, and the new emperor had just taken the throne, not even having a chance to warm the seat before potentially facing the same fate.</p><p></p><p>Now, if anyone tried to advise the new emperors that the 'Bund' was the safest place in the world, that person would undoubtedly have ill intentions and could be directly charged and imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>After He Fashi returned, he did not rashly reveal himself but instead took advantage of the situation to operate behind the scenes, quietly controlling the vast Mage Association, with few people aware of his return.</p><p></p><p>The one representing them at this conference was He Fashi's assistant, Qi Shou.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Shou only acted as an intermediary and did not participate in the representative team's discussions.</p><p></p><p>A man with a floral collar frowned and said, "The report stated that they were robbed by two 'Earth-Scraping Armors,' who directly encased all the doomsday cannons in crystal and teleported them away.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the guards' abilities were nullified, and they had no way to stop those two 'Earth-Scraping Armors.'"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the name 'Earth-Scraping Armor,' everyone present instantly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>If the Earth-Scraping Armors were involved, the doomsday cannons being robbed was understandable... or not!</p><p></p><p>Without the doomsday cannons, what would they use to confront the Radiant Society? Continue organizing the mage army?</p><p></p><p>What's the point of fighting? They might as well surrender.</p><p></p><p>If they mentioned forming an army to eradicate the Radiant Society, the mages heavily funded by the royal families would probably flee the next day.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone indignantly said, "The construction of the doomsday cannons has always been a top-secret matter known to very few people, but it certainly did not include anyone from the Radiant Society. So how did the Earth-Scraping Armors find out? To be able to so precisely rob all ten doomsday cannons, don't tell me it was an accident!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone suddenly realized this point and looked at each other, dumbfounded. According to the manufacturing and transportation process of the doomsday cannons, the possibility of a leak was almost zero. So how did the Earth-Scraping Armors obtain the information?</p><p></p><p>As they pondered, three words popped into their minds: "There's a mole!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the way they looked at each other changed, filled with suspicion and scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>Except for themselves, no one knew whether the others were the traitors who betrayed the collective.</p><p></p><p>In other words, anyone present could potentially be the mole!</p><p></p><p>Someone gritted their teeth and said, "Investigate! We must find the person who leaked the information and tear them to shreds!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>While the imperial conference was frantically searching for the mole, the Radiant Society had already located the positions of the various royal families based on the information provided by the emperors over the past six months and secretly set up corresponding transfer orbs.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan decided to organize manpower the next evening to first launch a surprise attack on the royal families of ten regions, then eliminate the remaining seven royal families, aiming to complete the task of clearing out the royal families within two days.</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng worriedly said, "Mr. Jia Ya Shan, we still lack manpower. How about waiting another six months? In six months, I'm confident I can double the number of my mage friends!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Don't worry! The three of us will take care of the royal palaces with the strongest defenses. You only need to handle clearing out the various city manors. Moreover, we've collected all the source devices and distributed them to the various squads. As long as they're used properly, wiping out those regional manors will be a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng still didn't feel reassured. "While that may be true, launching such a hasty attack will undoubtedly result in heavy casualties for our mage friends. Furthermore, I'm worried that the mages from the Mage Association will quickly react and join the battle, leaving us without a chance of victory."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan said, "Losses are unavoidable, but we can't refrain from taking action just because there will be losses. Everyone is fighting for the goal of 'letting the light shine upon the land.' Even if they sacrifice themselves, it will be for the great cause of the Radiant Society, so there's nothing to regret.</p><p></p><p>And you don't need to worry about the Mage Association. Even if they notice something amiss, they'll turn a blind eye. What you need to be concerned about are those righteous individuals who might interfere recklessly. If you encounter them, just eliminate them as well.</p><p></p><p>Go and prepare properly! Use this time to reconfirm the transfer orb sequences and emergency mechanisms. Come up with contingency plans for every possible scenario you can think of, so you don't end up in a mess and fail at the last moment."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng let out a long breath and said, "I understand! If that's the case, then let's eliminate all the royal families in the best possible manner!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the seventeen imperial royal families remained oblivious to the Radiant Society's actions, still furious over the loss of their weapon against the Radiant Society, the 'doomsday cannons,' vowing to root out the traitor who betrayed them.</p><p></p><p>The next day, as night fell, the Radiant Society's mages split into nearly seven thousand squads and secretly made their way to their respective target cities through the transfer orbs.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the cities, they did not immediately attack the manors but instead went to specific locations to sabotage the communication bases connecting to the outside world. Only then did they use the transfer orbs to appear directly inside the manors and launch their attacks.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, curses, bloodshed, screams, and severed limbs...</p><p></p><p>The mages stationed in the various manors quickly reacted, either fleeing or fighting back, but they were soon overwhelmed by the Radiant Society's mages, losing their ability to resist or their lives.</p><p></p><p>The difference between being prepared and unprepared was immense.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also joined this operation, tasked with destroying the royal palaces of six regions.</p><p></p><p>He directly teleported to the main city of the nearest Dragon Heart region, locked onto the royal palace with his divine sense, and didn't even bother using a suppression device. He simply took a stance, clenched his fist, and applied various enhancing effects.</p><p></p><p>Then, he punched the wall next to him with full force.</p><p></p><p>There was no sound, and the wall remained intact.</p><p></p><p>Under the effect of the 'Locked Fist,' the tremendous impact force from his punch was divided into countless portions and transferred into the heads of the people locked onto by his divine sense, effortlessly turning their brains into mush.</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, everyone in the royal palace of the Dragon Heart region's main city lost their voices and collapsed softly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao threw another punch, and the people in the surrounding prince manors also fell, following the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>All the members of the royal family in the Dragon Heart region's main city didn't even know how they died.</p><p></p><p>After two punches, Su Hao withdrew his fist, flashed into the royal palace, and transformed his Vajra Armor, spreading it out and causing the entire royal palace to sink underground. The once brightly lit palace disappeared, becoming a dark, flat expanse of land.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the Li Yuan region!" Su Hao scanned with his divine sense, confirming that no one was left behind, and then teleported away. When he reappeared, he was already outside the royal palace of the main city in the Li Yuan region.</p><p></p><p>Once one's strength reached a certain level, carrying out such tasks became incredibly easy.</p><p></p><p>A vibrant life, like an insect or ant, could be extinguished with just a flick of his finger.</p>

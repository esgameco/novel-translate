        <h1>Chapter 658</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A planet - on the premise that it already had a certain foundation, Su Hao wanted to make appropriate modifications to it, so that life could survive on it. This was not a very difficult task.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was willing to spend one or two hundred years slowly exploring and experimenting, he would eventually get the final result.</p><p></p><p>Not only because he now had many means at his disposal, but also because he never underestimated the survival and adaptability of life.</p><p></p><p>However, for the current Su Hao, such a thing was still premature.</p><p></p><p>He had not even solved the problem of his own survival, how could he think of creating a new world?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not explain to Ya Shan and the others how to modify the planet. Instead, he extended a finger, gathered strength for a moment, and pointed it at the planet.</p><p></p><p>'Star-Piercing Finger'!</p><p></p><p>Then he timed the activation of the 'Exploration Cube' in his hand and precisely threw it into the hole below.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the small cube had started working normally, Su Hao said to Ya Shan and the others, "Let's go, back to the spaceship. We'll go tour other planets and drop 'Exploration Cubes' to collect unknown materials."</p><p></p><p>Only then did they come back to their senses from the fantasy of the 'various cubes', and followed Su Hao back onto the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Through Su Hao's simple explanation and demonstration, they gained a new understanding of this thing called the 'Planetary Virus', and developed a keen interest in it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps a 'virus' could not only be used for destruction, but also for creation.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng brought up the corresponding techniques and manufacturing processes on their universal assistants to view, but soon closed them in frustration.</p><p></p><p>It was too complicated! Each step was very clear, and each piece of data was very accurate, but they just couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>The gap in their knowledge reserves compared to Su Hao's was too large.</p><p></p><p>The 'Planetary Virus' was temporarily something they could not comprehend or utilize, even for Ya Shan. He couldn't persist past one-third before getting dizzy and confused, unable to make sense of it. Even the 'Seer' could not save him.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Two years after Su Hao and the others arrived in the Purple Wolf Galaxy, the 'Exploration Cubes' had transmitted back a large amount of unknown substances from the planets, with an efficiency tens of thousands of times higher than manual searching.</p><p></p><p>After classifying and organizing all these substances, Su Hao planned to implant 'Planet-Shattering Cubes' into the outermost giant planets again.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was to create a major disturbance and attempt to observe the energy flow of the 'Catastrophe System'.</p><p></p><p>His plan was simple: travel to different star systems - search for unknown substances - explode stars - wait for the next 'disaster' to arrive.</p><p></p><p>With all preparations complete, Ya Shan transmitted, "Master Wei, everything is ready on this side, you can begin."</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the message, Su Hao took action immediately.</p><p></p><p>'Star-Piercing Finger', 'Planet-Shattering Cube', 'Igniter'!</p><p></p><p>One side of the planet lit up with brilliant light, accompanied by a massive stream of material particles shooting towards the depths of the universe, like a 'cosmic lightsaber' extending to infinity.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Su Hao's reckless actions would cause the next disaster to be even more ferocious...</p><p></p><p>He believed it was inevitable.  </p><p></p><p>But if it didn't come more ferociously, how could he sense the energy fluctuations of the 'Catastrophe System'?</p><p></p><p>In this situation where the enemy was hidden while he was in the open, if he didn't put himself on the brink, how would the enemy easily reveal itself?</p><p></p><p>After completing the star explosion, Su Hao and the others began analyzing the various unknown substances, and again obtained two special substances, named 'Seeker Three' and 'Seeker Four'.</p><p></p><p>Which also meant that Su Hao's vision had expanded by two more...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were not what Su Hao was looking for.</p><p></p><p>But it was better than nothing, who knows if they might be useful in the future? Wasn't this how Su Hao had been accumulating step-by-step?</p><p></p><p>But they would definitely be useful eventually.</p><p></p><p>As for the Purple Wolf Galaxy, it no longer had the serene and beautiful appearance it had when they first arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was like a wild boar had entered a cabbage patch.</p><p></p><p>The only star Su Hao dared not touch was the Purple Wolf star itself.</p><p></p><p>If he could create a 'Planetary Virus' that ignored the stellar environment, even the Purple Wolf star might not be spared.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao ravaged the easily bullied planets in the Purple Wolf Galaxy, he pointed to another star system five light-years away and said, "Get ready, we'll depart for the next star system - Taurus - in two months."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and the others responded in unison, "Yes, Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>This kind of journey was extremely novel for all of them.</p><p></p><p>They were like true cosmic travelers, roaming between various star systems, witnessing the scenery of all kinds of planets.</p><p></p><p>When departing, they always looked forward to what the next planet they arrived at would be like.</p><p></p><p>Most special of all, no one could predict the appearance of that planet before arriving. Each planet was unique, one of a kind.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they were a bit different from the cosmic travelers they imagined. Travelers might only 'sightsee and broaden their horizons', while they would choose the farthest planet and blow it up...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be more fitting to describe them as the 'Cosmic Wild Boar Squad'. But it didn't matter, no one cared about that except the planets themselves!</p><p></p><p>This caused Su Hao's desire to learn knowledge to be dashed, Ya Shan could not witness the appearance of different civilizations, Feng Cheng's alien girls were out of reach, and Fei Yao wanted to find a place to settle his five students...</p><p></p><p>However, as long as they kept exploring, hope would never be cut off!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Year after year passed, with the spaceship jumping once every year, equivalent to traveling at the speed of light, extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>And they explored one star system after another, slowly advancing towards the inner rings of the Panyang System.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they also obtained all kinds of never-before-seen substances and structures with various miraculous special properties, named 'Seeker Five', 'Seeker Six', and so on.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was still no trace of the 'Catastrophe System' sensor that Su Hao was looking for.</p><p></p><p>Sixty years flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others looked the same as sixty years ago, while Yuan Feng and Ling Xue gradually aged and eventually reached the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>The five children had now grown into youths, and their cultivation had reached the Yuan Ying realm. They no longer aged, and after watching their parents grow old and die, they asked their teacher Fei Yao in confusion, "Will we also grow old and die in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao nodded, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Who could escape the limits of lifespan?</p><p></p><p>Death is inevitable. There is no fundamental difference between humans and plants, insects, and fish - in the end, they will all dissipate into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Yuan Feng's five children felt the fear brought by death.</p><p></p><p>After death, they would no longer exist, unable to perceive or think, nothing at all!</p><p></p><p>They had no concept of a hundred-year lifespan, feeling it passed in the blink of an eye. And they had no concept of their own five-thousand-year lifespan, not feeling it was a very long life.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that in the end, they would grow old and die like their parents.</p><p></p><p>How cruel, how terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed day by day, they gradually forgot everything that made them feel afraid, and excitedly joined Su Hao and the others on their planet-exploring journey.</p><p></p><p>As Yuan Ying cultivators, they could barely survive in the space environment for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>One day, outside a star system called Mu Ming, a small spaceship abruptly appeared, flying towards the star system at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>All nine of them were crammed into the cockpit. Su Hao smiled, "Same old routine, let's go to the habitable planet first and take a look to see if there is any life."</p><p></p><p>Ling Bai Hua and the other five youngsters immediately cheered.</p><p></p><p>These five were all over seventy years old, but still looked like little brats who never grew up.</p>

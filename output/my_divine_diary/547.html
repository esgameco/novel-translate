        <h1>Chapter 547</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao first entered the bizarre disaster, he had the idea of raising some summoned beasts to replace him in entering various bizarre disasters to probe the triggering conditions and effects. </p><p></p><p>As long as the consciousness information of various summoned beasts was recorded into the Tantopolis space, and then monitored in real-time using the Small Black Room, recording the information, then each summoned beast would become Suhao's audio-visual real-time detector, which was very useful. Everything that happened to the summoned beasts could be replayed through the Small Black Room.</p><p></p><p>What others dared not think of, or could not do even if they thought of it, was easy for him with the Tantopolis space.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he did not need to take risks himself.</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of summoned beasts to choose, Suhao also had pre-selected targets.</p><p></p><p>What could be a better choice than rats? Able to enter anywhere, extremely prolific, and extremely hardy - they were unmatched in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yashan and Fengcheng brought back a bag of snakes, rats and rabbits. Suhao reached out, his blood energy surging, and in the blink of an eye recorded the consciousness information of all the small animals. He then sent them in batches into the bizarre disaster.</p><p></p><p>For the bizarre disaster happening at the base, based on Yashan and Fengcheng's descriptions and his own personal experience, Suhao had made some guesses, and was just waiting for these small animals to go in and verify them.</p><p></p><p>According to Yashan, all the items in the base had been destroyed, and he did not see anything that was preserved intact.</p><p></p><p>But when Suhao was teleported back to the base, his keen hearing allowed him to hear the sound of machinery operating from another factory building.</p><p></p><p>The question was here - if all the machinery was destroyed, how could there be the sound of machinery operating?</p><p></p><p>But in any case, he was certain that the 'core' of this bizarre disaster must be related to it.</p><p></p><p>So this time when sending the small animals into the disaster, the target was very clear - to go to the machinery factory and see what was really going on.</p><p></p><p>However, how to go required setting up corresponding plans in advance to probe the triggering conditions of the disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Reviewing what happened before, it's not difficult to see that the bizarre trigger is related to movement. So, the first batch will have eight small animals entering. After entering, four rats will remain stationary, and the other four will keep moving. If it's really related to movement, then the four moving animals will surely die, while the four stationary ones will be able to survive.</p><p></p><p>If all eight die, then we can rule out stillness and movement as the triggering condition..."</p><p></p><p>As Suhao explained his probing plan, he sent corresponding action commands to the eight small animals.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the bizarre range, four animals immediately stopped, while the other four continued moving.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to Suhao's expectations, the four stationary small animals had blood spurting out, their bodies cut into pieces, and they quickly died. The four moving small animals were unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? The stationary small animals were actually harmed..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not jump to conclusions, but carefully observed the situation below. After a while, he made two of them gradually stop.</p><p></p><p>"Shh shh!"</p><p></p><p>The two that stopped soon became motionless. The remaining two continued forward without issue.</p><p></p><p>After another while, Suhao controlled one of them to slowly stop, and this stopped animal's body was quickly cut into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The last one was still moving forward. Just as Suhao was hesitating whether to make it slowly stop, that small animal's limbs suddenly broke off, and its body rolled uncontrollably on the ground, before also being cut into pieces.</p><p></p><p>By this point, the eight innocent small animals sent in had all perished.</p><p></p><p>Suhao grinned, waving his big hand to send another eight small animals into the bizarre disaster. But this time he did not rush to control their movements, letting them remain still.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the eight small animals that remained still all survived.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I thought!"</p><p></p><p>The conditions for triggering the bizarre disaster were one of 'movement' and one of 'stillness', alternating repeatedly! He called them the 'Movement Disaster' and 'Stillness Disaster'. In the 'Movement Disaster', if you moved around, you would be attacked. As long as you remained still, you would be unharmed. And vice versa.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Suhao had just teleported into the base, it was the 'Movement Disaster'. Standing still without moving was fine, but when he tried to reach out to grab Fengcheng, his moving arm was injured, and he instinctively pulled his arm back quickly, causing the entire arm to be cut off and fall to the ground.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could also be seen that in the 'Movement Disaster', the faster the movement, the greater the harm.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the principle, Suhao casually gave this disaster the code name 'If the Enemy Doesn't Move, I Don't Move'!</p><p></p><p>It would be terrible if he got it wrong carelessly.</p><p></p><p>So this critically important task fell upon these small animals.</p><p></p><p>In this way, batch after batch of poor small animals were sent by Suhao into the bizarre disaster. The small animals also did their best and never caused any fuss with Suhao.</p><p></p><p>When only four small animals remained, Suhao finally figured out the pattern of alternation between the 'Movement Disaster' and 'Stillness Disaster'.</p><p></p><p>It was related to the only intact 'processing' machine in the factory building. Contrary to his imagination, it had nothing to do with 'time' - there was no fixed interval between the switching of the two disaster states.</p><p></p><p>When the machine was operating, it was the 'Movement Disaster', cutting whoever moved. When the machine stopped, it was the 'Stillness Disaster', cutting whoever was still, not sparing even walls and ground.</p><p></p><p>To figure this out, there was no small amount of bloodshed and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>But it was all worth it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled as he shared the exploration results with Yashan and Fengcheng, then said: "That processing machine must have become the 'core' of the bizarre disaster, treating everything in the area as raw materials for processing. The cutting damage we saw was probably the effect of the processing machine's blades. Haha, the three of us were all processed by the processing machine earlier, experiencing the treatment those spirit grasses went through."</p><p></p><p>Yashan forced a smile: "It's just absurd, making those spirit grasses suffer so much, they came back as evil spirits to take revenge on us!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also said: "There's no reason for them to become evil spirits! The spirit grasses are just used to make spirit-enhancing pills, right? If that's the case, I won't dare eat meat anymore."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled: "No need to be so alarmed. Most likely it's just a coincidence. In a few years, when we thoroughly understand the mechanisms of Sources, all doubts will be cleared up. Let's go, get closer and identify which parts are the 'Source' and which are the 'Manifestation'."</p><p></p><p>With that, he flashed and appeared at the edge of the disaster, peering inside.</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed awkwardly, hesitated for a few seconds, then also disappeared from his spot and reappeared next to Suhao. Fengcheng looked envious, but unfortunately he had not yet learned teleportation from theFu's Mental Cultivation Method, so he could only fly down slowly.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Suhao's finger, the entire mountain was leveled. Another wave of his big hand summoned a raging wind that blew away all the rubble and dust, revealing the huge processing machine inside the mountain cavity.</p><p></p><p>The machine was currently operating on its own, its "gaga" sounds ringing out as the sharp rotating blades spun rapidly inside. One could imagine what would happen if a 'raw material' was thrown into it - those glinting, terrifying blades would make short work of it. After all, the three of them had just been 'raw materials' for this bizarre machine not long ago.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, with his limited experience and perception of Sources, Suhao determined which parts were the Source and which were the Manifestation.</p><p></p><p>"The flywheel in the machine should be the 'Source', and the rest are the 'Manifestation'. Those blade shafts should be the 'Source Artifacts', so..."</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, he casually pointed.</p><p></p><p>'Little Cannon'!</p><p></p><p>A tremendous boom erupted as the entire machine instantly disassembled, scattering components everywhere. The parts Suhao had identified as the 'Source' and 'Source Artifacts' fell intact to one side.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the flywheel flashed with white light and disintegrated into thumb-sized Source Pearls scattered around. The blade-covered shaft dimmed, shrinking into the shape of a thermos, but the spiraling blades on it looked razor-sharp.</p><p></p><p>Even then, Suhao did not let his guard down. He first sent the few remaining small animals into the bizarre disaster area, having them frolic about. Seeing no abnormalities, he finally approached the 'processing blade' Source Artifact with Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>After collecting nearly a hundred Source Pearls, he turned to the cylindrical 'processing blade' and said: "Fengcheng, go find some sand and wrap it in sand to take it away. Yashan, collect the spirit grass debris first, to cultivate new spirit grasses, then bury this entire base."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng and Yashan quickly took care of their tasks.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Suhao called out, taking the lead flying into the distance.</p>

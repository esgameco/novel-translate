        <h1>Chapter 686</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Before the Octopus Race's ship Yuanxing had even docked, they had received a warning message from their supply base's signal nest, informing them that a human patrol cruiser was approaching with the intent to plunder their supplies.</p><p></p><p>However, the Octopus Race's commander at the supply station didn't take this seriously.</p><p></p><p>When had the Octopus Race ever feared humans?</p><p></p><p>A puny little patrol cruiser daring to intrude into their territory was simply seeking death. The idea that it could plunder their supplies was laughable.</p><p></p><p>They then made the appropriate preparations, with cannons of all sizes extending from the base sphere, pointing in all directions, waiting for their "military exploits" to come to them.</p><p></p><p>For the Octopus commander, the humans' arrival was perfectly timed. Perhaps during this opportunity to make merits, it could leave this desolate place.</p><p></p><p>However, events had already surpassed the Octopus Race's understanding.</p><p></p><p>The enemy actually stopped dozens of kilometers away and did not approach further. Then one by one, its tribesmen began disappearing.</p><p></p><p>That's right, they vanished into thin air, just like files being completely deleted from a computer.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to describe this bizarre feeling.</p><p></p><p>All nine of its brains were puzzled: "What happened? Where did the Octopus soldiers go?"</p><p></p><p>But they didn't need to ponder this question for long.</p><p></p><p>The over 300 remaining Octopus Race members who hadn't disappeared didn't even have time to rejoice at their good fortune before being suddenly blasted into pieces by an energy cannon that appeared.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After "rattling" on the spot for a bit, Su Hao retracted the machine cannon behind his back and said to Commander Jiang: "Commander, it's done, we can go receive the supplies now."</p><p></p><p>Although Commander Jiang knew of Su Hao's abilities, he still found it somewhat absurd until now.</p><p></p><p>He immediately said: "Good, Squad 744 immediately retreat 50 kilometers following Xu Shiqiang. The rest follow me to the supply station to investigate."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he personally led the team and quickly arrived at the Octopus Race's supply station.</p><p></p><p>From the outside it appeared completely normal, just an ordinary Octopus Race supply station, but it was too quiet, like a "silent village" from a horror movie.</p><p></p><p>They cautiously approached, observing it repeatedly, but didn't see a single Octopus Race member.</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang felt reassured: "It seems they've all been killed by Xu Shiqiang..."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a squad immediately activated their armored vehicles to investigate the base sphere. Soon, they reported back: "Commander Jiang, no surviving Octopus Race members detected. There are scattered limbs and flesh outside the base sphere. The automated attack AI system inside should be in standby mode. The Octopus Race didn't even have time to enter combat mode before being wiped out. No immediate danger for now."</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang gave another order: "Plasma breaching squad, go breach the base sphere."</p><p></p><p>A squad quickly rushed into the supply station while protected, breaching each base sphere one by one. Inside they found large amounts of scattered limbs and flesh as well, a horrific sight.</p><p></p><p>Everyone understood that Su Hao's "hundred shots, hundred hits" had taken effect!</p><p></p><p>After Commander Jiang inspected the area, he directly voice communicated to the Yuanxing ship: "Reporting to the captain, this is the combat team commander. The supply station has been taken, large amounts of energy blocks discovered. Request Yuanxing to land and dispatch logistics team to inspect."</p><p></p><p>Another huge haul!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>While everyone else was focused on the supply station, Su Hao quietly returned to the ship and began attempting to record the curvature engine in pieces.</p><p></p><p>This time, he succeeded!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao worked quickly, completing the recording of the curvature engine within just two days.</p><p></p><p>At the same time he finished recording, the Yuanxing had also completed loading the supply materials. It soon took off back into space at maximum speed to avoid encountering any Octopus Race reinforcement fleets.</p><p></p><p>As long as they moved quickly enough, the chances of the Octopus Race catching up were low.</p><p></p><p>The smoothness of this operation exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>It also sparked ambitions in the Yuanxing's officers that they had never had before.</p><p></p><p>Although they had obtained many energy blocks, it was still far from enough to fully load the Yuanxing. They needed more, and could obtain even more!</p><p></p><p>The large haul from this sudden attack made him eager to begin researching the Octopus Race.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, eager to evolve the Octopus Race into [Gods]!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Su Hao transmitted himself into the miniature world prison.</p><p></p><p>The miniature world prison was a spherical shape, not very large with only a 5,000 meter diameter. Inside, besides the 1,000 Octopus Race members Su Hao had brought in, there was also soil and rocks from planets.</p><p></p><p>A small portion of the Octopus Race members died after being transmitted, unable to withstand the spatial pressure. Their corpses, unaffected by gravity, floated about the miniature world like in space along with the dirt and rocks.</p><p></p><p>The physically strong individuals who managed to survive were extremely weak, wilted and unwilling to move.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also tenacious individuals still operating armored suits to explore the miniature world, hoping to find a way out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wasn't worried about the Octopus Race members suffocating from lack of oxygen, as they were still wearing thick combat armor that could provide enough oxygen to allow them to survive in space for extended periods.</p><p></p><p>For these Octopus Race members, everything happened too abruptly. They had no idea what had occurred or why they had suddenly appeared in this strange spherical place.</p><p></p><p>Regrettably, no matter how they searched, they could not find an exit.</p><p></p><p>Until Su Hao suddenly appeared here.</p><p></p><p>All the conscious Octopus Race members simultaneously looked towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>A human?</p><p></p><p>A human had also appeared in this bizarre place?</p><p></p><p>For them, no matter the situation, killing all humans would never be wrong.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but reveal a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although he had improved the transmission method to minimize the spatial pressure's impact on lifeforms as much as possible, he was still worried many Octopus Race members would die during transmission.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed he had been overly concerned.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Race's physiques were even stronger than he had imagined, which was a good thing!</p><p></p><p>An enormous runic array spontaneously manifested, gradually etching itself into completion. The instant it finished, the runic array flashed brilliantly before disappearing. Immediately after, a tremendous gravitational force emanated from the runic array, acting on all objects within the miniature world.</p><p></p><p>The moment the runes activated, this miniature world gained a sense of up and down.</p><p></p><p>Affected by gravity, the soil began falling, gradually filling the bottom of the miniature world while covering up the runic array.</p><p></p><p>As for the Octopus Race members, at some point an unknown force had frozen them in midair, immobilizing them until all the soil had settled. Only then did that force suddenly release them to fall downwards.</p><p></p><p>The conscious Octopus Race members immediately activated their armor suits, landing steadily, while the unconscious or dead ones "thudded" into the soft ground, creating large craters on impact.</p><p></p><p>After steadying themselves, the Octopus Race members seemed to realize something, looking at the human floating above with disbelieving gazes.</p><p></p><p>If it was one of their own using such an ability, perhaps they wouldn't be so shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Octopus Race members who could still move unanimously raised their tentacle weapons and frantically attacked Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Pew pew pew!"</p><p></p><p>A torrential barrage of energy blasts fired from the tentacle weapons, instantly striking Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>But before the excited expressions on their octopus faces could fully form, they froze.</p><p></p><p>All the energy blasts had hit that human, but didn't seem to have any effect, simply passing through his body as if striking an illusion before detonating far behind him.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao remained expressionless throughout, completely ignoring the Octopus Race's reaction.</p><p></p><p>He slowly descended, extending his right hand to gather all the dead Octopus Race members into a pile. Then a tremendous spiritual force burst from his body, spreading outwards to construct an extremely high-powered "focus system".</p><p></p><p>"These dead octopus monster corpses can't be wasted. They'll work perfectly as sources to be converted into oxygen to supply the remaining octopus monsters!"</p><p></p><p>From the information on the Yuanxing, Su Hao had learned that one of the Octopus Race's survival requirements was oxygen.</p><p></p><p>And converting sources into oxygen was child's play for Su Hao. He just didn't know how the Octopus Race would feel knowing the oxygen they breathed came from their fallen comrades' corpses.</p><p></p><p>But as long as they could survive, who would care about such details?</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, the entire pile of Octopus Race corpses had been converted into "sources".</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually flicked his finger, firing a golden beam that struck the corpse pile.</p><p></p><p>To the remaining Octopus Race members' shock, the corpses erupted with brilliant light, bathing the miniature world in whiteness.</p><p></p><p>Then with a "whoosh", they burst into a shower of small glowing white pearls.</p>

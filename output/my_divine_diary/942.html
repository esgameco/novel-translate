        <h1>Chapter 942</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng each set up a course at two different universities, but the ones giving lectures to the students were just their smaller avatars. Their main focus was on using spatial techniques to connect two planets.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng came to a desolate planet and observed the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Small-scale spatial transfer is not difficult, but when the range becomes larger, the difficulty increases geometrically. Following the usual approach, there's no way to connect two planets."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he couldn't help but recall the scene when he and Lao Wei cooperated to launch the asteroid. He revealed a slight smile, thinking that if they had possessed such formidable power back then, they definitely wouldn't have been stumped by that small asteroid.</p><p></p><p>"So, we need to leverage the 'small world' and 'secondary space' to jointly complete this project."</p><p></p><p>He put his fingers together and casually drew a line.</p><p></p><p>"Whoo—whoosh—"</p><p>"Ka-boom—ka-boom—"</p><p></p><p>A huge arc blade burst from his hand, ripping through the heavens and earth, extending to the limits of sight.</p><p></p><p>Yashan retracted his hand and said, "Let's take this line as the boundary and transform it into a supporting point for the secondary world according to the plan."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng clapped his hands, "Got it, Old Master Yashan."</p><p></p><p>Yashan's design concept was not actually complicated, basically consistent with the 'secondary world' they usually used, just with the addition of the small world setting to allow free connection between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>The principle of the 'secondary world' is to stuff a small world into the 'secondary space' and maintain stability over a long period to form a gap space.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it means transmitting the small world from point A to point B, but pausing it at the moment of completion, leaving the small world stuck in between A and B, neither forward nor backward, yet able to go either way.</p><p></p><p>At this point, if Yashan opens up passages for the small world on both the A and B sides, anyone meeting the passage conditions can walk into the small world from point A, keep going forward, and exit the small world from the other direction to arrive at point B.</p><p></p><p>In this way, to ordinary people, the two continents of A and B appear seamlessly connected.</p><p></p><p>For Yashan and Fengcheng, this is very simple and easily accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite is that the range is not too large.</p><p></p><p>But when the range expands to the size of an entire planet, when the objects that need connecting become infinitely many, things become complicated.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty also increases with the expanding range.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, how can they ensure the constructed spatial passage remains continuously stable?</p><p></p><p>However, this problem did not stump Yashan and Fengcheng. After years of attempts, they found a way to overcome the difficulties—positioning stones.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, they made the positioning stones into 'spatial balance stones' with a certain self-adjustment ability, burying them on the two planets as the two supports of the secondary world, allowing the secondary world to remain stably in the gap between the two planetary surfaces for a long time.</p><p></p><p>With this, the conditions for creating a stable planetary passage to connect the two continents were fully met.</p><p></p><p>And now was the time for Yashan and Fengcheng to test it on a desolate planet.</p><p></p><p>Following the grooves they had dug out, Yashan and Fengcheng placed the prepared 'spatial balance stones' into the grooves, burying one stone every five kilometers.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long to complete the laying.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on another planet, their avatars completed the same laying work.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Fengcheng, get ready. We'll start creating the corridor small world now. Listen to my instructions and complete the transmission of the corridor small world simultaneously."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng replied, "Got it!"</p><p></p><p>With that, taking the spatial balance stones as support points, he created a corridor small world like a huge city wall, extending from their location into the distance, growing longer and taller.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the corridor small worlds created by Yashan and Fengcheng connected, opened up, and formed a small world passage about 3,000 kilometers long and 2 kilometers high.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to transmit this entire passage to the other planet, pausing it mid-transmission.</p><p></p><p>Yashan took a deep breath and said, "Get ready for transmission. Tell me when your area is ready."</p><p></p><p>About two minutes later, Fengcheng said, "Old Master Yashan, I'm ready on my end."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I'm also ready on my end. Then...</p><p>3...</p><p>2... </p><p>1!"</p><p></p><p>When Yashan shouted '1', the two simultaneously initiated the transmission, almost simultaneously transmitting the constructed small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Yet in an instant, they controlled them to pause midway.</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>The two closed their eyes and sensed that the corridor small world had achieved the intended effect, successfully stuck between the two planets.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "First activate the balance stones on both sides to maintain stability."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded, and together with Yashan they completed the final step.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The planet Yashan and Fengcheng were on was a yellow-black rocky planet, while the other blue-gray planet had their avatars.</p><p></p><p>These were two different color tones in stark contrast.</p><p></p><p>Now the two of them stood in front of the corridor small world, with the yellow-black land behind them. When they looked towards the small world, they saw a stretch of blue-gray land extending to the horizon.</p><p></p><p>It was as if two continents of completely different colors and textures were connected, with a huge transparent glass pane in between.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what was reflected in their eyes was no longer this yellow-black planet, but an unknown planet in another galaxy.</p><p></p><p>The land of that planet had been forcibly cut off by the small world created by Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Yashan looked at the scene before him and smiled, "Let's take a walk and test the effects."</p><p></p><p>The two stepped forward, passing unobstructed into the 'huge glass pane', crossing over to the other side, and turned back to look.</p><p></p><p>Both revealed brilliant smiles.</p><p></p><p>The planetary passage fully achieved Yashan's goals, with deviations within the preset range.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng praised, "As expected of Old Master Yashan, this design is precise to the extreme. I couldn't achieve this level. Most crucially, this massive project was completed in less than ten years."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Far from it. When we entered and exited the small world, we still felt some pressure from space. I couldn't completely eliminate this effect. If ordinary beings entered, they might get severely crushed."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "This passage wasn't prepared for ordinary beings anyway. Beings without any ability cannot enter the world passage we've constructed."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "You're right. As for what's next, we'll leave it to Lao Wei to decide after he emerges from seclusion. For now, let's continue deepening this technique and refine it. When Lao Wei comes out, we'll report to him.</p><p></p><p>As for this passage we've created, it's still too crude. First, it's too conspicuous, making people suspicious at first glance.  </p><p></p><p>Second, the passage rules are too simplistic. We need to study the passage rules for world passages and formulate regulations."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to the empty central position inside the small world, like a deep trench, "We also need to fill it with soil to make it look more natural."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Hey, it seems my disciples have been too lazy. Not many have learned 'secondary space', let alone 'secondary world'. This time when I return, I need to step up their training in this area. Otherwise, for a project like this, we'd still need Lao Wei's help, which would be too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "Indeed. A few hundred years ago when we were manufacturing that special equipment assembly line together, I already had this idea. Recruiting more disciples now is all the better. As long as their abilities and mindsets meet certain requirements, I don't mind accepting them. These disciples can definitely help us a lot on key projects!"</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly testing the effects, the two returned to their respective bases.</p><p></p><p>As for this passage, Yashan left it to change freely in order to observe the stability of the world passage for subsequent adjustments.</p><p></p><p>And so, the two planets, separated by vast distances in the universe, rotated along their respective orbits, yet the spaces on these planets were mysteriously connected.</p><p></p><p>The rain and snow falling on the yellow-black planet would partially pass through the world passage and land on the blue-gray planet.</p><p></p><p>While meteorites falling on the blue-gray planet would also traverse the world passage and crash onto the yellow-black planet...</p><p></p><p>This is the so-called 'repaying a drop of favor with a meteor strike'.</p>

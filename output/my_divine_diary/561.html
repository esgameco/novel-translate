        <h1>Chapter 561</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xing and Wang only thought Su Hao was joking, and both laughed it off, turning to talk about King Luo's solicitation this time.</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang wanted to be free to go out on missions, while Su Hao wasn't interested in this whatsoever Luo King.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was that this Luo King was actually just a small, insignificant royal family, only in his Mingchuan City could he say something, out of Mingchuan City, nothing.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, it is a monopoly asset, very rich is true.</p><p></p><p>So, in the end, the squad unified their opinion: thank you for King Luo's appreciation, but don't want to leave Huai Shui Town, so they can only endure the pain of refusal, hoping that King Luo can understand.</p><p></p><p>Then all together, they walked towards the Source Mage Association auditorium.</p><p></p><p>President Gu Yin coordinated in the middle and helped them to prepare for the meeting time, so it was just the right time to go over now.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Hao didn't want to go, so why not send a representative?</p><p></p><p>However, Xing thought that King Luo personally came to Huai Shui Town to invite them, which was a sign of respect for them, so the 'Wind Mountain Yang Stargazing Squad' should also reflect the appropriate etiquette, and all of them participated in the meeting, giving the other party the respect they deserved.</p><p></p><p>So it wasn't much of a waste of time, so Su Hao nodded his head in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that if they talked to each other later, they would directly ask that Luo Wang if he had any hidden information that they could borrow at that time.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, it was Yashan who raised his eyebrows and his expression became very strange as he secretly laughed in his heart, ''Letting Boss Wei, a true god, go and meet with the king? Ah Xing still really wants to come up with that. I hope that the king won't be too high-profile, or else I can bury someone again."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't done anything like this in a long time, and his hands were itching.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the meeting hall on the highest level of the Association's auditorium, a heavy, atmospheric stone table was laden with delicate canap√©s.</p><p></p><p>King Luo and Su Hao and the others converged here.</p><p></p><p>"This one beside me is King Luo of Jianxuan, the forty-ninth generation clan of Mingchuan, who was specially appointed in the year 1251 of the New Era, and also serves as the Director of the General Inspectorate of Mingchuan City ......"</p><p></p><p>King Luo's line totaled eight people, each dressed very well, both fancy and dignified, like eight noble roosters, was using a kind of scrutinizing gaze, condescending, surveying this Su Hao five people.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to take a look at what the squad that was worthy of Luo King's personal trip actually looked like and what they were capable of!</p><p></p><p>There were two powerful senior source mages among these eight people, whose strength could be ranked amongst a level like President Gu Yin, in charge of security.</p><p></p><p>Two of them were professional drovers and breeders in the king's mansion, responsible for taking care of the random carriages and horses.</p><p></p><p>There were also two beautiful maids who specialized in taking care of King Luo's life and living.</p><p></p><p>Together with King Luo and the driver, Little Box, there were a total of eight people. Each had an extraordinary aura, revealing nobility inside and out.</p><p></p><p>After President Gu Yin introduced King Luo and the others one by one, he briefly introduced Su Hao and the others.</p><p></p><p>Right at this moment, Luo Wang, who was wearing a bowler hat, slightly wrinkled his noble brows and adjusted his nostrils slightly downwards in an orientation, before looking at Su Hao and the others with sharp eyes.</p><p></p><p>The driver's little box was first-rate at reading words and colors, immediately sensing his own king's displeasure, he hurriedly gave Xing and the others a wink, and solemnly said, "Since we have seen King Luo himself, why don't all the mages quickly come forward to greet him?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang suddenly realized, immediately stepped forward and saluted with both hands on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's three stood back, indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding me, what kind of 7 bar stuff are these, all of them are so arrogant that they still want Su Hao to salute?</p><p></p><p>Yashan had already asked in the group chat at this time, "Boss Wei, should we find a chance to do away with them and forget about it, how dare they look at you with such eyes! I dislike it very much."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately replied, adding fuel to the fire, "I don't like it either, this kind of look is like us looking at rats bred in the lab."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled faintly and replied, "Don't be so fiery, thinking about fighting and killing all day long, after so many years, haven't you learned to be kind to others?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, King Luo turned his gaze to Su Hao's three people, and his frown deepened.</p><p></p><p>The driver's small box said, "You three, why don't you greet Lord Luo Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "King Luo? Oh, see and meet, you guys can just say what you're looking for us to do. I'm usually very busy, so let's finish the conversation as soon as possible, take care of the problem, and then we can each go about our own business."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin and Ah Xing Ah Wang looked at Su Hao in surprise, this kid, he's used to not being big and small, right? How dare he speak like this to a king.</p><p></p><p>The little box froze and immediately jumped up with an angry expression, "Bold, how dare you talk to King Luo like that, why don't you kneel down and apologize?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's brows furrowed, "Can you speak properly?"</p><p></p><p>Aside from Yashan and Feng Cheng, those present roared wildly inwardly, "It's clearly you who didn't speak properly first!"</p><p></p><p>The little box pointed at Su Hao and droned, "Bold unruly people, now forgive you for your ignorance, it's not too late for you to immediately bow and apologize to King Luo, or else you will be sentenced to contempt of the royal family, and will be sure to be imprisoned in the black prison for eternity without seeing the light of day."</p><p></p><p>King Luo looked at Su Hao icily, the corner of his mouth hooked into a smile, and in his heart, he seemed to already be conceptualizing how to concoct Su Hao and the others.</p><p></p><p>However, he acted with great poise, raising his hand to stop the little box from continuing on, and with a smile on his face, he seemed to be unconcerned as he said, "Oh, it's alright, it's very normal for young mages to not have heard of my name. This time the king is here, is heard of the heroic deeds of all mages, very yearning, especially here to sincerely invite you to join the Mingchuan Luo Wangfu, common resistance to all kinds of disasters, in order to protect a side of the civilian population. And all the needs of the mages, this king can fulfill, and from now on become the people's hero, live an unimaginable life ......</p><p></p><p>I wonder what you mages think?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully listened to him finish all his words, and then simply refused, "None of what you said is what I want, so I refuse your invitation."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin's face changed and called out, "Zi Yang ......"</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say something, but nothing could be said. Had she known that Su Hao was so straight and didn't know how to change, he should have informed in advance, now, it was too late to say anything. Her brain turned quickly, thinking of a plan to crack this rigid atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>From Su Hao's words, Luo Wang felt a strong sense of humiliation, as if he was saying that he looked down on everything he could offer, looked down on the Luo Wang House, and looked down on him ......</p><p></p><p>As a Luo King who was so small that he couldn't be any smaller, what he hated the most was when people looked down on him, and the suffocation he had suffered along the way couldn't help but explode at this point.</p><p></p><p>His voice became raw and cold: "You refused so dryly, do you know the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Oh? What consequences?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang revealed his eerie teeth, "You don't want to know, you have to believe that it's not something that a small source mage like you can bear. Therefore, your only choice is to join us."</p><p></p><p>As Xing A Wang sniffed, his face became ugly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that they had thought too well before, that their squad, there was no room for rejection at all, and that if they were looked at, they could only go and be a dog for the nobles.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and said to Luo Wang, "Since you don't want to say it then forget it, there's nothing else going on right now, so I'll leave first!"</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to President Gu Yin and said, "President Gu Yin, it seems like I've messed up your banquet, but I don't like to eat with these people, so let's leave it at that! I'll invite you back next time."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned around and left first.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng showed their teeth and smiled at King Luo and the others, their eyes as cold as if they were looking at a dead person.</p><p></p><p>These people who dared to threaten Boss Wei were dead!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then sent a message to the group, "These people are hopeless, it's better to bury them!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Okay Boss Wei! I'm good at this burying people."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Hehehe, Boss Yashan I'll go with you, I need to learn more too."</p><p></p><p>The direction and speed of the development of things exceeded the imagination of the others, how could they not expect that a good meeting invitation would end up in a stalemate to such an extent that it was near irreparable.</p><p></p><p>A question popped up in Gu Yin's head, "What to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing Ah Wang glanced at each other, gritted his teeth, apologized to President Gu Yin, and followed suit to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yin glanced at Luo Wang and the others and with difficulty revealed a smile, explaining with a grin, "It's all a misunderstanding! Zi Yang grew up in this mountain, he is used to being wild, he doesn't have a concept of respect and inferiority, who would have thought that he would have bumped into His Excellency King Luo today. I still hope that Your Excellency King Luo will not be angry with this child."</p><p></p><p>King Luo took a deep breath before revealing a smile and said, "Of course, it won't."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing and Ah Wang came out after him and cried and even said, "Ah Yang! We're offending the royal family, bad thing!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I didn't realize that Xing, who wasn't even afraid of weird disasters, was afraid of this."</p><p></p><p>Ah Xing shook his head and said, "I also only have one life, death is not enough, but I'm worried about getting back to involve the whole Huai Shui Town ah!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan grinned, "What are you afraid of, you can't even get involved, can they still slaughter the town?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Wang said sullenly, "If they annoy the nobles, they can really do it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said indifferently, "Ah Wang, you're being silly! If you're annoyed, you definitely have to make the first move, right? How can you wait for someone else to make the first move?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Sing Ah Wang were all stunned, "You guys ......"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I didn't say anything, so don't make any wild guesses you two."</p>

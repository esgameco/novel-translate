        <h1>Chapter 935</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong pointed to the distant fog and said, "Double Sword University is ahead, but it's blocked by this fog in front of us, we can't see anything. We need to wait here for twenty minutes. After twenty minutes, a school boat will come to pick us up."</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl tilted her head in confusion, "School boat?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong chuckled foolishly, "I don't know what that is either. My name is Zhu Changdong, what's your name, classmate?"</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl didn't reply, but snorted, "I have my own vehicle, I don't need any school boat to pick me up."</p><p></p><p>She put her helmet back on, revved the throttle, turned to Zhu Changdong and said, "Not a bad ride, want to come?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong was stunned, pointing at the fog, "You're going to charge into it?"</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl: "What else?"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Zhu Changdong's reply, the pink motorcycle roared towards the fog.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, wait for me!" Zhu Changdong immediately put on his helmet and drove his motorcycle to chase after the girl.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why he was chasing her, but he felt that if he didn't, he might regret it for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he didn't like regrets.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong suddenly accelerated, quickly driving side-by-side with the girl. Looking at her dashing figure beside him, he thought to himself, "I think I'm poisoned, poisoned by this girl, but I really like this feeling."</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl also turned her head in surprise, "Why is your motorcycle's acceleration so fast?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong found confidence from this question and shouted back, "Of course, this is a motorcycle I customized myself."</p><p></p><p>"Shoo—shoo—"</p><p></p><p>The two motorcycles charged into the swirling fog one after the other. Amid the surging fog, they disappeared without a trace, leaving only the faint roar of engines that soon faded away completely.</p><p></p><p>The other students on the square also saw the two enter the fog, and they were all itching to follow, but not a single one actually did. They were either stopped by their parents or afraid of being expelled by the school.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had just been admitted, so they had to behave. If they made a huge blunder, they might lose their dating privileges for four years. It wasn't worth taking such a risk for a momentary impulse.</p><p></p><p>After entering the fog, the two found that they could hardly see anything in front of them. The ground was no longer flat but uneven like a barren mountain, with rocks and weeds everywhere, forcing them to slow down.</p><p></p><p>They were daring, but not foolish enough to throw their lives away.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong drove behind the girl, not saying a word, enjoying the pleasure of driving. He found that the girl's riding skills were also quite impressive, skillfully navigating the seemingly complex terrain with deft changes of speed and direction.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong liked her more and more...</p><p></p><p>He could barely hold back from shouting out loud to vent his excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Double joy!"</p><p></p><p>"Roar roar roar—"</p><p></p><p>The motorcycles roared as they suddenly noticed the fog ahead getting brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Did we get through the fog?"</p><p></p><p>With two 'whooshes', the swirling fog parted, and they emerged back into the blue sky.</p><p></p><p>They were out!</p><p></p><p>"This is...the square?"</p><p></p><p>This was indeed the same square as before, with more and more students and parents gathering.</p><p></p><p>The girl looked around, puzzled, "My sense of direction is excellent, there's no way I turned around. Let's go again!"</p><p></p><p>She turned her motorcycle around and drove back into the fog. This time, she became even more focused, carefully identifying the direction. She wanted to keep going deeper into the fog until she passed through it and found Double Sword University.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong grinned and also turned around to follow her into the fog.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two burst out of the fog from another spot onto the square again.</p><p></p><p>Now even Zhu Changdong was amazed. What kind of high-tech trickery was this?</p><p></p><p>Quickly, they emerged from other spots again, leaving the other people on the square dumbfounded: Are these two punks? Don't they know this is a school? How dare they come here and make a ruckus.</p><p></p><p>Three times, four times...</p><p></p><p>Each time they charged out of the fog from a different location. Finally, the girl stopped her motorcycle and turned to look at the fog behind her, astonished, "What's going on? Every time I'm sure I'm going forward, but somehow I end up back here."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong said, "Maybe this is some new technology from Double Sword University. You know their technology is at least ten years ahead of this era, so there's a lot we haven't learned and can't figure out. Haha, that's also why I chose to come to this university."</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl smirked, "I admit they're impressive, but they're all too arrogant, acting like they're invincible and looking down on everyone else. I find that really annoying, so I came here to shake things up. I want to use my knowledge to knock them down a peg."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong was astonished, "This..."</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl tilted her head, "You don't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong: "I believe you came to shake things up, but I don't believe Double Sword University will be knocked down by you."</p><p></p><p>Although he really liked this girl, one shouldn't abandon principles, right?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the dense fog in the sky churned violently, and an overwhelming sense of pressure emanated from within, causing a brief silence to fall over the entire square.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a colossal beast was hidden in the fog, about to burst forth and appear before everyone.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and the girl both sensed it, and couldn't help but look up.</p><p></p><p>The fog parted, revealing a massive silvery-gray metallic object with a sci-fi design that made the boys' blood race with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up, their mouths agape, following the emergence of the gigantic object from the fog with wide-eyed, slack-jawed expressions like they had never seen the world before.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the behemoth fully revealed itself, overshadowing the entire square and surrounding area. The sky above was completely blocked out, casting the square into darkness.</p><p></p><p>This was the very definition of blotting out the sky and sun.</p><p></p><p>It was like a small asteroid looming overhead.</p><p></p><p>The sheer shock of this sight was unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>Was this a conceptual spacecraft?</p><p></p><p>So much for a 'school boat'!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>After the ship hovered to a stop, its flat underside lit up with bright lights, bathing the square in a warm glow.</p><p></p><p>Quite thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong was simply dumbstruck, muttering in disbelief, "This is a spacecraft, right? But...how is this possible, current technology can't possibly have reached this level. And where are the engines? I didn't even hear any engine noise..."</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl took off her helmet, frowning as she examined the ship overhead. She also seemed unable to comprehend it. "This must be an inflatable airship! The metallic look is quite convincing."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, over a hundred elevators descended from the underside of the ship. From each one stepped out an adorable maid, identical in appearance, smiling warmly as she said, "The first 'school boat' of Double Sword University has docked. Please line up in an orderly fashion, hold your admission letters ready, and board the ship. The school boat will depart in ten minutes. The second school boat will arrive in thirty minutes."</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared at the identical-looking maids, utterly shocked once again.</p><p></p><p>They had carefully read the admission guide before coming, but found that reality was completely different from their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Waiting in the square? Shrouded in fog? Picked up by a spacecraft? Served by maids?</p><p></p><p>None of that was mentioned...</p><p></p><p>They never expected this year's admission to be so unusual, catching everyone completely off guard.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong looked at the elevator entrances, then turned to the girl, "I don't know if we can drive our motorcycles in there. Should we go ask?"</p><p></p><p>The motorcycle girl looked towards the fog, put her helmet back on and said, "Nah, you go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>"Roar roar roar—"</p><p></p><p>She started her motorcycle again and charged back into the fog.</p><p></p><p>"Hey?" Zhu Changdong glanced at the elevator entrances, then at the girl disappearing into the fog. Without hesitation, he started his motorcycle and gave chase.</p><p></p><p>Who cares about going to school~</p><p></p><p>"Roar roar roar—"</p><p></p><p>Soon Zhu Changdong caught up with the motorcycle girl, riding alongside her like before.</p><p></p><p>But he noticed something different - this time the girl was driving at an extremely dangerous speed on this rocky, weed-strewn terrain where they could hardly see what was ahead.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but shout, "Hey! Slow down, it's dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>The girl replied, "I'm testing if I can break through this fog with speed. You don't need to follow."</p><p></p><p>With that, she swerved around a large pit and sped forward.</p>

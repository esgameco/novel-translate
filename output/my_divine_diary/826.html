        <h1>Chapter 826</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In this world, humans mainly live on two large continents. One is the Zongguang Continent, which is relatively smaller and belongs to the domain of the God of Eternal Night - Yongshi.</p><p></p><p>The other is called the Varan Continent, much larger than the Zongguang Continent. The main population center belongs to the God of Salvation - Baishen and the God of Resurrection - Zhuxia.</p><p></p><p>The two largest human cities, the 'City of Salvation' and the 'City of Resurrection', are located on the Varan Continent, which is also referred to by humans as the center of the world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the so-called 'center of the world' is not recognized by the dragon race and the mountain spirit race.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone has to admit that these two cities are indeed the most prosperous places in the world.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace of the City of Salvation, the three main human gods and seven subordinate gods, a total of ten deities, gathered to watch the record played by Yongshi.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi had no expression on his face, only saying indifferently: "My severed will that lost contact with Bari still has not given any feedback, most likely having died the moment contact was lost.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, this new god has the ability to instantly kill our wills, the implications of which need not be stated, as the gods here surely understand."</p><p></p><p>The head God of Salvation - Baishen was a ruddy old man with white hair, with a benevolent look that inspired trust, making one feel he was the strongest deity to save the world.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew this was just Baishen's hobby - not only did he impersonate an old man, he would also act as a young girl, loli, mature woman, young boy, weathered uncle, handsome man, old granny, and so on, looking just like whatever he was impersonating.</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation - Baishen coughed lightly and said indifferently: "But for nearly a hundred years, I have not sensed the fluctuation of a new god being born. Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi said: "That is also why Bari called it the 'Secret God' - perhaps its ability is to hide its own tracks."</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation shook his head: "Even for the 'Secret God', it is impossible to leave no trace at all. The burst of soul force when a mortal being transforms into a deity at that instant cannot be concealed."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi said indifferently: "Your doubts are also my doubts, but the fact is that such a powerful crimson golden dragon has suddenly appeared. After discovering this dragon, I have probed it, resulting in the loss of a severed will as you all saw, yet I could not even trace its whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>I am merely conveying these facts to you all, not trying to convince you of anything. How you think about it and act has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>The God of Resurrection - Zhuxia was a handsome young man. Looking at Yongshi, he could not help but laugh lightly.</p><p></p><p>In his understanding, Yongshi usually had hidden intentions when doing things, and would absolutely not come to all the human gods to mention the 'Secret God' for no reason.</p><p></p><p>If he had encountered a newborn deity unknown to others, he would have surely captured and devoured that deity in secret. How could he publicize it?</p><p></p><p>After Yongshi finished speaking, regardless of others' reactions, he closed his eyes and remained silent. He had said what he needed to say; how these gods thought and acted was none of his concern.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a subordinate god called the 'God of Order - Redlight' laughed lightly: "The birth of a new god, what an ancient phrase. It reminds me of the chaotic era in the distant past. Isn't it interesting?"</p><p></p><p>Another subordinate god, the 'God of Bathing Light - Yi' said indifferently: "The chaotic era has never truly passed. The current peace is merely an appearance. Once anyone shows a flaw, they will inevitably be ganged up on and thoroughly annihilated by the other gods, is that not so? Those weak gods, did they not all perish in the distant past?</p><p></p><p>And now, an existence that threatens all of us eighteen gods yet is unknown to us has appeared, breaking the balance we should have.</p><p></p><p>So whether it is human, dragon or mountain spirit, it is something we eighteen gods cannot tolerate."</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation - Baishen stroked his white beard and shook his head: "That may not necessarily be the case. After all, that being is of the dragon race. Our human gods may see it that way, but the two dragon gods may not think there is no room for a nineteenth dragon deity.</p><p></p><p>It is very likely that not only will they not join us in eliminating the nineteenth deity, they may even shelter and protect it. After all, humans and dragons have always been absolutely opposing races."</p><p></p><p>All the gods understood this reasoning. If the nineteenth deity was a human god with great power, they might protect the newborn deity for human supremacy, and then find an opportunity in the future to annihilate the dragon and mountain spirit races...</p><p></p><p>But the newborn deity was a dragon, which was completely different.</p><p></p><p>The God of Resurrection - Zhuxia laughed lightly: "The way to resolve conflicts and problems has always been simple. If there are differing opinions or dissatisfaction, just fight it out. Is this not the meaning of war's existence? The long history of the world has advanced alongside war, has it not? The so-called peace we have now is the fruit of war."</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation smiled: "Indeed. Then let us first consult with the two dragon gods and demand the joint elimination of the nineteenth deity. If they do not comply, we shall ally with the mountain spirit race and launch a full-scale war against the dragon race."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he turned to Yongshi and inquired: "What does Lord Yongshi think?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi revealed a faint smile and said indifferently: "Of course, I will not interfere with your decision, but it is in line with my wishes."</p><p></p><p>After all, even deities have racial divides.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the human gods were discussing how to find the 'new god' and eliminate it, Suhao was feigning sleep to enter the Pinball Space, assisting Xiaoliang in decrypting the consciousness information of the God of Eternal Night - Yongshi and the God of Golden Light - Bari.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was briefly analyzing and summarizing the results from his previous brief contact and battle with the two gods.</p><p></p><p>"First, it can be known that the conditions for these gods to become deities must be extremely harsh, accompanied by a certain element of chance. At the same time, the eighteen gods have some kind of covenant that limits the birth of new deities. Otherwise, it is impossible that so many years have passed with only eighteen gods;</p><p></p><p>Second, judging from the power these gods wield, the purity of their soul force is far higher than those soul guards and soul cultivators. The soul arts they release not only contain a vast amount of information, but even intelligent thoughts, similar to the spirit sense controlling magical treasures in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Third, Yongshi's ability to instantly break through the 'Crispy Skin Defense' and shatter my avatar's head should be the result of cooperating with Bari.</p><p></p><p>The golden light Bari shone on me was actually a kind of intense chaotic information flow with extreme penetrating power, directly interfering with the stable structure of the 'Crispy Skin Defense', causing my protective barrier's defensive power to drop in a straight line. The defenses I had built based on the soul arts of those soul cultivators were almost useless against deities.</p><p></p><p>And almost simultaneously, Yongshi skillfully used a counter-spatial barrier to launch a sneak attack, perfectly releasing his soul force energy in the strongest way, instantly shattering my defenses and completing a precise attack.</p><p></p><p>Soul force, this is almost the most perfect energy I have ever seen. Although its level is much lower than spiritual power, only between spiritual power and physical energy, its perfect ability to carry vast amounts of consciousness information not only makes up for its lower level, making its value perhaps even higher than spiritual power, second only to the source.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, after the two gods self-destructed their souls, they did not leave behind any special material. From the data I collected, their wills transformed into something like photons after soul destruction, combining with other substances and disappearing..."</p><p></p><p>Analyzing point by point, Suhao could not help but exclaim in the end: "Truly an extraordinarily miraculous life form, it is not an exaggeration for them to call themselves deities."</p><p></p><p>This life form surpassed any being Suhao had encountered in all his time, including himself.</p><p></p><p>There was one thing Suhao still did not understand - what exactly were these gods' so-called "severed wills", and how did they exist and interconnect?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be like the 'twin nerves' of the 'Mother Bug' I encountered in my previous life? No, it should not be so. Perhaps it is even more miraculous. Regrettably, I forgot to ask if those two gods' severed wills that entered my small world could still connect with their main bodies.</p><p></p><p>I was negligent, but it does not matter. With so many gods, I can find a few more to ask later.</p><p></p><p>Heh, if I capture the main body, I wonder if these gods who have lived for who knows how many years will still talk so tough and commit soul destruction so readily.</p><p></p><p>Worth looking forward to."</p><p></p><p>Based on Suhao's experience over so many years, if the main body was captured, unless they wholeheartedly sought death or had principles more important than living, these gods' behavior would not be better than ordinary people's.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his analysis, Suhao no longer dwelled on it and focused on decrypting the residual information of the two gods.</p>

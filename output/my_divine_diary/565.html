        <h1>Chapter 565</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After seeing the filth hidden in the city, Su Hao planned that once he completed his primary research work, he would clean up the privileged royal families of the entire world. He may not do a perfect job, but at least those things that made him uncomfortable would disappear from his sight.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, while wandering to Chaonan City, he discovered an interesting group of people massacring the royal palace. After slaughtering the palace, they even established an organization called the 'Glorious Society', planning to overthrow all the royal families in the world.</p><p></p><p>In his view, these people were simply intoxicated by a small victory and had muddled thinking. If they didn't lay low, at most they could accomplish a few big feats before being caught red-handed by the Source Masters Association and easily wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Even he, a formidable Huashen cultivator with unimaginable combat power, didn't dare run amok in this world. It was only recently after mastering the 'Second-Level Space' that he started to become somewhat unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>As for those Source Masters he could easily annihilate, they dared to shout the slogan "Let the light shine upon the land" - their courage was admirable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao had no intention of mocking them. On the contrary, he rather appreciated such people who could grow tenaciously in adversity, not being devoured by darkness, but instead having the light in their hearts shine ever brighter. Such people were rare to find.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he encountered these people that a hint of interest arose in Su Hao's heart: "Perhaps I can use them to help me eliminate those unsightly trash, while also helping me collect corresponding information."</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't met these people, they might have just become a piece of news in a few months. But since he had encountered them now, it was different. With his help, it would not be easy for these people to die.</p><p></p><p>After thinking through the key points, Su Hao transformed into [Fate Child], hid in the 'Second-Level Space', and emerged from the dilapidated house below.</p><p></p><p>However, unexpectedly, these people attacked him without a word.</p><p></p><p>Yet another group incapable of proper communication.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao let them attack for a round, and after they calmed down, he went out to persuade them again. Unexpectedly, their reaction was even greater this time, directly calling two strange Source Masters to attack him.</p><p></p><p>A young girl covered her face with both hands - what was she trying to do? And a young man actually hit his own forehead with a wooden hammer, incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't matter. When dealing with those who couldn't communicate properly, Su Hao was already very experienced.</p><p></p><p>Just beat them all down.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his right hand, and a Vajra armor surged out from the side, gradually forming a small formation disk.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Even more incomprehensible to Su Hao were the high-ponytailed girl Xiaohui and the long-haired man Aming.</p><p></p><p>Because they found that their illusory abilities had no effect on 'Gua Di Pi Zhi Kai'!</p><p></p><p>It was simply unbelievable, the first time such a situation had occurred, leaving them both dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Xiaohui's ability 'Tearless Cry' could make the target feel endless sadness, doubt life, cover their face and weep, without the slightest thought of taking action.</p><p></p><p>Aming's ability was 'Seeing Stars', where if something hit his forehead, he would see stars and become dizzy. Of course, who saw stars was up to him to decide - even if he hit his own forehead, others could see stars. So he always carried a small wooden hammer to activate his ability.</p><p></p><p>The abilities they relied on to run rampant had never failed before! But today they encountered a formidable enemy who could resist their abilities.</p><p></p><p>The gold Source Master frowned and shouted: "Xiaohui, Aming, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Xiaohui and Aming didn't believe it and frantically activated their abilities towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Xiaohui covered her face, crying "wuwuwu", while Aming took the small wooden hammer and frantically struck his own forehead, making "kengkengkeng" crisp sounds like a clock's hammer striking.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how hard they tried, that tall figure showed no signs of being affected.</p><p></p><p>Xiaohui lowered her hands, wiped away her tears and said, "Sister Hejiao, our abilities are ineffective!"</p><p></p><p>Aming also said, "Mine is ineffective too."</p><p></p><p>The gold Source Master Sister Hejiao made a decisive order: "Let's go, we'll leave here first."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, strange Source Masters threw down various flashes, smoke bombs and other obstacles to hinder pursuit, and the group fled while protecting Zhipeng.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled as he watched them retreat in an orderly manner, not giving chase. Instead, he waited for the 'Bewildering Formation' at his side to be set up, then flashed and appeared in front of them.</p><p></p><p>To their horrified gazes, he activated the Bewildering Formation.</p><p></p><p>The 'Twenty-Four Bewildering Formation'!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everyone lost their sense of direction, the world spun, and they lost control of their bodies, falling to the ground and rolling around in a mess. No matter how hard they kicked and struggled, they couldn't stand up, only rolling around wildly, kicking up a cloud of dust from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"So as I said, the Bewildering Formation is most useful. Activate it ten or a hundred times, and basically they'll all calm down."</p><p></p><p>The formation disk in Su Hao's hand did not dissipate, but floated quietly in mid-air, waiting for the others to wake up.</p><p></p><p>The people of this world had far inferior physical and mental strength compared to the cultivation world. Initially, when the Immortal Lord was exposed to it, he could recover in just a few breaths. But it took Zhipeng and the others a full minute to recover.</p><p></p><p>One minute later, Zhipeng and the other ten people finally regained their balance and managed to get up. But before they could speak, the disk in Su Hao's hand released red and blue rays again, shining on them.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhipeng managed to stretch out his five fingers, his nostrils flaring as he shouted, "Friend, stop!"</p><p></p><p>But it was too late. The ten of them fell stiffly to the ground, rolling around like mud. After a moment, they gave up and stopped struggling no matter how the world spun.</p><p></p><p>"Urp--"</p><p></p><p>Someone even vomited from the dizziness.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, Su Hao's keen senses detected a subtle anomaly - just before he activated the Bewildering Formation, all these Source Masters spontaneously moved closer to Zhipeng, as if desperately trying to protect him. But their steps had just started when they were struck by the red and blue rays, tumbling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao have a guess in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the Guild Leader Gu Yin mentioning to him an ability called 'Let's Be Friends' - could it be this person down here?</p><p></p><p>This time, it took even longer to recover - a full two minutes before they gradually regained control of their bodies. Zhipeng opened his mouth, trembling as he tried to speak, but his tongue was tied. He could only watch helplessly as that armored figure aimed the small patterned disk at them again, releasing those terrifying red and blue rays.</p><p></p><p>This was the third time they fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Enduring this endless dizziness, they made up their minds that later, no matter what, they would not get up again. Perhaps if they obediently stayed down, that 'Gua Di Pi Zhi Kai' would stop using those strange rays on them.</p><p></p><p>But they thought too much. To avoid future trouble, Su Hao had decided from the start to activate it ten times first. After ten times, he would see the situation and make another decision. Now he had only activated it three times, how could he stop?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After ten times, Zhipeng and the other ten stared hopelessly at the starry sky, thoroughly losing any will to resist.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after being exposed four or five times, they had already lost the will to resist. If they could control their mouths to speak, they would have begged for mercy long ago.</p><p></p><p>Another ten minutes later, Su Hao still didn't see these cultivators getting up, so he lowered his altitude to observe their condition.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their blank expressions, he couldn't help but ask with concern, "Hey, are you guys okay?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to help these people take down the royal families, not beat them up. These people still had some use.</p><p></p><p>The ten of them were already too exhausted to even sneer inwardly. You did this with your own hands, how could we be okay?</p><p></p><p>But fearing that this 'Gua Di Pi Zhi Kai' might have another fit and expose them again, they had no choice but to reveal an ugly smile in response, indicating they could still smile and the problem wasn't too serious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they no longer constantly thought about fighting, Su Hao showed a satisfied smile: "It seems your tempers have cooled down a bit, not bad! I used to have a friend who I had to expose a hundred times before he calmed down - he was very stubborn."</p><p></p><p>A hundred times!</p><p></p><p>When Zhipeng and the others heard this, their scalps went numb. What kind of formidable person could endure such extreme dizziness for a hundred exposures? Impressive, impressive!</p><p></p><p>After recovering, Zhipeng immediately stopped Sister Hejiao who wanted to speak out. He stood up, bowed to Su Hao, and forced a smile on his scruffy face: "This 'Gua Di Pi Zhi Kai' friend, this is all a misunderstanding. We were too rash before. If we offended you in any way, please forgive us."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Of course, it's a small matter, I don't mind. But I'm not called 'Gua Di Pi Zhi Kai', you can call me Jia Wei."</p><p></p><p>Zhipeng immediately corrected himself: "Mr. Jia Wei, hello. May I ask why you are looking for us?"</p><p></p><p>See, now they could communicate properly? This is what's called the art of communication.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>That faint sound came drifting in from the distance, like the joyful voices of children playing in the willow grove. But why did it send chills down one's spine when heard?</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's hair stood on end, their bodies tensed up motionless, carefully controlling the balloon dummies to walk forward.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao waited with interest for the so-called strange phenomenon to appear.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the thing making the singing sounds came bouncing and hopping right up to the three dummies!</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang's hearts pounded wildly, almost leaping out of their throats. Even Su Hao was dumbstruck - he had imagined many possibilities, but never expected that the things bouncing and hopping up to them would be these creatures.</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>As they ran, they left a trail of fresh blood splatters on the ground, making one's head spin.</p><p></p><p>These 'little cuties' bounced curiously around, under and over the three balloon dummies, leaving bloody footprints behind. Seemingly having had enough fun, they bounced away again.</p><p></p><p>The three stood stock-still, barely daring to breathe until the creatures had completely disappeared from sight. Only then did they let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Awang murmured, "What are those things?"</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head, indicating he didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Weren't we told earlier that the two escaped source masters had all their internal organs missing? Those things might have been what became of them."</p><p></p><p>The thought of his own organs potentially running around happily bouncing in the woods made Axing's head spin.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite possible!"</p><p></p><p>He pondered, uncertain, "This strange disaster is likely related to those creatures. The lethal effect it triggers could very well be digging the organs right out of the abdomen..."</p><p></p><p>Before Axing could finish, they saw a pig's brain strolling by them at a leisurely pace, as if deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang: "......"</p><p></p><p>Axing quickly added, "Brains can run around on their own too!"</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Su Hao understood why people in this world called such calamities 'strange' - wasn't this scene precisely strange and abnormal?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao wondered if his own brain ran off, would [Destiny Child] be able to regrow it...</p><p></p><p>"Probably...not, right?"</p><p></p><p>If the brain was gone, it was gone for good. No matter if [Destiny Child] regrew one itself, it wouldn't be his!</p><p></p><p>In other words...</p><p></p><p>Danger!!!</p><p></p><p>The usual calm feeling of having everything under control had vanished!</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not careful, I could very well be done for!"</p><p></p><p>If he had known the strange disaster would be this horrifying, Su Hao might not have cheerfully run into it.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual feelers immediately latched onto the positioning stone at the temporary base, reassuring him that he could teleport away at any time. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Thankfully, I can teleport away whenever needed, so it's stable! But Axing and Awang are still here, so unless absolutely necessary, I shouldn't just run off!"</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since Su Hao last encountered anything that threatened his life.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had run into one so soon after being reborn into this world.</p><p></p><p>Just as Axing said, resolving strange disasters required not just strength, but intelligence and luck were the real keys to solving the problem.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took a deep breath, thinking to himself: "I can't approach this with a casual attitude anymore, or who knows how I'll end up dying. Time to get serious!"</p><p></p><p>He turned and asked, "Axing, have you found anything?"</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head. "No, but I suspect that if we accidentally trigger the strange disaster, our internal organs will jump out on their own. It could be one organ, it could be all of them, but either way, it would be fatal. So we absolutely, absolutely must not trigger the strange disaster!"</p><p></p><p>This matched Su Hao's guess quite closely. He then asked, "Axing, does the strange disaster only affect living things? Or can it also affect inanimate objects?"</p><p></p><p>"It depends on the category - some make no distinction between living and non-living."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao gazed thoughtfully at the willow grove around them.</p><p></p><p>Awang asked softly, "What should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Axing pondered for a moment. "Let's head further in and take a look around first, try to find the source squad that went in earlier. Only by getting more information can we make a proper judgment."</p><p></p><p>The three had only just entered, so they didn't understand much about this willow grove yet. To find the key, they had to venture deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>"Proceed with utmost caution, maintain the same pace as before!"</p><p></p><p>The three set off again, slowly making their way deeper into the willow grove.</p><p></p><p>.....</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao was pondering, Little Light notified him that the comparative analysis was complete.</p><p></p><p>He turned his attention inward to the Pinball Realm to examine the results, and soon made a discovery: "What I'm perceiving doesn't match reality!"</p><p></p><p>After carefully comparing, he found that most of the scenes were not what his eyes saw, but rather imagined by his own brain. A hunch began to form: "In fact, our brains were already being interfered with by the strange disaster as we approached Willow Mountain. The closer we got, the stronger the interference became. Everything we see and hear is vastly different from reality.</p><p></p><p>"This deceptive method is quite ingenious - it doesn't simply implant a complete scene into one's mind. Instead, through a special realistic structure and mental interference, it causes people to imagine the scene themselves. The principle behind it...is similar to the brain's color constancy, but even more complex."</p><p></p><p>By comparing the consciousness information in the Pinball Realm before and after, he could detect the subtle differences and see through this hallucinatory effect. But he didn't know if the people of this world understood why this was happening.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked softly, "Axing, do all strange disasters create a maze-like illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Axing replied, "No, only some strange disasters can trap people inside. The ones that can imprison people are always extremely troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately judged that this visual deception was likely just an incidental domain effect of the strange disaster, akin to being randomly generated.</p><p></p><p>If a mere side effect was this powerful, one could only imagine how formidable the true strange disaster must be!</p><p></p><p>It was not to be taken lightly!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Su Hao suddenly said, "Axing, it seems there's someone over to the right. Shall we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang couldn't help but look in the direction Su Hao indicated. Aheng's perception was still so extraordinarily keen!</p><p></p><p>The balloon dummies led the way as the three slowly made their way over. After walking for about two hours, they faintly heard the sound of anguished cries.</p><p></p><p>They didn't rush, maintaining their sluggish pace.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they saw a few organs come bouncing and hopping by, shouting loudly: "Run, run! She's catching up!"</p><p></p><p>A long, worm-like thing came chasing after, straining to keep up. "Wait for me! Don't leave me behind!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they watched the 'little cuties' disappear into the distance, a disheveled figure came stumbling out, chasing after the organs.</p><p></p><p>It was a short-haired man wearing simple armor, his hair and clothes in disarray. He clutched a short spike tightly in one hand, tears streaming down his face as he cried out desperately, "Don't run away! Come back, please! I beg you, if you don't come back we're all doomed..."</p><p></p><p>Sobbing, he collapsed to the ground, but didn't give up, struggling to crawl back up to search for the escaped organs.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he soon spotted the three balloon dummies standing nearby. As if grasping at a last hope, he crawled towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, save me," he pleaded as he crawled. "I'm a source master from the Hongao Squad. Save my life, and I'll give you all my source gems, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>The three hidden observers remained silent for a moment before Axing spoke up first, "What happened? How can we save you?"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man immediately looked over, recognizing they were just dummies. He eagerly crawled towards them, eyes full of delight. "Help me chase down my liver, kidneys and stomach! If I can get them back and put them inside, I'll live! But I'm getting weaker, I can't catch up anymore..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, his mouth suddenly gaped open wide.</p><p></p><p>A scream erupted from his mouth: "So scared, don't hit me!"</p><p></p><p>Then a red blur shot out of his mouth, shrieking as it ran off: "Run, run!"</p><p></p><p>They looked closely and saw it was a heart with arms and legs.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man reached out desperately towards his fleeing organ. "Help me, please, I beg you!"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't over - his right arm began violently convulsing, and a bloody muscle burst shrieking from his mouth and ran away.</p><p></p><p>Now he couldn't even lift his right hand anymore.</p><p></p><p>The three inwardly recoiled in shock, never expecting that even muscles could run off.</p><p></p><p>Thinking quickly, Su Hao pointed towards the fleeing heart in the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the panicked, fleeing heart vanished from its spot and reappeared right next to the short-haired man, bouncing off his body before rebounding back.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly reminded him, "Hey you, that's your heart! Better grab it quick before it runs off again!"</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man snapped to his senses and snatched the heart with his left hand, clutching it tightly.</p><p></p><p>Having reclaimed his heart, he grew excited!</p><p></p><p>But the heart struggled frantically in his grip, shrieking in terror, "So scared! Help me!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 676</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The command center thought Su Hao was making a strategic maneuver at first, so they didn't think much of it. After all, they couldn't understand the thinking of a fighter jet genius.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, Su Hao's direction remained unchanged. Apart from dodging incoming attacks, he just flew straight towards the enemy's warship.</p><p></p><p>The people in the command room looked at each other, thinking Su Hao must have gone crazy.</p><p></p><p>A fighter jet's main cannon could threaten ships, but the threat was very limited. To be effective, hundreds of fighter jets would need to act together.</p><p></p><p>How could this lone fighter jet do anything by charging towards the enemy warship?</p><p></p><p>The captain suddenly turned to the official named Jiang: "Is this your soldier? Why don't you get on the line and ask him what he's trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>They all knew it wasn't ideal to communicate during combat, but seeing how at ease Su Hao looked, he probably wouldn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Official Jiang immediately replied: "Received!"</p><p></p><p>Then the communicator directly locked onto Su Hao's fighter jet for voice communication.</p><p></p><p>But no one answered. The communicator looked up and said: "Xu Shiqiang hung up!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p><p></p><p>The captain glanced at the trajectory of the Yaoxing ship. There was still some time before it could successfully change course, so he said: "Never mind him, keep an eye on the warship in case the enemy suddenly attacks."</p><p></p><p>The Yaoxing's mobility was far inferior to the raiding warship, leaving it in a passive position unable to take the offensive. It could only wait passively for the enemy warship to approach.</p><p></p><p>This was the captain's helplessness, but it didn't mean the Yaoxing was sure to lose.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Xiao Chang followed Su Hao for a while, but soon realized his direction seemed off.</p><p></p><p>Yan tried to get through to Su Hao to ask what was going on, but it showed he was offline......</p><p></p><p>He immediately turned back to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang curiously asked: "Captain, why aren't we following him?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan cursed: "Follow him? Who knows if that kid Daqiang is deaf again! If we follow behind and he gets into trouble, we'll be done for too!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chang said: "That makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan locked onto an enemy octopus fighter: "Let's go, you and I will work together to take down those octopus freaks!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes captain!"</p><p></p><p>In the command room of the Octopus Clan's warship, they also observed Su Hao's approach. The camera switched to him, but they showed no panic, only amused guesses about Su Hao's intentions, sneering derisively.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan quickly responded by dispatching over ten octopus fighters to intercept and surround him. At the same time, the warship's main cannon rotated and slowly locked onto Su Hao's fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>It felt like using an anti-aircraft gun to swat a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also noticed the warship's movements, but remained completely calm. If they could hit him, he would concede defeat. Not to mention predicting the projectile trajectory, even if he didn't move at all, the main cannon couldn't possibly hit his small fighter jet!</p><p></p><p>He could still completely envelop it with his space abilities that he had perfected through years of research.</p><p></p><p>Before the warship's main cannon acted, over ten octopus fighters came to intercept first.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao just glanced at them, maneuvering his fighter jet in a large S-shaped trajectory, causing the octopus fighters to explode one by one along the way.</p><p></p><p>A single fighter jet, yet he made it look like an 'invincible master flashing through enemies for an instant kill'.</p><p></p><p>In the command room of the raiding warship, the tall Octopus Clan members' eyes bulged in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They had missed Su Hao's first display of superhuman ability, so this was their first time witnessing such an invincible piloting skill, almost popping their eyes out.</p><p></p><p>Their first thought was: Did the humans develop a new type of fighter jet?</p><p></p><p>Soon after, all the large and small energy cannons on the warship opened fire on Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Numerous beams of light shot out from the warship, crisscrossing in a way that seemed impossible to evade.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Su Hao couldn't actually evade the warship's intersecting main cannon fire due to the fighter jet's performance limitations.</p><p></p><p>So under everyone's watch, Su Hao's fighter jet was engulfed by the various energy beams.</p><p></p><p>In the Yaoxing command center:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Hao's fighter jet engulfed, everyone was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The captain slammed his fist hard on the table, making a dull sound. He glared at Official Jiang: "Did you give that order?"</p><p></p><p>Official Jiang: "......"</p><p></p><p>He was speechless.</p><p></p><p>In the Octopus Clan's warship command room, the Octopus members showed faint smiles.</p><p></p><p>No matter how skilled the pilot, everything would turn to dust under their firepower.</p><p></p><p>But their smiles soon froze.</p><p></p><p>As the beams dispersed, instead of the expected shattered remains of that ordinary fighter jet, it maintained its original flight trajectory towards their warship, seemingly completely unscathed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the barrage just now wasn't an attack, but merely shining some light on the fighter jet.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is that?"</p><p></p><p>Not only were the Octopus Clan stunned, but the captain and others were stunned too.</p><p></p><p>This outcome clearly exceeded their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Someone wondered: "Didn't that barrage hit? He must have dodged it!"</p><p></p><p>"How could he dodge that?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other: Who knows how he dodged!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After confirming the enemy's energy beams couldn't penetrate his spatial barrier, Su Hao felt relieved and maneuvered his fighter jet at full speed.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, he arrived near the enemy warship.</p><p></p><p>At this point in the battle, both sides' attention was involuntarily focused on Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>They all wanted to see what Su Hao planned to do......</p><p></p><p>From the human side, they inwardly hoped Su Hao could do something, not necessarily amazing, just annoying the Octopus Clan would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Some even imagined Su Hao docking his fighter jet on the warship's hull, then jumping out to pee on the warship.</p><p></p><p>'Peeing on it isn't impossible......'</p><p></p><p>But the Octopus Clan's feelings were far more complicated. Those ten minutes felt unbearably long for them.</p><p></p><p>The octopus fighters sent to intercept were all blown up.  </p><p></p><p>The warship's main cannon fire somehow completely missed.</p><p></p><p>Various guided missile attacks were also easily evaded.</p><p></p><p>Other fighter jets sent to intercept fared even worse than the octopus fighters.</p><p></p><p>Accelerating to break away from this fighter jet? The warship's massive weight required enough time to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>How were they supposed to deal with this......</p><p></p><p>They even had the terrifying guess: This must be a new human weapon.</p><p></p><p>However, they weren't too worried. The "raiding warship" title wasn't just for show - its hull was extremely sturdy, not something a small fighter jet's main cannon could break through.</p><p></p><p>So what if the enemy made a fuss outside the warship?</p><p></p><p>Once their energy was depleted, they would naturally choose to leave.</p><p></p><p>As long as they destroyed the human's main ship, what could a single fighter jet without resupply do in the vast universe, no matter how powerful?</p><p></p><p>In summary, this mysterious and formidable fighter jet couldn't affect the bigger situation!</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what others thought, Su Hao's idea was simple: destroy the warship, eliminate the threat, and gain more time to develop.</p><p></p><p>He maneuvered his fighter jet around the warship, firing a few shots to test for weak points, but couldn't find any.</p><p></p><p>Then he stopped looking.</p><p></p><p>"Since I can't damage the warship, I'll just attack the octopus freaks controlling it. If those operating the warship die, the result should be the same!"</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Su Hao swept his radar to detect life signatures inside, then turned several mounted energy cannons......</p><p></p><p>'Fire!'</p><p></p><p>In the Octopus Clan's warship command room, all the Octopus members curiously watched Su Hao's futile attack, seeing it as no more damaging than peeing on the hull.</p><p></p><p>But before they could figure out what was happening, various warning lights started flashing in the command room.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Clan instantly realized the warship was under attack.</p><p></p><p>"Where?"</p><p></p><p>But soon, they didn't need to wonder where it was attacked.</p><p></p><p>Because a massive amount of projectiles suddenly appeared in the command room, ravaging everything.</p><p></p><p>"Biu biu biu~"</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>"Pu pu pu--"</p><p></p><p>Every single Octopus member present was shot into pieces by the suddenly appearing energy blasts, their blue juices splattering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The few Octopus members still barely alive just had one thought in their confused minds: "???"</p>

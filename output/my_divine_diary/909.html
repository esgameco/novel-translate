        <h1>Chapter 909</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later, perceiving the extremely stable cosmic waves, Su Hao was struck by a whim and decided to go out and see how those dimensional travelers were faring nowadays.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the Crossroads Star, he found that the Cong siblings were leading a dozen or so fairly powerful people in launching another challenge against the Great Demon King Chipu.</p><p></p><p>That battle was earth-shattering, the sun and moon were obscured, islands were destroyed and seas churned...</p><p></p><p>The Cong siblings and their group, who had thought they could easily defeat the Great Demon King Chipu, fled in disarray amidst his manic laughter.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mountains remain, there will be firewood to burn.</p><p></p><p>But who could tell the siblings why the Great Demon King Chipu had become even more powerful? Moreover, his rate of gaining strength was no less than theirs. Had the Great Demon King intended to kill them, they might have been beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a few years, yet another island had vanished...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Great Demon King Chipu grew stronger by encountering powerful foes?</p><p></p><p>One by one, they recalled the intense scenes from the recent battle, taking identical healing potions from their personal spaces and guzzling them down frantically.</p><p></p><p>So the question was, where did those healing potions come from? They were redeemed from the mall.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling asked Cong Renfei in a hushed voice, "Did you redeem those healing potions for them?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei shook his head, "I thought you redeemed them."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the siblings realized something and looked at their disciples with an inexplicable gaze.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional travelers in Hyde Town were acquainted, having spent quite some time there initially. They had suspected each other before, but never confirmed it.</p><p></p><p>After taking the Twin Gods as their masters, they immediately understood each other's identities but tacitly chose not to expose them.</p><p></p><p>And so it remained for twenty years.</p><p></p><p>What the dimensional travelers did not expect, however, was that their own masters, the Twin Gods, were also dimensional travelers...</p><p></p><p>The disciples' gazes towards the siblings also turned inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng felt a bit dazed, "Suddenly it feels like the whole world is filled with dimensional travelers..."</p><p></p><p>The six non-dimensional traveler disciples were completely baffled, their minds full of doubts: "Why is the atmosphere so oppressive and gloomy? What's wrong with the master brothers and sisters? Is it the dejection from being defeated by the Great Demon King Chipu? But it shouldn't be this bizarre, and the masters..."</p><p></p><p>They had tried but found they could never learn cultivation, yet through their spiritual power, they had embarked on a different path and become quite formidable. However, among the group of dimensional travelers, they naturally paled in comparison, which plunged these six into deep self-doubt and insecurity.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling pondered for a moment, then attempted to send party invitations to her disciples through the system.</p><p></p><p>"Sent successfully, awaiting reply!"</p><p>"Sent successfully, awaiting reply!" </p><p>"Sent successfully, awaiting reply!"</p><p>...</p><p>"Send failed!"</p><p>"Send failed!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten successful sends, six failed sends.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling was speechless, then enlightened, "So the party function can also confirm whether the other person is a system host or not, I see..."</p><p></p><p>"Tali Gade has sent you a party invitation. Do you accept?"</p><p></p><p>The dimensional traveler disciples were also dumbfounded upon seeing this system prompt.</p><p></p><p>"What? We can form parties? Do quests and share rewards?"</p><p></p><p>Not only Cong Shuling and the others were dumbstruck, but also the eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>After Cong Shuling's second failed battle against the Great Demon King Chipu, they all froze, exchanging glances but unable to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Barry muttered, "I have a feeling something is amiss."</p><p></p><p>The deities suddenly turned to the Bathing God Yi with unfriendly looks, "Could it be that you're behind this trickery, Lord Yi? You're always the one who enjoys pulling these deceitful stunts."</p><p></p><p>Yi immediately shook his head, "It's not me, I have nothing to do with it. Don't make baseless accusations."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chuckled lightly, "One hundred dimensional travelers, now only ten remain. Not bad, these ten who have survived must possess extraordinary qualities. I shall label them as 'cultivable' and transfer them to another reincarnation station. If they die later and conditions permit, I can give them another chance."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the operation was complete. He then left the Crossroads Star, "Let me see how the dimensional travelers on the other reformed planets are faring."</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the Elven Planet, Su Hao was greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>From the forests came a chorus of wailing howls:</p><p></p><p>"Grasping the vines of love"</p><p>"Listen to me howl~~~howl~~~"</p><p></p><p>From elsewhere also came orderly howling, "Howl~~"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire forest resounded with the hypnotic melodies howled by elves, startling many birds into flight.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Had they been assimilated? To this extent...</p><p></p><p>After carefully tracking, Su Hao discovered that this person had become the Elven King, donning regal yet wild garments as he led a troupe of lithe elves patrolling their forest domain.</p><p></p><p>The other dimensional traveler on this planet had not perished either and was thriving, leading another elven tribe out of the forest onto the vast plains to begin expansion.</p><p></p><p>"Both are talents. If they are still alive and well after fifty years, I shall have Yashan take them as disciples and formally guide them onto the path of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao visited the world of the beastmen to search for those two dimensional travelers, but regrettably, only one remained.</p><p></p><p>"For the tribe!"</p><p></p><p>An exceptionally muscular beastman in ornate armor swung his massive hammer forward.</p><p></p><p>"Roar——"</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom~"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a stirring drumbeat that made one's blood boil, a horde of beastmen charged towards the alien race.</p><p></p><p>The beastman's eyes shone with excitement as he clenched his fist forward and snarled, "It won't be long before I become the king of this world! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, two alluring female beastmen sidled up to him. He pulled them into an embrace, laughing heartily.</p><p></p><p>But no one could see the sorrow in his eyes. He muttered, "I'll make do somehow!"</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this, Su Hao actually felt a tinge of pity, "This one is quite pitiful indeed."</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if he could persevere until fifty years later, Su Hao would have Yashan take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>As for why Yashan and not Feng Cheng, Su Hao pondered that since Feng Cheng already had the Twin Sword Sect on the Crossroads Star, he would give Yashan the dimensional travelers from the reformed planets, perhaps establishing another Infinite Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, Su Hao merely smiled, "We'll see what fate has in store!"</p><p></p><p>He then visited the other planets to inspect the conditions, finding that of the original two hundred people, only eighty remained. However, these eighty survivors were all doing well on their respective planets, with the worst among them being a regional king.</p><p></p><p>This number far exceeded that of the Crossroads Star.</p><p></p><p>The environment on the reformed planets was clearly much harsher, yet the survival rate was higher compared to the Crossroads Star.</p><p></p><p>Reality is always full of contrasts.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stroked his chin and mused, "The pace of civilization's development has indeed accelerated under the influence of the dimensional travelers, just as I had envisioned. The dimensional travelers would subconsciously guide civilization in the same direction with their knowledge.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the current trajectory, although these reformed planets with dispatched dimensional travelers are progressing in the same direction, without exception, they will all retain the original characteristics of their races.</p><p></p><p>And in this evolution of civilization, environmental factors play a greater role than the dimensional travelers. The dimensional travelers may only serve as a catalyst for advancing civilization, without affecting the overall characteristics of the world's civilization.</p><p></p><p>In other words, my act of dispatching a few scattered dimensional travelers to these reformed planets did not actually have much impact and would not influence the final outcome of civilization. Even if they were temporarily steered in the same direction, after the dimensional travelers died or were taken away by Yashan, it would take no more than a century for the planets to revert to their original trajectories under the influence of their environments."</p><p></p><p>With this realization, Su Hao immediately set out for other planets that had not received any dimensional travelers and selected them in order for dispatch.</p><p></p><p>After completing this task, Su Hao drifted in the vast expanse of space, silently gazing at the distant stars and murmuring, "The seeds have been planted, and now I await their germination and growth. Soon, very soon, I shall reap the fruits I desire."</p>

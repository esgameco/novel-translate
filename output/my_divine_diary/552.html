        <h1>Chapter 552</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In these past two years, Suhao's greatest gain, apart from breaking through to the Divine Realm and obtaining the extremely powerful 'divine consciousness', was successfully experimenting on the origin device and gaining some understanding of the manifestations of origin.</p><p></p><p>This was of tremendous significance for his later research on origin.</p><p></p><p>These manifestations can be summarized into three points:</p><p></p><p>The second, in the 'origin field', materials of any kind have an extremely small probability of being affected by the origin field, thereby transforming into a temporarily unobservable thing, suspected to be 'origin';</p><p></p><p>Through constant analysis and experimentation during this period, Suhao believed that the thing materials transform into in the 'origin field' was highly likely to be origin.</p><p></p><p>Because if these origin devices could transform materials into origin, then everything he saw in this world would make sense.</p><p></p><p>'Under the action of some special force, an object underwent an essential change, beginning to release the origin field around it. After a period of radiation, the surrounding things were affected by the origin field, becoming unstable and tending to transform into origin. Under some special connection, they combined together, forming the nucleus that constitutes a disaster, and one day accumulating to a certain degree, suddenly erupting...'</p><p></p><p>So in this process, there are two key points. One is the force that can change the essence of an object and release the origin field. The other is how the origin field transforms materials into origin.</p><p></p><p>As long as he figures out these two key points, Suhao will not be far from mastering origin.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise is that Suhao's guess is correct: the thing that materials transform into is origin.</p><p></p><p>However, he did have sufficient confidence in his guess.</p><p></p><p>He came to the experiment table, cleaned and arranged everything, and took out a low-quality origin pearl, grasping it in his palm.</p><p></p><p>With eyes slightly closed, he cleared his mind of distractions and quickly entered meditation.</p><p></p><p>His divine consciousness converged, no longer paying attention to surrounding things, but instead focusing all his attention on the origin pearl.</p><p></p><p>"Hu~" It was as if a voice penetrating some barrier reached the depths of his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Suhao seemed to have transcended time and space, arriving in another pure white world.</p><p></p><p>This was...the interior of the origin pearl!</p><p></p><p>"What is...this?"</p><p></p><p>Using divine consciousness to perceive the true form of origin, and using spiritual power to perceive the attribute tendencies of origin, were completely different sensations.</p><p></p><p>A wondrous feeling never experienced before surged in Suhao's heart, leaving him utterly amazed.</p><p></p><p>This place was filled with a pure white color, no light or shadows, no gaps, as if something indeed existed, yet also as if nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Like air, yet like water, omnipresent, filling this miraculous space.</p><p></p><p>But completely unlike air or water.</p><p></p><p>No matter how tightly packed air and water seemed, there were still gaps.</p><p></p><p>But the 'origin' perceived by Suhao's divine consciousness had no gaps at all, not a single one.</p><p></p><p>The mere fact of having no gaps already exceeded Suhao's understanding.</p><p></p><p>When 'divine consciousness' was fully focused on an object, the scene observed must be the microscopic world. He could even directly observe molecular and atomic structures, as well as the gaps between atoms. Using divine consciousness to observe the microscopic world of an object was like entering a new universe.</p><p></p><p>Before observing origin, everything Suhao observed with divine consciousness, without exception, all had gaps, big or small. For a long time, this had been Suhao's 'truth'.</p><p></p><p>Until today, after observing 'origin', another truth was shattered!</p><p></p><p>An amazing discovery for Suhao: origin has no gaps!</p><p></p><p>No matter how much Suhao magnified origin, what he saw magnified was still pure white, without the slightest change.</p><p></p><p>But how was this possible?</p><p></p><p>It was as if...the opposite of space!</p><p></p><p>What he perceived with 'divine consciousness' had no gaps, only space. No matter how much space was magnified, it remained continuous without gaps! Even his 'teleportation' utilized the 'duality' of space, rather than squeezing through a gap in space.</p><p></p><p>After continuously magnifying his perception, Suhao decided to try checking if there was an issue with his divine consciousness: "Let me try with other objects."</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his divine consciousness perception from the origin pearl, casually grabbed a common stone, and then focused his divine consciousness on magnifying the microscopic world within the stone.</p><p></p><p>He soon saw another 'universe of stars', confirming that his divine consciousness perception was working properly and could indeed perceive the microscopic world.</p><p></p><p>Suhao muttered: "So origin really has no gaps?"</p><p></p><p>He then again focused all his perceptive power within the origin pearl, and as before, it was a pure expanse of white without gaps.</p><p></p><p>"The perception is correct, so origin is a special continuous thing without gaps. Then, let me see the difference between a high-quality and low-quality origin pearl."</p><p></p><p>The amount of origin contained in a high-quality origin pearl was many times higher than a low-quality one, so he should be able to clearly perceive the difference between them.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed a brighter glowing origin pearl. His divine consciousness focused its perception, and in a flash he arrived in a pure white world.</p><p></p><p>How could he describe this feeling of pure white?</p><p></p><p>Was there even a color called 'deep white'? He didn't know if there was such a color, but in terms of divine consciousness perception, that was the special feeling.</p><p></p><p>If one insisted on analyzing it from a physical perspective, it could be expressed as the 'density' of the high-quality origin pearl being greater than the low-quality one within the same unit of space!</p><p></p><p>"Truly an extraordinary thing, without density, yet different quantities can be evenly distributed within the same size space. How is this achieved? Following this line of thought, can it be said that all origin can be infinitely compressed into the same origin pearl?"</p><p></p><p>He repeatedly examined the two origin pearls of different qualities, finding it more and more interesting.</p><p></p><p>Having just begun researching origin, he had already made such a major discovery, filling him with even greater anticipation for the research ahead.</p><p></p><p>Suhao put away the two origin pearls, flashing to the sea around the small island and casting a spell to stably float in midair.</p><p></p><p>Next, he wanted to try observing the changes origin undergoes when an origin mage casts spells.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power entered the low-quality origin pearl.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible booming sound crashed onto the spiritual power, bringing an immense oppressive force.</p><p></p><p>The origin perceived by the spiritual power that entered the origin pearl took on another appearance, a suppressed ferocity, as if containing enough energy to tear apart the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>With his divine consciousness fully focused, he skillfully guided a wisp of origin out, transforming it into a semi-explosive state at the slowest pace, completing the preparation before spell release.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that an excited look appeared on Suhao's face: "I sensed it, the transformation process of origin...truly wondrous, truly astounding!"</p><p></p><p>The origin guided out, under the stimulation of Suhao's spiritual power, tended towards an explosive state. This process seemed brief but was actually quite lengthy in the microscopic world perceived by divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The transformation process was not complex. Observed by divine consciousness, it was exposed without concealment.</p><p></p><p>To describe it in two words: 'fracturing'!</p><p></p><p>The final number of fragments could be represented by an exponential expression with base 2.</p><p></p><p>With each split, a certain amount of energy was released inwards. In theory, infinite splitting would release infinite energy. Once the energy reached a certain level, it would completely erupt in a violent explosion.</p><p></p><p>And this was the explosive origin spell of blast-type origin mages.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually flicked his finger, sending the semi-explosive origin into the sea for a tremendous explosion, making the seawater churn and splash, many fish floating upside down to the surface.</p><p></p><p>"That spell release process, I can understand it as transforming origin into pure energy! Indeed, there is some reason this world divides origin mages into 'energy', 'material' and 'illusion' types. Energy, matter, origin..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao gradually fell into contemplation. After a long while, he let out a long breath and looked at the faintly glowing origin pearl in his hand, muttering: "It seems I understand what origin is!"</p><p></p><p>This is incredible...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 732</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, the Eight-Armed Race gathered the forces from all the colonial planets in the Cloud Ring System and formed a massive fleet to advance towards the Blue Light Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of warships surrounded the Blue Light System...</p><p></p><p>This showed the Eight-Armed Race's determination to eliminate humanity, which was simply insane. It was clear that after the previous incident, they truly felt threatened by humans and panicked completely.</p><p></p><p>This force poured cold water on the rising humans.</p><p></p><p>Even the Compound Eye Race disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Despite facing such a force, even Su Hao could not help but feel daunted.</p><p></p><p>He was not worried about dozens or hundreds of motherships bombarding Blue Light with nova cannons. He could stay on Blue Light, point at them one by one, and quickly clean them up.</p><p></p><p>But in the case of millions of motherships firing simultaneously, no matter how many hands Su Hao had, he could not block them all.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentals like this could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Destruction was easy, but protection was difficult...</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao also had a good solution - creating an extremely massive small world to envelop Blue Light entirely, evading the nova cannon attacks. Or unfurling an enormously large "counter-spatial barrier" to wrap around Blue Light...</p><p></p><p>But that was just imagination. The problem was Su Hao could not achieve that level.</p><p></p><p>From the cosmic perspective, Su Hao was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, humanity had already considered this situation and made preparations ten years in advance.</p><p></p><p>They had covertly set up many disguised "energy burst waves" in key areas of outer space around the Blue Light Galaxy to protect the entire region inside and a certain range outside the Blue Light System.</p><p></p><p>This area became an absolute forbidden zone for any Eight-Armed Race warship.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Eight-Armed Race did not recognize this. A large number of warships entered, and when they reached what they thought was a safe range, they immediately aimed their nova cannons at Blue Light and started the firing sequence.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Eight-Armed Race, their orthodox status was being seriously provoked!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be them, the Eight-Armed Race, who would die in a few years.</p><p></p><p>Then, the vast majority of warships that entered a certain range simultaneously turned into cosmic fireworks and shattered apart.</p><p></p><p>Only some warships that the "energy burst waves" could not cover managed to survive by luck.</p><p></p><p>The survivors were about a thousand large fleets, meaning the Eight-Armed Race still had the ability to simultaneously fire over a thousand nova cannons.</p><p></p><p>It still seemed terrifying, but it was within Su Hao's ability to handle.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao could rapidly construct "decay cannons" - it only took five or six seconds for him to obtain an energy projectile specialized in destroying nova cannons. Even if two thousand nova cannons fired simultaneously, he could deal with them one by one.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the human side transported a massive number of small warships through transmission arrays, charging at full speed towards the remaining Eight-Armed Race warships.</p><p></p><p>These warships were all loaded with high-powered "energy burst waves". As long as they entered a certain range, they could destroy all the Eight-Armed Race warships.</p><p></p><p>The plan proceeded smoothly, leaving the Eight-Armed Race no opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After a few months of battle, the Eight-Armed Race's remaining warships quietly retreated. They clearly realized that relying solely on the number of warships was no longer enough to defeat humanity.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, they had failed in their frontal attacks on Blue Light twice, and they did not know where they had failed or what technology humans were using...</p><p></p><p>How could they use more advanced technology to defeat humans?</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a report was sent to the Eight-Armed Race's homeworld "Houyan".</p><p></p><p>The report stated that a "Compound Eye" had extremely powerful scanning abilities that could be used to obtain human technology.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a plan was formed to organize one hundred large fleets to attack the Compound Eye planet and capture Compound Eyes.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>This matter almost scared the Compound Eye Race to the point of wetting themselves.</p><p></p><p>They had personally witnessed how the Eight-Armed Race dealt with humans.</p><p></p><p>Just because humans could miraculously endure it did not mean the Compound Eye Race had that strength.</p><p></p><p>They would be helpless even if just one large fleet came after them, let alone one hundred.</p><p></p><p>What should they do?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It so happened that Su Hao heard about this and his eyes lit up. What a fortuitous opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Good, Great Elder."</p><p></p><p>After ten years, Su Hao's research on the Mother Worm had deepened. As of now, he had basically completed the analysis of "twin worm eggs" and could stably obtain a large number of entangled particles.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he would be able to turn his attention to studying the secrets of the Compound Eye Race.</p><p></p><p>The principle of entanglement was simple; the difficulty lay in obtaining a vast quantity of stable entangled matter.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao had been doing for the past decade or so was researching methods to obtain large and stable amounts of entangled matter.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had tried to directly construct a screening structure similar to the Mother Worm's "twin worm eggs" using formations or spiritual power, but he found that building a structure as complex as life itself was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>It required an immense amount of effort, and success was not guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>This was the so-called situation where the principle was clear, but realizing it was not easy.</p><p></p><p>After countless failures, at a certain moment, a flash of inspiration struck Su Hao's mind, leading to a new approach: since "spiritual power" could not solve the problem of biological structures, then use "biology" to solve the problem of biological structures.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao began experimenting on the [Insect God], constantly modifying its genes by referring to the Mother Worm. After a few years, he finally obtained a large amount of "entangled matter" within the [Insect God].</p><p></p><p>He could even modify the genes of other lifeforms, including himself, to obtain large amounts of "entangled matter".</p><p></p><p>If needed, he did not mind modifying himself.</p><p></p><p>This was not about turning himself into an insect. Essentially, it was similar to the various talents he already possessed, except that he could gain new "entangled talents".</p><p></p><p>Now, the only things left were the combination and application methods of the particles.</p><p></p><p>The ideal state would be like the Mother Worm, using it to enhance his own brain while also forming a "team of millions of avatars" to help him explore the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for how to realize this, he still needed careful consideration and to wait for the results of Yahan's research on the Mother Worm's brain.</p><p></p><p>Yahan's research on the "layered structure of the Mother Worm's neural system" had also yielded corresponding conclusions. Currently, they were conducting experiments using the brains of the Eight-Armed Race and the Mother Worm, attempting to artificially bridge neural cells directly into their brains.</p><p></p><p>This forced bridging seemed extremely difficult, but with the Mother Worm as an example that could be observed repeatedly and provided in unlimited quantities, Yahan's progress was very smooth.</p><p></p><p>It was believed that before long, Yahan would be able to achieve bridging a large number of neural cells into a brain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the end, brains could even be connected remotely, forming a vast brain domain network? Like the "global human brain server" in fantasy novels...</p><p></p><p>Of course, for now, it could only be imagined - whether it was feasible was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stretched out his right hand, and two grayish pearls the size of chicken eggs materialized in his palm. These were two clumps of entangled matter he had produced using the Insect God's body.</p><p></p><p>They looked ordinary, but from a microscopic perspective, the motion states of the tiny particles inside the two pearls were basically synchronized.</p><p></p><p>When the motion state of the particles inside one pearl changed slightly, the corresponding particles in the other pearl would undergo the same change - it was truly miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the legend of "twins having a spiritual connection" had this as its origin?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao murmured, "So the question is, how do I use this entangled matter to achieve 'millions of avatars'? I don't feel it's as difficult as imagined..."</p><p></p><p>"No rush, let's wait for Yahan's research to yield results first. For now, let me try using the entangled matter to construct various things! Like entangled blood energy, entangled spiritual power, and even the extremely complex - entangled nerves!"</p><p></p><p>"My metamorphosis may not be far off."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 718</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The captain took a deep breath, silently chanting 'humanity must prevail' twice. Following Suhao's instructions, he stepped into the transmission array. Sensing someone's presence, an control panel rose from the ground with a numeric keypad.</p><p></p><p>He pressed '000' and confirmed. </p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the control panel descended, and the innermost ring of runes lit up, attaching a 'balancing technique' to the captain. Immediately after, the entire transmission array was illuminated.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light forced everyone to shut their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance intensified, reaching its peak before suddenly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>When everyone opened their eyes again, the spot where the captain had been standing was empty!</p><p></p><p>At this point, no one cared why the captain had to do something to his mother after succeeding. Everyone could barely contain their excitement.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun looked at the transmission array, deeply moved, and asked Suhao, "Big Strong, is this transmission array safe?"</p><p></p><p>Apparently, they used to call him Xu Shiqiang, but now followed the captain in calling him Big Strong.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Of course it's safe, try it if you want!"</p><p></p><p>As the human leader, Xia Qingjun wanted to try, but others didn't let him. "Leader, for safety, let us try first! You absolutely cannot have any issues!"</p><p></p><p>Then Xia Qingjun could only watch as others took turns transmitting back and forth, having a great time.</p><p></p><p>Until Suhao said, "Oh right, transmitting too frequently in a short period can cause some harm to the body."</p><p></p><p>Then the group of self-preserving fellows abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun thought for a moment and said, "Big Strong, can this transmission array be made bigger? If it can only transmit people, its usefulness will be greatly reduced. It would be best if it could transmit mothership-sized vessels."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Adjust the proportions according to the design and experiment. It shouldn't be a big problem. However, transmitting larger objects will consume vastly more energy. You'll need to conduct more tests to determine the exact amount."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao left, Xia Qingjun immediately convened a high-level meeting. They unanimously decided to immediately classify the transmission array technology as top secret, conduct extensive testing on the array, add a self-destruct program, and quickly put the transmission array into use.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they would search for suitable planets or asteroids in the universe to build a comprehensive transmission network.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, transmission technology became one of humanity's core technologies!</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun waved his fist excitedly yet suppressed, muttering, "I bet right! Xu Shiqiang is the hope of humanity! Indeed, every human being cannot be underestimated. Any one of them could save the human race at a critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Humanity! Must prevail!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Suhao set up the transmission array for humans and trained a batch of professional 'inspection-maintenance' technicians, he stopped concerning himself with how they used the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>He returned to his small world and resumed his research on the mother insect.</p><p></p><p>He had now successfully grasped the principle of the mother insect's 'matching similar particles', which was related to its digestive system rather than a single organ performing this step alone.</p><p></p><p>The organs of a lifeform may appear independent, but are actually just parts that make up a complete system.</p><p></p><p>If one studies life by separating and examining each organ individually, then half the effort is wasted.</p><p></p><p>"I've basically mastered the particle matching mechanism. Next is the 'vortex screening mechanism'!"</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by, and Suhao gained more and more knowledge. Through repeated experiments, he integrated what he learned into his own knowledge system, making it completely his own.</p><p></p><p>During these years, he never again encountered Yunbo's lockdown and intrusion on him.</p><p></p><p>And misfortune also seemed to have drifted away from him!</p><p></p><p>No more pressure, no more anxiety, no more urgency...</p><p></p><p>Now he had only relaxed days of study and research!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the life Suhao had long hoped for?</p><p></p><p>He had realized a small part of it now.</p><p></p><p>"This is what I've gained through so many years of effort! So you see, studying is useful! I will walk the path of learning unceasingly until the end of the universe. Ahem! The universe may have an end, but I cannot!"</p><p></p><p>These few years were the most comfortable for Suhao, and as a result, his ambitions grew somewhat larger...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by second by second. Many human warships encountered small conflicts in unknown regions of space - some were destroyed, others successfully defeated their enemies and claimed victory...</p><p></p><p>The game of intergalactic hide-and-seek that had lasted for years continued.</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Bluelight received a message from the Compound Eye race: "My Compound Eye race has recently learned of a new piece of information. In order to track a special human patrol cruiser, the Octopus race launched a new research project called the 'Ultra-long Frequency Signal Stealth Invasion Program' ten years ago. It can secretly implant a special long-frequency program into ships that have been detected by their signal hives, in order to track and lock onto them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, we advise the human side to immediately halt all ships returning to the mother planet, evacuate from the star domain of the mother planet, and only return after inspection confirms no issues.</p><p></p><p>The ultra-long frequency program has been captured, details as follows. Please analyze the corresponding inspection program as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the message was transmitted back, it reached the human high command, and the emergency protocol was immediately activated.</p><p></p><p>All outbound human ships immediately stopped returning and moved away from Bluelight. The human research team began studying the ultra-long frequency program and quickly obtained the inspection program, which was sent to every ship, including a copy for the Compound Eye race.</p><p></p><p>Such incidents had occurred many times during the conflict between humans and the Octopus race, so there were already countermeasures in place. It wasn't particularly tense.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>"Report! The 'Changgeno' carrying out a special mission is about to reach the outer star domain of Bluelight!"</p><p></p><p>The 'Changgeno' was the stealth assault warship that infiltrated an Octopus colonial planet to experiment with the 'Shattered Star Cuboid'. After completing the mission and confirming it was not locked onto by a signal hive, it began returning!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xia Qingjun's pupils constricted as a great terror descended. His first thought was, "Oh no! Bluelight will be exposed!"</p><p></p><p>He roared furiously, "Immediately send a message to the 'Changgeno' to stop returning and get the hell out of here! Who the fuck authorized the 'Changgeno' to return? I'll kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Report! The 'Changgeno' is in warp flight with its endpoint predetermined. It cannot change course! And the 'Changgeno' is returning through normal procedures..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's eyes were bloodshot as he clenched and unclenched his fists, gritting his teeth to control his boundless rage, taking deep breaths to adjust his state.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced, "No! We haven't been exposed yet, there's still a chance! The Octopus can only get an imprecise location from that program. They can't confirm the 'Changgeno' is returning. Most importantly, the 'Changgeno' hasn't reached Bluelight yet..."</p><p></p><p>He immediately ordered, "Send a message to the 'Changgeno' to clear the ultra-long frequency program. After reaching the destination, immediately turn around and attack the Octopus 'Danger-348' base, feigning an energy raid. Even if they all die out there, the Octopus cannot discover Bluelight!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, recall all patrol ships around Bluelight and go into hiding."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he gritted his teeth and said, "Immediately issue the highest leader directive. The entire globe enters 'super alert' status. All factories cease operations and cut off power supply. Enforce a full civilian lockdown, no one can go outside. The military will take control of all resources for rationed point-to-point distribution."</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the safety of all humanity, some economic losses were trivial.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Don't be afraid! Even if we're discovered, we still have the transmission array. We've set up quite a few over these two years, enough to preserve a spark of humanity! And we also have Xu Shiqiang and his small world for rapid evacuation!</p><p></p><p>If worst comes to worst, we can kneel and beg the Compound Eyes to take us in as slaves on their home planet. With human capabilities, we'll definitely be able to rise up again countless years later.</p><p></p><p>As the human leader, if even he loses faith and hope, then humanity is pretty much doomed.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone can despair, except me, Xia Qingjun!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 952</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The great world was about to be created. After hearing the world announcement in the spiritual realm, almost all intelligent beings knew this news.</p><p></p><p>Including the dimensional travelers who occasionally took trials and missions.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the construction of the world passage did not affect their ability to continue completing various trials in the primordial divine realm, until they completely separated from it.</p><p></p><p>After the initial surprise, the trialists quickly put this matter aside.</p><p></p><p>It was simple - the opening of the world passage had little to do with them. Whether they could survive the next trial world was still a question.</p><p></p><p>For them, the trial missions were the urgent problem at hand.</p><p></p><p>A young man in full camouflage battle armor, his right hand resting on the long sword at his waist, stealthily climbed a large tree and scanned the distance. His pupils flickered as the distant city palace came into full view. After a long while, he nimbly leapt down from the tree like a mountain cat and quickly disappeared into the woods.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he flashed into another hidden cave and said to a black-clothed, short-haired young man: "Captain, the Ogre God King is always surrounded by a large group of guards when he goes to the training grounds to supervise the ogre soldiers' training. The key is that these guards are extremely powerful. From my perception, if we randomly pulled one out, they could fight us to a standstill. There's simply no opportunity to approach the Ogre God King. And moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him not continue, the black-clothed captain finished his sentence: "And moreover, even if we get close to the Ogre God King, we would not be a match for him, right?"</p><p></p><p>The camouflaged man did not deny it: "That's right, it's almost impossible to obtain the mission item from the Ogre God King's hands."</p><p></p><p>Would the system issue an impossible mission? From their perspective, it shouldn't. There must be other ways to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed captain fell silent while studying the detailed map in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The other team members quietly waited, calmly thinking.</p><p></p><p>Their small team had come to this trial world before, just never encountered the Ogre God King.</p><p></p><p>This was their team's final trial. According to the system, completing this trial would allow them to completely separate from the primordial divine realm and receive an unimaginable reward.</p><p></p><p>But after truly arriving in this world, they realized how difficult the final mission was.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that during their previous visit, the Ogre God King did not have so many guards around him. But now, nearly ten thousand elite fighters stronger than them had crowded into this small city.</p><p></p><p>Their nine-person team had to approach the Ogre God King, an overwhelmingly powerful super expert they could not defeat, while surrounded by nearly ten thousand enemies, and then take the mission item from him.</p><p></p><p>Was this possible?</p><p></p><p>The others felt it was impossible, but after carefully considering, the black-clothed captain said softly, "Comrades, let's go all out with me. After this trial, I will lead you away from the primordial divine realm. No matter what we face in the future, we will still be comrades who rely on each other."</p><p></p><p>The other members nodded firmly, gripping their weapons with determined expressions.</p><p></p><p>The camouflaged man asked, "What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed captain said resolutely, "We can only rely on wisdom, not force. Do you still remember that faint voice we heard when we first entered the primordial divine realm? 'Fifty years later, the world passage will open and the great world will be born.'</p><p></p><p>"The ogre tribe has suddenly started vigorously training soldiers, causing the entire race to grow and progress at an unimaginable speed - this must be related.</p><p></p><p>"So we need to take advantage of this to complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>"Take advantage?"</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed captain pointed in a direction, "Remember those people we saw before with a unified insignia and mysterious, powerful abilities? They came here to build the 'world passage', and this is our opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"What's the connection?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course there is one. If we disguise ourselves as people who came to build the world passage, we'll have a chance to approach the Ogre God King. However, if we're exposed, there will be an extreme risk, but this is our best choice."</p><p></p><p>"Comrades, we've been through wind and rain. Let's go all out one last time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King stood before a group of young ogres around ten years old, fully displaying his powerful physique and aura, speaking in the most domineering tone: "Fight for the glory of the ogres!"</p><p></p><p>The young ogres immediately became excited as if injected with stimulants, raising their fists and roaring: "For the glory of the ogres, for the glory of the God King!"</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>These young ogres were the most gifted in the entire ogre race. After repeated screening, they finally stood before him.</p><p></p><p>Each young ogre had awakened two abilities - one was the ogre race's innate magic power, and the other was a newly emerged special superpower.</p><p></p><p>He found the answer from the system - soul power.</p><p></p><p>This ability, never seen before, had gradually appeared in various regions since he heard the voice that the 'great world' was about to open over a decade ago, eventually drawing his attention.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, he took all these young ogres as disciples to personally train them.</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King had an inexplicable premonition: a chaotic era was about to begin, and he had to quickly strengthen the entire race's power to survive the unknown future.</p><p></p><p>Although his heart was human, having been an ogre for over a thousand years, he harbored an indescribable feeling for this race.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he would lead the ogre race to tenaciously survive, and as their king, he would lead the charge.</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the vast training grounds, he returned to the palace to practice as usual. Suddenly, a guard came running to report: "Reporting to the Eternal Ogre God King, there are nine humans outside the city seeking an audience. Their clothing and attire resemble those active in the Ataris Mountains, with a double-sword insignia on their hands. They say they have news about the great world to convey."</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King's brow furrowed: "People from the Double Sword Sect? What do they want from me? News about the great world?"</p><p></p><p>He recalled not being too familiar with the Double Sword Sect's people and even having some conflicts when they first met.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, he said, "Bring them in and take them to the reception hall."</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, the nine trialists following the ogre guards wiped away their sweat in relief: "The first step was a success. Next, we'll seize any opportunities."</p><p></p><p>After meeting the Ogre God King in the reception hall, the nine did not sit down as he intended. Instead, they acted arrogantly as if inspecting the place, wandering around and examining the decorations.</p><p></p><p>The captain marveled, "As expected of the Ogre God King's palace, every decoration is a rare masterpiece! I didn't expect the outwardly rugged Ogre God King to be such a refined person."</p><p></p><p>Then, from the corner of his eye, he noticed the crystal ball hanging on the Ogre God King's waist - their mission target. Unexpectedly, they had so easily encountered the Ogre God King and the crystal ball.</p><p></p><p>They acted nonchalantly, performing to the best of their abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King watched the nine wander about, growing increasingly displeased, as these nine seemed to completely disregard him, the mighty Ogre God King.</p><p></p><p>But he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>These Double Sword Sect people appeared weak, but each possessed an extremely powerful spatial imprisonment ability. He admitted he was no match for them, so if he could avoid offending them, he would.</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King strongly expressed his displeasure: "If you've come here to speak, say it directly. If you've only come to tour my royal palace, then I cannot accommodate you."</p><p></p><p>The captain steadied his heart and laughed: "The world passage is about to open. I believe the God King must have many questions. We've come to give you a warning."</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King narrowed his eyes: "Please speak."</p><p></p><p>The captain set down a vase and approached the Ogre God King, whispering in his ear: "The battle between races will begin. Whoever is the final victor will be the master of the great world." With that, he retreated, shouting frantically in the team channel: "Mission item obtained, return immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>The nine trialists vanished simultaneously. </p><p></p><p>Only the Ogre God King remained, his expression grave: "The battle between races...the master of the great world...just wait, under my leadership, the ogre race will certainly be the final victor."</p><p></p><p>He was extremely confident in his wisdom.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the system notification sounded: "Mission item lost, guard mission failed, 500 points deducted. Use a redemption card to nullify this failure penalty?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I didn't even see the trialists' faces. How did the mission fail?"</p><p></p><p>The Ogre God King checked in bewilderment, confirming the failure.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his waist - the crystal ball was gone!</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the events, he quickly realized what had occurred. His face instantly reddened as he almost spat out a mouthful of blood: "Dammit, those trialists actually dared to trick me!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 879</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After truly entering the so-called way of tea and pottery, Su Hao and the other two truly witnessed what the world of mountain bandits was like.</p><p></p><p>Every segment of the journey, a group of mountain bandits would jump out, shout out a characteristic opening line, and then proceed to rob them.</p><p></p><p>Crucially, there was even a unified pricing standard - one tael of silver per carriage.</p><p></p><p>This made Feng Cheng exclaim how ridiculous it was.</p><p></p><p>The three were leisurely riding horses on this small path carved between a sheer cliff and valley, taking in the beautiful scenery along the way.</p><p></p><p>"This mountain is..." </p><p></p><p>A few mountain bandits jumped out from the side, but before they could finish their lines, a tael of silver drew an arc and landed precisely in the hand of the lead bandit, stuffing the words back into his throat.</p><p></p><p>The lead bandit looked at the silver in his hand, suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had been insulted in this line of work.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were a few younger bandits watching nearby. If he just let them pass like this, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing?</p><p></p><p>Plus, they were just three young men who didn't look too formidable. Most crucially, they had three big horses.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, viciousness welled up in him. The lead bandit ferociously said, "You three, stop right there. Leave behind all your goods, money and horses, only then can you pass through here. Otherwise, don't blame this boss's blade for not seeing clearly."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Su Hao and the others come to their senses, staring at the mountain bandits in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng pointed at the silver in their hands and said in astonishment, "Isn't it one tael per carriage? Raising the price arbitrarily, wanting to take everything in one go - how unprofessional! If you take it all, then the mountain bandit brothers behind you won't have any money left. If this goes on and those behind can't make a living, won't they come and slaughter you all eventually?"</p><p></p><p>A clever young bandit looked at the lead and stammered, "Sec...second boss, what...what he says makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The second boss glared ferociously at the young one and said, "You shut up. How dare he teach us how to be mountain bandits? Go, get them, take everything. If they resist, chop them all up and throw them off the cliff."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, second boss."</p><p></p><p>Then a few brutal mountain bandits charged forward to rob them. However, before they could get close, each of them foamed at the mouth and collapsed to the ground, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the other two simply passed by without looking back.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ya Shan said, "Didn't we agree that we're all ordinary people and can't use tricks? Who took action just now?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao punched his palm, looking suddenly enlightened. "Yeah, we agreed not to cheat. Whoever took action is the fool. Which of you two took action? Feng Cheng, was it you?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately waved his hands, saying, "Don't wrongfully accuse me, boss. I was spacing out and didn't take any action."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also said, "It wasn't me either. If I took action, would they still be alive? It wasn't me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It wasn't me either. If not you two, then who else could it be? It must be one of you two."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't take any action either."  </p><p></p><p>"Maybe they suddenly fell ill themselves."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After walking some more distance, they encountered the young man and woman they had met in the city before. The two looked extremely haggard.</p><p></p><p>The young woman seemed to recognize Su Hao and the others, exclaiming in surprise, "Oh? You three actually made it this far, unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled, "Why not? But you two, didn't you say you were joining the Southern Merchant caravan? Why are you heading back looking so ragged?"</p><p></p><p>The young woman didn't answer, but instead said, "Don't go any further. Up ahead is a gang of brutal mountain bandits. It's not as simple as paying them off - they'll kill too. The Southern Merchant caravan I was following was slaughtered by those bandits. If we hadn't seen the danger and ran fast, plus some luck, we'd probably be dead too."</p><p></p><p>The young man also said, "That gang of mountain bandits must have suffered a huge loss in a battle with Meng Wanguo's massive 'United Merchant' caravan, and are venting their anger on the Southern Merchants to recoup their losses. If you go now, it's not something money can solve - it's like walking to your deaths."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "I see, you two were really lucky to have escaped."</p><p></p><p>The young woman frowned in displeasure, "Hey, did you not hear what we said? Those are mountain bandits who dared to attack the United Merchants - they're extremely vicious. If you keep going, you'll lose your lives."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Yes, yes, very vicious. Oh, since you're heading to the Western Kingdom, why don't you join our merchant caravan?"</p><p></p><p>The young woman was about to explode with anger. She had said so much, yet these three didn't seem to have listened to a single word.</p><p></p><p>She said viciously, "Go ahead! Go quickly, and you'll end up being just corpses on the roadside for the wolves to feed on."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she pulled the young man and left.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, she ran back, fuming, "I'll just follow you for a bit. I want to see how you die. I want to see the regretful expressions on your faces when blades are raised to your heads."</p><p></p><p>The young man had a look like he was about to cry. He completely didn't understand his sister's thought process, and couldn't help but tug at her sleeve, saying softly, "Sis, let's just go. Do you want to follow them to the grave?"</p><p></p><p>The young woman said, "What's there to be afraid of? We're second-rate experts. If we see danger, we'll immediately run - who can catch up? What I can't stand the most are people who don't listen to advice. I just want to see the regretful expressions on their faces. That would be extremely satisfying for me."</p><p></p><p>Then this female martial artist followed behind Su Hao and the others, with her younger brother in tow.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others didn't mind, letting them tag along.</p><p></p><p>After walking some distance, Feng Cheng patted the empty space beside the carriage, "Why walk? Come up and sit."</p><p></p><p>At first the young woman was coy, but eventually couldn't resist the temptation and sat in Feng Cheng's carriage.</p><p></p><p>Through casual conversation, Feng Cheng learned the young woman's name was Cong Shuling, and her younger brother was Cong Renfei. Their father was a top-rate martial artist who had once escorted a merchant caravan on the Tea and Pottery Road, but many years had passed without any news of him. Their mother had fallen ill from anxiety and passed away not long after.</p><p></p><p>This caused Cong Shuling to harbor deep resentment towards her missing father in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Because in her view, it was because her father refused to listen to their dissuasion and insisted on being a merchant caravan escort that everything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>After that, she developed the habit of dissuading others, while also hating those who didn't listen to advice...</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that in this situation, she had come to hate Su Hao and the others. She wasn't joking - she really did want to see the regretful expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily, "So in other words, you two are going to the Western Kingdom to find your father, then tie him up and make him kowtow at your mother's grave?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said coldly, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked, "What if your father had already died?"</p><p></p><p>The younger brother Cong Renfei immediately refuted, "Impossible, my father is a top martial artist. No one could kill him. Even if he was outmatched, he could have escaped."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng just smiled, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by amidst their casual conversation.</p><p></p><p>"This mountain is..."</p><p></p><p>Another silver tael was precisely stuffed into the speaking mountain bandit's hand.</p><p></p><p>The bandit froze: "..."</p><p></p><p>He felt that just letting them pass like this was a loss.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the bandit not speaking or letting them through, Feng Cheng asked, "What's wrong, want to raise the price?"</p><p></p><p>The bandit felt his authority was being challenged.</p><p></p><p>The bandit foamed at the mouth and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Who took action this time? Surely they didn't fall ill again?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "I didn't take action, Cong Shuling can testify."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "I didn't act either. I was just entranced by this beautiful scenery and didn't even notice the mountain bandits come. Cong Renfei can testify."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were a bit dazed - they indeed didn't see Su Hao and the others take any action.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said uncertainly, "Indeed, no action taken. Maybe they really fell ill?"</p><p></p><p>After walking some more distance:</p><p></p><p>"This mountain is..."</p><p></p><p>The mountain bandit was facing a career crisis.</p><p></p><p>The mountain bandit eyed their goods and the woman.</p><p></p><p>The mountain bandit foamed at the mouth and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao, Ya Shan and Feng Cheng instinctively said in unison: "It wasn't me this time."</p><p></p><p>Then they all looked at the brother and sister with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister shook their heads dazedly, "No...not us either."</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, the brother and sister witnessed an extremely horrifying scene: Any mountain bandit who dared make a move against them, the moment they drew their blades, would foam at the mouth and collapse - no exceptions, including the gang that had slaughtered the Southern Merchant caravan.</p><p></p><p>Most bizarrely, after each incident, these three handsome men would deny taking action, and even more ridiculously, they actually suspected the brother and sister had done it.</p><p></p><p>It was quite numb.</p><p></p><p>Drifting along in this manner, they arrived at the largest city of the Western Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were dumbfounded: "We're here already?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling looked like she had seen a ghost: "That's impossible...from Meng Wanguo to the Western Kingdom, even the fastest merchant caravans take over half a year. But this was less than a month...</p><p></p><p>At the leisurely pace of these three, it should have taken at least a year to get here. But looking at the local people's features full of foreign influences, it's just as the rumors describe - this has to be the 'Jier' capital of the Western Kingdom, no mistake.</p><p></p><p>And I specifically asked around too, this is indeed the capital 'Jier' of the Western Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the younger brother Cong Renfei tugged at his sister's sleeve and said softly, "Sis, I'm scared!"</p>

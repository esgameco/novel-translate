        <h1>Chapter 895</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Just as the brother and sister were excited about the harvest of the soul fruit, a handsome young man suddenly appeared in front of them, smiling as he walked towards them.</p><p></p><p>The moment this young man appeared, the brother and sister were startled and abruptly looked up ahead.</p><p></p><p>This person...why does he seem a bit familiar?</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister couldn't help but draw their long swords, retreating together with guarded expressions. They sensed an extraordinary feeling from this young man in front of them, though they couldn't quite put their finger on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their strong reaction, Feng Cheng couldn't help but smile: "Long time no see, what's wrong, don't you remember me?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei felt the person in front of him was very familiar, but after racking his brain, he couldn't recall and looked towards his sister instead.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing had a good memory for handsome guys, so after thinking for a moment, she suddenly froze, pointing at Feng Cheng and stammering: "You...you...are that..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was anxious for his sister, staring at her wide-eyed in anticipation of what she would say next.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Cheng!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing blurted out after a pause: "You're that Jia Feng Cheng we met on the Tea Porcelain Path, along with a Jia Wei and a Jia Yashan."</p><p></p><p>The Tea Porcelain Path had left an extraordinarily deep impression on the brother and sister, with those bizarre scenes lingering unforgettably in their minds.</p><p></p><p>After his sister spoke, Cong Renfei suddenly recalled that fantastic journey and quickly matched the person before him to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>He was also dumbfounded: "No way! It can't be!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two were utterly confused, unable to make sense of the situation. They knew they were thinking, but didn't know what they were thinking about.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded: "That's right, I'm Jia Feng Cheng, we traveled the Tea Porcelain Path together back then."</p><p></p><p>He pointed at Cong Shuxing: "You're the older sister Cong Shuxing."</p><p></p><p>Then at Cong Renfei: "You're the younger brother Cong Renfei. Only now you've swapped identities, one became the younger sister, one the older brother. How interesting, hahaha."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister: "......"</p><p></p><p>It really was Jia Feng Cheng!</p><p></p><p>Over the past decade or so, they had verified countless times that this was no longer the world they once knew, but an entirely new one.</p><p></p><p>This place possessed mystical soul power, as well as gigantic dragons, mountain spirits and all kinds of animals they had never seen before. Even the races of people differed from what they once knew.</p><p></p><p>They had confirmed their complete departure from the past. Although they sometimes wondered when they could return to their former homeland, they knew deep down that it was merely a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful and mysterious Shopping Mall didn't sell a "return home" item.</p><p></p><p>Yet they never could have imagined encountering someone they once knew in this other world.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be astonished?</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing regained her composure and asked full of puzzlement: "Mr. Feng Cheng...do you know what's going on here? Why did we end up here with swapped bodies?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled: "I don't know the details either. I just heard from my senior that your souls from the previous life had died and ran over here recently, so I came to take a look at what happened. If you want to understand, then study hard and grow stronger. Maybe you'll find out one day in the future?"</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the surrounding mess: "Judging by your state, you seem to be doing alright. Tsk tsk, not bad at all, wrecking this place like this."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing asked in astonishment: "You don't know either, Mr. Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed: "I'm quite busy usually, how could I possibly know everything just by watching you?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing asked again: "Mr. Feng Cheng, do we have a chance to go back? I mean, back to my hometown, the place I used to live."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Of course there's a chance. As long as you're strong enough, you can go back. But why would you want to return?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing: "No...just want to go back and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed: "You mean find your father, right? He's probably long dead by now, it's been over a hundred years after all."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were dumbstruck: "Dead...over a hundred years later..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled mysteriously: "And at your current speed, if you wanted to fly back, let me calculate...it would take you at least a trillion years, and you still might not make it back. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were completely dazed. They had no concept of a trillion years.</p><p></p><p>"Then why..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng waved his hand: "For me, of course I can go wherever I want, not like your speed."</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei asked full of anticipation: "Can you take us back?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook his head: "I can come and go freely by myself, but I can't bring you along. If you really want to go back, you'll have to rely on your own efforts. You can't go back at your current level, but that doesn't mean you can never go back once you become powerful enough. If you can cultivate to my level of strength, then you should be able to return."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were suddenly filled with hope.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing asked curiously: "Mr. Feng Cheng, how powerful are you?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng stroked his chin thinking for a moment, then shook his head: "I don't know, it's hard to explain to you two. I guess I'm quite strong, but it doesn't feel that strong either."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister: "......"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng summarized: "Mainly I might just know a bit more, so as long as you study hard, one day you'll probably reach my level...maybe?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing suddenly thought of something and asked her consciousness system: "Diligence, can I reach Jia Feng Cheng's level through cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Diligence replied: "The system cannot detect Jia Feng Cheng's strength, unable to answer."</p><p></p><p>She immediately changed the question: "Can I cultivate to the level of being able to return to my former homeland?"</p><p></p><p>Diligence: "No."</p><p></p><p>"What if I have countless points and cultivate with the system's help, could I return home then?"</p><p></p><p>Diligence: "No."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Cong Shuxing understood Feng Cheng's immense power. Even cultivating to the highest level with the system's help could not reach his realm. No wonder he said he didn't know how powerful he was...</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through Cong Shuxing's mind: "This is a golden thigh..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing hesitated, then resolutely said: "Mr. Feng Cheng, could you teach me how to grow stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei also looked at Feng Cheng with great anticipation. Considering they were old acquaintances meeting again in another world, he should agree, right?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng readily agreed: "Of course, I came to ask if you want to study all kinds of knowledge diligently, if you want to explore the unknown. If you have that intention, then you can become my disciples. I'll impart some exploratory knowledge and skills to you.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I won't teach you for free. As my disciples, there aren't many rules, but when I need it, you'll have to unconditionally help me with some tasks.</p><p></p><p>After all, knowledge and power have never come cheaply. If you want to gain something, you'll inevitably have to pay a price. I can teach you knowledge now, and when you grow up, you can become my assistants to help me out."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuxing and Cong Renfei exchanged a glance, seeing the determination in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness systems within them were quite bizarre. Although they could gain tremendous power, the siblings always felt a sense of unease...</p><p></p><p>Compared to the system, this Jia Feng Cheng from the previous life seemed far more trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, through their dialogue with the system, they realized that Feng Cheng might be even more powerful than it.</p><p></p><p>Learn knowledge from him, grow powerful, and then deal with the consciousness system later.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hesitate. The brother and sister immediately knelt and paid their respects in their own way, saying in unison: "Greetings to Master Feng Cheng."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded with satisfaction: "Although I'm your master and look forward to your future growth, whether you can actually learn depends on your own efforts."</p><p></p><p>The siblings said: "We understand, we will definitely work diligently and study seriously."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled: "Since that's the case, from now on you are my students. Let me give you a welcoming gift."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng examined the back of their hands, then casually pointed, sending a purple beam shooting out like a slender rope that bored into their hands and formed a 'Double Sword Imprint'.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "This is the special mark of my disciples, called the Double Sword Imprint. You can call yourselves disciples of the Double Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Feng Cheng finished speaking, a 'ding dong' sound suddenly came from the depths of the siblings' minds.</p><p></p><p>"Happy Learning System activated, I'm your assistant Xiaole, at your service."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister were instantly dumbfounded: "......"</p>

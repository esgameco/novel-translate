        <h1>Chapter 994</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Time flew rapidly as Su Hao was developing the 'Exiled Avatars', with twenty years passing in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao cradled a lump that appeared to have a dull metallic sheen on the outside. He carefully observed its operating state, then casually gave it a push, and the metallic flesh ball immediately disappeared from his hand, exiled by him to an unknown realm of the universe.</p><p></p><p>This metallic flesh ball was only the size of a basketball, unremarkable in appearance, yet it was a product that integrated Su Hao's most advanced biotechnology - the 'Exiled Avatar' he had developed.</p><p></p><p>This exiled avatar had extremely high performance, powered by multiple high-quality source pearls as its driving energy. It possessed the biological characteristics of a [God], with built-in 'Star Keys', a micro-spirit brain, crispy defense, spirit structure, personal space, automatic exploration programs, and more.</p><p></p><p>One could say that the exiled avatar was lavishly equipped, capable of dealing with all kinds of situations in the unknown space.</p><p></p><p>After the exiled avatar was sent to the unknown space, Xiao Guang was responsible for controlling its exploration. In special circumstances, it could even be directly controlled by Su Hao's sub-consciousness, evolving at an extremely fast speed into one of his avatars, or even transforming itself into a transmission array to open a channel to the experimental base.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of making the exiled avatars this way was that they could be mass-produced, without requiring Su Hao's constant attention. As long as he set up an automatic production and deployment program, it would meet his basic needs for exploring the infinite universe.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine the scenario - billions of exiled avatars scattered out there, some of them were bound to strike gold eventually.</p><p></p><p>After casually sending out the exiled avatar in a random direction, Su Hao entered the Ping-Pong space and took over its control.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, this exiled avatar began to squirm and stretch, quickly growing limbs and a head. The head's shape shifted, morphing into Su Hao's facial features.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao blinked his eyes, raised his hand to check his current state, and revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>It felt pretty good - at least in extreme environments, he could still effectively protect himself and launch powerful counterattacks.</p><p></p><p>"So, what is this place?"</p><p></p><p>The area was exceptionally vast, with only faint starlight visible in the far distance, let alone any star systems.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao estimated that the nearest starlight was at least tens of billions of light-years away.</p><p></p><p>This was a cosmic void.</p><p></p><p>For this exiled avatar to fly and reach the nearest star system was utterly impossible.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the current situation, Su Hao didn't hesitate and initiated a second spatial exile.</p><p></p><p>With a hazy blur before his eyes, he arrived in another star domain.</p><p></p><p>This place was also a cosmic void, without even a speck of dust, surrounded by nothingness.</p><p></p><p>He sensed everything around him through the exiled avatar, and a feeling of loneliness inevitably arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The universe was too vast.</p><p></p><p>The portion occupied by matter was so small as to be almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>The probability of reaching a star system through exile was lower than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao exiled himself several more times, but without exception, he ended up in cosmic voids each time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>This made him wonder again if his luck had always been this bad.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter - as long as he produced a massive number of exiled avatars and continuously deployed them throughout the universe, there would definitely be gains.</p><p></p><p>Once he encountered a star system, he could establish a base in that space through the 'Star System Network' and expand outward.</p><p></p><p>After re-examining the current exiled avatar's performance and finding no need for improvement, Su Hao decided to finalize the design for mass production.</p><p></p><p>He withdrew his consciousness from the exiled avatar, returning to the Ping-Pong space to design an automated production line.</p><p></p><p>The main difficulty in producing exiled avatars lay in the manufacturing of the 'micro-spirit brains', but Su Hao had completed the full automation of spirit brain production long ago, so producing exiled avatars wasn't too difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>After completing the design, Su Hao directly handed the production line design to Yashan and Feng Chengdao: "Yashan, Feng Cheng, here's a production line. The first phase target is to produce one million units.</p><p></p><p>The quantity I need to produce this time is extremely large, with no deadline, meaning it will be an ongoing production, so you can treat it as an eternal project.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this production task can be treated as a daily task for the disciples, just like the exploration task."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at the production line data and asked in surprise, "Grand Master, what are you going to produce?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "A low-configuration version of the [God] avatar that can be used as a probe. I plan to randomly deploy these exiled avatars throughout the universe using the 'Spatial Exile' ability. Maybe we'll gain some unexpected discoveries.</p><p></p><p>If we do find something, we can take over the probe at any time and establish another universal base.</p><p></p><p>In this way, our exploration range won't be limited to the 'Star System Network'."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng were stunned for a moment, then exclaimed in admiration, "Grand Master, this operation is awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng had an inexplicable feeling that their learning speed would never be able to keep up with Grand Master's research and exploration speed.</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid that one day in the future, they would suddenly fall behind Grand Master's pace.</p><p></p><p>The two of them thought inwardly, "We need to work harder, we've been slacking off too much recently."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After carefully reviewing Su Hao's production line design, Yashan and Feng Cheng gathered together to discuss it.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "This production line doesn't seem complicated, but it involves many technologies that most disciples can't comprehend. If we just assign it to them like this, the production efficiency will definitely be extremely low. Just the initial adjustment period would take a lot of time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Indeed, if we arrange it like this, I estimate the Double Sword Sect's disciples will be in chaos for a while. After all, the Double Sword Sect disciples' knowledge is far inferior to that of the Infinite Sect's disciples."</p><p></p><p>On this point, Feng Cheng could only scratch his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>All of his disciples' intelligence was focused on combat attributes, while Yashan's disciples placed more emphasis on studying knowledge, so their overall knowledge was much higher than the Double Sword Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, this didn't mean that Yashan's disciples had lower combat power than Feng Cheng's disciples. After a long time, Yashan's Infinite Sect disciples might even crush Feng Cheng's Double Sword Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "It's hard to compare knowledge. Everyone has their strengths."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Yashan said, "To complete the production line with maximum efficiency, we still need the Infinite Sect disciples and Double Sword Sect disciples to collaborate, separating the difficult and easy parts and dividing the work. If we each take on part of the production line targets, who knows when we'll figure it out."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "I was thinking the same thing."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng had fresh memories of making production lines.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the two of them had worked alongside Su Hao for nearly a hundred years, painstakingly grinding out over a hundred million production lines.</p><p></p><p>That kind of repetitive work, doing the same thing for decades at a time, was something ordinary people could hardly imagine.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they now had nearly a hundred million disciples, all top-quality advanced labor forces, so they no longer needed to do the work themselves.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng added, "This should be the second time our two sects have collaborated on a major task, right? The last time was when we built the World Passage. I think we should have our disciples interact more. In the future, as we have more disciples, conflicts and clashes will be hard to avoid. Who knows, if we're not watching one day, they might start fighting."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Indeed, it's hard to avoid. Even among the disciples of my own sect, there are quite a few conflicts. We can find some tasks for our disciples to interact and get to know each other better."</p><p></p><p>In fact, the two of them weren't worried about their disciples causing conflicts.</p><p></p><p>The universe was too vast - no matter how many disciples they had, once scattered throughout the universe, any grievances or conflicts would dissolve.</p><p></p><p>Of course, maintaining communication and bonding was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng suddenly said, "Oh, by the way, why don't we take this opportunity to produce the spatial interference devices as well?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Good idea."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Yashan and Feng Cheng separately summoned their capable disciples and began discussing the production line issues.</p><p></p><p>The specific steps were: division of labor, training, and trial runs.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire process, Yashan and Feng Cheng were involved, controlling the progress of the project.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary matter, they could simply give their disciples a brief instruction. But this time was different - this was a task personally assigned by Grand Master Su Hao, so the two of them had to participate to avoid any problems or wasted time.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Years later, the Crimson Demon King of the Demonic Realm keenly sensed the activities of the two major sects and wondered to himself, "Huh? What are the Infinite Sect and Double Sword Sect up to, acting all secretive? And why didn't they call me?"</p><p></p><p>He strongly suspected that his master, Feng Cheng, had forgotten about him.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King summoned the Eighteen Deities and his junior, Cao Shilang, to inquire about it, but the Eighteen Deities seemed even more surprised than him. "What? The two major sects are making a big move? Why didn't we receive any news about it?"</p><p></p><p>Ba Li asked doubtfully, "Crimson, aren't you the third senior brother of the Double Sword Sect? How could you not know about the Double Sword Sect's affairs?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King coughed and said, "I haven't been back there for a long time, so it's normal for me not to know."</p><p></p><p>Then an awkward silence fell over the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Although theoretically, the events happening on the Infinite Land had nothing to do with the Demonic Realm, they all felt a sense of dissatisfaction in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were unhappy about being kept in the dark, and at the same time, they blamed the two sects for making a big move without informing them...</p><p></p><p>It was like everyone was holding a party, and one person hid away, thinking that when someone asked why they didn't come, they would suddenly appear and surprise everyone. But then they realized that until the party ended, no one had even mentioned them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most likely reason was that they were worried others would secretly 'get rich' without their knowledge or while they were being negligent.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Nati suggested, "Crimson, why don't you go back to the Double Sword Sect and ask? Many things require us to be more proactive."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also said, "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King thought about it and agreed that it would be better to go and ask directly rather than guessing blindly.</p><p></p><p>So he said, "Alright, you all wait here. I'll go to the Double Sword Sect first and see what's going on."</p><p></p><p>Then the Crimson Demon King transmitted back to Double Sword City and found Feng Cheng's avatar. "Master, I've come back to see you!"</p><p></p><p>When Feng Cheng saw the Crimson Demon King, his eyes lit up. "Oh, Crimson, you're back just in time. I was actually looking for you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Crimson Demon King felt relieved - it seemed his master hadn't forgotten about him after all.</p><p></p><p>He smiled brightly, "Master, please tell me what it is. Crimson is here to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "I need you to manage a few factories. This is what you're best at. Come, come, from now on, you'll be one of the ten joint factory directors."</p><p></p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in the Crimson Demon King's heart. "???"</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities waited in the Demonic Realm for a long time, but the Crimson Demon King didn't return with any news, leaving them utterly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>So Ba Li asked in the group, "Crimson, what's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Demon King replied with an angry emoji and three exclamation marks: "!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Deities: "???"</p>

            <p>以下是对这段中文小说片段的英文翻译:</p><p></p><p>After doing things, time always flies by quickly.</p><p></p><p>Before I knew it, two years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The whole world seemed to have changed a bit, but on the surface, it didn't look much different from before.</p><p></p><p>In these two to three years, Axing and Awang had spread the reputation of the 'Lucky Star Squad' almost throughout the entire Hengxuan District, becoming one of the most brilliant star squads. At the same time, they had also passed the advanced Source Mage examination and obtained the title of advanced Source Mages, opening up the path for promotion within the Source Mage Association and having the opportunity to become high-level managers within the association.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of their unbridled antics. They had gained the reputation of being the 'Scourge of Bizarre Disasters'. Whenever there was a bizarre disaster that couldn't be solved for a long time somewhere, people would think of Axing and Awang's 'Lucky Star Squad'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during these two years, Su Hao had helped them out of trouble many times.</p><p></p><p>When they encountered a dangerous bizarre disaster that they couldn't solve, Axing would resolutely activate the positioning stone that Su Hao had given him.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to say whether he was reckless or cowardly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, most people are just a bundle of contradictions. You think they are one way, but in reality, they act differently.</p><p></p><p>Another thing, regarding the matter of the King of Luo, there were no longer any Source Squads daring to come to Huaishui Town to investigate. And Huaishui Town had become famous throughout the entire Hengxuan District, becoming a forbidden zone for Source Squads, with a level of danger comparable to bizarre disasters.</p><p></p><p>The number of Source Squads that had mysteriously disappeared near Huaishui Town was no less than ten. You tell me, isn't that terrifying?</p><p></p><p>As for the missing King of Luo, the matter was eventually left unresolved. The heir of the King of Luo didn't care about his life or death. They just symbolically sent some of the most enthusiastic yet least favored people to investigate, for if they were to exhaust all their resources for this, it would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>As for the other prince, Prince Chao Wang, who was massacred by Zhi Peng and others, a squad named 'Hound Butchers' was listed on the walls of the grand halls of various Source Mage Associations, with their corresponding ability types announced. However, no one knew who exactly was in the 'Hound Butchers'.</p><p></p><p>Because of this incident, princes in various places became more restrained in their actions, or rather, more discreet.</p><p></p><p>And now, the wanted Zhi Peng and others were living a very prosperous life. What does it feel like to have friends all over the world? Wherever they went, they were welcomed by a large number of friends, and these friends were all Source Mages with some local influence.</p><p></p><p>In just over two years, Zhi Peng had made a name for himself, being respectfully called the 'Heart Healer', 'Great Scholar', 'Preaching Saint', 'Virtuous Sage'...</p><p></p><p>He even attracted many high-ranking members of the royal families, who actively invited him into their palaces to teach philosophy, and then smoothly became good friends with Zhi Peng.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Zhi Peng didn't dare to send these royal friends he had made to the Gourd Dao and hand them over to Ya Shan for experiments, for fear of letting something slip.</p><p></p><p>Even good friends could potentially betray you without realizing it! He wouldn't underestimate the power of the Source Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhi Peng's appearance would inevitably lead to an investigation by the Source Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>But was he afraid of the investigation?</p><p></p><p>Not at all. He had already completely changed his appearance under Su Hao's gene needle, and all the Source that had been used to maintain his 'Source Body' had dissipated, disguising himself as an ordinary scholar.</p><p></p><p>He was just a knowledgeable ordinary person! Apart from being able to expound on a great deal of philosophy, he couldn't be detected by those old Source Mage masters.</p><p></p><p>Even if they investigated, they could only investigate through Ya Shan's experimental subjects. As long as he kept a low profile, he could persist for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, we must mention the Source Mage Association's attitude towards the royal families.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was to 'maintain the legitimacy of the royal power'!</p><p></p><p>Before the Round Table Conference, the world was ruled by twenty massive empires and countless small countries. Due to various conflicts of interest, they waged wars against each other incessantly.</p><p></p><p>With disasters from the outside and wars between countries on the inside, the lives of the people were extremely difficult, and deaths from freezing or starvation were very common.</p><p></p><p>It was against this backdrop that a small organization filled with a sense of justice was born. It was called 'He' (meaning 'peace'), with the goal of bringing peace to the world and ending the endless wars. It was the predecessor of the Source Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of several decades, this organization grew into a massive entity, overseeing the entire world from above. It proposed that all empires sign a peace treaty and form a united body to jointly resist disasters, without distinguishing between each other and no longer attacking one another.</p><p></p><p>The twenty empires scoffed at this so-called 'He'. What a joke! Did it understand the 'art of governing' and that 'war is a means to achieve political goals'?</p><p></p><p>Then, after 'He' used the threat of force to destroy two empires, the remaining eighteen extremely powerful empires compromised! They acknowledged that 'He' did indeed grasp the essence of 'war is a means to achieve political goals'.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the eighteen empires and various small countries jointly signed the 'Eighteen Empire Alliance Agreement'.</p><p></p><p>As long as 'He' existed, this document would remain in effect permanently.</p><p></p><p>The last clause of this agreement was: 'He' maintains the legitimate ruling status of the eighteen empires and does not interfere in the governance of each empire. In the event of a disputed incident, it has the right to convene a joint council and decide by vote, including but not limited to replacing the emperor (see Appendix 99 for details on disputed incidents).</p><p></p><p>It was this clause that allowed the royal families of the eighteen empires to enjoy blessings for over a thousand years. During this process, they encountered numerous incidents, but in the end, they were all suppressed by the Source Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>The Source Mage Association is 'He', and that 'Eighteen Empire Alliance Agreement' signed over twelve hundred years ago has been amended many times as the unified society gradually progressed. Even the term 'empire' was changed to 'district' to downplay the opposition between them.</p><p></p><p>Only that final clause about maintaining the legitimacy of the empires remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Whether this is good or bad is hard to say.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was what Su Hao had seen in the records he had collected from various places, including the original text of that agreement, which was basically accurate.</p><p></p><p>From the current social structure, as long as the Source Mage Association could maintain its position as the strongest force and remain transcendent in this world, the pattern of this world would not change for a very long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>Even a special Source Mage like the powerful Zhi Peng could not shake their foundations of rule.</p><p></p><p>However, it was unfortunate that Su Hao had come to this world, which meant that this pattern that had been maintained for over a thousand years would undergo earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple: he didn't like these royal families.</p><p></p><p>But that's another story. Overthrowing the entire world order is not something that can be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>And this was not Su Hao's main concern. What he had always been concerned about was the research on Source.</p><p></p><p>By now, Su Hao's research had made tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to the billions of various marine fish recorded in his Ping-Pong Dimension Space. On average, he could harvest one fish that had molted into a Source Beast every month.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of two years, a total of twenty fish had molted into Source Beasts, providing him with concrete sample data.</p><p></p><p>Not a lot, but it allowed Su Hao to grasp certain patterns. Not only did he find the special interface hidden within the Source Beasts, but he also successfully found a way to plug and unplug the interface.</p><p></p><p>In other words, after two years of research, following a certain path, he found the 'system' that could turn matter into Source!</p><p></p><p>That day, Su Hao was in the laboratory, taking an octopus out of the fish tank and placing it on the experiment table.</p><p></p><p>This octopus had recently molted into a Source Beast, and Su Hao had repeatedly studied it. Today, he wanted to conduct a different experiment: to sever the connection between this Source Beast octopus and the 'system', and then observe its subsequent changes to see if it would lose its Source abilities and revert to being an ordinary octopus.</p><p></p><p>But how could he sever the connection between this Source Beast and the 'system' without damaging its physical structure?</p><p></p><p>He had made many unsuccessful attempts before.</p><p></p><p>But from the perspective of 'killing the octopus', he found a feasible method.</p><p></p><p>That was to put the octopus into a state of apparent death.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 667</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Question: What should one do if a huge cannon barrel is aimed at you, ready to fire? Urgent!!</p><p></p><p>Not only was Suhao panicked, but his comrades including the squad leader were also panicked. If that cannon fired, how could they possibly survive?</p><p></p><p>But sometimes there is just such helplessness. Panicking is useless, if you're meant to die, you'll die. </p><p></p><p>Just as the squad members were paralyzed with fear and their minds went blank, they saw a figure suddenly dash out, rapidly charging forward while dodging left and right to avoid the incoming bullets.</p><p></p><p>"What...there was no order to charge?" Many of the soldiers were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But the squad leader instantly snapped out of it, realizing that charging forward was their only chance at survival. He immediately jumped up and roared furiously, "Charge forward!"</p><p></p><p>The cannon's firepower was immense, with a long range. If caught in the blast radius, one would basically be done for.</p><p></p><p>However, this type of energy cannon also had an obvious limitation - a narrow firing angle and lack of the precision and flexibility of firearms.</p><p></p><p>As for why they didn't have guided missiles...</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't know either. He only knew that running forward would maximize his chances of getting out of the cannon's firing angle and surviving.</p><p></p><p>It was like how a tank may be powerful, but if you hid underneath its barrel, the tank cannon couldn't hit you.</p><p></p><p>At the squad leader's order, the soldiers didn't think twice, reflexively jumping up and activating their armor assist systems to charge forward with the leader.</p><p></p><p>"Zzzz~"</p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao and the others finally start moving, the octopus monsters also got excited, poking their heads out and aiming their guns to shoot at Suhao's group like it was a game.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the black cannon barrel lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Wooong~"</p><p></p><p>With a droning sound, a beam of light shot out, hitting Suhao's original hiding spot.</p><p></p><p>"KABOOM--"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous explosion, a deafening roar, accompanied by an intense shockwave that swept over Suhao's group, sending them flying forward.</p><p></p><p>Suhao only felt a powerful shockwave hit his back, throwing him into the air to fall face-first. One thought crossed his mind: "Didn't die, phew!"</p><p></p><p>"Whushshsh~"</p><p></p><p>He landed steadily, rolling a couple times to dissipate the impact force, then quickly scrambled back up and continued charging forward.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, he saw the octopus monsters in the fortress excitedly shouting and aiming their guns this way, "Pew pew pew~"</p><p></p><p>Suhao strafed to avoid the attacks, unable to resist raising his gun and aiming at the octopuses' eyes, firing off a shot: "Let me show you how it's done!"</p><p></p><p>"Zzzzt!"</p><p></p><p>A beam shot out from his gun, shattering an octopus's visor and drilling straight into its eye.</p><p></p><p>"KABOOM--"</p><p></p><p>The octopus's massive head suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Splortch!" Blue-green fluid and chunks of flesh sprayed out from the gaps in its armor.</p><p></p><p>That octopus died on the spot, collapsing limply.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's other comrades had just gotten up when they witnessed this scene, their eyes going wide in amazement: "That luck is insane!"</p><p></p><p>They unconsciously imitated Suhao's movements, strafing left and right as they charged forward.</p><p></p><p>The armor's mobility was excellent, giving the soldiers great maneuverability. Although they couldn't evade every bullet, the erratic long-range movements did help them dodge somewhat.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't resist taking potshots in return during the lulls, but their accuracy was pitiful - being able to hit an octopus's head was impressive enough, let alone shooting into their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The squad leader executed a roll after being hit by the shockwave, quickly getting back up. He instinctively mimicked Suhao's erratic charge, but soon realized that continuing forward would bring them into the enemy's accurate firing range!</p><p></p><p>They had only run a short distance, getting a bit closer to the military fortress. Charging further would be like walking into the firing line, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't understand, so he just ignored it and kept blindly charging ahead.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, there weren't many options - either charge in and kill all the octopuses to eliminate the threat, or get his remaining squad mates killed to eliminate the threat.</p><p></p><p>As a human, he was more inclined towards the first option - it didn't seem to make much difference, after all.</p><p></p><p>"The weak point is their eyes! One shot through the eye can blow up the whole octopus's head. This gun isn't completely useless!" After blowing up an octopus's head with one shot, Suhao's thoughts started flowing.</p><p></p><p>He had discovered the advantage of these energy guns - they were exceptionally stable, accurate and had decent firepower.</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, it was the perfect weapon.</p><p></p><p>No matter where the weak point was, as long as his attacks were effective, he'd blast it to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The death of that one octopus didn't scare the others, but rather enraged them for some reason, causing them to attack Suhao's group even more frantically.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's comrades suffered several more casualties as a result.</p><p></p><p>But Suhao didn't hesitate, strafing forward while firing back.</p><p></p><p>"Zzzt!"</p><p>"KABOOM--"</p><p></p><p>Every shot accurately drilled into an octopus's eye, blowing its brain apart.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the bullets firing from the fortress became fewer and lost their aim.</p><p></p><p>The situation was suddenly reversed, with the pressure on Suhao's group greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's pinpoint accuracy left his fellow soldiers dumbstruck: "Is this luck? When did Xu Shiqiang get so freakishly accurate?"</p><p></p><p>The squad leader also muttered to himself: "Is this kid Dasheng reincarnated as the Soldier King on the battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Then seeing the openings appearing one after another on the fortresses, with black cannon barrels poking out from every angle, he felt a shiver of fear.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he finally decided to lead the squad continuing to charge forward with Suhao for a bit, to get out of the cannons' firing arcs before reassessing.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the soldiers stunned, even the octopuses were shocked, feeling an eerie sense of déjà vu from RPG games where the protagonist massacres low-level mobs.</p><p></p><p>Some refused to believe it and tried to retaliate defiantly, to put that arrogant human in his place. But as soon as their eyes poked out, before the human could see them, they saw a blinding beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Then nothing.</p><p></p><p>Some smart octopuses suggested having several of them pop out and attack simultaneously, to see which one the human would shoot at.</p><p></p><p>But after that clever octopus died a few times in a row, no other octopuses made that suggestion again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the octopuses didn't dare poke their heads out anymore, trembling in fear as they hid and called for reinforcements - troops, robots, artillery, drones, all kinds of support...</p><p></p><p>But those probably wouldn't be very useful against Suhao either.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the midst of this intense attack, an extremely bizarre scene emerged: Elsewhere it was chaos with all sorts of crazy weapons being deployed, while in Suhao's area his squad just strafed around dodging the aimless bullets, passing through the most dangerous area almost unimpeded to reach the spherical fortresses.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the squad leader and the other soldiers felt like they were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's maneuvers completely baffled them.</p><p></p><p>Even movies wouldn't dare depict something so outrageous. Indeed, reality is stranger than fiction.</p><p></p><p>The squad leader was out of ideas, and his ideas didn't matter anymore anyway - they had already charged right up to the enemy's doorstep, what else could they do?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>So Suhao charged into the cluster of hemispherical fortresses, roaming around. Whenever he saw an enemy, he'd blow its head off with one shot. If he didn't see any, he'd ignore them and just focus on dodging the incoming fire.</p><p></p><p>As for the octopuses hiding in the fortresses...</p><p></p><p>The fortresses' black metallic shells were extremely durable - Suhao currently had no way to break through them. So he could just ignore them, as the octopuses that didn't expose themselves posed little threat for now.</p><p></p><p>The real threats were the stray bullets and explosives flying around, which he just had to carefully evade.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's comrades followed closely behind him, charging recklessly with bravado.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone had Suhao's skills, and as Suhao advanced deeper, the soldiers trailing him suffered more and more casualties.</p><p></p><p>Ten...eight...five...</p><p></p><p>But Suhao, with his attention fully focused, was oblivious to this. All he had to do was kill all the octopuses to completely eliminate the threat.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, Suhao had reached the central area.</p><p></p><p>Here stood an immense hemispherical fortress that seemed to be the main base, about 400 meters in diameter. A single person standing before it looked utterly tiny.</p><p></p><p>As Suhao approached, he faced extremely intense retaliation.</p><p></p><p>After taking out all the exposed octopuses, he stopped in front of this giant fortress.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings fell deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Suhao was stumped!</p><p></p><p>Having the vocabulary didn't mean he could express himself, but he could still understand what others said.</p><p></p><p>"Dammit! Dasheng you little...! How dare you disobey my orders! I told you to stop - but you just keep blindly charging ahead! Fuck's sake..."</p><p></p><p>Ever since Suhao had charged in, the squad leader behind him had been cursing up a storm. Suhao thought he was issuing orders, so he ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Only after the little AI translated it did he realize the curses were directed at him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but wonder: "Huh? How did it end up being just the two of us left..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao finally turn around, the squad leader was almost moved to tears: "Fucking hell!"</p><p></p><p>A new journey begins~</p>

        <h1>Chapter 831</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Writing a consciousness information specific information retrieval program, the fastest way is to conduct a lot of experiments, and coincidentally there were a bunch of pirates in the small world for him to experiment on.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao's progress was very fast. On the sixth day, he obtained a highly accurate 'Ontology Location Automatic Retrieval Program'.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Suhao secretly returned to his ancestral land through the positioning stone, found other red golden dragons to test, and the results satisfied him greatly.</p><p></p><p>"In theory, the consciousness information of this Zhen Tian deity should also be cracked within a few seconds. However, I still need to try it myself."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's next plan was simple - to wait for the Zhen Tian deity to plant a soul seed in him, to experience what soul power really is. After successfully planting the soul seed, he would find an opportunity to teleport the deity's avatar to the small world, and then capture the deity's main body.</p><p></p><p>With the deity's main body, further research would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>As for being disrespectful to the deity, and the impact on the whole world after capturing the deity...</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not care much about that.</p><p></p><p>In his view, as long as he cracked the secrets of the deities, whether these eighteen deities existed or not was irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>If they cooperated with him, he couldn't be bothered to manage the deities' lives and deaths. If they were too stubborn, he might have to use some brutal methods to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to know what soul power was, and what kind of existence the Ten-Colored Plate was. He had no intention of doing anything to these deities.</p><p></p><p>The best was a win-win situation. If a win-win was not possible, then Suhao chose to win alone.</p><p></p><p>The awakening ceremony day came soon. Under the 'encouragement' gaze of the mother dragon Shaduo and the two young dragons, Suhao and a group of eighteen young red golden dragons stood in the square outside the temple.</p><p></p><p>This dragon Suhao, sandwiched among a group of huge red golden dragons, was very conspicuous, attracting frequent glances from all the dragons, wondering what this young dragon was here for.</p><p></p><p>There were even young red golden dragons who 'kindly' asked Suhao to leave, lest he be accidentally stepped on by other dragons. When Suhao refused, they even wanted to take action, but were beaten up by Suhao's two punches and couldn't tell directions.</p><p></p><p>Very smoothly, Suhao beat down all eighteen young red golden dragons present, to avoid future troubles...</p><p></p><p>So there was a large empty space around him, with no dragon daring to approach within ten meters of him. They all looked at this small young dragon in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"What are the young dragons eating these days to grow up so ferocious..."</p><p></p><p>The so-called awakening ceremony was very simple. On the day of the awakening ceremony, the deity of the red golden dragons, Zhen Tian deity Nati, would descend here. Then the deity Nati would cast a spell on each young red golden dragon participating in the ceremony, assigning them a clear task. The young red golden dragons who completed the task would gain the qualification to awaken. Those who did not complete the task would try again next year...</p><p></p><p>Around noon, a huge red golden dragon that looked basically the same as the giant dragon in the temple descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>With wings spread, its shadow enveloped all the waiting young red golden dragons. As its feet landed, a muffled sound rang out, and a powerful pressure descended upon this place, sweeping outwards.</p><p></p><p>The young dragons, overwhelmed by this pressure, could not help but feel their legs go weak, instinctively crouching down and loudly welcoming: "Greetings to the revered Zhen Tian deity - Your Majesty Nati!"</p><p></p><p>Nati glanced at the dozen or so young dragons present, very curious as to why these dozen dragons looked so battered. His gaze paused on Suhao for a moment, even more puzzled as to how a tiny one had snuck in...</p><p></p><p>Nati thought to himself: "This year's ceremony is different from previous years."</p><p></p><p>But he did not care much about these irrelevant details. Raising his head full of majesty and looking down, he said: "My subjects, by successfully completing this ceremony, you will become adults and powerful red golden dragons. But before the real ceremony begins, you must earn the qualification to participate through your own efforts."</p><p></p><p>The young red golden dragons listened with bated breath, their heartbeats quickening like students entering an exam room.</p><p></p><p>The awakening task was different every year, and they had made many preparations, hoping this time's task would match the training they had done.</p><p></p><p>Nati said slowly: "This awakening task is very simple."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to a huge snow-capped mountain in the distance: "Before sunset, retrieve a handful of snow from the Rainbow Snow Mountain."</p><p></p><p>All the young dragons' eyes were drawn to that snowy mountain, stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of this year's test was a bit high!</p><p></p><p>One had to know that snow would melt.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Nati cast a soul technique on each young dragon present to record the process of this task.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "My subjects, set off! I look forward to your performance."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a childish voice said, "What about me? Why don't you cast that soul technique on me? I want to participate in the awakening task too."</p><p></p><p>All the dragons turned to look at the small young dragon in the center of the field, including the deity Nati.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze could not help but fall on the confused little wings on Suhao's back, like a chick that had not grown feathers yet. Could such wings even fly?</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>The young dragons wanted to laugh but did not dare.</p><p></p><p>Nati chuckled: "I very much admire your courage, little one."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he casually cast a soul technique on Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded in satisfaction, then spread his tiny wings and flapped them lightly. To the astonished gaze of all the dragons, he took flight and flew towards the Rainbow Snow Mountain...</p><p></p><p>The young dragons' jaws nearly dropped to the ground. Even the well-traveled deity Zhen Tian Nati was slightly stunned, looking at Suhao's departing figure with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shaduo watching from afar gradually became dumbstruck. The young dragons Chipu and Molly also stared wide-eyed at the flying Suhao, imitating his movements by flapping their wings, but no matter how hard they tried, their feet remained firmly planted on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons' little souls were hurt again. They just could not understand why, with the same movements and posture, their third brother could do it while they could not.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the young dragons reacted and spread their wings to fly towards the snow mountain, chasing after the young dragon's figure.</p><p></p><p>But then they found that no matter how hard they sped up, they could not catch up to that young dragon. The distance only grew further and further until he disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed very bizarre to the young dragons.</p><p></p><p>As they struggled to fly against the raging winds approaching the snow mountain, they found that the little young dragon had already cupped a large handful of snow and was returning. Those tiny wings were flapping rapidly, leaving behind almost only two afterimages.</p><p></p><p>Watching that young dragon disappear from their sight again, the young dragons could no longer hold back and began exclaiming with their companions:</p><p></p><p>"Is that a young dragon? Flying faster than even my father, it's unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Do you still need to ask? That's definitely a young dragon. I just don't understand how wings like that can fly."</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, we were all beaten down by this ferocious young dragon today. If you still look at this young dragon normally, then you'll never find the answer to your question."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect the young dragons born recently are all this powerful. I've developed a bit of fear towards these seemingly weak creatures..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the legendary genius of the Golden Dragon Clan? I've gained some insight."</p><p></p><p>"Even a genius can't reach this level. I think he must have eaten something incredible to become so ferocious. Let's ask about his diet later..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The young dragon Chipu pointed into the distance and flapped his wings excitedly: "Look Mother Shaduo, the third brother is flying back."</p><p></p><p>Mother Shaduo and the young dragon Molly followed Chipu's finger and saw a small young dragon flapping its wings exaggeratedly, flying back towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>Mother Shaduo exclaimed: "I didn't expect Leian to be able to fly so fast, almost as fast as me. But the question is, when did he learn to fly? I don't remember teaching him..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao returned to the square in front of the temple with the snow, placing the not-yet-melted handful before Nati and saying: "I have completed the awakening task. When can you hold the awakening ceremony for me?"</p><p></p><p>The dragon Nati looked at Suhao with a strange gaze and replied: "Well done, little one. You have earned the qualification to participate in the awakening ceremony. Now, you just need to wait patiently here for the other trial golden dragons to return, then I will perform the awakening ceremony for all my subjects who have completed the awakening task."</p><p></p><p>He was extremely curious about this little young dragon and did not mind planting a soul seed in him, then taking him back to study what gave this tiny young dragon such tremendous power - something unprecedented in the history of their Golden Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>During this little young dragon's round trip to the snow mountain, he had been observing through that soul technique.</p><p></p><p>He could confirm that this little young dragon did not have the slightest fluctuation of soul power, meaning this was purely physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Nati thought to himself: "Perhaps this is a mutant golden dragon, the best physical form prepared for me by the Golden Dragon Clan."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 862</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After imprinting the twin-ring seal on the pirate, Su Hao immediately began various tests.</p><p></p><p>The results were even better than he had imagined. Without needing to act in person, he could freely teleport this pirate to designated locations within the entire Xianghu Galaxy System that he could perceive, and could summon the pirate back at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Invincible!"</p><p></p><p>While the twin-ring seal was successfully implanted on a human being, it didn't mean it could be smoothly implanted on a Baijiale species.</p><p></p><p>After sending the nearly soul-departed pirate back to the 'Game Paradise', which the pirates called the 'Divine Paradise', Su Hao found a Baijiale and studied the method of imprinting the twin-ring seal on its core.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he found a tiny material anchor point on the spherical core of the Baijiale and successfully imprinted the twin-ring seal on it. After testing, it similarly achieved the intended goal.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, the deities smoothly completed the mission of exploring a newborn red giant star as required, awaiting Su Hao's inspection before moving on to the second red giant star.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao sent eighteen divine avatars to summon all the deities back at once, then said with a smile: "Congratulations on completing the exploration mission of the first red giant star. Specific evaluations and rewards have been issued in your assistants, which you can check yourselves."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Barry was a bit bolder than the other deities in front of Su Hao, daring to say anything: "Lord Thunder, I have a question."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Ask."</p><p></p><p>Barry calculated with his fingers: "We were executing the exploration mission on the Baijiale home planet, earning a bit of credit rewards every day. So in half a year we earned nearly two hundred credits. But the new mission we're going on now only earns one hundred credits in half a year. Isn't that a huge loss? I don't know about the other deities, but I feel like I'm losing big here."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked surprised: "Wasn't there also a lottery reward?"</p><p></p><p>Barry: "I just drew it, thanks for nothing, basically worthless! Lord Thunder, I'm at a huge loss here..."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also claimed they had bad luck, only getting junk items.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said helplessly: "Then do you have any better suggestions?"</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, two eyes, three eyes...</p><p></p><p>They were all gesturing for someone else to speak up, causing a ruckus in the group chat, but no one was willing to be the one to stick their neck out.</p><p></p><p>Barry angrily roared in the group: "I was the first to point out the problem to Lord Thunder, now it's your turn to speak up, bastards! Lord Redlight, you're always the loudest braggart, hurry up and take the lead!"</p><p></p><p>Redlight: "If I speak up now, wouldn't that confirm that I'm the biggest braggart? I was going to, but now I absolutely refuse!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing no one speak up, Su Hao smiled and said: "Since none of you want to say anything, then I'll decide for you. How about this - I'll give each of you deities an additional 'twin-ring seal', which can be considered a 'life-saving talisman' that can protect you from danger when you encounter it. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>A life-saving talisman?</p><p></p><p>The first thing the deities thought of was the 'body talisman' from games, and they imagined the attribute: blocks one fatal damage.</p><p></p><p>"Whewâ€”"</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect there to actually be such a thing in reality. Lord Thunder is truly all-powerful!</p><p></p><p>The deities didn't think too much about it and readily agreed, as it could save their lives.</p><p></p><p>But the clever Nati hesitated and raised a doubt: "Lord Thunder, if you wanted to get rid of us, would this talisman be useful?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily: "What do you think? If I wanted to get rid of you, it would only take a thought, the talisman wouldn't have time to react."</p><p></p><p>The group erupted in noise again, all criticizing the fool Nati for being able to ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Nati, are you suggesting that Lord Thunder get rid of us?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Nati, if you hadn't sold the Taimeng Beast to me, I would have some words for you."</p><p></p><p>"What? Nati, you sold the Taimeng Beast to Fuer? Favoring beauty over friendship, you traitor!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the end, the deities all accepted the twin-ring seals imprinted by Su Hao. Seeing the strange purple twin-ring seal appear on their cores, they couldn't help but wonder: "Why is this so similar to the soul seeds we imprint on our believers..."</p><p></p><p>But now their lives were in Su Hao's hands, so they had no choice.</p><p></p><p>After imprinting the twin-ring seals on the deities, Su Hao said: "Alright, get ready, I'll teleport you to the second red giant star to continue your exploration. See you."</p><p></p><p>With that, he teleported away.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, the deities all received the mission information for the second phase, along with a teleportation countdown prompt.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Gu was surprised: "Huh? Lord Thunder left, he's not going to personally teleport us?"</p><p></p><p>Gu the Thunder God had always been observing Su Hao's various abilities. He noticed that every time they were teleported to a distant location, Su Hao would be there in person to send them off, leading him to believe that Su Hao's teleportation ability could only be activated at close range.</p><p></p><p>The other deities were also surprised upon hearing this, their minds racing with various guesses.</p><p></p><p>"3!"</p><p>"2!" </p><p>"1!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the deities felt the scene change. Looking around, they found themselves on an alien planet orbiting the red giant star, which was the mission location.</p><p></p><p>Then they began to doubt themselves: "Could it be that my observations about Lord Thunder's abilities were all inaccurate? Lord Thunder is truly too cunning!"</p><p></p><p>Another half year later, after the deities submitted their mission, they found a 'Return Countdown' on their assistant panel.</p><p></p><p>The moment the countdown reached zero, the deities once again felt the scene change, finding themselves in a lush, verdant place.</p><p></p><p>They recognized this location, it was the small world they often stayed in before.</p><p></p><p>"We're back just like that? Lord Thunder didn't even need to show up, just sending us back from who knows how far away?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Deity Nati laughed: "Haha, I thought Lord Thunder would come get us in person. Seems I thought too much, maybe in Lord Thunder's eyes our value has greatly diminished, not even needing his personal welcome anymore. Maybe he'll get rid of us all very soon."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Nati's thinking is rotten to the core. We haven't finished playing this game yet, don't drag me into wanting to die with you."</p><p></p><p>"It's unimaginable how Lord Thunder did this, what method is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, look at the assistant's prompt, we can rest for one day, and one day later we'll go to the next red giant star for exploration. There's also a countdown above."</p><p></p><p>"When the countdown ends, will we instantly teleport to the mission location again?"</p><p></p><p>The Night Deity Yongshi stared at the twin-ring seal on his core and thought: "I have this feeling it's related to this life talisman, but this was just a temporary reward Lord Thunder decided on, it shouldn't be."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was very satisfied with his masterpiece: "It's decided, the twin-ring seal will be my exclusive seal from now on."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he uploaded this mature skill to the group: "Yashan, Fengcheng, I've developed an interesting teleportation ability, take a look if you're interested."</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao said 'interesting', it immediately piqued their curiosity, and they both opened it to look.</p><p></p><p>After reading it, Yashan said in surprise: "This operation, it seems a bit familiar."</p><p></p><p>The two of them learned quickly, fully mastering it in a moment. Fengcheng excitedly designed his own pattern, two crossed swords inside a circle, like the character 'tian', and posted it to the group: "How's this, my Twin Sword Seal? Hahaha! Big bro Yashan, aren't you going to design one too?"</p><p></p><p>Then Yashan posted his seal, an outer ring with an infinity symbol inside: "This is my Infinite Seal."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng gave a thumbs up in praise: "Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at his own seal again, feeling the two swords were too ornate, so he simplified them to two plain bars crossed inside the circle.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked, the more satisfied he became: "Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>After designing their seals, the two of them couldn't wait to test out their new skill.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao focused his mind again, analyzing the information the deities recorded from the red giant stars, and simulating various environments in the small world to attempt generating divine power.</p><p></p><p>Over the nearly twenty years, as he continued his attempts, the formation arrays simulating the red giant star environment grew more and more massive, and more and more refined, while he became more and more adept at operating them.</p><p></p><p>In the small world, Su Hao controlled an avatar of a Baijiale captured from the red giant star, floating motionlessly in mid-air, then activated the formation arrays buried around the heavily fortified perimeter.</p><p></p><p>Soon, this area turned into a raging inferno, violent energies churning wildly, while Su Hao continued activating new arrays, simulating more and more environmental conditions of the red giant star.</p><p></p><p>This hellish scene had no effect on the floating Baijiale avatar, allowing Su Hao to calmly observe the subtle changes in this small world.</p><p></p><p>Time passed day by day, Su Hao repeatedly changing the arrays, repeatedly attempting to generate divine power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, after Su Hao added a type of radiation recorded from the red giant star into the array, he sensed an wondrous fluctuation in the simulated red giant star environment of the small world.</p><p></p><p>His heart skipped a beat, a powerful electric current coursing through his main body, pupils contracting then widening, filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Fluctuations of divine power, these are definitely fluctuations of divine power! Successfully generated divine power!"</p><p></p><p>He steadied his mind, carefully sensing the continuously increasing divine power fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he saw a small, shimmering sphere of seven-colored light appear at the center of the small world, twisting erratically like a water droplet tossed into the air.</p><p></p><p>This was - pure divine power!</p>

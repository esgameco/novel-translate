        <div class="content">
            <p>At the same time, a muffled sound came violently from within the head of the Feng Cheng Vajra Armor, connecting the chest cavities.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also fell backward with it, as if his brain was hit by a hammer blow! Opening his mouth, he sprayed out a large amount of blood and fell straight down from mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Dumont maintained his far-sightedness and muttered, "Is he dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lada laughed out loud and said, "Are you doubting my ability? Just that punch just now was bound to beat his brain into a pulp! The Armor of Scraping the Ground is dead! I'm still ranked in the top five in the world, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The other teammates also revealed a smirk, "Worthy of being Chief Rada!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, go over and take a look, that armor of his is good, pull it off and it's mine!" Radha put away his trench coat and went in the direction of Feng Cheng first.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" Lansing took a long breath, exited the 'concentric' state, rubbed his temples, and followed behind Lada.</p><p></p><p>Only Dumeng continued to maintain his farsightedness, observing Wind Cheng, and only after taking a few steps, he suddenly frowned and said, "Chairman, the Armor of Scraping Ground has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>The crowd stopped in their tracks and looked at Du Meng in unison.</p><p></p><p>Dumeng said, "Suddenly disappearing from his spot, I doubt he's still alive!"</p><p></p><p>Lada's fists tugged tight here, "Not dead? Du Meng, you give me a clearer look! That punch just now must have shattered all of his internal organs including his brain, who can't die?</p><p></p><p>When the five people quickly came to the place where Feng Cheng had fallen, where was Feng Cheng's figure?</p><p></p><p>Lada cursed: "His grandma's a fierce, this still let him run away? What the hell kind of perverted ability is this, does it still allow other source mages to mix?"</p><p></p><p>His four teammates disagreed. Chairman, your ability is the perverted ability, right?</p><p></p><p>The woman wearing glasses pondered, "Could it be that the other party is already dead, only that his instincts unleashed the source and transferred his body away?</p><p></p><p>Lada, however, would not carry such a fluke as he raised his fist and said, ''As long as we don't see the body and cut off his head, then he is not considered dead.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter, where can you run to? With my next punch, I'm going to blow everything inside the armor, out of the water."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Feng Cheng teleported and appeared in the middle of the experimental base, the [Fateful Son] ability quickly repaired the injuries of his internal organs, and after a moment, he let out a long breath of relief, his heart palpitating, "Almost died! Fortunately, the spiritual power structure organization did not collapse!"</p><p></p><p>This punch really caught Feng Cheng off guard, just a little bit short of complete physical death!</p><p></p><p>As long as one is careful, one can be called invincible, right?</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, it nearly shattered his internal organs and his spiritual structure nearly collapsed!</p><p></p><p>After he transformed into [Destiny Son], he habitually shifted his brain to a position a little below his neck at Yama's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>It was also this habit that saved his life during this attack, otherwise, the brain would have inevitably shattered into pieces along with it, and then would the [Fate Son] still be able to regenerate?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng slowed down and quickly thought of something, cursing, "Zhi Peng that fool even told me that there is only a six thousand meter attack range? Almost got me killed, it's better not to say anything if you're not sure!"</p><p></p><p>He made up his mind that in the future, no matter what Zhi Peng said, he wouldn't believe half a word of him anymore!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao listened to Feng Cheng's description and compared it to Feng Cheng's passing data, he was surprised, ''There's still this ability? It's a mountainous attack, isn't it! And the attack part can still be chosen by yourself, this is too foul! Normal people being hammered in the brain by him, who can still live ......"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said with excitement in his eyes, "If I can bring him into my lab ......"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at Yashan with wide eyes, "Boss Yashan you still dare to experiment on him?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "I've gotten used to doing experiments lately and I can't change that!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is indeed a good material for experiments!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "This ...... is too dangerous, right? If you're not careful and he hammers your brain, you're dead!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao rubbed this chin and said, "Didn't Yashan research a formation disk called 'Chemical Source Variable Suppressor'?</p><p></p><p>If the 'Chemical Source Variable Suppressor' is really ineffective, then let's take him out again! I'll improve on the 'Chemical Source Variable Suppressor' in the next few days and strive to achieve the ultimate suppression effect."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked, "Boss Wei, what about the Illuminati? Do I still need to look after it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan patted Feng Cheng's shoulder and said, "Feng Cheng, your kid still hasn't learned, if we don't let the Guangyao Society suffer a bit at this time, will they listen to us in the future?</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng: "Makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them dispersed separately, doing what they should do, as if the threat of Chief Radha had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng did not intend to care about the Kougyou Association, the Kougyou Association was caught in a bitter battle, being whisked around by Chief Radha.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the fast transfer ability of the Transit Sphere, the Light Yew Club would have been destroyed by Radha alone!</p><p></p><p>If the door of the Transit Sphere was open, with the inner and outer space connected, as long as Radha perceived the entity, it would have been similarly knocked down by Radha's punch.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of five days, the number of people in the Koyo Club had drastically decreased.</p><p></p><p>Lada had already made a big kill!</p><p></p><p>Darla had gone over the top!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>However, Zhi Peng could not get a response from Su Hao no matter how he called out, and after receiving a call from Feng Cheng, Feng Cheng said, "He was seriously injured when he went up against President Lada before, and he needs to recuperate for a while to recover and fight again! Hold on, if you can't fight, run far away!"</p><p></p><p>Zhi Peng wanted to cry!</p><p></p><p>There are so many people in Guangyao Association, there is always someone who can run, there is always someone who is unlucky enough not to be able to run!</p><p></p><p>Maybe it's close by?</p><p></p><p>Sending people to monitor won't work either, they'll die as soon as they get close. The various detectors placed along the way also lost their effect after being discovered by the other side!</p><p></p><p>Lada team, just like the mosquito into the mosquito net, turn on the light, it disappeared, turn off the light to sleep, it appeared in the ear "buzzing"!</p><p></p><p>So the set Peng ordered, all people hide into the transit ball, the channel will be completely closed ......</p><p></p><p>Then a bunch of people suffocated in the lack of oxygen, and can not help but venture out, just ventured out, was hit, and then can only be hastily transferred to another city, an infinite cycle.</p><p></p><p>Every time they are discovered, there are quite a few people being punched to death ......</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Lada crossed his arms and laughed up to the sky, the trench coat behind him was brought up by his aura and hunted, "This kind of gopher game, old me also likes it very much! I didn't expect to come over for a trip, but I actually encountered such an interesting activity.</p><p></p><p>It's too interesting, this game old me blows up, I can play for a year!"</p><p></p><p>Dumeng and the others sweated, why didn't they find this game fun?</p><p></p><p>The woman with glasses had a surprised look on her face, "Chief Chief, it can't be true that you can play for a year!"</p><p></p><p>Radha turned her head and glanced at the woman with glasses, sending a shiver down her spine, "That's right, I'm going to play for a year!"</p><p></p><p>After a while he suddenly laughed out loud himself, "Fooled you! Hahaha!"</p>

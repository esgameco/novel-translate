        <h1>Chapter 833</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao came before the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati and said, "My dragon mother Shaduo fully agrees with my decision."</p><p></p><p>The God of Holding the Heavens - Nati showed an obvious smile and said with a grin, "Of course, becoming a Dragon Envoy is the greatest honor for all mighty dragons. From now on, my glory will envelop you, making you one of the most powerful existences in this world. With my name, you can roam freely across the vast lands and heavens."</p><p></p><p>The God spoke extremely domineeringly, making the young dragons present have shining eyes like stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The God of Holding the Heavens - Nati slightly opened his wings, stretched out his claws and grabbed Su Hao, "Come with me, Ryan Oakes. From now on, begin your legendary life."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao did not dodge, allowing the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati to grab him. At the moment Nati grasped him...</p><p></p><p>'Space module transfer' 'Teleport'!</p><p></p><p>Air gushed in violently, kicking up a whirlwind of dust that gradually settled.</p><p></p><p>The young dragons exclaimed in amazement, "As expected of the great God of Holding the Heavens - His Majesty Nati. He came so domineeringly and left without a trace, disappearing in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of a deity, disappearing just by saying so. So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"I also want to learn by His Majesty Nati's side. If I could master such a traceless soul technique, that would be wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"That young dragon called Ryan Oakes is so lucky, I'm really envious."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the young dragons marveled, the dragon mother Shaduo was slightly dazed with a puzzled look, "Is this the ability of a deity? Why does it look more and more like Ryan's 'bullseye'...could it be that Ryan took His Majesty away?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she immediately shook her head to dispel the unrealistic thought, "How is that possible? Ryan is an obedient child, he would never disrespect His Majesty Nati, and has no reason to do so. This must be the ability of the God of Holding the Heavens - His Majesty Nati.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, His Majesty Nati is after all the ancestor of our gold dragon tribe. Perhaps he also has the 'bullseye' ability which is rooted in the bloodline of every one of us gold dragons. Ryan just happened to awaken His Majesty Nati's ability."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo quickly figured everything out, overjoyed yet with some reluctance. She looked at the round, ordinary stone in her hand and said to the two young dragons, "Chipu, Moli, let's go! Your brother has become the honorable Dragon Envoy. This is the glory of our family. You two will also become powerful gold dragons in the future, so strive to follow in your brother's footsteps!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, she led the two young dragons and slowly flew into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons kept looking back, full of reluctance and sadness in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they experienced the emotion of sadness. It felt very special yet made them extremely uncomfortable. Unknowingly, they swallowed the positioning stone that Su Hao had given them, feeling even more uncomfortable...</p><p></p><p>At this moment in the small world, Su Hao recorded the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati's information through Nati's claws grasping him, with a massive amount of blood energy frantically surging into Nati's body.</p><p></p><p>To prevent Nati's sub-consciousness from escaping his body like Yongshi and Bali before, Su Hao also built a new separate space in the small world, perfectly enclosing Nati's entire body like a glass cover conforming to his dragon form, restraining Nati's body completely immobile.</p><p></p><p>"This way, even if he realizes something is wrong, he cannot separate his soul from his body since there is no extra space outside. Now it's just a matter of reaction time."</p><p></p><p>After the sudden scene change, the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati was stunned for a second. He wanted to examine the surroundings but found his body completely immobilized. Moving his eyes around, all he saw was a hazy yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" At the same time, he also sensed a special warm flow circulating through his massive body, as if he was soaking in a hot spring, quite comfortable...</p><p></p><p>The incident happened too suddenly. With his experience, he could not figure out the current situation.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced to analyze the situation, but before he could think too much, he guessed, "Perhaps I was attacked by another deity, and my body was restrained by a soul technique."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he activated a soul technique specifically used to break restraints.</p><p></p><p>'Break Restraint'!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao realized Nati was using the Break Restraint soul technique. To prevent Nati from separating his soul too quickly, he slightly loosened the spatial restraint, allowing Nati to gain a bit of mobility.</p><p></p><p>Nati's eyes lit up, "I can move now, the Break Restraint technique is effective. A couple more times and I can completely break free of the restraint. I'll see who dares to attack me."</p><p></p><p>'Break Restraint'!</p><p></p><p>After Nati used the Break Restraint technique two more times in a row, he finally broke free of the restraint and regained freedom. His wings flapped as he hovered steadily in the air, observing the surroundings and contemplating his situation.</p><p></p><p>As for the young dragon he had casually grabbed, Nati ignored it. For the time being, he probably did not realize the problem lay with the young dragon in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao had completed recording Nati's consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>The moment the recording was done, this dragon's consciousness information established a connection with and synchronized to the Bouncing Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Guang immediately began decrypting the recorded consciousness information. Five seconds later, it successfully obtained the location of the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati's main body.</p><p></p><p>He had buried his main body under a nameless small island in the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Su Hao spoke, "Lord Nati, please wait a moment. I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>With that, he struggled free from Nati's claws and instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The God of Holding the Heavens - Nati stared at his now empty hand, completely baffled. His supposedly brilliant mind could not make sense of the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he realized the problem, "Oh no, my connection to my main body is severed!"</p><p></p><p>He began probing the surroundings, "Why is this? Where did Ryan Oakes go? Does he have something to do with it?"</p><p></p><p>He reviewed all the abnormalities he had seen from Su Hao and finally judged, "All of this must be related to Ryan Oakes!"</p><p></p><p>After teleporting to an uninhabited place outside the small world, Su Hao immediately activated his crystal armor to construct a gravity array linked to the 'Starry Network'. Based on the location information obtained from Nati's consciousness, he quickly searched for Nati's main body location in the 'Starry Network'.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao detected an anomaly under an uninhabited island and eventually found a colorful, intricately shaped board in a rock cavity.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao rejoiced, "This must be the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati's main body, the Ten-Colored Board. I've finally found it. He doesn't seem to have realized what happened yet. I should bring him into my small world now to prevent any accidents."</p><p></p><p>Once Nati senses something is amiss, he would immediately relocate his main body's position, making it much harder to find again.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly locked onto a huge rock on the island, activated the analysis program, then extended his mental tentacles to locate the rock's position. In less than a minute, Su Hao found it!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the God of Holding the Heavens - Nati's other sub-consciousness opened its eyes, full of confusion, "Why did my sub-consciousness suddenly lose connection? Could it be that another deity was lurking nearby and launched a sudden attack to kill me? But I did not sense the aura of any other deities.</p><p></p><p>As long as another deity's sub-consciousness enters my domain, I would definitely be able to detect their presence. It's impossible for me to be ambushed..."</p><p></p><p>Apart from being killed by other deities during battle, his sub-consciousness had never experienced such a situation before, leaving him unable to make sense of it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He went over the entire incident again, noting every abnormality and overlooking no detail. On the first pass, he subconsciously ignored that strange young dragon.</p><p></p><p>It was only on the second pass that he noticed the anomaly, "Could it be the young dragon Ryan Oakes? Among all the abnormalities present, he is the only one left. And my connection to my sub-consciousness was severed right when I grabbed him.</p><p></p><p>Viewed this way, Ryan Oakes must have something special that could either instantly kill my sub-consciousness or sever my connection to it the moment I made contact with him..."</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, he suddenly sensed a pink crystal-armored human appearing on the island where his main body was hidden. His expression changed drastically, "No good! My main body has been discovered!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Out of Su Hao's expectation, the hand-built 'balancing game' was cracked by a student after only a few months.</p><p></p><p>And the angle of cracking was very clever, only with the principle of 'Angular Momentum Gyroscope', instantly transmitting the wrong signal to the outside, the stealth in the 'Simulated Doom System' was completed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought it would take at least ten years to solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>One could only say that the thinking perspective of a genius was indeed different from the average person.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the skeptical look on both of their faces, Su Hao didn't explain too much and instead raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>From above came a crunching sound, the sound of steel bars breaking.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the hanging balls on the dome fell.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er both heard the sound and subconsciously looked up to see a large number of hanging balls smashing down from the sky, and immediately froze in place with wide eyes, and when they subconsciously wanted to run, they realized that the air around them was like gel, confining them both so much that they couldn't move, and they could only watch the hanging balls smashing down towards them.</p><p></p><p>Even screaming had been forgotten.</p><p></p><p>The weight of these small balls they had personally tried before, smashing down from such a high dome, there was bound to be no possibility of being spared.</p><p></p><p>"Finished! I can't believe I'm so scared that I can't move ...... "The two people were all disheartened.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Su Hao's mouth hooked into a smile as he softly said, "Set!"</p><p></p><p>All the small balls immediately came to a collective standstill, stopping at a place where the two could reach out and touch.</p><p></p><p>The two then realized that they had regained their freedom of movement and looked at the scene in front of them, stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This ......"</p><p></p><p>With a twist of Su Hao's finger, a large number of small balls spun up freely around them, as if a small elf was leaping and dancing in this space.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out again, a larger hanging ball came to his hand, constantly changing into various shapes, even dispersing into small balls the size of grains of rice one moment, and then gathering together to form a smooth hanging ball the next.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is immortal magic, want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong's knees went weak and he knelt down fiercely with a muffled sound, then he crouched down with his hands on the ground and knocked his head on the ground as he shouted, "Master is above, please accept my disciple's obeisance."</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gong Jia'er still frozen, he couldn't help but reach out and tug on her pant leg.</p><p></p><p>Gong Jia'er returned to her senses and also bowed down as Zhu Changdong did.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, ''Of course, you guys can only be considered as my registered disciples now, whether you can really become my disciples or not will depend on your subsequent performance.</p><p></p><p>I focus on talent and mind, the two of you are still talented, but your mind is not enough, so you still need to hone it more."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Su Hao reached out and tapped on the two men's heads, recording their consciousness information in the pinball space, while at the same time placing a 'double ring seal' on their eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he teleported away.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and the two of them touched their foreheads and looked up, where was Su Hao's figure still visible?</p><p></p><p>Then they saw the floating and rotating small balls as if they had lost their support, and they all smashed to the ground with a dull sound.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong asked loudly, "Master, when are you going to teach us Immortal Arts?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's voice resounded from the bottom of their hearts, "After graduation."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er were instantly petrified, "Bi ...... graduation?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice sounded from the bottom of their hearts, "Little Genius Learning System activated, I'm your assistant Xiao Tian, at your service."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Changdong and Gong Jia'er were once again confused, "Huh? Old Grandpa System? This is an element that was popular two or three hundred years ago, right ......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, both of their worldviews suffered an extreme upheaval.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"I still lack sufficient understanding of naturally born geniuses. The human brain's ability to think about problems and utilize its imagination is limited by its insights, but I think that true geniuses are not among them. They think in terms that are often unexpected and yield surprising results."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao returned to the pinball space and looked at the galaxies and 'balanced transport lines' simulated by Little Light, and couldn't help but reveal a smile.</p><p></p><p>The two students' deciphering of the 'balancing game' had brought a brand new idea to his research, which was to instantly transmit the 'wrong information' outwards, accomplishing stealth and making it impossible for the transport waves to lock onto the traveler who was the focus.</p><p></p><p>Years of research allowed Su Hao to understand that as long as there was no focal point, the transport waves would not be able to complete the locking, and the impact caused by the traveler would not be able to complete the rebound, but would be gradually digested by the entire huge 'Multi-focus System' to form a new balance.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if he really completed this piece of research and obtained a device that instantly transmitted misinformation outwards, then his main body would be able to obtain absolute freedom, and he would not have to worry about being killed by the backlash wherever he went.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he would also be able to solve another even more crucial problem: exploring the universe.</p><p></p><p>Exploring the universe was something Su Hao was bound to do, but the universe was too big, and he would need a massive amount of 'rovers' to help him gather information to explore the universe, then he would need to drop 'rovers' into various galaxies.</p><p></p><p>The problem came, these roamers were also an outsider to other galaxies, and would inevitably disrupt the balance of the galaxy, and thus be revolted by the galaxy, the roamers might have the ability to survive the revolts, but the living planets in the galaxy, would not necessarily have such good luck.</p><p></p><p>Should every rover be like the three of them, hiding in secondary space and manipulating their detachments to explore?</p><p></p><p>This was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>But if every person had a pair of 'concealment devices' with them, wouldn't they be able to avoid the effects of the Doom System? Wherever they went, they wouldn't have to worry about dangers appearing inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Hao intended to connect all the searched planets in the future with spatial methods of assembling together to form a vast earth and ocean, inevitably there would be creatures from different planets walking around and circulating with each other, then the 'hidden devices' made could safeguard the planet from being affected by foreign creatures.</p><p></p><p>"Delineate each planet into a region, and the 'hidden device' I made becomes a pass that can cross the region, something like a 'road guide' in the olden days."</p><p></p><p>Thinking a lot more along this line of thought, Su Hao felt more and more that this construction idea was feasible.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what kind of scene it will be in the future after the various worlds are connected to each other."</p><p></p><p>Prosperity, Destruction, Killing, Destruction, Creation ......</p><p></p><p>Any outcome will do.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao was looking forward to was being able to obtain new knowledge new systems from the to collisions of the various planets.</p><p></p><p>After all, for Su Hao, his entire body of abilities and knowledge, was relying on a variety of different knowledge and systems piled up, he was able to utilize more than ten or twenty worlds to do this extent, there was no reason for the 'infinite land' he created to do worse.</p><p></p><p>He believed that under the flow of time, he would inevitably be able to acquire more and more marvelous knowledge.</p><p></p><p>But now that the idea of the 'hidden device' was there, it wasn't that simple to actually bring it to fruition.</p><p></p><p>The 'balancing game' was just a small game that could only provide a feasible idea, the specifics of how to accomplish the concealment in the Doom System would require more in-depth research, and the one who could do that was none other than Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao quickly thought over the ideas, he exited the pinball space, took a long breath, and muttered: "Originally thought that after completing the discovery of the 'Luck Line', I could completely relax, like a retired old cadre like finding a shade to cool down and play chess and read a book or something, I didn't think that it was only just a few years ago, and then I had to continue the research. I didn't realize that just a few years ago, I would have to continue my research in seclusion again.</p><p></p><p>Haha, I am this kind of laborious life, stop but feel uncomfortable, there are things to do, can always make my heart more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Do it! Now I'm just about to get the tools for exploring the universe ready, and the real exploration of the universe, which is entirely mine, has just begun. It is far from time for me to rest."</p><p></p><p>After stretching his body, he sent a direct message to Yashan and Feng Cheng, "Yashan, Feng Cheng, I have a new research project now, and I need to go into full retreat for a period of time, exactly how long is not yet known. As for other things, you deal with them on your own, just follow the previous plan, there is no need to be too hasty.</p><p></p><p>We have plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>Two days ago I received two named disciples, I wanted to personally bring them, but now I think I shouldn't have the time, you guys arrange for disciples to help me guide them in their cultivation! Their brains are not bad, and they might be able to bring us some surprises in the future."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng were stunned, it had only been out of the gate for a short while, and they were going into seclusion again? And it still sounded like it was going to be a long time in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>After Yashan and Feng Cheng answered, Yashan added, "Boss Wei, the life planets searched during this period of time, I have conducted some simple research, the data and research results have all been uploaded, if you have time, you can take a look at it first, you might be able to get some new inspiration from it to help you solve your problems."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I'm in the habit of flipping through the new planet data you uploaded, if I come across something of interest, I'll take the initiative to go to you guys. Of course, if you guys encounter any problems, you can leave me a message, I will check it regularly and will reply if I see it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Understood Vee Boss."</p>

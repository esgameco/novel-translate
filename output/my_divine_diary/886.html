        <h1>Chapter 886</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the trickle of dimensional travelers has been intermittent, with none able to survive for as long as ten years.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao temporarily stopped his work of exploring the source by going against the dimensional waves. Instead, he stayed on the Crossroads Star, carefully observing the situations where different dimensional travelers were locked onto by the dimensional waves, collecting data and monitoring the fluctuations of the waves.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he summarized several points with fairly high accuracy:</p><p></p><p>1. Only consciousnesses descending from extremely distant space-time can be locked onto by the dimensional waves. Dimensional travel within the same galaxy cannot be locked onto by the waves.</p><p></p><p>2. There are no intelligent animals on the Blue-Purple Planet. After being reborn into this world, they would also be locked onto by the dimensional waves.</p><p></p><p>Non-intelligent animal consciousnesses are also locked onto by the dimensional waves when moving around, and soon encounter various predators, eventually dying.</p><p></p><p>Whether intelligent or not, once becoming a 'focus', the catastrophe system will naturally be constructed.</p><p></p><p>3. Animals transmitted from the Blue-Purple Planet to the Crossroads Star are also locked onto by the dimensional waves.</p><p></p><p>4. If the original consciousnesses of animals transmitted from the Blue-Purple Planet are erased, and the consciousness information of animals from the Crossroads Star is implanted instead - in simple terms, using the consciousness information of the Crossroads Star to control the bodies from the Blue-Purple Planet.</p><p></p><p>This greatly surprised Su Hao. Consciousnesses sent from the Blue-Purple Planet would become a focus and be locked onto by the dimensional waves, but the physical bodies sent from the Blue-Purple Planet would not become a focus. What was the reason behind this?</p><p></p><p>Subsequent experiments also proved this point - to become a focus of the catastrophe system, one must at least possess mobility and autonomy.</p><p></p><p>5. The impact they were having on this universe was accumulating, but because there was no specific focus, a complete 'catastrophe system' could not form. As time passed, the impactful energy was not fed back, but was gradually digested by the vast universe and returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>6. The birth of a dimensional traveler would become a new focus. The impacts caused by Su Hao's group that were not digested by the universe would likely be fed back onto the dimensional traveler. The death of the dimensional traveler would cancel out part of the impact and accelerate the universe's digestion of the 'impactful energy'.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Su Hao felt his safety had become more assured.</p><p></p><p>7. Except for gravity, the dimensional waves were almost unaffected by any other factors. Even gravity only had a minor influence on the waves...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao reviewed his conclusions repeatedly, trying to deduce where the endpoint of the dimensional waves was connected, with many ideas and possibilities, but unable to determine the real answer.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he set his sights on the 'gravity' item.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "Gravity...it can be simply understood as the outward manifestation of matter warping space-time. The dimensional waves are slightly affected by gravity, does this mean the waves have a certain relationship with matter? Or perhaps the waves are triggered by matter itself?"</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao continued contemplating and experimenting, time quietly passed.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional travelers with system enhancements did indeed survive longer than those without systems, their lives more tenacious. Under the deities' careful nurturing, they showed a tendency to thrive.</p><p></p><p>But few dimensional travelers could live until adulthood, always dying in various accidents.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the existence of dimensional travelers was to refresh the deities' knowledge of ways to die.</p><p></p><p>The deities secretly recorded the death processes of the dimensional travelers, even able to publish a book called 'A Thousand Death Methods of the World's Will'.</p><p></p><p>It made the deities cry out in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the Blue-Purple Planet, Ya Shan was also rushing to carry out transformations: the mechanical revolution, electrical revolution, automation revolution, intelligent revolution, superconductor revolution...</p><p></p><p>Hmm, scratch the superconductor revolution.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was very experienced in these matters. At his sweeping revolutionary pace, perhaps in a little over a hundred years, he could complete all the historical processes.</p><p></p><p>People of later generations might seriously study: In just over a hundred years, the world completed the leap from primitive society to modern society. Didn't anyone find this terrifying?</p><p></p><p>But no matter how they studied it, they would never find any strong evidence to prove their terrifying guesses were true.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>150 years later.</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's hands were the last two consciousness information pieces he had not thrown into the 'Experimental Material Station' - the brother and sister who had originally followed Su Hao's group on the path of tea and ceramics, Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ya Shan had more or less finished transforming the Blue-Purple Planet, after using up these last two dimensional travelers, he could go to the Blue-Purple Planet to harvest a new wave of high-quality consciousnesses.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao thought he might as well send out the brother and sister together.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in order to observe the impact of two foci together, he had tried sending out two dimensional travelers at once. Overall, the impact was not big.</p><p></p><p>It so happened that Su Hao observed a brother and sister falling into a lake on the Crossroads Star, drowning. He casually rescued them, then implanted Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei's consciousness information into these two siblings.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the older sister Cong Shuling became the younger sister, and the younger brother Cong Renfei became the older brother.</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, they remained silent for a long time, as if immersed in memories of their previous lives, an air of sadness and pain pervading.</p><p></p><p>Until another set of new memories was inputted into their consciousnesses, making them realize that something inconceivable had happened to them.</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "I remember my heart being pierced, powerlessly collapsing into a pool of blood, quietly awaiting death's arrival...</p><p></p><p>But why am I still alive now? It seems I...have become another little girl called Tali, with an older brother and a pair of parents with a good relationship. According to scattered memories, I just fell into a lake by accident. My brother jumped in to save me, but it seems he also couldn't swim, and we both drowned...</p><p></p><p>Why did this happen? Could it be that after death, one goes to another world and starts a new life with a different identity?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Cong Renfei: "I died...and I lived again...feeling a bit flustered. It seems I now have a new identity, I'm called Gail, a thirteen-year-old young boy.</p><p></p><p>I have a younger sister and a pair of parents with a good relationship. Just now my sister fell into the lake, and after I jumped in, I realized I couldn't swim, and ended up drowning...</p><p></p><p>Oh right, where's my sister?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei looked around and finally found his sister on the other side. He exclaimed happily, "Tali, you didn't die, that's great!"</p><p></p><p>If his sister had died, Cong Renfei felt he wouldn't need to return to the home of his original body, and would just wander the world instead. Otherwise, going back would only get him beaten to death by his parents.</p><p></p><p>When Cong Shuling saw Cong Renfei, she also relaxed and instinctively said, "Brother, you're still alive too..."</p><p></p><p>Neither of them knew that the soul within the other's body was actually their own sibling from their previous life. Facing this unfamiliar environment and strangers, they both instinctively hid their true selves and played their new roles.</p><p></p><p>And so, the new lives of these two dimensional travelers began.</p><p></p><p>Feeling damp and chilly all over, worried about getting sick, Cong Shuling said, "Brother, let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei was stunned. Go back? Although he had some memories, he didn't quite remember how to get back, only vaguely knowing the general direction.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei thought to himself, "It doesn't matter if I don't know, but does my sister not know either? I'll agree with her, then let her go ahead to find the way."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Cong Renfei said, "Okay, let's go back and change into dry clothes, it's uncomfortable being all damp."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling relaxed, thinking to herself, "I don't really remember how to get back either, but it's good this brother is here, I'll let him lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said, "Let's go, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "Yeah, okay."</p><p></p><p>Silence...</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling: "..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei: "..."</p><p></p><p>Neither took the first step, both wanting the other to go first.</p><p></p><p>Then they said in unison: "You go first!"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Then they looked at each other doubtfully, no longer speaking, both minds in a muddle, thinking of ways to make the other go first.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as the older brother, Cong Renfei could only take the lead.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "My sister once taught me to seize opportunities when they arise."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 715</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yashan awkwardly scratched his head and said, "Big Boss Wei, here's what happened..." </p><p></p><p>He then briefly explained the events that occurred a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Big Boss Wei, those people who caused trouble have been dealt with by us. It's been much quieter these past few years, and the negative news about you has basically disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As for Yonghua, I was worried she might get retaliated against if she went out, so I temporarily kept her here. You can decide what to do with her when you return."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded and looked down at Yonghua, "Think you're not smart enough? Easy, come see me again tomorrow and I'll modify your brain."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua didn't know what that meant, but she was excited that her great uncle agreed to her request and jumped up, "That's great!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said to Yashan and Fengcheng, "Since we've brought up intelligence, I have a new research task for you.</p><p></p><p>The mother bug of the star-eating insects has a special way of increasing intelligence, which I'll call the 'neural system stacking method'. It can continuously increase brain capacity and enhance the brain through egg-laying, thereby increasing intelligence.</p><p></p><p>The strongest mother bug I know of has immense intelligence and mental power, capable of controlling all the insects on a planet. Perhaps it can continue stacking further with no theoretical limit.</p><p></p><p>So I need you to study the mother bugs, analyze their neural system structure, how they stack neural systems, and how they build such a massive thought system.</p><p></p><p>If we can successfully decipher this, our brain power may achieve a qualitative leap."</p><p></p><p>The star-eating insects had very high overall value, including their "insect control method", "neural system stacking method", "molting mechanism of insect eggs", and "how they obtain nutrients and energy". However, Suhao alone could not complete all these research projects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was also very interested in studying the Compound Eye race...</p><p></p><p>Without anyone's assistance, it would take him who knows how many years to finish all these projects.</p><p></p><p>He still had even more core issues like "lifespan", the "doom system", and "mental power" to work on. There was too much for him to do.</p><p></p><p>If Fengcheng had matured by now, he would unhesitatingly assign him an independent task. But currently Fengcheng was only at the "basic computer" level, still needing to assist Yashan before reaching the "researcher" level.</p><p></p><p>Probably after a few hundred years of training, he would become proficient enough.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Big Boss Wei!" Yashan and Fengcheng knew Suhao had raised a small insect colony in another small world, but didn't expect these insects had such special qualities. Their interest was piqued.</p><p></p><p>However, studying the mother bug's brain and neural system stacking method would not be easy. They knew that anything involving the brain, no matter how simple it seemed, was actually extremely complex - just like the "source spiritual frequency" Yashan had researched in the previous world, which was just a small spiritual wave fluctuation issue but took him many years.</p><p></p><p>The "research neural system stacking method" task assigned by Suhao was clearly even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was prepared for long-term research. He asked, "Are we going to the insect colony small world to study that mother bug?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course not, I have other uses for that small insect colony.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this kind of research requires consuming a huge number of mother bugs. You'll need to take the search cubes to the star-eating insect domain to capture them, they're everywhere there.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you can also cultivate them yourselves, there are plenty of star-eating insect eggs in that domain."</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and added, "If you need experimental subjects, you can ask the captain for some death row inmates, or go capture some space octopus monsters. The octopus monsters have decent intelligence, so they're also suitable for this kind of experiment."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao said this, Yashan immediately understood. Basically: the project task has been assigned to you, figure out how to get whatever you're missing, encounter any difficulties and find ways to solve them, only the result matters not the process.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Big Boss Wei would have helped provide some equipment and conditions, even experimental ideas. Now he just directly provides the ultimate goal and research direction!</p><p></p><p>I, Yashan, will definitely not let Big Boss Wei down. Mother bugs! Mother bugs!! Here I come!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yonghua said in a small voice, "Can I... can I help?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Help? What help could she provide? She hasn't even graduated from university yet! If evaluated as an assistant, she would probably get the lowest rating of "clueless about everything"!</p><p></p><p>Yonghua excitedly jumped up.</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao said, "Next, we'll move bases! Relocate the main base to another planet, and establish transit small worlds at various locations in the star system."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Big Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The first thing Suhao did after returning was to move the small worlds placed on Bluemoon to the neutron star planets he had encountered over the past few years, leaving only one small world for contacting the captain.</p><p></p><p>No matter how harsh the environment on other planets, he could use small worlds to isolate a space and then transform it into a habitable area.</p><p></p><p>Suhao moved extremely quickly, completing the relocation of all six small worlds to various locations across the star domain in less than a day. The small worlds were spaced extremely far apart, linking the entire region.</p><p></p><p>Right after finishing the move, Suhao noticed the captain had entered the Bluemoon small world, searching everywhere for him.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't because the captain knew Suhao had returned, but because he came to check every day whether Suhao was there or not.</p><p></p><p>Suhao suddenly appeared in front of him and asked, "Captain, were you looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" The captain was startled by Suhao's sudden appearance and stumbled back a few steps.</p><p></p><p>After seeing it was Suhao, he calmed down and forced out a smile, "Daqiang, just popping out like that almost made my heart jump out!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked the captain over and exclaimed, "Captain, it's been a few years but how did you end up looking like this? Looks like you've gained at least 150 pounds!"</p><p></p><p>The captain said awkwardly, "Don't mention it! With my body type, I bloat up as soon as I stop exercising. If I hadn't rejoined the military for daily training a year ago, you'd see an even more...massive me right now!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao praised, "Living the good life!"</p><p></p><p>The captain said in a low voice, "Daqiang, where have you been these past few years? I couldn't find you anywhere."</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "I recently learned a new ability and went to try it out in space. Overall it felt pretty good."</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes widened, "What? You learned another new ability? That's awesome, I still haven't fully mastered all the superpowers you gave us before! Can you tell me what ability it is?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "I call it 'Star Traversing'. A plain and unremarkable ability that both humans and the Octopus race have."</p><p></p><p>"Star Traversing?" The captain didn't understand and directly asked about what he was most concerned about, "Daqiang, do you still have those 'star-shattering cubes'? What exactly is the manufacturing process? We plan to mass produce them as weapons against the Octopus race."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed lightly, "I'll organize the manufacturing processes for the 'star-shattering cubes' and 'exploration cubes' and give them to you sometime soon. But the precision requirements are very high and it's extremely complex - your technology may not be able to produce them."</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter giving away these unconventional weapons, as they had no impact on him anyway. The key was, without a 'source', no matter how many cubes were produced, they would be useless.</p><p></p><p>As for the people of this world researching the secrets of the 'source'...</p><p>In Suhao's view, that was almost impossible, not a matter of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The captain waved his hand dismissively, "No problem, we'll try first. If we can't do it, we'll figure something else out."</p><p></p><p>The captain believed as long as they had the technology and ideas, there was nothing humans couldn't make.</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while and inquiring about Suhao's needs, the captain asked in a lower voice, "Daqiang, has there been any progress on the 'teleportation' matter?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Teleportation is a bit harder, but I estimate in a few more years it should be about ready."</p><p></p><p>He would dangle it in front of them for a few years, then directly throw them a set of long-range teleportation arrays to tinker with...</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Suhao added, "Oh right, I need two more sets of equipment with the same configuration as before, plus one 'particle operation center' just like the one at the research institute. That thing is very important for long-range teleportation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing it was important for teleportation research, the captain agreed without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>The captain frowned, "Two equipment sets is fine, probably doable in a year. But the 'particle center' can't be made anytime soon, at least three years..."</p><p></p><p>Money and such wasn't important to the captain. He had to consider time costs, resource allocation, etc. As long as resources kept up and the output benefits exceeded the input, everything was negotiable.</p><p></p><p>In his view, what Suhao asked for wasn't much, it was even too little. What was the value of 'teleportation technology'? It couldn't be measured by money or resources.</p><p></p><p>Three years wasn't a very long time for Suhao, so he casually said, "Okay. Get them customized for me as soon as possible. By the way, how is your superpower development going?"</p><p></p><p>The captain demonstrated some rudimentary skills, then proudly said, "I'm already among the top experts, reaching Level 3 in the superpower rating system. Not bad, right?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "...Passable!"</p><p></p><p>The captain continued, "The Parliament plans to systematically disseminate the superpower cultivation methods. A few years later, they'll add a superpower exam to the college entrance exam to select talented individuals and form a superpower military force..."</p><p></p><p>The corner of Suhao's mouth curved up slightly as he thought to himself, "Perhaps in ten years, I'll be able to harvest a mature 'point-breaking-plane technique'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>My friends, please support me with your votes at the start of the month!</p>

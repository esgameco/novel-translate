        <h1>Chapter 637</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A long time ago, during the 'infectious disease' disaster of the Hogs, Suhao had already made some guesses about the way these strange psychic abilities worked.</p><p></p><p>Normally, human psychic power does not have the quality of being able to self-restore to its original form, like 'restoring metal'.</p><p></p><p>Once a change occurs, it really does change, and it's difficult to revert to the original state, just like certain special mental illnesses.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the strange abilities of the Hogs or Zhipeng seem extremely supernatural and unsolvable, but they essentially do not fundamentally change the human psyche.</p><p></p><p>This is just a 'projection', and as long as this projection method can be parsed, not only can those recorded strange psychic abilities be understood, but he may even be able to develop more interesting effects.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, similar to the Misfortune System, although Suhao guessed the principle, he could not find any trace of its operation.</p><p></p><p>To parse every step of how a special psychic ability runs, the possibility is currently not high, unless his observation tool 'psychic power' gets a fundamental enhancement, allowing him to directly observe the process of the ability manifesting.</p><p></p><p>He could only set it aside for now, and pick it up again to study when he has more time in the future.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Fengcheng, you can go offer a bouquet of flowers on our behalf!"</p><p></p><p>After all, they did have some connection...</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Okay, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Suhao suddenly thought of Axing and Awang, and couldn't help but ask, "Are those two guys Axing and Awang doing alright?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng smiled, "Those two are in great spirits now, telling stories about dealing with disasters on past missions to their grandchildren, extremely happy. They've gotten a bit old, but they won't die anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded without saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Happiness is not necessarily the case, perhaps it's just a forced smile out of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>The difference between immortals and mortals is manifested here - he has gained a long lifespan, while those he knew have grown old and passed away one by one.</p><p></p><p>These past fifty-plus years felt like the blink of an eye to him, but for ordinary people, it was almost their entire life.</p><p></p><p>A human life is truly too short, so short that before one can fully experience this world, old age arrives.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't gone to the cultivation world and mastered the core techniques of cultivation, by now he might have grown old like Axing, Awang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had wanted to find an opportunity to reunite with Axing and Awang, but after thinking it over, he dismissed this idea.</p><p></p><p>On the long journey ahead, those unable to stay by his side like Yashan Fengcheng are ultimately illusory.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue researching the 'Planet Virus'! I have a feeling success is not far off!"</p><p></p><p>After modifying the issues from the previous failure, Suhao began designing the newest 'Planet Virus' again, now version 3.2. It still had an ellipsoid shape, but was much smaller, only as big as a van.</p><p></p><p>This was the progress Suhao had made in structural techniques over the past decade.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen days later, a large metal ellipsoid was freshly made. Suhao knocked on its surface, making a thumping sound, and joked, "Hey 'Planet Virus' buddy, give me a break this time and last a little longer..."</p><p></p><p>After that, he transformed into [Fate Child], then transmitted himself and the 'Planet Virus' to Planet Key.</p><p></p><p>It was the same old spot. Without hesitation, he dropped it down.</p><p></p><p>The 'Planet Virus' spun as it rolled down into that bottomless pit.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>The ellipsoid instantly split open from the middle into left and right halves, flying in opposite directions. At the same time, dense swarms of small rocket darts shot out from inside the half-ellipsoids towards designated locations, piercing through anything in their path.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the designated locations, the rocket swarms exploded a second time, releasing special devices that almost instantly scattered and arranged themselves into a perfect ellipsoid by the time the left and right halves stopped.</p><p></p><p>The entire process seemed complex, but was completed in just two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Next, the focus system activated, and the material on the ellipsoid's cross-section began transforming into source pearls, piling up like mountains.</p><p></p><p>Then came the critical step that Suhao had struggled with the most, failing countless times - the source conversion system.</p><p></p><p>Using these source pearls to convert into the 'temporary product of the material system' as the physical structure of the 'replicated Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>His heart raced as his mind intensely watched every subtle change below.</p><p></p><p>The main structures of the two ellipsoid halves disassembled into thousands of small blocks with indentations that mixed with the piles of source pearls.</p><p></p><p>Each small block could precisely absorb a source pearl into its indentation. It seemed chaotic yet orderly.</p><p></p><p>Suhao breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "Matching successful!"</p><p></p><p>The next step was precise work - each small cube was an extremely sophisticated source device containing all the information of the entire 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>Once a small cube successfully absorbed a qualified source pearl, it could use the pearl to rebuild a new 'replicated Planet Virus' from nothing using the 'temporary product of the material system'.</p><p></p><p>Although the 'replicated Planet Virus' only had a lifespan of less than two hours, that was enough to complete the replication task.</p><p></p><p>Under Suhao's hopeful gaze, the small cubes began functioning. One by one, identical small cubes attached to source pearls and grew, appearing out of thin air like a Source Mage casting spells.</p><p></p><p>These small cubes automatically piled up around the original cube heap, squeezing and expanding outwards in an orderly fashion, gradually forming thousands of van-sized ellipsoids that even caused the ground to bulge slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, the replication was not complete - this was merely building the virus framework. The internal complex structures were still being constructed within each one.</p><p></p><p>Five seconds later, Suhao's eyes lit up as he exclaimed in pleasant surprise, "Replication successful!"</p><p></p><p>It took less than thirty seconds in total for one 'Planet Virus' to successfully replicate into at least five thousand replicas!</p><p></p><p>Let's give these five thousand replicas serial numbers, calling them 'first-level replicas'.</p><p></p><p>Assuming these five thousand 'first-level replicas' scattered and each successfully replicated another five thousand in thirty seconds, that would yield 25 million 'second-level replicas'. Then there would be 12.5 billion 'third-level replicas'...</p><p></p><p>If all went smoothly, in just one hour there could be 5,000 to the power of 120 replicas!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, while first-level replicas had a two-hour lifespan, when they became second-level replicas, their lifespan refreshed to another two hours. In theory, as long as there were enough materials, replication could continue indefinitely!</p><p></p><p>As Suhao did some simple calculations, the five thousand 'first-level replicas' below showed new changes.</p><p></p><p>The 'random gate' program activated.</p><p></p><p>The over five thousand 'first-level replicas' randomly connected to locations within a 200km range, then vanished from their original spots, randomly transported away.</p><p></p><p>After the successful transport, the 'first-level replicas' immediately burst open, splitting into left and right halves shooting in opposite directions, repeating the previous replication process.</p><p></p><p>Thirty seconds later, Suhao smiled, "Success with the 'second-level replicas'!"</p><p></p><p>It continued replicating like this. There would eventually come a time when enough replicas could make the entire planet burst, with all replicas simultaneously detonating to easily launch the whole planet into deep space.</p><p></p><p>"The 'third-level replicas' succeeded too!"</p><p></p><p>"Fourth level..."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth level...awesome virus! Keep going!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>But soon, the smile on Suhao's face gradually disappeared as he said in puzzlement, "Huh? Why did it stop..."</p><p></p><p>When the 'Planet Virus' developed to the seventh-level replicas, just as it seemed it could press on and completely convert the massive Planet Key, a large number of replicas lost their replication ability and stalled.</p><p></p><p>Suhao waited a bit longer, but the farthest could only replicate to the seventh level before stopping! They were scattered everywhere, still operating according to the program, but unable to produce eighth-level replicas.</p><p></p><p>Because the 'focus system' had collapsed, unable to obtain more source material.</p><p></p><p>Suhao stood on the ground and casually summoned one of the small cubes that could no longer function properly into his hand. He carefully observed it, recording it into his dimension orb to compare with the original small cube.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao discovered the problem: "I see, the structure of the seventh-level replicas deviated slightly from the original virus body structure. It was this tiny deviation that caused the virus to be unable to continue functioning..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao declared another failure.</p><p></p><p>Taking the sample, he quickly left Planet Key.</p>

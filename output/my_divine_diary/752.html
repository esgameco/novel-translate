        <h1>Chapter 752</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The first to learn about Suhao moving the large blue crystal was the human leadership.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the video, the captain immediately brought it to Suhao, wanting to confirm if the person in it was him.</p><p></p><p>Although they looked alike, it was better to confirm in person.</p><p></p><p>However, instead of meeting Suhao, he met Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the video, Fengcheng said, "Ah, that's definitely the old master Wei. What's there to be so surprised about? Isn't it an easy thing to do?"</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes widened, "Easy? Didn't you see how huge that blue crystal was? How could one person possibly lift that? Even if Xu Shiqiang was made of energy blocks, he couldn't do that, could he?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed, "Look at you, so inexperienced. The old master Wei could easily lift crystal stones dozens of times larger than that. Not to mention the old master, even a weak assistant like me could do that."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked completely unconvinced, his expression saying 'don't lie to me'.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng just smiled and didn't care whether he believed it or not, "Alright, I thought it was no big deal, but if there's nothing else, I'll be going."</p><p></p><p>The captain hesitated, but still asked, "What is Xu Shiqiang doing? Researching dream stones?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng replied, "Yes, the old master has been focused on researching dream stones recently. Nothing special, we shouldn't disturb him."</p><p></p><p>The captain came with many doubts and left with even more doubts.</p><p></p><p>The only gain was confirming that the person in the video was indeed Xu Shiqiang!</p><p></p><p>At the meeting, they first played the video of Suhao lifting the giant blue crystal, then Xia Qingjun said, "After confirmation, the person in the video is Xu Shiqiang. It's unimaginable for a human to possess such strength. I don't know how you all view this."</p><p></p><p>These people had always advocated viewing the world through an objective scientific lens, not believing in superstition, using facts and evidence to speak.</p><p></p><p>But now, faced with the 'facts' and 'evidence' in front of them, their worldviews were somewhat shattered.</p><p></p><p>How could they view this?</p><p></p><p>They could only view it as a deity!</p><p></p><p>The gods and immortals of legend could indeed move mountains and reverse rivers like Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>At this point, someone asked, "Looking across the human race, if anyone could do this, it would be Xu Shiqiang."</p><p></p><p>Others nodded, "Indeed, thinking back, Xu Shiqiang has brought many 'unimaginable' things. For him to do this is within reason..."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite helpless, I considered myself well-traveled among humans, yet I cannot fathom how Xu Shiqiang reached this level."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Xu Shiqiang is the most special individual? With the vast number of humans, the birth of such a superhuman genius 'new human' is understandable."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun directly refuted, "From what I know, Xu Shiqiang is not the only special one. His two assistants Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng can also do what was shown in the video, or even more."</p><p></p><p>Silence!</p><p></p><p>Simply unbeatable!</p><p></p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even know what made Xu Shiqiang strong, let alone how strong he was.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun smiled slightly, "Perhaps the entire human race combined is no match for the three of them."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he added, "That's still an understatement. It should be that humans, the Eight-Armed race, the Compound Eye race, plus the Star-Eaters, are all powerless against those three."</p><p></p><p>After Xia Qingjun finished speaking, he looked around.</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately understood why he had called this meeting: to have some awareness of the sanctity of these three humans, and on certain issues, not be ungrateful or offend them.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but think, "The leader really overestimates us. With our small stature, how dare we offend Xu Shiqiang? We were utterly convinced after he repelled the Eight-Armed race's fleet the first time!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, even standing before Xu Shiqiang, they wouldn't dare to stand upright while speaking.</p><p></p><p>On the Compound Eye side, they also saw the footage of Suhao lifting the massive blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>What they didn't know was that only three humans could do this.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they unanimously believed that many humans could achieve this feat, just like how foreigners think all Chinese people know kung fu.</p><p></p><p>Then they fell silent, no longer clamoring that many 'star priests' were Compound Eye traitors.</p><p></p><p>After all, such a huge gap in strength was simply unbridgeable.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute strength, their inner arrogance was shattered.</p><p></p><p>It was one thing that their intelligence wasn't as high as humans, but the key was that their physical abilities were also inferior, by an enormous margin.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, humans were all deities!</p><p></p><p>It was after this incident that the Compound Eye race became more obedient.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after confirming the minimum size of the dream stone, Suhao decided to conduct a second experiment: whether the blue crystal converted from source energy could help him enter the 'planetary network'.</p><p></p><p>In Suhao's classification, blue crystal was a mixture.</p><p></p><p>But the compounds that made up blue crystal were not complex. In the previous world, Yashan had already converted all the compounds that make up blue crystal from source energy.</p><p></p><p>Now if he wanted to obtain blue crystal, the steps were simple, just like converting spiritual power - first convert the necessary compounds from source energy, then combine them in different orders to get the blue crystal product.</p><p></p><p>The structure of blue crystal was much simpler than that of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>With the powerful brain amplification, in just a few days, Suhao mastered the method of converting source energy into blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>On the Planet of Gods, he was still in the same location as before.</p><p></p><p>Suhao moved away from the ten-kilometer diameter blue crystal to another open space.</p><p></p><p>"There are two structures in blue crystal - one is the blue crystal itself, and the other is the special free particles contained within.</p><p></p><p>I'm not sure if consciousness can access the 'planetary network' because of the blue crystal itself, or because of the free energy within it.</p><p></p><p>So first I'll convert source energy into blue crystal, but intentionally remove the free energy within.</p><p></p><p>One try and I'll know."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his palm and began constructing a special small world.</p><p></p><p>In just five seconds, a massive and complex small world was built.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge and intricate small world with a diameter exceeding ten kilometers would have taken at least half an hour to complete before he got the external brain, but now it only took a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>The amplification effect of the external brain on him was evident and far beyond what was possible in the previous world.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a large number of source pearls were transmitted into the small world, quickly filling half of it.</p><p></p><p>"This many source pearls is enough!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao closed his eyes, and his vast divine consciousness entered the small world, connecting to all the source pearls.</p><p></p><p>'Convert'!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a large number of 'mini-mes' scattered, each giving a conversion 'vector' to the source energy at specific locations.</p><p></p><p>The small world, originally bright white from the source pearls, gradually dimmed as various tiny lights flickered.</p><p></p><p>In just two seconds, the first step was complete.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought inwardly, "Next is the second step: combination!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the lights of various colors began to flow and intersect, swirling and converging at one point.</p><p></p><p>And at the point of convergence, a tinge of blue light emerged.</p><p></p><p>That was Suhao's goal - blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>However, the amount he wanted was far more than just that.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Suhao, the lights of various colors swirled faster to complete the combination.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they formed a huge vortex, like a black hole in the universe devouring countless planets.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the volume of blue crystal in the small world rapidly expanded - ten meters in diameter, a hundred meters, one kilometer...</p><p></p><p>Until it finally stopped at ten kilometers in diameter!</p><p></p><p>Exactly as Suhao had calculated, without the slightest deviation.</p><p></p><p>Suhao opened his eyes and took the huge spherical blue crystal out of the small world, placing it to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The source-created blue crystal slammed into the ground, sending a deafening rumble as a large section of the ground caved in.</p><p></p><p>The powerful tremors spread far, once again triggering all sorts of detectors.</p><p></p><p>Soon, cameras large and small automatically turned towards Suhao's location...</p>

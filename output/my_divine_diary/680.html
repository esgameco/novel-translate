        <h1>Chapter 680</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suhao's five-day vacation was over.</p><p></p><p>As a naval soldier, he had to participate in daily training sessions covering all kinds of content - machinery maintenance, machinery operation, combat simulations, energy loading, reaction drills, and more...</p><p></p><p>To Suhao, these trainings were meaningless wastes of time, except for honing his spiritual power through meditation.</p><p></p><p>He pondered, and decided to ask Captain Yan for another leave of absence...</p><p></p><p>The excuse would be "I expended two months' worth of energy in the previous battle, so I need to rest and replenish." Explaining the situation properly, surely the captain would understand!</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked in surprise, "Could there really be anything important going on now?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan shook his head, "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Well it can't be that urgent. Captain, I want to request two months of leave..."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan's eyelid twitched, immediately interrupting, "Don't ask me about leave, go find the Commander. That's it, you go now!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately ran off.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said speechlessly, "I didn't even finish speaking, don't reject me so quickly...Going to ask the Commander for leave is also fine, as long as I can justify the reason!"</p><p></p><p>So Suhao went to the command center.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the Captain and Commander Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Suhao saluted and stated his purpose, "Captain, Commander Jiang, I want to request two months of leave!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain and Commander Jiang: "......"</p><p></p><p>What was this situation, coming in and immediately asking for that, making it seem like they were some dedicated leave-granting department.</p><p></p><p>The Captain glanced at Commander Jiang, who got the hint, cleared his throat and said, "Xu Shiqiang! Let's put aside this leave request first, we want to ask you some things."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Sure, what would you like to ask?"</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang asked, "Those eight-armed aliens on the enemy battleship, were they really shot dead by you?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao looked surprised, "Huh? I thought I detailed the whole process in my report already, didn't you two see it?"</p><p></p><p>Damn, this soldier was talking back! They were the ones asking questions here? When did a lowly naval soldier dare question his superiors like this? Where was their authority?</p><p></p><p>You say what? He's a hero? Oh, never mind then!</p><p></p><p>Like how did you breach the battleship's hull and precisely shoot the eight-armed aliens inside? From the data I've seen, apart from the hole blasted by the Yuanxing cannon, there was no other damage to the battleship.</p><p></p><p>Professional data analysis couldn't find an answer, so we want to hear your explanation."</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "You're asking about that? Simple. First, the energy cannon didn't actually hit me, it just looked like it did - I dodged it! In an intense battlefield like that, I'm not bragging, but normally no bullets can hit me!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain and Commander's facial muscles twitched uncontrollably: This guy really wasn't bluffing!</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "Second, as for how I hit the eight-armed aliens hiding inside the battleship, it's because I have an extremely powerful skill."</p><p></p><p>The Captain and Commander seemed expressionless, patiently listening to Suhao's account, but their hearts raced upon hearing this. What skill was so overpowered?</p><p></p><p>"???" The two superiors couldn't hold it in anymore, looking at Suhao like he was mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their confused looks, Suhao patiently explained, "You can understand it as an ability in the realm of imagination - any attack I lock onto is guaranteed to hit, 100% accuracy!"</p><p></p><p>Though Xu Shiqiang spoke seriously, the two superiors felt he was messing with them.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I know it sounds unbelievable, but that's how it is. Or you can think of it as a supernatural power."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain cleared his throat authoritatively, "Xu Shiqiang! Assuming what you say is true, can you prove to us the reality of this...'100% accuracy' of yours?"</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang nodded, "Right, we need to see some scientific basis. Just listening to you, we can't really understand."</p><p></p><p>They were still giving Suhao plenty of face. For any other lowly soldier, they might have already blown up, yelling curses.</p><p></p><p>Who would believe such nonsense? You're kidding, right?</p><p></p><p>What the two superiors didn't expect was that Xu Shiqiang actually nodded, "Of course, I can demonstrate it for you."</p><p></p><p>He looked around, spotting a lidded glass cup on the table, and casually picked it up, "May I borrow this as a prop?"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao handed the cup to the Captain, "Captain, please hold it and check if there's any issue."</p><p></p><p>The Captain didn't know what Suhao was up to, but inspected it as told, "No issues."</p><p></p><p>Of course not, he drank from it every day, how could there be an issue?</p><p></p><p>The Captain did as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually took off the small communication watch on his left wrist, then said, "Assume the glass cup is a battleship, and my watch is a bullet. Then by using my '100% accuracy' skill, I can send it straight into the glass cup, destroying the enemy."</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang's eyes lit up, "I get it, it's a magic trick! I love watching those, didn't expect you're also a magician, Xu Shiqiang."</p><p></p><p>The Captain understood, tightly covering the lid with his hand and smiling mysteriously, "Alright, let me see how you pull off this trick right in my hand!"</p><p></p><p>The glass, the lid, himself - none were planted accomplices.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe anyone could actually do this.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled faintly and flicked his wrist.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Following the sound, the two superiors looked at the tightly sealed cup to see the small watch bouncing around before settling down.</p><p></p><p>"Huh????" They froze, not sure what just happened.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "That's 100% accuracy."</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang's eyes quickly lit up like bulbs, exclaiming admiringly, "This magic trick is damn impressive!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain shook his head, taking out the watch to return to Suhao, "Wait wait wait! I didn't see clearly, let's do it again!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't mind, taking it back and retreating, "Ready? Here I go again!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain instructed Commander Jiang, "Old Jiang, you watch his hands, I'll watch the cup."</p><p></p><p>"Got it!"</p><p></p><p>Then the Captain stared fixatedly at the cup in his hands, covering it tightly, while Commander Jiang watched Suhao's watch.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao flicked his wrist.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>And the watch reappeared inside the sealed cup again.</p><p></p><p>The two high-ranking officers couldn't help but bug their eyes out, "This is..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao had completely bamboozled them.</p><p></p><p>Was this a magic trick? What sorcery was this?</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't speak, pointing at the Captain's pistol, "Captain, may I borrow that?"</p><p></p><p>The Captain didn't hesitate, immediately unholstering his gun and tossing it to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took the glass cup and casually threw it, firing a shot towards a door in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Shockingly, the glass cup flying in the reverse direction suddenly exploded, shards scattering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Suhao returned the gun, "Need another demonstration?"  </p><p></p><p>The Captain quickly regained his composure, putting away his gun and shaking his head, "No need, I believe your ability now. 100% accuracy is...interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Commander Jiang asked, "Xu Shiqiang, did you get injected with some new enhancement serum? How do you have this ability?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "I've always studied and trained very hard. This ability is the result of my learning and training efforts. Perhaps I was also quite lucky.</p><p></p><p>If you superiors also want such abilities, you can try studying and training diligently every day - maybe it will have miraculous effects too."</p><p></p><p>The Captain and Commander no longer knew what to say, ignoring Suhao's words and asking all sorts of bizarre questions, receiving vague non-answers in return.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Captain let out a long breath, "Xu Shiqiang, one last question! If more enemy battleships attack, can you still use '100% accuracy'?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Of course, no matter how many battleships like that come, I can take them all down. But I'll need enough quiet rest. Meaning, I need to request leave!"</p><p></p><p>The Captain and Commander: "......"</p><p></p><p>Suhao explained, "You know, using an ability like this expends a lot of energy. I need sufficient rest to recover."</p><p></p><p>The Captain asked, "How long of a rest?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "The longer the better."</p><p></p><p>The Captain: "Approved!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, after verifying your contributions, a report will be sent back to Bluray. You'll receive corresponding commendations, though the specifics are unknown for now. But you'll be awarded by higher-ranking officers once the Yuanxing returns to Bluray. Any other questions?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "No issues, the rewards are secondary."</p>

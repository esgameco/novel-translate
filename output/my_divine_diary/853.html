        <h1>Chapter 853</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Two years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's research had made great progress, but he was also stuck in a very critical position that prevented him from continuing to the next step.</p><p></p><p>He discovered through his research that the three factors of soul power 'core, divine light particles, and information', divine light particles and information could be obtained easily, and the difficulty was above the 'core'.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, as long as there was a small soul power seed, he could obtain more soul power through other conditions, such as deducting a little bit down from the gods, he could quickly produce soul power, many times faster than the way the gods harvested their followers.</p><p></p><p>But the soul power gained this way wasn't what he wanted, because as long as the core was the soul power of a deity, then all soul power gained down the line would be marked with the deity's traces.</p><p></p><p>This kind of soul power with other people's traces would not be used by Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>And the problem now was that if there was no soul power core from the deities, one of the three conditions would be missing, and Su Hao would not be able to obtain more soul power.</p><p></p><p>How to obtain a pure core?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had done many experiments and found that none of them could naturally give birth to the soul power core he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes it was like this, being stuck was being stuck, and it wasn't something that could be figured out with a pat on the head or a frown.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to break through the last step of experimentation, there was still a need for an opportunity, and this opportunity, Su Hao had a premonition, was on Baijalben Star.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I find Bai Gaer's home planet and trace the roots to figure out what kind of environment Bai Gaer was born under, then I will definitely be able to create a similar environment and obtain pure soul power."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao temporarily put down the work at hand and came to the small world where the gods were imprisoned and said, "All the gods, you've been working very seriously during this period of time, and I've seen it all in my eyes, so I've decided to give you a few years of vacation."</p><p></p><p>When the eighteen deities heard this, they sucked in a mouthful of cold air, and their ten-colored plates all dimmed instantly, "A vacation? And a few years of vacation? Last time I said a few days off, but it ended up dragging on for a year, and now I'm saying a few years off, wouldn't that be hundreds of years?"</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about themselves talking to themselves in a corner of the barren universe, they instantly felt that the entire ten-colored board was numb.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God-Barry cried out, "Lord Lei An, can I take a vacation here? Ahem, I mean, I don't want to go on vacation in the universe."</p><p></p><p>The other gods immediately expressed that they had the same need.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Of course you can, the vacation will be arranged by yourselves, but in order to prevent you from being too bored, I have arranged a little learning game for you."</p><p></p><p>"Learning game?"</p><p></p><p>The spirits of the gods shook in spirit, immediately understanding that this was the point, the years they had been imprisoned, they had been experimented on by this Excellency Lei An in different ways, with many more names and all sorts of things.</p><p></p><p>And this one was actually going to last for a few years, it was the big guys the moment they heard it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, ''That's right, this is a combination of ''learning'' ''building'' ''interacting'' ''positioning ' and other multiple factors into one game, the game I set up for each deity has some subtle differences, but it's not bad by and large, specifically, if you silently recite 'assistant' in your hearts, there will be an assistant to guide you to get started, and after adapting to it for a period of time, you'll know how to play this game. "</p><p></p><p>The Golden God's eyes lit up when he heard about the game, he couldn't wait to silently recite 'assistant' in his heart, and in the next moment, a blue minimalist panel suddenly appeared a meter in front of his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>On it were 'study materials' 'soul world' 'experiment records' 'search' 'Mini Games' 'Communication' 'Settings' and several other small icons.</p><p></p><p>He looked confused and even used his soul power to try and find out what the blue frame was made of, but a handful of them came up empty.</p><p></p><p>Unable to help himself, he said, "What the hell is this?"</p><p></p><p>It was like a primitive man suddenly getting a smartphone.</p><p></p><p>The other deities also quickly meditated on the assistant, and the blue box that suddenly popped up startled them, and they were also confused about this new appearance.</p><p></p><p>Right at this moment, a neutral voice sounded in their minds, "Welcome to use World Creation Assistant Version 1.0, I am your assistant, and in the process of using World Creation Assistant Version 1.0, you can ask me about any problems you encounter. Next, I will introduce you to the assistant functions ......"</p><p></p><p>The gods wanted to be ruthlessly shocked to show their doubts, but after following Lei An's experiment for so long, they couldn't be shocked anymore when faced with something new.</p><p></p><p>All they knew was that their bodies, must have been tampered with by Lei An. Otherwise, there was no way to explain where this blue frame came out from, or where that so-called assistant was hiding.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the very gentle looking person in front of them, only to realize that it was unfathomable, "Rayan Oaks, I can no longer imagine how powerful he is."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, also ten thousand times glad, when he was captured, rashly resisted, if resisted, perhaps now has been unable to think ......</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the gods quickly accepted this new thing, Su Hao couldn't help but praise, "I can't imagine that the ten-colored board's ability to learn new things is so powerful, seeing that you guys don't have any doubts, I'm relieved. Then, starting today, you guys are on vacation. Within this small world, feel free to toss and turn as you please, of course, you can also try to escape, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao would still be happy if the deities escaped, because it showed that there was a loophole in his small world cage, and he could take the opportunity to make up for it ......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's reason for opening assistant privileges to the deities was simple: he wanted the deities to learn the management statistical framework type of knowledge, and he wanted to utilize the deities' soul power characteristics to properly remodel this world to be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>As for what it would be transformed into, it hadn't been completely decided, and it was still necessary to look at the learning progress of these deities, and the final height of this world would be decided by these deities.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao arranged the gods' future study and work plans, Yashan and Feng Cheng happened to find Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Boss Wei, we have now carefully searched all the planets in the area of 10,000 light years around the Cross Star, but none of them have been found to be suspected to be Bai Gal's home planet. Should we continue to expand our search outwards?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao frowned and said, "Did we not find Baikal's home planet in a 10,000 light year area? It's logical that Bai Gaar's home planet shouldn't be that far away from the Cross Star."</p><p></p><p>The point was that Su Hao believed in the abilities of Yashan and Feng Cheng, and the two were bound to have carefully searched every planet before coming back to report to him.</p><p></p><p>"Can't it be that this is really the Bai Gaer family that has been wandering together for many years, wandering for tens of thousands of years that happened to come here?"</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and put this possibility aside for the time being, thinking that it was more probable that Bai Gal's home planet was not far from the Cross Star.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought of something and asked, "This kind of creature, Bai Gal, is very special, perhaps it was born in the inner high temperature zone of the planet, when you searched, did you take into account the inner core of the planet?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded and said, "Yes, every planet we turned around in the planet's core, but there was no other discovery."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yashan said uncertainly, "Could it be that Baikal was really born from the planet's core, but we happened to miss it when we searched? Otherwise, let's search carefully again."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's search again from beginning to end, focusing on the inner areas of the planet. I'll go with you guys to look for it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't have a better solution for this, because he had already done tests with the deities, and it was simply impossible to obtain the location of Baijia's home planet through the existing Baijia, and if he wanted to find Baijia's home planet, he could only look for it one planet at a time.</p><p></p><p>However, with Su Hao on board, the search should be a bit faster.</p><p></p><p>Each of the three people maneuvered their [God] doppelgangers and came into the universe, and after quickly assigning a search area, they accessed the 'galaxy network'.</p><p></p><p>Each person controlled a few thousand egos each to frantically surge into the 'galactic network', searching outwards with the cross star as the center.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's ego arrived at a gaseous planet and dove headfirst into it to observe it carefully.</p><p></p><p>It was an ocean of liquid metal hydrogen and helium, endless, and after searching for a long time, there was no sign of any abnormality, not to mention the possibility of giving birth to Bai Gal.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately gave this planet a fork and decisively left this planet for another search.</p><p></p><p>In this way one planet after another searched outwards, each planet was searched extremely seriously.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in the tireless searching of the three.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, a year passed.</p><p></p><p>It was also at this time that Su Hao, Yashan, and the others, once again searched the interior of the planets within 10,000 light years of the Cross Star.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was still no discovery.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but secretly say, "Perhaps Planet Baikal is further away ...... It seems that we can only continue to search outward."</p><p></p><p>Before he exited the galactic network, he couldn't help but take another look at this 'stargazing world' full of 'stargazing worlds' of varying sizes and colors ......</p><p></p><p>And so on!</p><p></p><p>His gaze snapped to a direction, "It seems like we still have a category of planets we haven't searched."</p><p></p><p>There was a super-large, blazingly glowing planet - a star.</p><p></p><p>That's right, when Su Hao and the three of them were searching for planets, they subconsciously ignored the stars that occupied a great position.</p><p></p><p>They subconsciously believed that life would not be born on a star, even if it was an unusually unique life like Bai Gal.</p><p></p><p>One had to know that it was a star, an existence that humans couldn't even look directly at.</p><p></p><p>However, from Su Hao's research on Bai Gal, the probability of Bai Gal being born from a star was not unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>In his opinion, as long as there was a hint of probability, then it was worth a try.</p>

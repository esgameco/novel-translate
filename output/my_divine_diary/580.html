        <h1>Chapter 580</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yahan scratched his head and said with a smile, "Currently, I can only flexibly use the abilities of the mass system and energy system, but I haven't summarized the frequency patterns of the illusion system yet. The energy that emerges is also very weak and doesn't meet certain requirements. It's only because this kind of ability has too large a range. But if you give me a few more years, I'll definitely be able to make some gains."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "This is already very good! Moreover, there are more than two thousand source devices in the collection room with all kinds of abilities. You can take them and do some experiments to see if you can replicate all the abilities of those source devices."</p><p></p><p>Yahan said, "Okay, Master Su. I was thinking the same thing. But I can only start the experiments after I find a way to enhance my illusion system abilities. </p><p></p><p>By the way, I've researched the rune waves that suppress the mental frequency activity of source abilities. I call it the 'Source Ability Vector Inhibitor'. However, the effect seems very unstable. For ordinary high-level source masters, the effect is still pretty good. Basically, after being covered by the waves, they can't successfully use their source abilities.</p><p></p><p>But for those extremely powerful source masters with strong willpower, it only has a weakening effect and cannot completely suppress their source abilities."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao raised his eyebrows, "Oh? Let me take a look first!"</p><p></p><p>If this Source Ability Vector Inhibitor really works, then the three of them would be able to move unhindered in this world.</p><p></p><p>He opened his all-purpose assistant and pulled up the data on the inhibitor to study it carefully. After trying it out, he pondered and said, "I have an idea for improving this inhibitor. I'll modify it later when I have time. The 'Source Ability Vector Inhibitor' that cannot completely inhibit abilities is not the complete version yet."</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao and Yahan were discussing their research findings, Feng Cheng seemed to have teleported back to the base and entered Su Hao's lab. Seeing Su Hao, he excitedly said, "Master Su!"</p><p></p><p>The three had been busy with their own things for a long time and hadn't seen each other in a while. It was rare for them to meet up today, so it was no wonder Feng Cheng looked so excited.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Since you're all here, I can tell you about the matter I called you here for this time."</p><p></p><p>Yahan and Feng Cheng immediately looked serious, almost holding their breath as they waited for Su Hao's next words.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "My research has made new progress, but I've also encountered new problems. This problem may require the help of source masters from all over the world to collect enough data for analysis before I can find the answer.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current situation, there is a possibility of reaching a cooperation agreement with the Source Masters Association. So my plan is to help Zhi Peng quickly eliminate all the royal families in the Hengxuan region first, while directly crushing the resistance from the Source Masters Association, demonstrating our formidable power to gain a certain voice, and then have an equal dialogue with the source masters associations of all eighteen regions in the world to propose a deal."</p><p></p><p>Demonstrating power is a necessary step, otherwise no one would be willing to sit down and listen to your ideas and demands.</p><p></p><p>Deals are always made on an equal footing between both parties.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Why don't we just take bombs to talk to them directly?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "That's true, but we need their help after the talks. Using bombs to talk is equivalent to directly threatening them. Even if we reach a deal, we don't know if the data they provide in the end will be reliable.</p><p></p><p>So a better choice is to use the royal families as a tool to demonstrate our power to the Source Masters Association. By eliminating the royal families, we can both show our strength and avoid direct conflict with the Source Masters Association.</p><p></p><p>The royal families act as a buffer between us and the Source Masters Association, so subsequent communication will be more moderate."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded in realization, "I see."</p><p></p><p>Although he was more inclined to just go with bombs, perhaps Master Su had other considerations.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked, "Feng Cheng, what's the current situation with the Glorious Society you're overseeing?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Su Hao ask about this, Feng Cheng immediately showed a helpless expression and waved his hand in exasperation, "Ugh! Just mentioning Zhi Peng's indecisive people makes me angry. It's been a year or two, and they're still the same slow and sluggish. If it were up to me, I would have unified the continent long ago..."</p><p></p><p>Yahan laughed, "If it were up to you, the world would be in chaos long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Yahan had more say in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Different people doing the same thing would result in different styles and outcomes.</p><p></p><p>For example, with the matter of opposing the royal families, if Zhi Peng did it, he would appear indecisive, always worrying about harming innocent people, causing their endeavor to progress very slowly. To the point that public opinion gradually came to be controlled by the royal families, and they started to lose the moral high ground.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Zhi Peng's extremely solid "friend" relationships, they would have been dismantled long ago.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Now the Glorious Society has advanced inward from Pingkong City and spread to seventy or so cities, expanding their territory several times over. Including ordinary people, the Glorious Society has developed nearly a million members, which looks pretty good. But essentially, there's no real difference. Compared to the entire Hengxuan region and the whole world, it's just a small dot.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of development, the Glorious Society being eliminated is only a matter of time. The timing depends on when the 'Eighteen Empire Alliance' reaches a consensus and makes up their mind.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current situation, the Eighteen Empire Alliance is running out of patience with them. In any case, I don't have high hopes for Zhi Peng and his friends."</p><p></p><p>Although their territory has expanded and their number of friends has grown, the Glorious Society's goal of eliminating the royal families has still not been achieved.</p><p></p><p>The royal families in cities near the Glorious Society's territory had already fled with their money and servants when the situation became unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Feng Cheng's summary, Yahan also nodded, "If that's really the case, then it will indeed be difficult to achieve anything significant."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Whether they succeed or not isn't a big problem. The key issue is wasting time! At their pace, even if they do succeed in the end, it would take thirty or forty years."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "That's why I called you here this time - I want to make a plan for the three of us to take action together and try to take over the entire Hengxuan region within a year."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was overjoyed, "How do we do it? I've wanted to do this for a long time! Watching them act so sluggishly has been unbearable."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It's very simple. We'll secretly set up teleportation entrances directly into each palace. Then on the same night, we'll have the Glorious Society charge out and kill everyone. We may not be able to kill all the royal families, but we should be able to get eight or nine out of ten!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "But those royal families have all gone into hiding after the incidents. They're deathly afraid and can't be found now!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao stroked his chin, "That is indeed a problem."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a bit, he quickly came up with an idea, "I'll spend two months collecting intelligence first. You two can produce a thousand transition spheres at the base during this time. The materials are on the assistant, and it's not too difficult. We'll take action in two months to overthrow the royal families."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master Su!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Su Hao was making the decision to expand his forces at the fastest possible speed, at the headquarters of the Source Masters Association in the capital city of Yixuan in the Hengxuan region, a five-person source master squad knocked on the door and entered Chief Lada's office.</p><p></p><p>It was Xiangli and Feitian's squad.</p><p></p><p>As Chief Lada puffed on his pipe, he looked at the overly youthful faces before him with puzzlement and asked, "You say you've found that batch of missing source devices?"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli anxiously glanced at Feitian.</p><p></p><p>Feitian smiled confidently, "That's right! I've basically confirmed the location of those source devices."</p><p></p><p>Chief Lada showed an interested expression, "Oh, I didn't expect your squad to be so capable! Go on, let me hear it!"</p><p></p><p>Feitian opened up a map and confidently pointed to an island, "It's right here!"</p><p></p><p>Chief Lada burst into hearty laughter, "I like your confidence. Come on, tell me your reasoning. If it's nonsense, I'll throw each and every one of you out of here as a reward for your squad. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Xiangli had already heard about this cape-wearing, muscle-exposing Chief who had a unique quirk - his way of rewarding people was to personally throw them out the window of his office. Apparently, many masters had been thrown out before.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining herself and the others being "rewarded" by the Chief soon...she couldn't help but shudder, thinking to herself, "I shouldn't have come up here with Feitian if I had known."</p><p></p><p>Feitian sensed a bit of pressure from Chief Lada, but he didn't feel the slightest bit nervous because he believed he was right.</p><p></p><p>Feitian organized his thoughts and calmly said, "The theft of the source devices from the storage room was done by the 'Earth-Scraping Armor', a member of the Glorious Society. The large number of missing source devices are on this island, and the Earth-Scraping Armor is hiding on this island."</p><p></p><p>Chief Lada asked, "Oh? You sound very sure. Have you seen it with your own eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Feitian shook his head, "No, I'm guessing. As soon as we get close to the island, we're immediately detected by the Earth-Scraping Armor, so we haven't been able to verify it."</p>

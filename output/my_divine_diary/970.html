        <h1>Chapter 970</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The battle between Lv Yijiang and An Mingwang ultimately did not produce a result.</p><p></p><p>After enduring 'humiliation' with no recourse, An Mingwang chose to withdraw from the fight and leave on his own.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the others were powerless to stop An Mingwang's escape.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to seek help from Cong Renfei, but Cong Renfei stated, "I'm just an ordinary weakling, I can't help much. To defeat the great Demon King, you'll have to take action yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Although Lv Yijiang rapidly grew stronger through the intense battle, the gap in power was evident, not something that could be bridged overnight.</p><p></p><p>The vast chasm in strength could not be closed by passion alone.</p><p></p><p>If Cong Renfei had not come, perhaps Lv Yijiang and his righteous companions would have been completely wiped out by An Mingwang.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of Lv Yijiang and the others, if they failed, this world would fall under evil rule, the world would be destroyed, and people would suffer immensely.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was not so.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lv Yijiang and all his righteous companions died, this world would still carry on just fine.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later, when An Mingwang grew old and died, a new generation of martial artists would emerge and thrive on the world stage, soon forgetting An Mingwang's dark reign completely.</p><p></p><p>All of them were merely small marks under the wheel of history.</p><p></p><p>None of them were as important as they imagined.</p><p></p><p>It was also hard to clearly define what was righteous and what was evil. To Cong Shuleng and the others, this was just a natural cycle, a periodic release of pent-up societal desires...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this perspective on the issue was incomprehensible to most ordinary people, as their entire lives spanned less than a century.</p><p></p><p>Any slight ripple in history could perhaps bring them endless suffering, stripping them of everything.</p><p></p><p>To Cong Shuleng and her brother, everything they saw was quite ordinary, not just occurring on this martial arts planet, but in nearly every corner of the infinite lands.</p><p></p><p>This was also why they reacted relatively calmly upon hearing that the evil An Mingwang wanted to use his power to rule this world.</p><p></p><p>As for righteousness or evil, truthfully, the two siblings did not think they had any criteria to judge. They had only come to help their master explore the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps their very existence was a form of evil to the people of this world?</p><p></p><p>"Are you all martial artists? How do martial artists cultivate? What were those energy blasts you released? They could even fly! And I saw you all got beaten up badly, but then recovered so quickly in the next second? Why is that?..."</p><p></p><p>He carefully reached out and poked at Lv Yijiang and the others' arm muscles, exclaiming in amazement, "Wow! So powerful! Like poking solid steel! I want to cultivate with you all and become a powerful martial artist too!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang said, "Sure! Then Cong Renfei, you can cultivate with us. Once you get stronger, I can spar with you!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said in surprise, "Really? Didn't your master tell you not to casually teach martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang turned and asked Gao Qi, "Gao Qi, did our master say we can't teach martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi shook his head. "No, as long as one is wholeheartedly devoted to martial arts, it can be taught. Martial arts can only progress faster through mutual exchange, to reach higher realms of martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei gave a thumbs up. "Well said."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi continued, "Although there's no barrier to teaching martial arts, and almost everyone practices a few styles, there aren't many who can truly endure the hardships of cultivation. So there aren't actually that many truly powerful martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said in surprise, "Cultivation is very difficult? Shouldn't it be enjoyable? Is your cultivation method wrong? I've never felt cultivation was difficult."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang nodded. "Cultivation isn't difficult at all. It makes my whole body feel comfortable, especially when I feel myself progressing and growing stronger - that's really enjoyable."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi thought to himself 'weirdo'.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation requires tempering one's physical body, which most people cannot endure. But of course, this doesn't apply to 'weirdos' who enjoy the process of toughening their flesh.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi suddenly asked, "Cong Renfei, what's the deal with your 'projection' martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled slyly. "That's called teleportation, or instant movement. It's my ability - I can instantly travel to the other side of this planet in a flash."</p><p></p><p>There was nothing he couldn't say about this.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he demonstrated 'flashing' right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The three stared wide-eyed at Cong Renfei. "Incredible!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang asked, "Cong Renfei, can I learn it too?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei stroked his chin. "Whether you can learn depends on two factors. One is whether I teach you. The other is how good your brain works. If your brain doesn't work well, you won't even be able to take the first step in learning."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang asked, "So will you teach us?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qi and Tai Cheng also looked at Cong Renfei expectantly. As top martial artists of this world, they were confident in their intelligence and strength. As long as Cong Renfei was willing to teach, they believed they could master it in no time.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei laughed. "Whether I teach depends on my master's attitude. If my master doesn't object, I can teach you."</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang exclaimed happily, "Really? Where is your master?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lv Yijiang finished asking, Cong Renfei froze, then looked to the side, calling out happily, "Master, Senior Martial Brother Yashan, Senior Martial Brother Wei!"</p><p></p><p>He then quickly went forward to greet them respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Three young, handsome men with well-proportioned physiques were smiling at them.</p><p></p><p>Lv Yijiang and the others curiously observed Su Hao and the other two, thinking, "So these are Cong Renfei's master and senior martial brothers? Based on their aura, they don't seem that powerful. But these three men still give off a dangerous vibe."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at Lv Yijiang and asked, "Cong Fei, are these your new friends?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei smiled. "You could say that!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The technological level of this martial world was extremely low, stuck in a relatively backward ancient era. The land was vast but sparsely populated, with agriculture also very backward. Only a few regions had mature agricultural techniques, developing into renowned major cities of this world. Other areas were mostly nomadic, under the rule of various lords.</p><p></p><p>Adding to that, there were many powerful ferocious beasts roaming the wilderness, causing human settlements to be relatively isolated with little interaction between them.</p><p></p><p>This led to minimal communication between people, and the common folk had very limited knowledge.</p><p></p><p>For most people, their entire life might be spent within their local domain, unaware of what the outside world was like.</p><p></p><p>But martial artists were an exception.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists were a group that traveled and cultivated all over the world. Wherever there was danger, their presence could be found, viewing the challenge of all calamities and natural perils as part of a martial artist's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Volcanoes, thunderstorms, the deep sea, high altitudes, snowy mountains...</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also battles and sparring with other martial artists to learn more powerful martial arts, exchange insights about martial arts, and progress together.</p><p></p><p>In general, martial artists pursued the pinnacle of strength, constantly breaking through their limits to reach higher realms. They had no particular demands beyond that.</p><p></p><p>However, some martial artists would rely on their strength to amass wealth in human society, pursuing the pinnacle of physical desires instead.</p><p></p><p>These martial artists usually only abandoned their pursuit after realizing they had reached their limit and could no longer continue breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, An Mingwang was a representative of this type.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest person in the world, when he looked up, he could no longer see any higher realms. In despair, he chose to look down instead.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao repeatedly observed Lv Yijiang and the others with his divine consciousness, sensing an extraordinarily refined energy within them that had completely fused with their bodies, inseparable.</p><p></p><p>As if they were born with it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao walked over with interest, smiling at Lv Yijiang. "Lv Yijiang, my name is Jia Wei. Would you be interested in sparring with me?"</p>

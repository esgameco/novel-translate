        <h1>Chapter 708</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao hid the avatars of Yashan and Fengcheng in his second-level dimensional space, the ripples he observed with the 'Seeker's Spiritual Eye' completely disappeared from his sight.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the three 'stowaways' had shielded themselves from being locked onto by the 'Doom System', gaining a certain degree of freedom.</p><p></p><p>"However, before fully understanding and mastering the ripples, this way of hiding is still not very secure. It only conceals my physical body.</p><p></p><p>If my guess about the nature of the ripples is correct, the impact I've caused has not been eliminated in essence, and the energy will continue to accumulate, causing destruction.</p><p></p><p>So before ensuring safety, I need to leave Blue Light and stay on another planet."</p><p></p><p>Now, as long as he had his small world or location stone, he could teleport freely, disregarding cosmic distances. </p><p></p><p>Whether he stayed on Blue Light or other planets made no difference.</p><p></p><p>Suhao guessed that the universe moved along a predetermined path, and his appearance would disrupt this process. Under the effect of the 'Doom System', the energy from his disruption would be fed back, causing all kinds of 'accidents'.</p><p></p><p>But in his view, this feedback of disruptive energy was not inevitable, but rather caused by the existence of the 'Doom System' feeding the disruptive energy back.</p><p></p><p>It was like throwing a stone into the center of a water tank - the ripples would converge back at the point where the stone entered. But what if the stone was thrown into the ocean? Would the ripples still feed back...?</p><p></p><p>From what we can see, the answer is no.</p><p></p><p>The ripples caused by throwing the stone would quickly be absorbed by the vast ocean, and the energy generated would hardly converge back at that point.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, as long as Suhao destroyed the 'Doom System' that confined him and fully integrated into the vast ocean of the infinite universe, the disturbance he caused would not create the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just a tiny human compared to the entire infinite universe.</p><p></p><p>The infinite universe would help him digest everything!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the special abilities of the Compound Eye Race can bring me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao couldn't help but look forward to it even more.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After teleporting back to the research base's small world, Suhao found his niece Yonghau waiting at the entrance of his lab, pacing back and forth with a big box in her hands.</p><p></p><p>He walked up and asked, "Yonghau, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Suhao's voice, Yonghau turned her head abruptly, very delighted, "Uncle!"</p><p></p><p>She handed the box to Suhao, her face full of joy, "These are meat balls made by my mom, they're really delicious, so I brought some for you to try."</p><p></p><p>It was just like sharing delicious food with her best friend.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took it and smiled, "Okay, I'll take it. Go on back now!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Suhao flashed and disappeared from the spot, returning to the lab.</p><p></p><p>As for Yonghau, she was trembling with excitement. Even after Suhao disappeared, she was still uncertain whether her great uncle had really accepted the gift she brought.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes shone brightly, as if the world had become more colorful.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the lab, Suhao casually sent the meat balls to the second-level space next to his avatar, transferred his consciousness into the avatar, and tasted them, praising, "The taste is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao would never refuse delicious food. Enjoying a nice meal during breaks from research was a great pleasure.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful he became, he was still a living being, and as a living being, he would always have the need to eat.</p><p></p><p>As he ate, he didn't forget to share with Yashan and Fengcheng, sending the remaining few meat balls in front of them, saying, "These snacks are from my niece, you two try them."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked at each other, both seeing the surprise in the other's eyes: this little niece was so considerate, even thinking of them?</p><p></p><p>After opening the box, they realized they had thought too much... there were barely any meat balls left. They were even more touched: The Great Lord Suhao was actually thinking of them! It felt so good to be valued.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng pointed at Yashan and himself, unsure, "Old Master Yashan, should we eat them as [Gods]? These are meat balls personally given by the Great Lord, but if we eat them like this, it feels a bit unfair. I want to eat them in my avatar form."</p><p></p><p>How could Yashan not feel the same way? But the problem was, they didn't know where their avatars were, so they couldn't eat in that form!</p><p></p><p>Yashan subconsciously stretched out his claws and scratched his head to aid his thinking, but he couldn't come up with any solution either, so he said, "It's okay, just eat them. Being able to taste the flavor is enough."</p><p></p><p>Then he pinched a small meat ball and threw it into his mouth to taste it. A strange, indescribable flavor filled his taste system, salty and a bit fishy.</p><p></p><p>In summary, it tasted bad! He couldn't understand why it looked so appetizing, but once in his mouth, it tasted terrible? There was no taste of meat balls at all.</p><p></p><p>He almost spat it out, but thinking that it was given by the Great Lord, he forced it down his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Then he stuck out a big thumb and praised, "Delicious!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng ate one with great anticipation, but couldn't hold back, his face contorting as he stared wide-eyed at Yashan, "Old Master Yashan, is it delicious?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan grinned, "What do you think? I'll give you the rest."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng immediately shook his head, "No need, you're the master, you should eat more."</p><p></p><p>The two declined to each other for a while, until Yashan suddenly thought of a question: could it be that the taste system of [Gods] is different from humans?</p><p></p><p>Suhao soon replied, "Is that so? I hadn't thought of that issue. The [Eight-Armed God] was created by me using the Octopus Monster, so its eating needs should be different from humans. Since you two can't enjoy it, give the meat balls back to me!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the food box in front of them suddenly disappeared, taken away by Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng looked at each other speechlessly: "......"</p><p></p><p>The meat balls they had just gotten were gone.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At a huge secret military base twenty miles east of Victory City.</p><p></p><p>Soldiers donned personal armor and conducted simulated combat against imaginary enemies.</p><p></p><p>An armored soldier made a simple hand gesture.</p><p></p><p>'Lightness Technique'!</p><p></p><p>'Invisibility Technique'!</p><p></p><p>'Earth Wave'! </p><p></p><p>'Sinking Ground Technique'!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>All kinds of spells were used by the soldiers, allowing them to complete their defeat missions one by one.</p><p></p><p>Although the destructive power of these spells couldn't compare to guns and cannons, they often had unexpected effects in single soldier combat, with extremely strong auxiliary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Unbeknownst to the soldiers, high-ranking military commanders were accompanying Leader Xia Qingjun, observing the soldiers' performance through video.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun marveled, "These 'superpowers' are unexpectedly powerful. Abilities that originally could only appear in movies and TV shows are actually being used by humans! This Xu Shiqiang is really something!"</p><p></p><p>A general agreed deeply, "Indeed. Although they don't seem powerful, the roles they can play on other battlefields besides warship combat are simply unimaginable. Now, we can surpass the Eight-Armed Race in a certain area, which is an excellent start."</p><p></p><p>Another general smiled, "The superpowers we're seeing now are just the initial effects from the soldiers' rudimentary training. If these abilities continue to deepen, our soldiers will become stronger and stronger, and may even play a decisive role in interstellar wars. It just depends on how we use them!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun nodded, "Isn't that exactly how Xu Shiqiang did it? He defeated five Eight-Armed Race warships single-handedly relying on superpowers, showing the tremendous potential of superpowers."</p><p></p><p>"I suggest that if there are no issues with the superpower testing, we should promote this set of superpower techniques throughout the entire military! There are bound to be some talents in this area who can bring us surprises."</p><p></p><p>"Correct. As the number of cultivators increases, there will inevitably be many talented individuals who can optimize and improve the superpower techniques, elevating them to new heights. In the future, there may even be 'immortal' figures in humanity who transcend mortality. By then, the Eight-Armed Race will be nothing to fear."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's mouth slowly curved into a confident smile, "Promote it throughout the military? No, no, no! We should promote it to all of humanity, and directly set up a 'Superpower' exam in the national college entrance examination to select outstanding superpower cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"And perhaps an 'immortal' who has transcended mortality has already been born among us humans."</p><p></p><p>The generals looked at Xia Qingjun in surprise, "Leader, you mean..."</p><p></p><p>Before they could finish, someone reported, "Leader, Lieutenant General Gong Liang is calling you."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said, "Put him through!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the captain's cheerful voice came through the communicator, "Leader, Xu Shiqiang wants to see you and hand over the first technological product, called the 'Star Shattering Cube'."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun and the generals looked at each other, then he directly said, "Okay, I'll go back right away."</p><p></p><p>After Xia Qingjun left, the generals lost interest in watching the soldiers' performance, their minds filled with: "Star Shattering Cube? What is that?"</p><p></p><p>However, they were bound to not get an answer for the time being. A moment later, they all found excuses to leave the observation room.</p><p></p><p>As for what they were going to do, of course it was to go back and cultivate superpowers!</p><p></p><p>Ever since they started cultivating, they couldn't stop. One day of cultivation, one day of enjoyment; cultivating every day, enjoying every day.</p><p></p><p>The general bigwigs all tacitly understood this.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 897</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After starting to learn from Master Feng Cheng, the brother and sister finally knew what real learning was.</p><p></p><p>In their combined thirty years of life across two lifetimes, it seemed they had never truly studied before.</p><p></p><p>Their previous days felt like merely playing children's games, playing house. </p><p></p><p>'Introduction to Numbers', 'Physical Phenomena and Simple Principles', 'The Beauty of Geometry', 'The Composition of the Material World and Chemistry', 'The Wonders of the Human Body', 'Infinite Imagination of the Cosmic Universe', 'Elementary Mathematics and Principles'...</p><p></p><p>According to their teacher Feng Cheng, this was just the basics of basics, only allowing them to gain a basic understanding of this world and form a correct worldview.</p><p></p><p>They still had a long way to go before true learning.</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister swore to the heavens that when they first heard Feng Cheng talk about teaching them to learn, they thought he would impart some incredible secret arts to them, allowing them to instantly gain tremendous power, defeating the heavens, earth and air in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>However, the gap between reality and ideals was truly enormous.</p><p></p><p>What they did not expect was that the world they had lived in for so long was actually so wondrous.</p><p></p><p>So many interesting phenomena around them had been overlooked, never deeply pondered as to the reasons behind them, merely accepted as blessings from the Creator.</p><p></p><p>Now, after learning from Feng Cheng for a period of time, everything they saw completely overturned their previous understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>This was truly the 'door to a new world' as Master Feng Cheng described. They were extremely grateful that their choice to take him as a teacher was not mistaken.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>It seemed Master Feng Cheng was a bit unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng often said with a wry smile: "You two have decent learning ability and willingness, it's just that your brains are too dull. You can't even grasp such simple knowledge and principles. But...I can't really blame you either, you were just born this way, it can't be helped."</p><p></p><p>This made the brother and sister very anxious. They used to proudly consider themselves geniuses, but never expected to be called 'dull-brained' by their teacher.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said puzzledly: "Sister, am I really dull? I feel like I'm learning those things quite quickly."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling also said with a conflicted look: "If the teacher says we're dull, then we must be dull. We've both been looked down upon by the teacher. We need to work doubly hard today. We must seize this opportunity well, I have a feeling that if we miss it, we may regret it."</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei said: "Don't worry sister, this is something I truly enjoy, I will work doubly hard."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Cheng walked out from the side hall and said: "Some things cannot be achieved just by working hard. If success could be attained through hard work alone, then success would be too cheap."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Cong Renfei heard such a toxic motivational phrase, and he was stunned: "Teacher, then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily: "Of course, you still need luck and talent. Speaking of luck, you two are quite fortunate - you could even be called children of destiny. Various coincidences led to your current selves; if it was a bit earlier or later, you would not be as you are now.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to my luck, yours is still a bit lacking. I am the true cosmic child of destiny! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I won't joke with you anymore. To be honest, you two are fine in other aspects, it's just that your brains are a bit dull - that's a fact."</p><p></p><p>Facts are always hard to accept. Just like now, the brother and sister were despondent.</p><p></p><p>Their brains were dull, but what could they do about it?</p><p></p><p>There was a term called the 'curse of knowledge' - those who understand cannot fathom why others do not understand...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Don't you have some kind of mall? Go check if there's an item called the 'Apex Genius Needle' in it. Get one of those for yourselves. Well...it may not be called exactly that, but it should have that function. Go check it out. I don't want to deal with you two dull-brained fellows every day."</p><p></p><p>"Apex Genius Needle?"</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister looked at each other, it sounded like getting an injection could make one a genius. But how could there be such a thing in this world?</p><p></p><p>However, since the teacher mentioned it, they decided to look for it!</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling asked curiously: "Teacher, is this the 'First Step to Genius' potion? The description says it can allow an ordinary person to gain a 'genius' talent and enhance their brain's cognitive abilities."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "Yes, exchange that one and use it first. It will allow your current brains some improvement without severely impacting your fragile consciousnesses - it's just right for you."</p><p></p><p>When the brother and sister saw the 12,000 point cost, they didn't hesitate much before exchanging for the potion. Under Feng Cheng's watchful gaze, they injected the potion into their bodies and soon fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>When they woke up again, they discovered a new world once more.</p><p></p><p>"This world suddenly seems different again, it's not an illusion."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, they realized Feng Cheng's words were true - their previous brains were indeed 'too dull'.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the deities gathered in heaven, their mood somewhat low and the atmosphere rather gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The Deity Overseeing Heaven, Nati, suddenly said in a depressed tone: "I can't even learn the knowledge that Feng Cheng is imparting to the Wills of the World. Does that mean my brain is not functioning well either?"</p><p></p><p>Bali nodded: "Logically speaking, that is indeed the case."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's words not only struck the brother and sister, but also the deities quietly observing from the side.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a deity proposed: "Can we exchange our brains? I also found that 'First Step to Genius' item in the mall. I want to try it too. If it can truly make one smarter, 12,000 points is not too expensive."</p><p></p><p>"That can't be done, have you forgotten our identities? We don't have physical brains. The 'First Step to Genius' clearly states it 'enhances the brain' - it won't work for us. Though if you want to try it, I fully support it and will contribute 10 points."</p><p></p><p>"I'll also contribute 10 points."</p><p></p><p>Nati said: "Why don't we ask Lord Leiﾄ］ for help and see if he has a way? To be honest, I originally thought I was quite intelligent, but now it seems I'm not up to par. I'm very unsatisfied with my own wisdom."</p><p></p><p>The deities unanimously said: "Of course, we are also very unsatisfied with your wisdom."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Radiance, Yi, suddenly said: "Lord Nati, there is a paid consultation service in the mall. For 2,000 points, you can consult Lord Leiﾄ］ once. As long as you make the consultation result public to me, I will contribute 100 points."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also became interested and said: "I'll also contribute 100 points."</p><p></p><p>Nati quickly calculated - if that was the case, he only needed to pay 300 points himself, which was quite a good deal.</p><p></p><p>So he spent the points to consult Su Hao: "Lord Leiﾄ］, can I become smarter by using the 'First Step to Genius'? I'm deeply worried about my intelligence and urgently want to become smarter."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied: "Your constitutions are very special and different from normal humans. You cannot use the 'First Step to Genius' for enhancement.</p><p></p><p>However, you are already extremely intelligent. Your computing power, cognitive abilities, perception, memory and more can utterly crush ordinary human geniuses. There is no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Nati then recounted the incident of encountering Feng Cheng teaching the two Wills of the World, and said: "We were also listening to Master Feng Cheng's lessons from the side. Although we could understand much better than the two Wills, when it came to the self-practice questions, we struggled immensely.</p><p></p><p>According to Master Feng Cheng's words, this is because our brains are dull and inept at thinking, completely unable to meet his learning requirements.</p><p></p><p>This made us deeply realize our own inadequacies - not only are we lacking in strength, but our understanding of the world is also extremely ignorant.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, I discovered that the Wills greatly improved their intelligence by exchanging for the 'First Step to Genius' from the mall, so I had this idea of hoping to enhance my own intelligence as well.</p><p></p><p>Apart from me, the other seventeen deities also hope to find a way to improve themselves. Please help us, Lord Leiﾄ］."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed heartily: "I have many ways to increase intelligence. If you truly have the desire to explore the world, I don't mind helping you enhance your brain power.</p><p></p><p>However, allow me to speak frankly - you have not tapped into the potential of Bai Gal at all and have not focused your attention on learning. You possess immense computing and cognitive abilities, yet do not understand how to utilize them. Even if I further increase your brain power, it would be of no use to you.</p><p></p><p>When the day comes that you are truly hindered in more advanced learning due to insufficient brain power, I will help enhance you. But for now, go back and start learning from the basics!</p><p></p><p>For you, the way of thinking is more important than intelligence itself.</p><p></p><p>You have corresponding knowledge bases in your assistants that can help you learn step-by-step with their aid. That is all."</p>

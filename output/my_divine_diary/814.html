        <h1>Chapter 814</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked the dragon mother what her demand was. Her answer was beyond Su Hao's expectation: "Be extremely cautious."</p><p></p><p>What does it mean to be extremely cautious?</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother's answer to Su Hao was simple: Lurk in the dark and ambush; take out all perceived enemies without knowing who they are in advance; learn to act pitiful, learn to play dead, then launch a 'hundred percent accurate' sneak attack; if it's not the target prey, don't eat it after killing, immediately retreat far away, don't look back to check the corpse...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo always appeared very serious. Su Hao thought she was a dragon yearning for light and brimming with a sense of justice. He didn't expect the tactics she taught him would be like this.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but ask, "Mother Shaduo, are all giant dragons like this?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the dragon mother Shaduo nodded and said, "These are the basic survival skills learned from dealing with humans for a long time, especially when very young, they are very useful."</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo not only gave Su Hao verbal guidance, but also conducted a practical operation.</p><p></p><p>She took three young dragons and found a large human pirate ship, letting the humans clearly see the three young dragons on her back. She then pretended to be injured and powerless, flying unsteadily until she had to land on a deserted island.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the humans' eyes turned red with greed as they howled and chased after her...</p><p></p><p>Then before the pursuing humans could even land on the island, Su Hao wiped them all out in one go.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother was very satisfied with Su Hao's performance and announced that he had passed her test. After instructing Su Hao to act this way, she continued on her journey.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>So as the dragon mother flew, Su Hao would quietly lie on her back, either training his spiritual power, slowly building an 'external brain' within his body, or designing the gene sequence of the "Prophet Human".</p><p></p><p>When the dragon mother stopped flying and went out hunting briefly, Su Hao would enter the small world to observe the growth of the hatched "Gods". The "Gods" could secrete a special substance called "separation liquid" like a mother insect to obtain sufficient nourishment from the land, with a growth mode surpassing 99.99% of other creatures.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would also take the time to enter the small world where the Fugui team was imprisoned to study soul power and soul arts.</p><p></p><p>The Fugui team had been imprisoned by Su Hao for a long time. Five of the humans could not bear the endless prison torment and became extremely frantic.</p><p></p><p>First, they planned to take off their pants and do unspeakable things to the only woman, Weiya, but were stopped and beaten by the bearded Xibo.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this did not extinguish their madness. When Su Hao came in, they actually tried to revolt and kill him...</p><p></p><p>Their attack, of course, had no effect on Su Hao. Su Hao casually added a few programs to the black room, turning them into "tool men" who only knew how to eat, drink, defecate and urinate.</p><p></p><p>He then began designing their gene sequences to cultivate spare "God" avatars.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating "God" avatars from these people required three steps: "Bone Demon" - "Life Child" - "God", taking three months, a bit longer than hatching from "God Eggs".</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao didn't mind having more "God" avatars. If the "Gods" hatched from the "God Eggs" were damaged, he would have replacements.</p><p></p><p>A day later, under the gaze of the bearded Xibo and others, Su Hao injected the gene modification liquid into these "tool men", turning them into "Bone Demons".</p><p></p><p>This really terrified the bearded Xibo and the others.</p><p></p><p>They completely did not understand what this operation was, each feeling deeply chilled in their hearts: "Is this the consequence of offending a deity?"</p><p></p><p>This made them realize one principle: no matter how suppressed or dissatisfied they felt inwardly, they had to endure it, as a desperate struggle was futile.</p><p></p><p>After doing this, Su Hao paid no more attention to these people and went about his own business as usual.</p><p></p><p>And in order to make the dragon mother return to Dragon Island as soon as possible, he did clear out any pirates who dared to target them. This "Heaven Road" truly became a "Heaven Road" in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Basically, wherever they went, the vicious pirates died there, making the entire shipping lane much safer.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a legend about an "Evil Dragon" gradually spread along this Heaven Road shipping lane.</p><p></p><p>The dragon mother Shaduo did not worry about her child's killing spree. Instead, she looked like a kind mother, giving Su Hao the greatest encouragement and praise: "Well done, Rayan Oakes, my child. You are the most powerful dragon I've seen besides the six Dragon Gods.</p><p></p><p>Yes, even though you are only a three-month-old young dragon, your strength surpasses that of most giant dragons. Of course, the premise is that you continue to follow the survival tactics I taught you, don't be arrogant... Come on Rayan Oakes, repeat the survival tactics I taught you once more."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao recall the distant past when his father Wu Yuntian taught him the "Three Stricts, Four Diligences, and Five Prohibitions" - they were just teachings, completely different.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two cute young dragons beside him and deeply doubted what they would become after learning from the dragon mother Shaduo.</p><p></p><p>Just imagining that unorthodox degenerate dragon scene made Su Hao feel uncomfortable looking at it.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself: "No wonder the relationships between giant dragons are not very good. Apart from their powerful individual strength, I've found the root cause."</p><p></p><p>The First Dragon Chipu and the Second Dragon Sister Moli did not know what Su Hao was thinking, but imitated Su Hao's movements, clenching their claws and pounding the ground while roaring "Down woo!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, when the dragon mother Shaduo brought Su Hao to an island to rest, two figures sped across the distant sea surface one after the other, heading straight for the island where Su Hao was.</p><p></p><p>One was a long-haired blond man, the Golden God Bari.</p><p></p><p>The other was a slender woman with a cold expression, dressed in a tight black suit, following silently behind the Golden God Bari.</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari suddenly spoke: "Bode, about how much longer until we catch up to that red-golden giant dragon?"</p><p></p><p>This black-clothed woman was none other than Bode, whose brain Su Hao had previously smashed with one punch before she was successfully revived in a new female body.</p><p></p><p>Bode closed her eyes to sense, then said, "Respected Lord Bari, I can sense that the giant dragon is not far ahead. We are about to catch up with them.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this red-golden giant dragon is so alert, intending to return directly to Dragon Island. And the 'Evil Dragon Legend' we heard along the way must be related to the existence behind that red-golden giant dragon. Your Majesty, we will soon know the truth."</p><p></p><p>Bari showed a faint smile: "The Evil Dragon Legend? Heh heh, I'm getting more and more interested. All the vicious pirates who died along the way, without exception, had their brains smashed, including some powerful level 7 soul guards and soul artists.</p><p></p><p>So, what kind of soul art could achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>Bode also smiled: "My sudden death before was most likely due to my brain being instantly smashed. At that time, I didn't deploy a soul art force field for defense, I was careless. This time, I want to see what he can do to us."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari and Bode were currently enveloped in a barrier that blocked soul arts released by Bari himself, rendering almost all 'infiltration-type' soul arts ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also had various other powerful defenses.</p><p></p><p>In short, they both felt an overwhelming sense of security at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent was a Deity, they could not immediately break through their defenses, allowing them to calmly find an opportunity to actively shed their shells and escape.</p><p></p><p>Invincible!</p><p></p><p>Thus, a deity and a divine messenger recklessly entered Su Hao's perception domain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao withdrew from his spiritual power cultivation and looked up into the distance, puzzled in his heart: "Huh, two people are coming. From their aura, I sense they are many times stronger than anyone we've encountered before. Are they coming for us or just passing by?"</p><p></p><p>If just passing by, Su Hao would ignore them. If they were coming for them, then he would knock them down with one punch.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately woke up the sleeping dragon mother Shaduo: "Mother Shaduo, two humans are flying this way. Let's quickly move aside!"</p><p></p><p>Without doubting him, Mother Shaduo immediately got up, grabbing a young dragon with each claw, and swiftly flew to the side hugging the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the black-clothed woman Bode suddenly pointed in a direction: "Respected Lord Bari, it seems the giant dragon has moved and is flying away over there."</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari said nothing and immediately changed course while increasing his speed.</p><p></p><p>As the Golden God Bari changed direction, Su Hao also sensed their movement trajectory and immediately judged that these two were coming for them.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao clenched his right claw and opened his left palm, fiercely clashing his fists together.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Golden God Bari and the divine messenger Bode trembled all over as if they had lost all their strength, tracing an arc before plunging headfirst into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Mother Shaduo, they were coming for us. Well, I've taken them out, they fell into the sea."</p><p></p><p>Such things had happened many times before, so the dragon mother Shaduo was not surprised, only praising: "Well done, Rayan Oakes, you are indeed my child."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, in the central palace of an independent palace complex on another distant continent, the muscular lion-like man sitting in the center opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His emerald green eyes flashed with incomprehension: "Just now... what happened?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pale golden light sphere appeared. He casually tapped it, and the golden sphere turned into a snake that burrowed into the body of a gorgeously dressed female soul artist below the main hall.</p><p></p><p>That soul artist looked at the incoming golden snake with deep fear in her eyes, then collapsed without a sound.</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, the soul artist slowly woke up, briefly dazed, before her will became completely lucid again.</p><p></p><p>She knelt on the ground, appearing utterly dejected: "Your servant Bode thanks Lord Bari's mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden God Bari said coldly, "Can you still sense the location of that red-golden giant dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Bode closed her eyes to sense for a while, then nodded, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Bari: "Let's go meet him again, at least clarify his attack method."</p>

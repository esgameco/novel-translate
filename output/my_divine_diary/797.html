        <h1>Chapter 797</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After returning to the hatching chamber, Suhao found a comfortable spot to lie down.</p><p></p><p>He didn't immediately start refining his blood energy, but instead entered the pinball space, sat at the desk, materialized paper and pen, and began making short-term plans:</p><p></p><p>"First, refine enough blood energy as soon as possible to gain stronger self-protection abilities. At the same time, use the blood energy to set up a 'focus system' to obtain source pearls.</p><p></p><p>However, having been reborn as a giant dragon, the dragon genes are somewhat different from humans and dragon species. Before the genes are fully analyzed, I can't recklessly modify them to avoid uncontrollable situations.</p><p></p><p>So, I can only skip the gene modification step for now and obtain source pearls in a slower way.  </p><p></p><p>Although I don't have spatial abilities and can't use source pearls to convert more blood and spiritual energy, as long as I have source pearls, I can achieve a certain level of invincibility. The pure abilities of a Demonic Source magician are not something ordinary beings can withstand.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the blood energy within the giant dragon body is immense, allowing me to use it freely to obtain enough source material.</p><p></p><p>Second, while converting blood energy, cultivate 'Starlight Guidance' to enhance spiritual power in preparation for obtaining spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>Many of my abilities rely on the 'small world' structure of spatial abilities, such as using source pearls to convert more blood and spiritual energy, or using them to convert the Seeker Zero spiritual eye and the 'Seek One' star system network.</p><p></p><p>Third, use the dragon species genes for comparison to quickly analyze the giant dragon genes, evolve myself into a [Seed], and inscribe core runes within my body to advance to a master warrior.</p><p></p><p>After inscribing the 'core compound runes' within my body, I will be able to use various abilities at will without restrictions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, create a secondary world to hide my main body and evade Yunbo's lock.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, install various necessary plugins to restore my absolute power from my previous life.</p><p></p><p>Ancient mythical creatures like the breath of giant dragons exist, so there may be rule-based enemies so powerful they defy reason. I can't be careless.</p><p></p><p>Fifth, build an 'external brain' and 'spiritual body' to break through to the separating spirit realm and fully restore all my powers from my previous life.</p><p></p><p>In this life spanning nearly ten thousand years, I will continue to seek methods to infinitely extend my lifespan... No, wait, the lifespan of giant dragons is obviously longer than humans. Combined with the extension from my 'separating spirit' realm, perhaps my lifespan will exceed ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Suhao wrote down many things in detail, including the specifics of restoring his powers.</p><p></p><p>As he mastered more knowledge and his peak power grew stronger, restoring his previous life's peak state became increasingly complex.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his power systems were interconnected, so he had to start from refining 'blood energy' and complete the necessary intermediate steps in order to reach his final peak state.</p><p></p><p>This was fundamentally different from the imagined method of meditating, absorbing the essence of heaven and earth, and tempering oneself.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's system was more akin to 'manually remodeling the body' using various cosmic knowledge rather than cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In general, each had its pros and cons.</p><p></p><p>The characteristic of Suhao's system was that while it seemed complicated, once certain steps were completed, the rate of growth became unimaginably fast.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his plans, Suhao exited the pinball space, closed his eyes to calm his mind, and began refining his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Brother One and Dragon Sister Two were secretly peeking into the hatching chamber from outside. They wanted to invite Suhao to play, but after being severely beaten three times, they became afraid of him and dared not disturb him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Brother One then turned to look at Dragon Sister Two, excitement gradually appearing in his eyes. He then bared his fangs and pawed towards her.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Sister Two was not to be outdone, letting out a low howl before grappling with Dragon Brother One, rolling and chasing each other around the cave.</p><p></p><p>The instincts imprinted in their bodies prevented them from staying still.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the giant dragon brought back an even larger triangular bull for the three young dragons to feast on.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the smallest Suhao was exceptionally ferocious, and most of the roasted triangular bull ended up in his belly, leaving Dragon Brother One and Dragon Sister Two to eat only the leftovers, which was quite pitiful.</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon did not interfere much, only gently watching the three young dragons, thinking to itself: "I prepared a large triangular bull according to the appetites of the children when they were born, but I didn't expect it still wouldn't be enough. The small Third has an unexpectedly large appetite. It seems I'll have to bring back more food next time, or First and Second won't be able to eat their fill."</p><p></p><p>It then looked at Suhao: "Third's power and intelligence far exceed the other young dragons. His talent seems exceptionally high - could he be a variant golden dragon? I'll observe further. Once they grow a bit more, I'll take them back to Dragon Shore to find their father."</p><p></p><p>After the three young dragons finished eating, the giant dragon took the remains and flew away again.</p><p></p><p>Suhao once again rejected the other two young dragons' invitations to play and continued refining his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>In just two days, Suhao's size exploded, his body length reaching 1.8 meters. The scales on his body became thicker and harder, greatly enhancing his defenses. When he used his tail to strike Dragon Brother One, he no longer felt pain.</p><p></p><p>However, since at least half of his energy was converted into blood energy, he still looked frail and malnourished, shorter than the other two young dragons.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the giant dragon brought back two robust deer bulls, one in each claw.</p><p></p><p>To the giant dragon's surprise, the result was still not enough food...</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon's eyelid twitched: "It's only been two days, how has Third's appetite grown so much again? At this rate, in another eight months he'll probably exhaust me... They say children aren't easy to raise, and now I see it's true. Filling the bellies of these three little ones is no easy task!"</p><p></p><p>Hunting food for itself was not difficult - it could easily feast on a herd of cattle or sheep. But feeding the young was not so simple.</p><p></p><p>It had to keep the nest hidden, going out to hunt in different locations each time to avoid being tracked by enemies.</p><p></p><p>Once the nest's location was discovered by humans, the young dragons could easily be cruelly stolen away.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, 'dragon slayer' was a popular profession.</p><p></p><p>Their 'Golden Dragon Clan' was originally at the top of the food chain, an extremely powerful species. But the giant dragon didn't know when their survival situation had become so dire.</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon was very displeased: "How could there be such an evil human race in this world?"</p><p></p><p>After the three young ones finished eating, it took the remains far away to dispose of them, determined to bring back even more food on its next trip.</p><p></p><p>It didn't believe that as a powerful adult golden dragon, it couldn't satisfy the appetites of three young hatchlings.</p><p></p><p>This time it was gone for three whole days. When it returned, each of its strong limbs carried a large elk.</p><p></p><p>It roasted the elk and placed them in front of the three young dragons. Looking at Suhao with a hint of pride, it made a 'gurgle gurgle' sound from its throat - was it laughing?</p><p></p><p>Day by day, the three young dragons grew larger, and Suhao's stomach seemed like a bottomless pit, putting more and more hunting pressure on the giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>One day, it couldn't help but miss its mate: "Muzhi, where are you? Come back and help me raise the children..."</p><p></p><p>By this time, Suhao had completed accumulating a sufficient amount of blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual power recovery is fastest. At this level, I can already set up a small 'focus system'. Most importantly, I have enough elite blood energy for now.</p><p></p><p>So, it's time to go get the first batch of source pearls."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 850</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Time passed imperceptibly, and a year went by.</p><p></p><p>One day, the humans in this world suddenly discovered that the deities they believed in no longer responded to them. Not only the deities, but also the soul practitioners and soul guardians in the churches had almost disappeared, leaving only a few soul practitioners still guarding the temples of the deities, praying day and night, waiting for their deities to return.</p><p></p><p>It was at this time that people realized that the disappearance of the deities did not have much impact on their lives. Those who needed to work still worked, those who needed to eat still ate, those who needed to sleep still slept, and in their leisure time, they could still chat with old friends.</p><p></p><p>Originally they thought that everything they had was bestowed by the deities, but now they found that without the deities, their lives went on as usual.</p><p></p><p>Of course, perhaps this generation, out of reverence for the deities, would not feel it too deeply. They all believed that the deities had gone to a gathering and had no time to manage mundane affairs. But when the gathering ended, the all-powerful deities would return and respond to their beliefs.</p><p></p><p>It was the children who had never seen the deities who harbored deep doubts in their hearts: Did this world really have deities?</p><p></p><p>They had never seen them, so they were skeptical.</p><p></p><p>However, as the time of the deities' disappearance grew longer, people inevitably had many questions: Why did all the deities in the world suddenly disappear and no longer appear before humans?</p><p></p><p>If their experiences were written into a book, it would probably be titled "The Record of Seeking Deities."</p><p></p><p>Those seeking the deities were still wholeheartedly devoted to them, fervently hoping that their deities would return and lead them to the path of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>But it was not difficult to imagine that after spending a long time searching and finding nothing, and believing that the deities had gone missing for some unknown reason, they would inevitably use their remaining strength to absorb a great deal of power in this world and establish a dynasty ruled by individual power, until they performed the "soul transfer ritual" to the limit and eventually died.</p><p></p><p>After that, the deities would become a distant legend.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the deities imprisoned in the small worlds were unaware that most of their followers had been captured by Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Even if they knew, they would not care too much, for they could hardly protect themselves, let alone care about what their followers were doing.</p><p></p><p>During this year, the deities had suffered unspeakable hardships, both physically and spiritually.</p><p></p><p>The only good news was that they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>After cooperating with Suhao's "will transmission" experiment, the deities could not help but discuss in low voices:</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm about to be worn out by Leanne Oakes. The divine majesty that I cultivated for so many years has been completely disfigured. If I return to my servants, I don't know if they can still recognize me."</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like you never had any so-called divine majesty? It was just self-satisfaction! And I estimate that your servants have already abandoned you, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are your perspectives so shallow? Why do I feel that after following Leanne in experiments for a year, I have gained more understanding of divine light? Don't you have any gains?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, speaking of this, I can't help but admire Leanne's prowess. I never thought that soul power could be used to create the so-called 'inner worlds', and in those inner worlds, I am the omnipotent creator."</p><p></p><p>"What's so great about that? Leanne's proposed soul power virtual world network is truly a genius idea. We have lived for so many years, yet our understanding of soul power is not as good as that of a newcomer who has just been exposed to it for a year, which is really shameful."</p><p></p><p>"It's not something that makes me sad to be ashamed in front of Leanne. What you said is nothing to me. What really shocks me is that Leanne has proposed an idea called the 'New Human Soul Completion Program'.</p><p></p><p>He seems to want to try to build a global soul power virtual world information network, and when all intelligent new lives are born, endow them with 'souls'. Then create two inner worlds as 'heaven' and 'hell', allowing those who meet specific conditions to either ascend to heaven and enjoy eternal bliss, or fall into hell and suffer torment for eternity, with the opportunity for reincarnation...</p><p></p><p>Such a world seems interesting just to think about, much better than the boring games we used to play."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's easy to say, but whether it can be realized is another question! Even Leanne may not necessarily succeed."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen Leanne fail?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the deities was much better than when they first came in, as if the shared experience had brought them closer together.</p><p></p><p>As they were chatting idly, Suhao suddenly appeared, smiling at the deities and saying, "There's good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear?"</p><p></p><p>The deities looked at each other, surprised that there was even bad news.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Salvation, Baishen, glanced at the others and said, "Let's hear the good news first!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "The good news is that I will let you take a few days off next, except for the Decacross Star. You can go wherever you want."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Ten Thousand Thunders, Gu, was puzzled: "Except for the Decacross Star, isn't there only this place? Whether we take a break or not, doesn't it make any difference?"</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, Suhao projected the star system where the Decacross Star was located in front of everyone: "Within this star system, you can go to any planet you want."</p><p></p><p>The deities gasped in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The usually silent Deity of Darkness, Yongshi, couldn't help but speak up: "Lord Leanne, are you joking with us?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "I never joke with strangers."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi randomly chose a star and said, "Then I'll go to this star system."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she looked at Suhao, as if expecting him to refuse her, but unexpectedly, Suhao nodded casually and said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Heavenly Stability, Nati, asked, "Then what's the bad news?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "The bad news is that your thought process has been slowed down this year."</p><p></p><p>All the deities were stunned, completely baffled. "The thought process has been slowed down? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao explained, "It means that the time you spend thinking about the same problem, observing an object, or performing an action has become longer compared to a year ago. You can also understand it as your perception of the external world has become dull."</p><p></p><p>The deities self-examined but found nothing unusual, suspecting that Suhao was just talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Suhao continued, "Of course, the rate at which you become dull is extremely slow, almost negligible compared to before. But all eighteen of you deities are no exception - your thought processes have been slowed down to some extent, and this slowdown will accelerate over time.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how much your thought process is slowed down, you will not be able to perceive the change in your own thinking. You will only feel that a day passes faster, plants grow faster, and people walk faster... as if the video you are watching has been fast-forwarded.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the end, when a complete question like 'Why did a day pass so quickly?' crosses your mind, a year may have already gone by. Yet you still won't understand what happened."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities' auras flickered unsteadily, clearly frightened by Suhao's words.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Ten Thousand Thunders, Gu, asked, "How does Lord Leanne know this?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I have my own ways of measuring it. And the reason I'm letting you take a vacation this time is to verify again whether my conclusion is correct. After you return from your vacation, you'll probably know the answer. If my conclusion is correct, then your Decachroma Plates will be quite an interesting thing."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Suhao's bad news, the deities lost their desire to go sightseeing in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Gold, Bali, asked the question that everyone wanted to ask but dared not: "Lord Leanne, aren't you afraid that we'll run away when you let us take a vacation? You should know that the essence of our bodies is 'light', and our speed can be very fast. We can disappear in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily, "What if I told you that my speed is faster than light? If you want to escape, you can go ahead and try. See if you can really escape. But let me warn you first, if you do escape and I catch you, then I will have to try taking apart your Decachroma Plates for research."</p><p></p><p>Faster than light?</p><p></p><p>The deities clearly didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't explain further. He enveloped all the deities with his divine will, then used "linear ultra-long-distance perception" to directly teleport them to the outer space far away from the Decacross Star.</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly changed to outer space, and the deities looked bewildered, but soon saw a yellow-blue planet behind them.</p><p></p><p>It was the Decacross Star!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had left the Decacross Star at such a great distance.</p><p></p><p>Suhao transmitted his voice, "Alright, next I'll take you to the star system you wanted to go to. You really picked a place - it's on the opposite side of the star system!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Suhao's pink crystal core grew, forming a "gravity" array, and then emitted a brilliant light that condensed into dark golden patterns, extremely beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a powerful gravitational force came from Suhao, attracting the deities.</p><p></p><p>The deities' expressions changed drastically as they tried to resist this powerful gravitational force.</p><p></p><p>After two breaths, the surrounding scene changed again.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Okay, we're here. You can play around in this star system! I'll come pick you up later."</p><p></p><p>With that, he teleported away, leaving the eighteen deities with their Decachroma Plates flickering with various colored lights.</p><p></p><p>The deities looked bewildered: "......"</p><p></p><p>This was a planet with not too harsh an environment, and the deities looked around, absolutely certain that this was no longer the Decacross Star.</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Salvation, Baishen, spoke first: "Let's go into outer space and check the situation."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the deities asked in bewilderment, "Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, they all looked at the Deity of Darkness, Yongshi. This was the place she had chosen for sightseeing, so she should know.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi shrugged, "Don't look at me, I just chose randomly."</p>

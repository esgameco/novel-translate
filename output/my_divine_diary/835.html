        <h1>Chapter 835</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The deities possessed an extremely powerful ability, which was to invade a physical body.</p><p></p><p>They could package a portion of their will, then send it into a body, completely taking over that body for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if that body had previously been implanted with a special mark structure belonging to the deities - a soul seed, and then allowed to ferment over time, the invasion would be even simpler.</p><p></p><p>So in the minds of the eighteen deities, all intelligent beings in this world capable of carrying their will were their own private property. The more property they had, the more bodies they could switch into, and the stronger their ability to resist risks.</p><p></p><p>The deities had existed for many years, with in-depth research into soul power. They had invaded countless bodies, which gave them highly skilled body invasion techniques, able to invade a body at the fastest speed and gain everything within, without any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Including control over the body, memories in the brain, and innate talents.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they could completely destroy the original will, and then receive the entirety of that consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In terms of analyzing consciousness information, perhaps the deities' abilities surpassed even Xu Hao's use of Xiaoguan to analyze consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Because Xu Hao could only find fragments of information from the consciousness information, and then piece them together into complete information, while the deities could use the brain of that body to 'recall' and obtain precise information.</p><p></p><p>This was incomparable.</p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely because the deities' body invasion skills were so extremely powerful that it left the Deity of Defending Heaven - Nati feeling utterly shocked by what happened to him.</p><p></p><p>He confirmed that he had already invaded this crystal person's body, and perfectly received all control over this body.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the physical abilities, skills, knowledge, and memories of this body should all be his spoils of war. After learning Leanne Oakes' ability to create worlds, he should be able to smoothly leave from here and return to the world he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>However, the reality was that although he did gain control over this body and could control its movements, it was slightly different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>First, the movements were not very convenient - the motion commands issued based on the human body structure had many deviations;</p><p></p><p>Third, this brain was a bit chaotic, and the portion of his will could not properly take control;</p><p></p><p>Most unbelievably, he had clearly occupied this body, yet the enemy was still able to seize control of the mouth and converse with him...</p><p></p><p>This was quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>So the question was, where was the enemy hiding?</p><p></p><p>The Deity of Defending Heaven - Nati's will swiftly took action, with a large amount of information repeatedly flushing through the body, scanning the entire body in an attempt to find the hidden enemy.</p><p></p><p>However, he failed, finding nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the mouth opened uncontrollably again to speak: "What are you doing? Looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Nati had lived for a long time as a deity, so even with his main body captured by the enemy, he could remain relatively calm. He continued trying to fully receive Xu Hao's body, while using the giant dragon standing beside him to converse with Xu Hao: "Leanne Oakes, you are the most mysterious human I've ever met. How exactly did you manage to contend with me for control of this body?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao laughed: "I don't actually have the ability to contend with you for control of the body. In fact, in this struggle for control over the body, you've already gained the upper hand. I just exploited a loophole that you don't understand. You should be confident - you deities are professionals when it comes to seizing bodies."</p><p></p><p>Nati asked in confusion: "A loophole I don't understand? Previously I believed in my abilities, that I absolutely wouldn't leave any loopholes, but the current situation has clearly exceeded my expectations. My abilities do indeed have loopholes. Can you tell me where you're hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said: "Of course I can. I said I would tell you what you want to know, no need to lie to you."</p><p></p><p>Then Xu Hao controlled his second Egg God avatar, transforming it into the shape of a young dragon, and teleporting it into this space. He openly told Nati: "I'm right here!"</p><p></p><p>He now had five Egg God avatars, and wasn't stingy with them at all.</p><p></p><p>Nati looked at the young dragon that appeared, speechless again. He tried hard to sense the soul power reaction from this young dragon, but couldn't sense anything different from an ordinary young dragon.</p><p></p><p>Extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>He controlled the giant dragon to point at the other Egg God avatar he had invaded: "Is this your main body?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said: "I don't have that deity ability of splitting my will. I'm just an ordinary young dragon."</p><p></p><p>Nati frowned: "I haven't sensed even the slightest bit of soul power from you, yet you possess such an extraordinary power. Where does this power come from?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao: "My Shaduo mother told me that I'm a mutant golden dragon, with naturally awakened powers."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be talking nonsense, but Xu Hao dared to swear on his conscience that every word he said was true, and he had no intention of deceiving this red-golden giant dragon called the Deity of Defending Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Nati: "A mutant golden dragon? Mutant golden dragons do exist, but none have ever mutated into your form."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, his main body suddenly shot out a beam of light that drilled into the young dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>He actually launched a sneak attack while they were conversing.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Hao didn't dodge, allowing the light beam to drill into his brainless Egg God head, as he wanted to see how this Deity of Defending Heaven would try to invade his body without a brain.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the light beam returned the way it came, merging back into Nati's main body's ten-colored plate.</p><p></p><p>Some residual power remained in Xu Hao's body, suddenly exploding outwards.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The upper half of Xu Hao's body shattered into crystal shards spraying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Kraka kraka kraka~"</p><p></p><p>The broken area rapidly regrew crystal armor, fully repairing itself in no time, as Xu Hao smiled at Nati.</p><p></p><p>Nati was stunned in disbelief: "What kind of ability is this? Over half the body was blown away, yet it could still regenerate..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao moved his body around: "Is this so strange? Isn't it only natural?" He addressed Nati: "You're a deity, don't be so easily shocked by little things."</p><p></p><p>Nati couldn't help asking again: "How is it that you don't have a brain? Your head is just an empty pool of water - this should be a creature without intelligence or consciousness. How can you have such intellect and abilities?"</p><p></p><p>He truly had too many doubts.</p><p>This discovery once again shook his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao expressed displeasure: "Lord Nati, let me be clear first - what exactly were you trying to do just now? Take advantage of my inattention to try invading my body? I opened my heart to communicate with you, but this is how you respond to me. Lord Nati, forgive my bluntness, but you are too shameless."</p><p></p><p>Shameless or not, the deities had long since shed such base moral constraints. As long as they could achieve victory, they were capable of even more shameless acts.</p><p></p><p>Nati said nonchalantly: "I was just joking with you, no harm done, right?"</p><p></p><p>He turned serious: "Leanne Oakes, what exactly are you trying to do? Kill me, or obtain something from me? Just say it."</p><p></p><p>Nati had realized that he was dealing with an unreasonable monster.</p><p></p><p>The deities' signature body invasion tricks were no longer effective against this young dragon. And based on his observations, even physically destroying the opponent's body would be useless.</p><p></p><p>So the correct approach now was to figure out the opponent's goal, then seize any opportunities, prioritizing self-preservation first, escaping second, and defeating the opponent third...</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao realized he had demonstrated his power sufficiently, and this giant dragon had preliminarily understood his current predicament and was willing to calmly converse. So he pointed at Nati's main body: "I'm very interested in your main body, and want to understand exactly what you deities call the 'divine light'. But I don't want to harm your life."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Nati's giant dragon avatar was instantly teleported away. His fingers then gently grasped Nati's ten-colored plate main body, using spatial powers to firmly lock it in place.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao once again demonstrated his absolute power advantage over Nati, subconsciously telling Nati that even if he let his guard down and allowed Xu Hao to attack freely, Nati would be powerless against him. Xu Hao only needed to think it, and Nati could be destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao reached out to lightly touch the somewhat scorching ten-colored plate, then coldly said: "I need you to unconditionally cooperate with my observations and experiments. Choose! Agree, or be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nati stunned, Xu Hao added: "Oh, I have a way to locate the deities' main bodies, no matter where you're hiding. If you don't agree, it's fine, I'll just ask the other deities. Besides you, there are still seventeen others."</p>

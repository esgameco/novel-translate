        <h1>Chapter 586</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The area in front of Lada's squad of five was already empty. Their hearts had also become empty.</p><p></p><p>What kind of ordeal was this? If they told others, no one would believe them!</p><p></p><p>Their small squad, which could operate unrestrained almost anywhere in the world, had actually been defeated by this tiny Radiant Society!</p><p></p><p>Especially Lada, he felt extremely aggrieved. An enemy that could stand before him but he couldn't hit was the first he had encountered.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of having no outlet to vent all his strength was also the first time he had experienced it.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to punch that crystal giant hard in the face, sending him flying a hundred meters away, to vent the frustration in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that crystal giant had left, disappearing inexplicably before their eyes, just as mysteriously as it had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Feiyu was right, the storage room of the headquarters was indeed robbed by this crystal giant, no, it should be called the 'Earth-Scorching Armor'!</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became. He couldn't help but punch out.</p><p></p><p>"Bang--"</p><p></p><p>A tree as thick as a waist snapped with that punch, shattered into flying debris.</p><p></p><p>Lada gritted his teeth and said, "Let's go, we're going back!"</p><p></p><p>The bespectacled woman asked in surprise, "Go back? Where to?"</p><p></p><p>"Back to Yixuan!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The crystal figure of the Gundam faded away and reappeared beside Yashan and Fengcheng. Then the crystal armor melted like candle wax, slowly dissolving and filling the previous pit, restoring the original appearance in a moment.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's figure also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked impatiently, "Master Wei, how was the test?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "The 'Second Space' can evade President Lada's attacks."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said enviously, "When can I learn the Second Space?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Certainly after me!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "They seem to be planning to leave, so we can test the 'Source Variable Suppressor' now."</p><p></p><p>When it came to capturing people, Fengcheng was the most eager. He had been punched by Lada before and was bent on taking revenge, personally beating them up before capturing them.</p><p></p><p>He was even afraid that if he captured them too cooperatively, he wouldn't have a chance to beat them up.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Let's move forward ten thousand meters, then activate the suppressor at a distance of ninety thousand meters from them. Just in case, don't get too close. Probe them from afar."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed, "Don't worry, Master Wei! I've learned my lesson and almost died. I won't be careless."</p><p></p><p>After moving more than ten thousand meters, Yashan's Vajra Armor surged, forming a huge array of runes - the 'Source Variable Suppressor'.</p><p></p><p>He then channeled spiritual power to activate the array.</p><p></p><p>The array was successfully activated with a flash of white light.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "The array is activated!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Fengcheng tried to activate their source abilities but found that the abilities that were previously easy to use could no longer be activated no matter what.</p><p></p><p>This kind of suppressor made no distinction between friend or foe.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "It worked! Go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng grinned, "Don't worry, Master Wei! I'll be right back!"</p><p></p><p>He then flew towards Lada and the others, stopping at a distance of fifty thousand meters. He pointed at them from afar.</p><p></p><p>'Wind Bullet'!</p><p></p><p>A golden beam shot out at extreme speed and precisely towards Lada's group after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Dumeng shouted in alarm, startling Lada and the others. They instinctively turned to look.</p><p></p><p>They saw a point of light gradually enlarging, obviously an attack launched from a distance, rapidly approaching them!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of a fist hitting the ground rang out.</p><p></p><p>The solid impact on the ground stunned Lada for a moment. "I don't make sounds when I punch..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Afu's panicked voice came, "Oh no, I can't use my ability anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Before they could react, the attack had arrived, not targeting any one of them but shooting into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>They had no time to feel relieved as the wind bullet exploded violently, kicking up dirt and sending all five of them flying and tumbling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, these people were extremely tough. They didn't suffer any major injuries and immediately scrambled back up, shaking their dizzy heads.</p><p></p><p>Lada, with an enraged expression, roared, "What's going on? Has the Earth-Scorching Armor returned?"</p><p></p><p>Afu tried to use his source ability again but failed, crying out in panic, "My ability has been disabled!"</p><p></p><p>The others also tried activating their sources and abilities but failed across the board, unable to let out even a fart.</p><p></p><p>Lada frowned and punched the ground with a roar.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A dull thud sounded from the ground, no different from a normal punch.</p><p></p><p>He immediately realized that his own source ability had been disabled too!</p><p></p><p>This feeling was infinitely worse than facing the crystal Gundam.</p><p></p><p>If he still had his abilities, no matter what situation he encountered, he would still have a way to fight back. But if his abilities were gone, he would lose everything, including his current position, and some might even kill him directly.</p><p></p><p>The five of them froze in place, at a loss for what to do.</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked to the President Lada, "President, what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lada didn't know what to do in this situation either.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another beam shot towards them from a distance - the second attack was coming.</p><p></p><p>Lada immediately said, "Scatter quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The five of them split up, but without their source abilities, their speed became extremely slow, no different from ordinary people, losing their former agility.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't run far before being blown away by the exploding wind bullet and rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Without source abilities, these five were no different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>They crawled up covered in dirt, and before Lada could feel the huge sense of loss, he straightened his windbreaker and shouted, "Run! Run back!"</p><p></p><p>Then he took the lead and started fleeing, though he thought it was useless to run in their current state.</p><p></p><p>But what if it worked? It was better than waiting around to die.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng sent a message to the group with a laugh, "Our suppressor is working better than expected. Those five have now become ordinary people unable to use source abilities."</p><p></p><p>After probing a few more times to confirm there were no issues, Fengcheng flickered and appeared in front of Lada's group, hovering in midair and blocking their path.</p><p></p><p>Lada and the others stopped in their tracks: "......"</p><p></p><p>They recognized him as the armored person who had punched Lada, making him cough up blood, before mysteriously disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He really wasn't dead!</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Earth-Scorching Armor exceeded Lada's imagination.</p><p></p><p>They immediately realized that the loss of their abilities might be related to the Earth-Scorching Armor before them.</p><p></p><p>Was disabling the source abilities of mages also one of the Earth-Scorching Armor's abilities?</p><p></p><p>Why did Lada feel it had even more abilities than the over two thousand source artifacts in the Association's storage room?</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng chuckled and moved swiftly, flickering to appear by each of the five in turn before knocking them away one by one.</p><p></p><p>Now Fengcheng felt relieved!</p><p></p><p>He landed and said softly, "You are all my prisoners now!"</p><p></p><p>Lada rolled over and charged at Fengcheng, raising his fist to punch the armor, but was frozen in place by a body-binding technique.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "I won't let you hit me again! You almost landed a punch, aren't you pissed?"</p><p></p><p>Dumeng, Lanxin and the others also mustered their fighting spirit and rushed at Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Whether they could win or not was one thing, but trying to fight was another.</p><p></p><p>None of the five were cowards afraid of death. Dying in battle was the end they had long accepted.</p><p></p><p>Only their heroic ends were destined to be unfulfilled. Before they could get close, Fengcheng immobilized them all, freezing them in place.</p><p></p><p>Lada's group had lost all hope!</p><p></p><p>Their life's glory ended here!</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng ignored their strange postures, waved his hand to levitate them, and quickly brought all five back to Suhao.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei! I've captured them!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the two towering armored figures of Suhao and Yashan, Lada's group was greatly shaken. "Damn, there are actually three Earth-Scorching Armors...no, four including that giant! Could they be the Earth-Scorching tribe?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 923</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The deities were the group most familiar with the primordial deity besides Su Hao's trio. If they took the initiative, they could completely take over maintaining the primordial deity for the eighteen people, while updating and replacing it based on the travelers' development.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the parallel worlds of each traveler also needed someone to regularly maintain and design them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao smiled and agreed: "Since you want to find something to do, I'll arrange some tasks for you! I'll first have you undergo some pre-job training to master the necessary skills."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the deities were truly excited.</p><p></p><p>Receiving Su Hao's reply, they all relaxed, each giving Yi a thumbs up, praising in the group: "Lord Yi is really impressive."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao sent out a clone to take all the deities away for training.</p><p></p><p>The reason Su Hao agreed so readily was because during this period, he had collected the wave data for the entire Xiang Hu galaxy system, and it was very clear.</p><p></p><p>Simulating and completing the wave pattern for the entire Xiang Hu system was no longer difficult.</p><p></p><p>Another month later, Xiao Guang finally sent a notification that the simulation of the wave pattern for the entire Xiang Hu system was complete.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately entered the pinball space, and in the nearly infinite domain of the pinball space, he simulated the entire Xiang Hu system.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, a simulated spiral galaxy appeared before him, composed of countless points of light, each representing a star. Countless points of light accumulated in places, forming many bands of light, like the spiral arms of a vortex, together forming a huge vortex.</p><p></p><p>Every place was filled with breathtaking beauty.</p><p></p><p>This was the Xiang Hu system where Su Hao currently resided.</p><p></p><p>Only it had been condensed many times over into its current form before him.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, all the stars dimmed, becoming bright pearls, while the 'wave' patterns permeating the entire Xiang Hu system lit up, fully displayed before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"The wave clusters have converged, I need to zoom in to observe. Fortunately, the pinball space has no size limit, it looks about the same as a universe."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Su Hao, the simulated Xiang Hu system immediately enlarged, continuously enlarging, and the wave patterns became clearly visible before Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>Line after line, strand after strand, interconnecting and crisscrossing, winding and turning, appearing chaotic yet also orderly.</p><p></p><p>After watching for a long time, Su Hao couldn't help but feel a bit dizzy...</p><p></p><p>Even with his tremendously powerful brain, having over a trillion star systems connected by interweaving lines laid out before him, he still found it rather taxing.</p><p></p><p>"The data collection is done, now it's time to analyze the data."</p><p></p><p>He slowly adjusted his state and began observing from the whole to the parts.</p><p></p><p>After the events of the source world, Su Hao learned that excellent thinking mode from Fei Yao, able to rapidly categorize and view large amounts of data, seeking out key patterns.</p><p></p><p>He believed that given enough time, there would certainly be corresponding results.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"So this is...the galactic network? It's so amazing!"</p><p></p><p>With Feng Cheng's help, Cong Shuling and Cong Renfei successfully accessed the galactic network. This was their first time entering this place, and they were stunned by the scenes they saw.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out Master and the others really could see the entire Xiang Hu system...but how did they manage to do this? What kind of people are Master and Uncle Master..."</p><p></p><p>They had followed Feng Cheng for over two hundred years now. Anything Feng Cheng casually took out could leave them utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention mastering such an amazingly supernatural skill, just knowing such a skill existed was already hard for them to believe.</p><p></p><p>Cong Renfei freely roamed the galactic network, lingering amidst the beautiful scenery of various planets, his joy reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>He understood once again the meaning of what Master Feng Cheng said about 'exploring the universe, exploring the unknown'. The planets floated like pinballs at his fingertips, free for him to admire - this feeling was simply too wonderful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had a strange feeling: "Master and the two Uncle Masters are the true gods of this universe, omnipotent primordial deities nurtured by the universe itself. Their birth is a blessing for this universe, and one day, the countless living beings in the universe will receive their three true gods' grace."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng had never told his disciples about his experiences, which was precisely why it sparked their boundless imagination and guesses about Feng Cheng's origins.</p><p></p><p>In their view, their Master and Uncle Masters must have extraordinary origins, most likely the three innate deities born at the inception of the universe.</p><p></p><p>At the origin of the universe, the source of rules, summoned by the universe's destiny, they formed three divine embryos, undergoing countless eons and rules' tempering, finally hatching and calling themselves Wanderers, roaming the endless universe. One day, they came to the Tenth Star and Blue-Purple Star, witnessing the birth of life on those planets, and conceived the idea of seeking out life and civilization in the universe...</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more plausible it seemed!</p><p></p><p>"Master (Sister), how is it, what's the galactic network like? Did you really see the entire Xiang Hu system?"</p><p></p><p>"But that's a galaxy over 200,000 light-years across, how could you possibly see it?"</p><p></p><p>"Supposedly all the planets are displayed in full detail before you, with no secrets, you can even see a single grain of sand on a planet 100,000 light-years away...it's too unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, just what did you see? Was it like the Founding Master described?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the envious looks around her, Cong Shuling showed a strange smile: "It was even more shocking than what the Master said! I can't describe the scenes I saw, I can only tell you that reality is even harder to believe than what you imagined. Keep working hard, once you master teleportation, you'll be qualified to learn the 'galactic network'. Luo Yanfeng has made the fastest progress, maybe in a few more years he'll get it."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng said humbly: "It's mainly because the Founding Master and Master taught so well."</p><p></p><p>He was extremely envious that his Master could enter the galactic network, but Founding Master Feng Cheng stipulated that to learn the galactic network, one must first master the 'teleportation' and 'blinking' abilities.</p><p></p><p>He had grasped those two abilities, but was still a bit short of true mastery. However, he was confident he would meet the requirements very soon.</p><p></p><p>She pushed through the surrounding crowd excitedly towards Feng Cheng: "Master, I successfully entered the galactic network."</p><p></p><p>While Cong Renfei said dazedly: "Master, my soul has ascended, I can sense your greatness."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed heartily: "If you all do well, you'll be able to see even vaster universes in the future."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciples' high spirits, the usually indulgent Feng Cheng struck a rare critical tone: "Don't get too excited yet, you're still green. Your current achievements are just the result of me forcefully imparting knowledge. Right now, your foundations are a complete mess."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Feng Cheng inwardly lamented: "In theory, these disciples are also Spirit Realm cultivators with external neural implants. Why are they still not making breakthroughs in their studies? I originally thought my learning ability was bad enough, but it turns out these disciples are even worse than me.</p><p></p><p>Could this be the legendary 'being spoiled leads to complacency'? Have I treated them too well, making them unaware of how precious this knowledge is?"</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Feng Cheng's disciples were progressing much faster than his initial pace, but under the same conditions, Feng Cheng was clearly far more outstanding and diligent than these disciples.</p><p></p><p>After all, these disciples had his personal guidance and various systems' help, while back then Feng Cheng was self-taught, to the point he even used his leisure time meant for enjoying music at the Celestial Court to self-study...</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another key point - the issue of thinking patterns. The thinking patterns catalyzed by the system were fundamentally different from the thinking patterns shed and explored through self-study.</p><p></p><p>After explaining this key point again, Feng Cheng said: "First, congratulations on successfully mastering the 'galactic network'. From today onwards, in addition to studying, every twenty years you need to complete the exploration of one galaxy system, searching for life-bearing planets. When I need you to carry out missions, I'll send you over."</p><p></p><p>The brother and sister immediately straightened their expressions and said loudly: "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng showed a satisfied smile: Finally, finally there were people who could help him complete the galactic exploration missions.</p><p></p><p>This was just the beginning. Many years later, he would have thousands upon thousands of disciples and disciples' disciples helping him explore the galaxies.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Feng Cheng's heart swell with joy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a huge dragon head extended over from the side - it was the Crimson Demon King. He curiously asked: "Master, what are you all doing?"</p><p></p><p>In these two hundred years, the Crimson Demon King had fallen severely behind.</p><p></p><p>Not because he wasn't smart, but because he had become obsessed with studying the mini-worlds.</p>

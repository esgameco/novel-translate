        <h1>Chapter 783</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This palace was called the 'Eternal Splendor Palace' by the immortal cultivation realm, the place where Eternal Splendor cultivated in the past.</p><p></p><p>Now it has become the residence of the 'Immortal Emperor'.</p><p></p><p>The outer areas of the Eternal Splendor Palace were in a semi-open state. As long as you paid enough for the entrance tickets, you could visit and tour the outer areas of the palace. </p><p></p><p>Of course, in order to attract enough tourists, there was also a professional 'Immortal Cultivation Aptitude Testing Station' established here. After paying enough money, you would have the qualification to participate in an hour-long immortal cultivation test.</p><p></p><p>At this time, many tourists were coming and going incessantly at the main gate of the Eternal Splendor Palace.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Hao was immersed in contemplation and distant memories, a young girl in a yellow and white long gown approached carefully and asked, "This...fellow cultivator? Excuse me, are you an immortal from the sacred realm?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao regained his senses, turned to look, and saw it was a young lady dressed in an immortal-like manner, staring at him with round eyes, both anxious and hopeful.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head and said, "No, this is my first time here."</p><p></p><p>The girl let out a long sigh of relief. For some reason, when she first saw Su Hao, her heart suddenly started beating faster, and she impulsively took the initiative to strike up a conversation with him, which was something she had never done before.</p><p></p><p>She sized Su Hao up and down, and couldn't help but inwardly sigh, "Too handsome, perfectly matching my image of what an immortal should look like! It's not a loss to take a couple glances up close. And with such good looks, he doesn't seem like a bad person either."</p><p></p><p>She stared at Su Hao with unblinking eyes and said, "I see, I'm also here for the first time! Are you here to seek an immortal master for cultivation as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps!" Su Hao lightly smiled and started walking inwards.</p><p></p><p>The girl thought for a moment, then followed after Su Hao and said, "I'm also here to seek an immortal master for cultivation. I'm not too familiar with this place, why don't we team up? That way we can keep each other company.</p><p></p><p>Don't let my frail appearance fool you, I'll secretly tell you, I'm actually a very powerful Class B superhuman, capable of roaming the star domains alone."</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao walked, he glanced at her and casually responded, "Oh, very powerful indeed."</p><p></p><p>The girl giggled, "Let me introduce myself, my name is Yue Xiaodan, you can call me Xiaodan. For some reason, I feel like you look very familiar, like I've seen you somewhere before. I even thought you were an immortal from the sacred realm, then I saw you on TV, but I didn't expect you were also here to seek a master. By the way, what's your name?"</p><p></p><p>After entering the tall gate tower, three huge golden statues of the Three Human Divine Saints stood towering before them, and next to the three statues sat a woman with a blissful smile on her face - it was Eternal Splendor herself.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually replied, "My name is Jia Wei."</p><p></p><p>Yue Xiaodan immediately exclaimed happily, "Nice to meet you, Jia Wei. Are you a superhuman? It's okay if you're not, I can protect you...eh? Your name is Jia Wei? That name also sounds so familiar, I don't know where I've heard it before..."</p><p></p><p>She frowned in distress and patted her head, but quickly put the question aside.</p><p></p><p>With a handsome man accompanying her, she needed to get closer to him quickly, in case this was her chance at romance...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made her giddy with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Then following Su Hao's gaze, she saw the three standing statues and one sitting statue, and chattered, "Jia Wei, fellow cultivator, let me tell you a secret. It's said that the Immortal Ancestor Wuguishenzu had an extremely close relationship with the Three Divine Saints, but for some unknown reason, the Three Divine Saints suddenly disappeared thousands of years ago. It was in order to search for the Three Divine Saints that the Immortal Ancestor established the Immortal Cultivation Sacred Realm. Unfortunately, the Three Divine Saints vanished without a trace, and the Immortal Ancestor's wish was never fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>Did you see the couplet on the main gate? 'The spiritual light cannot be found in the sea of people, the rights and wrongs of the mortal world are empty.' It's said that the Immortal Ancestor personally wrote it before leaving, probably out of longing for the Three Divine Saints.</p><p></p><p>However, many people speculate that the Three Divine Saints had already died for some unknown reason over six thousand years ago. What's even more regrettable is that over so many years, a lot of information about the Three Divine Saints has been lost.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it was stored in the Alliance's archives and is no longer publicly available, which is really a pity.</p><p></p><p>How about that, is this a secret you haven't heard before?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually replied, "Yeah, first time hearing it."</p><p></p><p>Xiaodan studied Su Hao's face, then looked towards the statues ahead and exclaimed in surprise, "Ah! I suddenly realized you look very similar to Xu Shiqiang of the Three Divine Saints!"</p><p></p><p>She carefully examined him and marveled, "Not just similar, you two are practically from the same mold! Could you be related to the Divine Saint Xu Shiqiang by blood? Could you be his descendant? Oh my god! No wonder you look so familiar!"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly seemed to remember something and slapped her thigh, "That's right! I remember Xu Shiqiang of the Divine Saints had a courtesy name called Jia Wei... No wonder your name sounded so familiar to me."</p><p></p><p>She laughed heartily, "Haha, your parents must have big ambitions, actually giving you this name. Maybe they saw you looked like the Divine Saint from a young age and named you after him!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, she also thought of 'plastic surgery'!</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a sense of dislike arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She thought to herself, "But he really is handsome. I'll take another look then leave. Hmph! I won't associate with someone like this!"</p><p></p><p>When she turned her head, she found that the handsome Jia Wei had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>She was dumbfounded and looked around, "Where did he go? He was just right beside me a second ago. As a Class B superhuman, I definitely wouldn't have missed him...could he be a Class A or even Class S superhuman?"</p><p></p><p>She stamped her feet angrily and headed inwards.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao had already locked onto the location of the 'Fourth Immortal Emperor'.</p><p></p><p>He then directly flashed and appeared before the 'Fourth Immortal Emperor', smiling and saying, "Are you the Fourth Immortal Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The reason he chose this moment to flash in was because the 'Fourth Immortal Emperor' had just completed a stage of his cultivation and opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Out of courtesy, Su Hao did not rashly disturb him during his cultivation, but instead waited until he finished before flashing in.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged with closed eyes in front of Su Hao was a handsome young man in a golden robe. At this moment, the young man's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Hao had already been very considerate of the young man's emotions, his appearance still startled the young man, causing his anus to tighten. His butt, which had been slightly numb from sitting for too long, instantly regained feeling.</p><p></p><p>If anyone was in the midst of absolutely secluded closed-door cultivation, and a casual young man in a shirt suddenly appeared smiling and greeting them, wouldn't they be scared out of their wits?</p><p></p><p>"An assassin!"</p><p></p><p>Before the young man in the golden robe could ponder how someone else had appeared in his sealed chamber, his instincts kicked in. He made a hand seal, causing a golden light to shine around his body, forming a protective barrier. At the same time, a beam of light shot towards Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Shaaâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't expect the young man to react so strongly and attack him on sight, but he didn't panic. He casually raised his hand and caught the golden beam the young man fired, then gently pinched it, causing the golden light to shatter and scatter into the air.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the golden robe was stunned by Su Hao's actions, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets.</p><p></p><p>Although the attack he had casually unleashed may not have been extremely powerful, it certainly wasn't something that could be so easily crushed like a toy!</p><p></p><p>The young man in the golden robe immediately shot up into the sky, breaking through the thick dome ceiling. Hovering in the air, he casually tossed down a super concentrated spiritual power bomb he had prepared.</p><p></p><p>'Black Twilight'!</p><p></p><p>At the moment the bomb exploded in the palace, everyone around instinctively looked towards the center of the Eternal Splendor Palace, but in an instant they squinted and cried out in pain, covering their eyes as streams of tears poured out.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much they blinked, they couldn't see clearly, as if it had turned to night.</p><p></p><p>"Boomâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by violent shaking underfoot, a tremendous roar erupted from the center of the Eternal Splendor Palace.</p><p></p><p>The sound pierced their ears, but what people felt more was as if their hearts had been struck by a war hammer, an excruciating pain in their entire chest cavity.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the golden robe narrowed his eyes as he hovered in the sky, thinking to himself, "Did that get rid of the mysterious assassin?"</p><p></p><p>"Shaa shaa shaaâ€”"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, dozens of rays of light flew in from all directions, steadily stopping beside the young man.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor frowned, "Just now when this emperor had finished meditating in the chamber, I discovered an assassin had infiltrated. His strength is not weak - this strike may not have been enough to kill him, so be careful."</p><p></p><p>"An assassin?"</p><p></p><p>The others' expressions turned grim.</p><p></p><p>Another assassin. In the past thousand years, the Eternal Splendor Palace had frequently been attacked by all kinds of powerful assassins, vexing them endlessly, yet they were helpless to stop it.</p><p></p><p>If you asked who in the Yuanhuan System had the most valuable head, it would undoubtedly be the Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor's head was the ultimate goal for every human assassin across the entire Yuanhuan System.</p><p></p><p>However, the others weren't too worried, for they knew the Immortal Emperor was recognized as the strongest cultivator among humans. Even if countless assassins infiltrated the Immortal Cultivation Sacred Realm, none of them would be a match for the Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Just that 'Black Twilight' the Immortal Emperor had casually unleashed earlier - in the entire star system, only a handful of people could withstand it head-on.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice came from ahead, "So you're the Immortal Emperor! Don't get too excited, I just want to ask you some questions!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 816</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Thinking he had completely let his guard down against the Golden God Bari who he thought he could see through, Xu Hao boldly went to investigate the situation of the 'Hidden God' Xu Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as he didn't master the 'Soul Scattering Technique', Xu Hao posed no threat to him. Even if all his physical bodies were destroyed, he could still revive smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Soul Scattering Technique' was an ability different from other soul techniques. It could dissolve and destroy the 'divine light' that carried the soul. In the common perception of ordinary people, this ability could be seen as the ability to subdue all deities.</p><p></p><p>However, for the Golden God Bari, even with the 'Soul Scattering Technique' it didn't matter. As a deity, he would not be threatened by a mere soul technique.</p><p></p><p>Having the Soul Scattering Technique didn't necessarily mean it could do anything to him. The so-called deity-subduing ability was not actually as powerful as rumored among ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Deities were just that powerful and unbeatable.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the Golden God Bari and the divine messenger Bode came to Bubble Island. After reporting their identities, they successfully took over the Bubble Pirates.</p><p></p><p>In this world, all soul masters and soul guardians who mastered supernatural powers were endowed with those abilities by deities personally planting soul seeds within them.</p><p></p><p>And those who were planted with soul seeds would forever belong to that deity's servants. In the presence of that deity, they would sense an overwhelming pressure and have no will to resist or betray the deity.</p><p></p><p>Bari sat on the throne at the pirate hideout, with a group of ragged pirates kneeling below, emitting a strange putrid smell that even Bari, the Golden God who was used to the Golden Land, could hardly stand.</p><p></p><p>Was this the "fairly capable" pirate gang that Bode spoke of? On this island with bubble hot springs, they were too lazy to even bathe?</p><p></p><p>To live in such squalor, yet they were followers of him, the Golden God Bari - it was embarrassing. If these pirates weren't still somewhat useful now, he would have taken back the soul seeds and thrown them all into the sea to feed the fish.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them in this state made the divine messenger Bode quite embarrassed too, his expression extremely unpleasant, making the pirates tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>If they knew their deity's thoughts, they would surely retort: We're doing pretty well around here, don't all pirates look like this? Who cares about appearances? We just take whatever we want, no need to dress up...</p><p></p><p>After briefly understanding the situation of these pirates, Bari turned to Bode and asked, "When is the 'Evil Dragon Legend' expected to arrive at Bubble Island?"</p><p></p><p>Bode replied without hesitation, "Based on the trajectory, they're expected to arrive at Bubble Island tomorrow evening. According to the information received, they will definitely choose a deserted, uninhabited islet to rest and recuperate."</p><p></p><p>He opened up the map of the islands he took from the pirates, displaying the map of Bubble Island.</p><p></p><p>Bubble Island was a teardrop-shaped island, with several islets of varying sizes scattered on both sides at the tip of the Bubble Sea.</p><p></p><p>Bode pointed at the islets and said, "The goal of the Evil Dragon Legend should be to return to Dragon State as soon as possible, so they definitely won't land on the main island, but will choose one of these uninhabited islets to land on. Of these islets, this one appears flatter and more suitable for observation, so...</p><p></p><p>As long as we station a few people on the other islets, and leave this one vacant, the Evil Dragon Legend is highly likely to choose to stop at this vacant islet we leave for them."</p><p></p><p>Bari nodded in approval at Bode, this capable divine messenger. "Bode's work pleases me. Let's proceed as you suggested."</p><p></p><p>Even if the judgment was wrong, the situation would still be under their control.</p><p></p><p>Bari added, "Pay special attention, all the pirates must control their eyes and not look recklessly at the Evil Dragon Legend, lest they notice our preparations.</p><p></p><p>Wait for my orders. Act without hostility, pretending to pass by and discover them by chance. I want to see where exactly this new deity is hiding. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>He opened his palm, from which golden specks of light emerged, scattering them with a wave of his hand into the pirates' bodies to combine with their soul seeds.</p><p></p><p>This was a soul technique unique to deities called 'Shared Vision Avatar', which allowed him to share the pirates' sight and hearing by combining with their soul seeds, and even temporarily take over their bodies to control their movements and combat.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect of the soul technique only lasted a few days, it was more than enough to deal with this situation.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Bari dismissed the pirates and sat alone on the chair, pondering. Before long, he revealed a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next afternoon, outside the waters of Bubble Island, an enormous dragon carrying three young dragons flew rapidly in the sky. </p><p></p><p>It was the mother dragon Shadow and her three children.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the back of mother dragon Shadow cultivating his spiritual power, Xu Hao suddenly opened his eyes and shouted loudly, "Mother Shadow, I can already sense the island ahead. It may be the Bubble Island with hot springs that you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>The two young dragon cubs became excited upon hearing this. "Bubble hot springs? Mother Shadow, can we take a bath?"</p><p></p><p>The second sister dragon Molly's eyes lit up too. "Can we bathe?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shadow was also tempted by the idea of bathing, as it had been a long time since she last properly cleaned her entire body of scales. Just thinking about arriving at an island where they could bathe, she immediately felt the discomfort of her dirty body.</p><p></p><p>However, what concerned her more was the safety of herself and her three children.</p><p></p><p>She hesitated, but ultimately consulted Xu Hao, "Leian, my child, what do you think? My biggest concern is your safety. If there are any existences on the island that could threaten us, then we'll choose to land on an uninhabited place to rest. But if there's no threat to us, then I'll take you all to experience the pleasure of soaking in the hot springs."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao could tell that mother dragon Shadow wanted to soak in the hot springs, but was genuinely worried about their safety, hence her hesitation.</p><p></p><p>However, this was an easy problem to solve in Xu Hao's view - if she wanted to bathe, then just bathe.</p><p></p><p>So he asked, "Mother Shadow, what kind of existence would be considered a threat to us?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shadow replied, "Soul masters and soul guardians above level 7 would pose a threat to us. Below level 7, there's no need to worry, as I can easily handle them and ensure the children's safety."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao had traveled a distance with mother dragon Shadow on the Celestial Path, and could now distinguish the levels of soul guardians and soul masters, including divine messengers. The only information he was missing was about deities.</p><p></p><p>As they got closer, Xu Hao extended his spiritual sense to carefully discern the state of every life on the island, using Little Light to label each person's level.</p><p></p><p>He quickly got the results. "Oh? On such a small island, there are actually two divine messengers? One is weaker, just slightly above level 7 from my perception. The other seems more powerful.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, there are quite a few people, but all level 6 and below, no threat.</p><p></p><p>So in other words, as long as I take out the two divine messengers, the rest won't pose a threat. That would also satisfy mother Shadow's wish to bathe.</p><p></p><p>And even if I take out the two divine messengers, they essentially won't die. Their wills can return and they'll be revived. Just two avatars gone, no big deal. Might as well satisfy mother Shadow's wish, since she's been carrying us on this long flight, which can't have been easy."</p><p></p><p>With his decision made, Xu Hao locked onto the two divine messengers with his spiritual sense. His right fist clenched, he struck forcefully towards mother dragon's back.</p><p></p><p>'Locking Fist'!</p><p></p><p>Amplified by the power of the Source, Xu Hao's tremendously powerful fist instantly traversed the vast distance, transferring into the heads of the Golden God Bari and the divine messenger Bode, instantly turning their brains to mush.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, Bari and Bode at the Bubble Pirate headquarters were brimming with confidence, feeling everything was under their control. The next moment, they shuddered, blood gushing from all orifices as they collapsed limply to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The level 6 soul master pirate leader Bubble stared dumbfounded at the bloodied corpses of his great deity and divine messenger.</p><p></p><p>His mind was filled with question marks: "What's going on?"</p>

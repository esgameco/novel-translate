        <h1>Chapter 851</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The reason why Su Hao sent all these deities to the far side of such a distant galaxy was not out of a guilty conscience to give these deities a vacation, but rather to conduct the final verification and find the flaw in the Ten-Colored Plate's thought process.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he inadvertently discovered that the current state of thinking of these deities had become somewhat dull compared to a year ago.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only an extremely slight change, it was enough to catch Su Hao's attention.</p><p></p><p>This was because it was not just one deity whose thinking had slowed down, but all eighteen deities were in this state.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation and research over a period of time, Su Hao guessed the reason for this slowing of thought: after Su Hao had confined the Ten-Colored Plate in the small world, it lacked sufficient active information interaction, causing the overall internal motion to slow down.</p><p></p><p>Likening the Ten-Colored Plate to a boiling pot of water, with a large amount of active information being the flame underneath, when the flame was extinguished, this pot of water gradually cooled until, at room temperature, the motion of this pot of water became extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>And the direct result of the Ten-Colored Plate's motion slowing down was that the deities residing within it gradually lost the ability to perceive the normal passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was 'a blink spanning a million years, unaware' - they thought they had just blinked their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As for why Su Hao sent them to the desolate cosmic region, the purpose was to make them bored and cut off the possibility of these eighteen deities engaging in a large amount of information exchange, extinguishing the 'flame' that fueled them, so he could observe whether their 'temperature' would drop faster.</p><p></p><p>If it was as Su Hao had imagined, then Su Hao could probably guess the reason behind the various behaviors of these deities: absorbing believers, walking the world with divided wills, creating more opportunities for interaction to keep their will functioning normally.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these deities were not even aware that the reason they spread their soul seeds and established sects proclaiming themselves as deities was merely an instinct.</p><p></p><p>They simply did so as a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Hao discovered that a lack of believers and abundant interaction would cause the deities' thoughts to slow down, he would have thought the deities' creation of sects was just a coincidence. But after discovering the slowing of the deities' thoughts, he could only see it as an inevitability.</p><p></p><p>Because the deities needed constant interaction - they could not be separated from the massive amount of information convergence provided by their myriad believers.</p><p></p><p>Thinking even deeper: what was the original state of the White Demiurge's thoughts?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the true White Demiurge's observation, a smile lasted a year, a sentence could span ten years, and everything around them in their observation moved at an incredibly rapid pace, with the planet they were on spinning like a top...</p><p></p><p>It was not until the first White Demiurge came to the Cruciform Star and interacted extensively with the intelligent life there that the world in the White Demiurge's eyes gradually slowed down, revealing a brand new cosmic appearance. Greatly intrigued by the intelligent life on the Cruciform Star, it then began calling out to its closest kin to come and enjoy all this together...</p><p></p><p>And the White Demiurge's various abnormal behaviors were interpreted differently by these deities:</p><p></p><p>Kind, cowardly, lacking self...</p><p></p><p>But this was not important to the White Demiurge.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the above was just Su Hao's conjecture based on the current situation - how things actually were would have to be verified one by one in the future.</p><p></p><p>After 'exiling' the deities to the other side of the galaxy, he returned to his own laboratory and entered the Pinball Space, sitting at his desk to begin organizing the many gains from this past year.</p><p></p><p>"First, it can be confirmed that soul force can package consciousness and transfer it into another body.</p><p></p><p>This way, I can also transfer my consciousness information into a spiritual brain, completely freeing myself from the shackles of the flesh-and-blood brain.</p><p></p><p>However, I cannot use the soul force of these deities, as the soul force of deities carries two imprints - one from the White Demiurge and one from the deity itself. If I were to use their soul force to carry my consciousness information, it would be like lying down under their blade after being whitewashed.</p><p></p><p>What I need is soul force that belongs entirely to myself. But for now I have not yet found a way to convert source energy into soul force. However, I believe that as research deepens, I will definitely succeed.</p><p></p><p>Second, regarding the spiritual brain's lack of psychic power, after extensive testing on experimental subjects, it was found that spiritual brains mixed with soul force made up for the spiritual brain's lack of explosive power and possessed multi-dimensional psychic power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as I can obtain soul force that belongs entirely to me, I can create a relatively perfect brain. The problems that plagued me in my previous life will no longer be problems then.</p><p></p><p>Third is the issue of soul force recovery and decay.</p><p></p><p>The recovery of soul force involves the essence of soul force. After the soul seed enters the brain of an intelligent life and fuses with it, it can recover soul force through special cultivation methods, using the soul seed as the core to stack and enhance information. However, this method of cultivation does not recover soul force very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the deities and their believers have constructed a vast soul force network on this planet. Under the shroud of this network, there is a certain probability that individuals born carrying innate soul force will emerge within the intelligent species population. These special individuals are known as natural-born soul cultivators and are quickly absorbed into the deities' sects.</p><p></p><p>Some highly intelligent creatures in nature also have a chance of giving birth to soul force, forming the sovereigns among beasts - soul beasts.</p><p></p><p>I can sense that during this year when I shielded the deities, almost no new soul beasts were born.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as I can figure out the mechanism behind the birth of soul force, I will likely be able to catalyze the emergence of soul force that belongs to me.</p><p></p><p>The mother planet of the White Demiurge must be permeated by this network capable of catalyzing the birth of soul force. If I can find the White Demiurge's mother planet, I can find a way to spontaneously acquire soul force.</p><p></p><p>As for the issue of soul force decay, there is no doubt that soul force will gradually decay over time, just like all life grows old.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this rate of decay is extremely slow. Based on the decay rate, it would take at least nearly a hundred million years to reach the end point.</p><p></p><p>Not just life or soul force, in my observations, all matter is 'aging' - including a simple stone, the massive planets, stars, even entire galaxies, without exception.</p><p></p><p>This may be the overarching trend of all matter in this universe, with minor cycles within the major cycle.</p><p></p><p>However, like spiritual power, soul force can be renewed, so I do not need to worry about the lifespan issue of soul force.</p><p></p><p>Fourth is the soul force's radiation communication function, which is hundreds of times stronger than spiritual power. In other words, as long as I obtain this soul force power, my 'divine sense' perception will be amplified hundreds of times over, easily covering an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>At that point, if I want to observe a planet, I won't need to use the special force field of the spiritual eye. A divine sense capable of covering an entire planet - just thinking about it makes me feel powerful!</p><p></p><p>For example, the 'breaking of seals' that the deities instinctively used after being confined by Su Hao's spatial restraints has extremely high value.</p><p></p><p>The essence of this ability is to radiate a massive information attack with extremely strong penetrative power, completely destroying any restraining structures containing psychic power, allowing them to break free.</p><p></p><p>When used by the deities, this skill can even destroy the basic structures of materials without psychic power - for example, a cage forged from finest steel cannot remain intact under the deities' 'breaking of seals.'</p><p></p><p>Other skills like 'soul search' and 'division of will' are also very useful..."</p><p></p><p>It's unknown how long passed before Su Hao put down his pen, filed away the notes he had written that day, and then stared blankly ahead, falling into deeper contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Su Hao opened his eyes and murmured, "The difficulties obstructing me have been resolved one by one. In this world, within a hundred years, I have absolute confidence that I can find a way to create soul force that belongs solely to me, and then construct a new spiritual brain to achieve immortality.</p><p></p><p>Once I attain immortality...there is still the Wave!</p><p></p><p>And after resolving the Wave..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao turned to look at his surroundings and thought to himself, "My core - the Pinball Space! Although I've reached this level thanks entirely to the Pinball Space, I cannot stake my entire destiny on the absolute safety of the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>If in the distant future, the Pinball Space were to suddenly collapse for unknown reasons, taking my consciousness information down with it, all the knowledge and wealth I've accumulated over so many years of effort and struggle would be instantly reduced to nothing."</p><p></p><p>"I cannot rely too heavily on the Pinball Space. Even if my consciousness information does not leave the Pinball Space, I must find a way to be able to leave the Pinball Space at any time."</p><p></p><p>The Wave and the Pinball Space - those were the last two goals.</p><p></p><p>But Su Hao felt that these two goals might not be so easy to achieve.</p><p></p><p>"I already have a preliminary plan for resolving the Wave, and I can immediately implement it once my research into soul force is thorough. As for the Pinball Space...I have no clue."</p><p></p><p>After pondering aimlessly in the Pinball Space for a while longer, he exited and wandered around the small world before sending a message to Yashan and Fengcheng: "Yashan, Fengcheng, how is your 'Egg God' project progressing?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan quickly replied, "Chief Wei, progress is very smooth. The first batch of 'Egg Gods' has already been produced and we are currently testing the growth attributes of the 'Egg Gods.' At most two months and we'll have the results. If all goes well, we can start mass production."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "The progress is much faster than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed heartily, "Not only has the 'Egg God' production line been established, but the other workshops are almost finished construction too, thanks to Fengcheng's friends working very hard."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng then said, "All thanks to Boss Yashan's good teaching."</p><p></p><p>After praising the two, Su Hao said, "Complete the base construction as soon as possible. Once it's done, I have an exploration mission for you two - search for the White Demiurge's mother planet within this galaxy."</p>

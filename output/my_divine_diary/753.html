        <h1>Chapter 753</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>As for whether his experiment had attracted attention from others, Su Hao couldn't be bothered to care.</p><p></p><p>To him, what did it matter if others paid attention or not?</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Ill-Fate System was powerless against him. Whatever he wanted to do was just a thought away.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Su Hao had transformed such a massive amount of material at once. He originally thought it would be somewhat strenuous. </p><p></p><p>But contrary to his expectations, the energy consumption from transforming the material was not as great as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>This would have been absolutely impossible to do so effortlessly before.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but exclaim: "The external brain's amplification of my abilities is indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>He stepped towards the huge spherical blue crystal, then placed his hand on it, sending out neural clusters that adhered firmly to the crystal wall.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try if the blue crystal I transformed from the source can allow me to enter the 'Planetary Network'."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao released his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No reaction at all!"</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the pure blue crystal alone could not allow him to access the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought silently: "Perhaps it has something to do with that special free particle energy. Then let me try infusing the blue crystal with free particles!"</p><p></p><p>These particles were new to Su Hao, and he had only discovered them within this type of blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>Incredibly, they could move freely within the tightly structured blue crystal, similar to extranuclear electrons.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually named them 'blue particles'.</p><p></p><p>If the 'blue particles' were separated from the blue crystal, they would lose their activity and quickly transition to an excited state, dissipating as photons.</p><p></p><p>But within the blue crystal, the blue particles could persist for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had researched these free particles early on and successfully transformed them from the source. Moreover, since blue particles were 'elemental', transforming them was much easier than the blue crystal itself.</p><p></p><p>He placed his hand on the blue crystal, guiding out a large amount of source that surged into the crystal. Under the influence of his spiritual power, they transformed into a vast quantity of 'blue particles' that roamed within the blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>About twenty seconds later, Su Hao released his hand.</p><p></p><p>Extending his consciousness, he carefully compared the differences between the blue crystal he created and the ones on the God Planet.</p><p></p><p>The result was that there were no differences.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "Let me see if this dream stone I made by hand can allow me to access the 'Planetary Network'!"</p><p></p><p>If successful, it meant that even if he couldn't unravel the secrets of the 'Planetary Network' in this world, he would still have a chance to continue researching after being reborn into the next world.</p><p></p><p>That would be quite reassuring.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao placed his hand on the blue crystal again, sending out numerous neural clusters to adhere to the crystal wall.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a massive amount of information surged into Su Hao's mind through the neural clusters.</p><p></p><p>After adapting for a period, he successfully accessed the 'Planetary Network', also known as the 'Stargazing World'!</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Su Hao released his hand and muttered: "The ability to access the 'Planetary Network' is indeed greatly related to the 'blue particles', or rather, the 'blue crystal' is merely a carrier, while the true key to accessing the 'Planetary Network' is the 'blue particles'!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't rush to verify whether this was true or not.</p><p></p><p>His vast consciousness spread out, enveloping the huge blue crystal sphere.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he placed his hand on the blue crystal, separating a 'mini-self' to enter the 'Planetary Network' and observe its situation at all times.</p><p></p><p>Then, with his consciousness, he lifted the massive blue crystal sphere into the air, flying higher and higher until entering outer space, heading deeper into the void.</p><p></p><p>This was the second experiment he wanted to conduct: the relationship between the clarity of the 'Planetary Network' and the volume of the blue crystal.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Hao suddenly threw out a huge spherical blue crystal, as well as a video of him carrying the blue crystal into space, causing another online sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Where did that blue crystal come from? Anyone who saw it clearly, speak up."</p><p></p><p>"I slowed down the video a thousand times, and the conclusion is - it just appeared out of nowhere."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Xu Shiqiang could create things from nothing! Indeed, myths are myths, existences that no one can surpass. Perhaps years later, someone will call him the 'Holy Ancestor', 'Divine Race', or 'Dao Ancestor'!"</p><p></p><p>"No need to wait years, I think we can do it now."</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a teleportation array effect? Although I didn't see any teleportation array..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard Xu Shiqiang has an invincible skill called 'Hundred Strikes, Hundred Hits', maybe this is the effect of that, though the scale seems a bit exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the largest human teleportation array couldn't fit that blue crystal!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did Xu Shiqiang take the blue crystal into space? Looks so cool, I want to try it too."</p><p></p><p>"Wake up, you can at most jump two meters."</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Shiqiang a celestial being? He just casually carried such a huge thing into the sky with one hand. Even if I broke my neck, I couldn't look up to the soles of his feet!"</p><p></p><p>"From these videos, I've discovered a truth: the gap between people is even greater than the Cloud Ring System."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This time, when Ship Captain Xia Qingjun and others saw the video, they didn't find it so shocking anymore.</p><p></p><p>They just casually watched it, then went about their business, neither overly excited nor depressed...</p><p></p><p>Drinking tea, drinking tea!</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "No way!"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua asked, "Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng replied, "Haha, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua asked again, "Can you reach Uncle's level, Brother Feng Cheng?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng nodded, "Of course, who do you think I am?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua said, "But you just said you don't know..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled, "Being able to do it and knowing how are two different things! I can do it, but it doesn't mean I know how.</p><p></p><p>The only one who knows the answer is the Great Protector."</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua exclaimed in surprise, "That makes so much sense... what about my uncle then?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked, "Why, what do you want to do with him? You want to move blue crystals too?"</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua said, "No, not that, I'm just curious. I thought cultivating could reach that level!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng replied, "You're just a little Yuanying cultivator, at most you can bully some psychics!"</p><p></p><p>Besides being a top researcher, Yong Hua's identity as a 'Yuanying cultivator' was also renowned in the psychic world, regarded as the strongest under the 'Three Divine Saints' among humans.</p><p></p><p>Her prestige was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>However, in the eyes of Su Hao and others, she was just a weak little girl.</p><p></p><p>The kind who would cry after being hit once.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if not for Su Hao's overwhelming pressure deterring them, she would probably have been taken away for research.</p><p></p><p>Yong Hua sighed, "Alright then! If you won't teach me, I'll practice on my own! I'm a genius, what could be difficult for me?"</p><p></p><p>Watching Yong Hua's disappearing figure, Feng Cheng shook his head and smiled, "A genius? Heh! Can being a genius really bridge the gap with the Great Protector?</p><p></p><p>Mortals will only use the word 'great' to evaluate the Great Protector, but they fundamentally don't understand his true greatness.</p><p></p><p>This is why the Great Protector has never cared about people's opinions."</p><p></p><p>With that, he returned to his lab, continuing to research the mother bug's eggs.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't figure out why, despite the genetic sequences being flawless, the developed organisms were all bizarre monstrosities.</p><p></p><p>He thought silently, "Perhaps it has something to do with the gene expression sequence, I can approach it from this angle!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao moved farther and farther away from the God Planet, he found the scenes in the 'Planetary Network' becoming increasingly blurred.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought inwardly, "Indeed, it's related to the warping of space-time!"</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the blue crystal Su Hao was holding accessed the 'Planetary Network' through a hierarchical connection method:</p><p></p><p>The sequence was: Su Hao's consciousness connects to the blue crystal - the blue crystal connects to the God Planet - the God Planet connects to the Star System - the Star System connects to the Cloud Ring System...</p><p></p><p>A step-by-step progression.</p><p></p><p>And the connection method relied on being within the absolute gravitational field of the higher level.</p><p></p><p>For example, while Su Hao's blue crystal was still within the gravitational field of the God Planet, it could still access the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>But as the blue crystal gradually moved away from the God Planet's gravitational field, the connection to the God Planet was severed.</p><p></p><p>This was commonly referred to as "losing signal".</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought it made sense.</p><p></p><p>But the signal had weakened to the point where it was insufficient for him to enter the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>So why did the signal weaken after moving away?</p><p></p><p>Just like how Su Hao rarely saw small asteroids in space within the 'Planetary Network'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao revealed an inexplicable smile, "Coincidentally, I happen to master the technique of warping space-time. I can completely create an artificial space-time warp in the space around the blue crystal to forcibly connect to the 'Planetary Network'!"</p><p></p><p>He acted on his thought, expelling a large amount of pink crystal armor from within his body that scattered around the blue crystal at various positions, forming an array for 'space-time warping'.</p><p></p><p>'Activate'!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Su Hao opened his eyes, "Success!"</p><p></p><p>A long time later, he released his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time warping is indeed an amazing thing. When interconnected, it can form a vast information network."</p>

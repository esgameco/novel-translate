        <h1>Chapter 852</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Eighteen deities were exiled by Su Hao to a desolate galaxy. At first, for a few days they were excited to explore the planets, the universe, and observe deep space.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, they realized that in this area, apart from the eighteen of them frolicking around, there was nothing else around them. </p><p></p><p>Even though they possessed the skill of "traversing thousands of miles in an instant", with a speed close to half the speed of light, it was still very slow on the cosmic scale, and it was not an easy task to break away from this galaxy.</p><p></p><p>So they began to get bored.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to gain freedom, but this extraordinarily empty freedom was not what they wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Lei An say he would let us take a few days off? So much time has passed, more than just a few days, I reckon it's been two months. Why hasn't Lord Lei An come to take us back yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Two months? It should be five months already. It's quite obvious that Lord Lei An may have found a new lover and forgotten about us. Everyone, fend for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"I think Lei An probably wanted to come find us a long time ago, but he just got lost and doesn't remember where he threw us anymore. After all, the entire galaxy is so vast, this place of ours is just a random point in the galaxy, like a grain of sand in the desert. Could you find a designated grain of sand in the desert? At least I couldn't."</p><p></p><p>The other deities thought about it, and indeed that was the reason, each of them panicked: "Then what should we do? This place should be on the other side of the Crux, according to Lei An's calculations, it's at least tens of thousands of light-years away, it would probably take hundreds of thousands of years to fly back..."</p><p></p><p>"That's not the key point, the key is do you know where the Crux is?"</p><p></p><p>"We can't go back..."</p><p></p><p>Then the Thunder God Gu Hei frowned and started blaming the Night God Yongshi: "Lord Yongshi, this location was chosen by you, so you tell us what to do."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also found an outlet to vent and started blaming the Night God Yongshi.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi calmly replied: "What does it have to do with you where I chose? I only said I wanted to come here, I didn't say I asked you all to follow me. You had no minds of your own and just blindly followed me here, and now you dare blame me? Sorry, I find it very comfortable staying here. If you don't like it, you can leave."</p><p></p><p>The deities: "......"</p><p></p><p>They did want to leave, but the universe was so vast, where could they go?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Hao, who the deities were missing, was calculating the thought span of the deities in the ball space.</p><p></p><p>He soon got the result: "In less than half a year, the thought span of the deities has been lengthened again, even more than it was lengthened in the past year, but even with my prior warning, they still did not notice their own situation."</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed the impact caused by the lack of sufficient information. Then, what if I deploy these eighteen deities separately into different regions of the universe, or even cut off their communication with each other? It's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao immediately took action, transmitting to the planet they were on before.</p><p></p><p>Then he continuously flashed to the deities' sides, saying in a surprised tone: "Oh, why are you all arguing? It seems your relationships aren't very good. Eighteen deities staying together doesn't give you much of a vacation experience. Here's what I'll do, I'll change the environment for each of you to continue your vacation!"</p><p></p><p>When the deities saw Su Hao, they were overjoyed, but upon hearing this, their expressions changed drastically, and they immediately shook their heads: "Lord Lei An, our condition is good, we don't need a vacation anymore, we can go back with you now."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said sternly: "How can that be? You've all worked for a year, I must give you a full year's vacation. It hasn't even been half a year yet. That's decided."</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Su Hao scattered the deities, deploying them separately in different locations of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities looked at the desolate environment around them, then at their lonely selves, unable to express their current emotions for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I, where am I, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm on vacation!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, is anyone there? Respond if you can hear me..."</p><p></p><p>Having been deities for such a long time, they had never been so speechless before. In this situation, they didn't even have the mood to curse at Lei An.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quietly, and half a year went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention how the eighteen deities spent each lonely night, through observation and comparison, Su Hao also confirmed the situation he had guessed.</p><p></p><p>The thought span of the eighteen deities kept getting longer and longer.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he roughly understood the mode of soul power generation: taking the Ten-Colored Plate as the core, absorbing particles similar to light in the universe, aided by a vast amount of information for transformation.</p><p></p><p>All three were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>The current state of the deities lacked a large amount of information. With only the information brought by the eternally unchanging starry environment around them, the movement of their newly generated soul power became very slow, far from enough to support their current thought speed.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, the deities would inevitably feel that the rotation speed of the surrounding planets was accelerating, and the speed of change of things was accelerating...</p><p></p><p>That is to say, as long as Su Hao could artificially create these three conditions, he could create his own unique soul power.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a smile: "Since I've figured this out, then I'll start the next experiment - creating soul power."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Hao sent a message to the deities through the small black room: "Deities, how was your vacation experience? Do you want to continue vacationing?"</p><p></p><p>For the deities, this was the most beautiful voice they had heard in the past half year. They immediately cried tears of joy and shouted hysterically into the vast universe: "Thank you very much for Lord Lei An's vacation, but I never want to take a vacation again. From now on, I will wholeheartedly work for Lord Lei An. Please let me return to the Crux!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled and satisfied the deities' requests.</p><p></p><p>After returning, looking at the familiar small world...</p><p></p><p>Their hearts wanted to cry but had no tears: "We're back in this narrow cage again. Well, it's better than wandering aimlessly in space like an idiot."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the eighteen deities began to communicate with each other, boasting about the splendid and magnificent places they had been to, the wondrous sights they had witnessed, and what kind of thoughts they had about the vastness of the universe.</p><p></p><p>They stated that if it weren't for Lord Lei An bringing them back, they would have continued exploring the universe to their heart's content. Each of them was full of hot air, unmatched by the others.</p><p></p><p>After they finished boasting, Su Hao smiled and told the deities: "Deities, let me tell you some bad news. My conjecture from a year ago was true. I just recalculated, and found that compared to a year ago, your thought span has been lengthened by about one thousandth."</p><p></p><p>Only then did the deities suddenly remember that Su Hao had mentioned this to them before.</p><p></p><p>They all felt themselves, but found no abnormalities, and couldn't help but wonder in their hearts: "Is Lei An tricking us...?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao sent a message to Feng Cheng: "Feng Cheng, go recruit some ordinary people without any traces of soul power, be they human or mountain spirits, I need them for some small experiments."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately replied, "Received, Great Lord Wei, I'll get it done for you soon."</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng went to various human cities and posted a recruitment advertisement: "Do you want to have the ability to shatter mountains and rivers with a single punch? Do you want to gain the power of flight and teleportation? Do you want to go on adventures to the unknown parts of the world? Join our 'Starry Sky Explorers' team! You will get whatever you want, be it power or wealth. From now on, your life will be different. The 'Starry Sky Explorers' recruitment requirements are as follows: 1. Young men with a spirit of exploration; 2......"</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Feng Cheng brought a group of spirited young men to the outside of Su Hao's laboratory.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord Wei, I've brought the people back. Each and every one of them is top-quality, full of youthful ideals, and they've all voluntarily participated in the experiment."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Well, he didn't mind the spirited young men. This experiment he was doing was just observing the conditions under which soul power would be born. He wouldn't take these people's lives, and if successful, he would even give them great power.</p><p></p><p>If this matter was left to Ya Shan, Ya Shan would definitely bring back a bunch of human trash.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Su Hao didn't have much experience with such high-quality test subjects, so it seemed quite novel when seen this way.</p><p></p><p>He casually asked, "What's the progress on finding Bai Jia'er's home planet?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Master Ya Shan and I are searching in different directions, expanding outwards about one-thirtieth of the way so far, but there haven't been any different discoveries yet."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You need to be more careful when searching. A life form like Bai Jia'er may not be able to be born on an ordinary planet. And according to the current information, Bai Jia'er's home planet is probably not far from the Crux. You should focus your search on the area within ten thousand light-years around the Crux first."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "Understood, Great Lord Wei."</p><p></p><p>After Feng Cheng went to arrange the living quarters for the spirited young men, Su Hao pondered alone.</p><p></p><p>One Bai Jia'er accidentally coming to the Crux didn't represent anything, but if a group of Bai Jia'ers came to the Crux one after another, as if calling friends and family, with intervals of about a thousand years between them, that would mean Bai Jia'er's home planet was not far from the Crux.</p><p></p><p>Because if it was too far away, even if they wanted to come, at Bai Jia'er's maximum speed, they wouldn't be able to arrive so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that the Bai Jia'er family had actually been wandering between galaxies for a long time, and after one Bai Jia'er accidentally came to the Crux, the other Bai Jia'ers also rushed over, and in fact they weren't far from each other when they gathered?"</p><p></p><p>That was also a possibility...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought: "What can be confirmed is that it must be within this galaxy. As long as we keep searching, we're bound to find it."</p>

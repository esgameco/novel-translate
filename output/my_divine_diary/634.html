        <h1>Chapter 634</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Given Su Hao's current strength, the planet did have the qualification to defy Su Hao. Currently, Su Hao had no way to deal with this key planet.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could use the source pearl to blow it up, use the 'Ten Thousand Explosions' to blast it, or set up formations to turn everything on this planet upside down.</p><p></p><p>However, a planet is still a planet. Its mass would remain there. Even if it was blasted into pieces, the next moment it could reaggregate due to mutual gravitational attraction, forming a brand new planet.</p><p></p><p>When it collided with the source planet, the source planet would still face the fate of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao floated in midair, pondering for a long time on how to completely destroy the planet.</p><p></p><p>'Chain reaction' was right, but after thinking for a long time, he couldn't find any reference: "How should I do it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao floated quietly in the air, thinking. When he had ideas and inspiration, he would try them out. This planet was big enough for Su Hao to fully express his thoughts on the key planet, and besides, this planet would have no objection.</p><p></p><p>One day...</p><p>Five days...</p><p>One month...</p><p>All to no avail.</p><p></p><p>After much thinking and experimentation, Su Hao negated all his ideas one by one.</p><p></p><p>The domino effect seemed simple in principle. Any child who had seen it a few times could set it up with the corresponding props.</p><p></p><p>But the principle was just the principle. To turn the principle into application was a vastly different matter.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, after riddling the key planet with holes, Su Hao decided to stop for the time being. Sometimes 'inspiration' was something that could not be forced.</p><p></p><p>'Inspiration' needed a hint! Just like the falling apple in the ancient story, Su Hao also needed a corresponding 'apple' to wake him up.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go to the planets in other star systems first. Maybe I'll get the corresponding inspiration!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, having reached this step, Su Hao was not in a great hurry anymore. The knowledge he needed to grasp, he had already recorded well in the bouncing space. If all else failed, he could still ride a spaceship into the universe, free and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>After deciding, Su Hao took action immediately. He transmitted back to the base and used the 'positioning transmission auxiliary device' to send himself near other planets in this star system. After confirming there was no danger, he landed on the planets.</p><p></p><p>He observed the differences between the planets, while trying all his previous methods on each planet.</p><p></p><p>There were barren rocky planets with pockmarked surfaces, looking like they had endured many meteorite impacts over countless drifting years. The daytime temperature was close to 700 degrees, while the nighttime plummeted to minus 200 degrees or more. Extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>There were planets whose atmospheres were almost entirely carbon dioxide, with extremely high pressure and temperature. An ordinary person entering the atmosphere would likely be cooked before even landing.</p><p></p><p>There were planets with volumes and masses far exceeding the sum of all other planets...</p><p></p><p>...In total there were seven major planets, all of which Su Hao visited one by one.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Hao had reincarnated on many life-bearing planets, but this was his first time exploring so many lifeless planets.</p><p></p><p>Landing on the surfaces of various planets was completely different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>What struck Su Hao the most was a sense of unparalleled shock.</p><p></p><p>This was a wonderful journey that thoroughly broadened his horizons!</p><p></p><p>It made Su Hao involuntarily exclaim: "This universe has countless stars, planets and celestial bodies. These celestial bodies of varied appearances, what do they really look like? I really hope that one day I'll have the ability to land on each of them, see their unique and vibrant appearances with my own eyes, and record them..."</p><p></p><p>After another half year, Su Hao had circled all the planets in this star system and left positioning stones in suitable locations for future transmission.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, during this half year of testing various chain reaction structures on the major planets, he failed every time.</p><p></p><p>He did not obtain the desired results, not even any progress.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was within Su Hao's expectations. If it were that easy, he would not have waited until now to start researching.</p><p></p><p>However, this half year was not a wasted trip. At the very least, he had personally witnessed and experienced the unique and ferocious appearances of the major planets, and moreover, as a mere human being. This alone was enough for him to take pride in.</p><p></p><p>How many humans in the universe could achieve what he had?</p><p></p><p>After making up his mind, Su Hao flickered and disappeared from this colorful planet, reappearing at the experimental base.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Su Hao's return, Ya Shan immediately came over: "Great Sage Su, you're back? The new design for the spacecraft is ready, let me send it to you."</p><p></p><p>After retracting the Destiny Armor and changing into casual clothes, Su Hao lazily sat on a lounger: "Send it over!"</p><p></p><p>The construction of the spacecraft was a top priority. If he couldn't solve the planet issue, then the spacecraft would be their last means of survival.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao carefully reviewed the design Ya Shan sent, closed his eyes in contemplation for a long while, and said: "This is it! Go ahead and build it according to this design. Use ample materials!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan rejoiced: "Got it, Great Sage Su. Next I'll start assembling the engineering team!"</p><p></p><p>Given the current world's technological level, it would take at least thirty years just to build the spacecraft frame. This one project alone could support countless people and families for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Then another thirty years would be needed to install the equipment, by which time a new batch of workers would be required.</p><p></p><p>After Ya Shan left, Feng Cheng also came over: "Great Sage Su, the latest planetary monitoring results are out. The data shows some anomalies on various planets this year, but overall no major issues. Please take a look to see if this is what you're looking for."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao briefly glanced through the data Feng Cheng sent and realized the so-called 'planetary anomalies' were just caused by his own actions over the years.</p><p></p><p>He laughed: "There are anomalies indeed, but not the data I want. It seems your astronomy team is quite capable to detect even slight anomalies. Keep monitoring and report any updates to me."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was a little disappointed: "Understood, Great Sage Su."</p><p></p><p>As Feng Cheng was about to leave, Su Hao suddenly stopped him: "Oh right, Feng Cheng, starting today, bring me a copy of the outside news briefing every day, the more detailed the better."</p><p></p><p>Although Feng Cheng didn't understand why Su Hao suddenly wanted to read the briefings, he didn't think too much about it and simply replied: "Got it, Great Sage Su. I'll take care of it right away!"</p><p></p><p>This was one of Su Hao's ways of seeking inspiration.</p><p></p><p>He believed that the 'chain reaction' capable of destroying a planet must be hidden somewhere in this world, waiting for him to discover it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other planets, the source planet had all kinds of lifeforms, making it far more complex. Correspondingly, the chance of finding the 'chain reaction' was slightly higher.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Feng Cheng sent Su Hao the news briefing compiled from all over the world via group chat.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then went to the pavilion by the pool in the small world of the base. He reclined there, reading the briefing with a good pot of tea by his side, utterly relaxed!</p><p></p><p>"'Mechanical City' Huchang has launched another high-performance sports car..."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Council of the Glorious Society has voted to pass the 'Unlimited Free Speech Act', to be implemented next year..."</p><p></p><p>"The Source Mage Association has officially changed its name to the 'Magic Association' after discussions by the ten great mages..."</p><p></p><p>"The adventuring party model is gradually becoming mainstream, professional analysis..."</p><p></p><p>"The emerging 'Battle Mage' profession has become indispensable in adventuring parties..."</p><p></p><p>"Annan Town was hit by a minor monster wave, but luckily it was detected in advance with minimal casualties..."</p><p></p><p>"The Most Beautiful Singer will perform at the Melody Fairy Palace in New City in three days..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly browsed through the briefing and found nothing worth noting, so he summoned the omnipotent assistant interface and entered the library to read books of interest.</p><p></p><p>It was Feng Cheng who discovered an incredible piece of news while collecting the briefing for Su Hao, making his heart race.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, he secretly went to the Melody Fairy Palace in New City, heading towards the performance venue: "The Most Beautiful Singer, let me see just how beautiful she really is!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, he meant nothing else, he just wanted to see what a beautiful woman looked like!</p><p></p><p>At first, Feng Cheng developed a habit of frequenting the Melody Fairy Palace. Then it became once a week, followed by once a month, then once a year...</p><p></p><p>Now he rarely went to the Melody Fairy Palace anymore.</p><p></p><p>As he put it, it was just that! Appreciate an extremely beautiful appearance, then store it away!</p><p></p><p>Besides, although he looked like a strapping young man of twenty, he was already nearly sixty years old. Did he really want to be an old bull eating tender grass? More importantly, he couldn't bring himself to pursue women his own age either...</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng got his wish to see the appearance of the 'Most Beautiful Singer', then quietly left: "After all, I'm just an ordinary person. My feelings have faded! Time to go back and read books. There are beauties like jade in books..."</p>

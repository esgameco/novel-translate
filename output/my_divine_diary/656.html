        <h1>Chapter 656</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Three years later, the Initial Number spacecraft was traveling rapidly through space, but compared to the vast expanse, its speed was incomparably slow, as if motionless in the void without ever moving.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, the surroundings were filled with brilliant stars, densely packed, yet they could only be observed from afar, unable to be touched.</p><p></p><p>Some stars that seemed not too far away would still be unreachable even if Su Hao spent his entire life trying to reach them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spacecraft, Su Hao was carefully examining a circular metal ring in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was the first "Mind's Eye 1.0" device made from the special material "Seeker One".</p><p></p><p>The method to install this "Mind's Eye 1.0" was very simple: open the skull, carve out a groove of suitable size on the inside of the cranium, then embed it inside the skull, and cover it back up.</p><p></p><p>Simple, right?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Su Hao seemed to have the intention to try it himself, Ya Shan couldn't help but worry: "Captain Wei, since this is something I created, let me try it first. We'll quickly get results on whether it works or not."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng also eagerly wanted to try: "Captain Wei, I think I can give it a try too, this thing seems very interesting."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "Feng Cheng, you'd better not. I'm afraid you'll mess up your brain with the neural interfacing after installing it in your skull."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng smiled awkwardly, he did have a point.</p><p></p><p>For them, placing the Mind's Eye 1.0 inside the brain was simple, but then guiding the metal needles to accurately insert into the designated areas of the brain, and connecting it to the cognition platform, would be extremely complex for him and he may not be able to successfully complete the first installation.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually handed the Mind's Eye 1.0 to Ya Shan and said, "Alright, you try it first, and record the entire process before sending it to us. Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan took it and said, "Okay Captain Wei, I have confidence in successfully interfacing this device that I created myself."</p><p></p><p>Having confidence is good, but most of the time, confidence alone does not guarantee success.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan took a deep breath, adjusted his physical and mental state, then transformed into [Lifeform], with surging adamantine armor enveloping him, forming a formidable and powerful suit of armor.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged, put the Mind's Eye ring on his crystal helmet, and as the helmet rippled, it swallowed the ring. Ya Shan then closed his eyes and remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and the others knew that Ya Shan had begun interfacing with the Mind's Eye, so they stood silently beside him, not making a sound to avoid disturbing his actions.</p><p></p><p>This scene was reminiscent of a cultivating monk entering seclusion, about to break through to a new realm, unable to withstand any disturbance.</p><p></p><p>After sitting motionlessly like this for two days, Ya Shan finally opened his eyes: "Captain Wei, I succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao curiously asked, "What was the experience like? Were you able to sense the 'Seeker One' fluctuations?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan exited his [Lifeform] state, stood up and said, "I could sense them, but what I sensed was very faint, almost imperceptible, perhaps related to the desolate region of the universe we're in.</p><p></p><p>This feeling is quite peculiar, as if my head has grown eyes all over, allowing me to see the ubiquitous rippling lines in the void, like lines, yet also like curved surfaces. Upon careful observation, it seems to be the folds of space, like wrinkles on clothes, chaotic yet orderly.</p><p></p><p>But seeing these folds does not affect my normal vision, as if two different organs are observing the same thing, overlapping yet not overlapping.</p><p></p><p>Everything I see still appears as it originally did, but with an additional layer of different attributes added."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan spoke up to this point, hoping everyone could understand his experience, but seeing their bewildered expressions, he knew his explanation fell short.</p><p></p><p>He smiled awkwardly and said, "My description may not accurately convey that feeling. If I have to describe it, it would be like: we use our eyes to look at a speaker, it's a black rectangular box, but not only do my eyes see its appearance, my ears can also hear the sound it produces. If someone sprayed perfume on the speaker, I could even smell its fragrance with my nose.</p><p></p><p>The speaker is still the same speaker, but different organs perceive different things from it. Just like the ears and nose, the 'Mind's Eye' allows me to sense another quality of the universe."</p><p></p><p>With Ya Shan's explanation, they roughly understood what he meant.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how it felt, they would know once they tried it themselves. The important thing was that their previous conception had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>By installing a new 'Mind's Eye' device, they could directly perceive the corresponding phenomenon!</p><p></p><p>Obtain the corresponding 'sensing material', thoroughly study the characteristics of that sensing material, then decode the corresponding consciousness information, write the information conversion program, and interface it with the brain.</p><p></p><p>So simple.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient knowledge reserves, human creativity was fully manifested at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's success piqued the strong interest of Su Hao and Feng Cheng, who took Ya Shan to the corresponding production facility to manufacture their own Mind's Eye 1.0 devices, intending to personally experience the spatial folds that Ya Shan described.</p><p></p><p>Fei Yao also felt very tempted by the Mind's Eye 1.0, but he absolutely dared not open his own skull and embed it inside.</p><p></p><p>Watching the others leave excitedly, Fei Yao was left dumbfounded: "What do I do?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, he came up with a solution.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I design an external Mind's Eye device for myself!"</p><p></p><p>Simply craving it was useless, taking action was the only way to obtain what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>With successful experience, manufacturing the 'Mind's Eye 1.0' became very simple. A month later, Su Hao had successfully created the second device.</p><p></p><p>Carefully reviewing Ya Shan's interfacing process and noting the points that required special attention to ensure no issues, he also transformed into [Lifeform], found a quiet room, and swallowed the metal ring into his adamantine armor.</p><p></p><p>As a [Lifeform], freely manipulating the shape and position of his own cells, organs and bones was an extremely simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly carved out a ring-shaped groove on the inside of his cranium, and seamlessly embedded the metal ring into it.</p><p></p><p>The next step - interfacing with the brain.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao activated the first program of the Mind's Eye 1.0, and in the next moment, a soft tendril slowly extended from the inside of the metal ring.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao immediately controlled it to pierce through the meninges, driving towards the corresponding neural node in the brain. Upon reaching the designated location, the tendril tip blossomed like a flower bud, opening into a six-petaled flower, with claws firmly grasping onto the neural node.</p><p></p><p>He then activated the second program, extending a second tendril...then a third...</p><p></p><p>Just like interfacing the cognition platform with the brain, but with fewer tendrils than the cognition platform's needles.</p><p></p><p>The reason it was more difficult than interfacing the cognition platform was due to the material issue - this special 'Seeker One' material was not like the cultivated 'spiritual power' and was harder to control.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Mind's Eye 1.0 not only interfaced with the brain, but also the cognition platform, a two-way connection that added another level of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao proceeded cautiously at every step, ensuring precision without the slightest carelessness. From the start of the Mind's Eye interfacing to the end, the time he took was not much faster than Ya Shan's.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, after Su Hao connected the final tendril, he thoroughly checked everything and found no errors before activating the preset program.</p><p></p><p>Like a computer booting up...</p><p></p><p>After a brief adaptation period, Su Hao's perception soon added a faint, inexplicable fluctuation that almost filled the entire space.</p><p></p><p>He saw a different universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe observed with the eyes was inevitably different from the universe observed with the ears. Similarly, the universe observed with the 'Mind's Eye 1.0' was also different.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao silently experienced this special feeling. After a long while, he opened his eyes and muttered, "The true face of the universe is indeed different from what the eyes can see!"</p><p></p><p>Many people firmly believed in 'seeing is believing', but at this moment, Su Hao felt that 'what is seen may not necessarily be real', and even 'nothingness' may not be visible to the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Some things are invisible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>After all, the function of the naked eye is essentially quite singular - it can only see light, and only 'visible light' at that...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it seemed utterly absurd, yet this was the reality.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao opened his eyes, exited his [Lifeform] state, and walked out, while pondering a question: "If the universe seen through the 'Seeker One Mind's Eye' has this faint wrinkled appearance, then what would it look like through the 'Seeker Two Mind's Eye'?"</p><p></p><p>In the future, there would be even more special sensing materials. After manufacturing them into 'Mind's Eye' devices and fully interfacing them with the brain, what would the universe appear as?</p><p></p><p>That would surely be another wondrous spectacle!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the day when Su Hao could behold the true essence of the universe was not far away.</p>

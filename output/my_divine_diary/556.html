        <h1>Chapter 556</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After observing the process of 'yuan' transforming into yuan pearls up close with his divine consciousness, Su Hao seemed to understand something, but was not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>In his divine perception, after the 'yin' shattered, it was as if the hollow broken wood lost some kind of restraint, gradually transforming into an excited state, becoming abnormally active. After reaching a critical state of total eruption, under the influence of a special force field, the pieces were mutually attracted and aggregated together.</p><p></p><p>It seemed chaotic, yet orderly, like a magnet attracting iron filings.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantaneously, all the excited state matter collided towards the very center point, completely aggregating together to form a pure yuan composite.</p><p></p><p>However, in the process of violent collision and aggregation, a quantified amount of energy was released, causing this pure yuan to separate and disintegrate into uniform yuan pearls.</p><p></p><p>That was the process, but there were still many unexplained phenomena.</p><p></p><p>For example, what exactly was restraining the hollow broken wood, preventing it from aggregating into yuan pearls all this time?</p><p></p><p>To answer these questions, observing this one natural disaster was not enough, Su Hao needed more comprehensive data.</p><p></p><p>He collected the scattered yuan pearls, casually putting them into his storage space. After observing the surroundings and finding no abnormalities, he flew up into the sky, randomly choosing a direction to fly.</p><p></p><p>Nothing much to say, he would continue searching for all kinds of disasters - natural disasters, yuan beast disasters, bizarre disasters, any type, he liked them all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Around three hours after Su Hao flew away, before the acid mist had dissipated, a rookie yuan squad cautiously approached the acid mist disaster site, eventually stopping outside the affected area.</p><p></p><p>A yellow-haired boy of around 15 years old, who seemed to be on his first mission with the squad, exclaimed in shock: "Sheesh - is this the natural disaster mentioned in our mission? It looks extremely terrifying. How are we going to go in and resolve it?"</p><p></p><p>A charming woman around 30 years old smiled at the yellow-haired boy, liking him more the longer she looked, and said softly: "Oh, this is the simplest natural disaster. Da Liang, don't be afraid, your sister squad leader will protect you, heheh!"</p><p></p><p>A male teammate with an unsightly nose muttered to himself: "When did Squad Leader Nalin start speaking so gently? And why can't I call her sister squad leader, but this newly joined yellow-haired brat can keep calling her sister this and sister that?"</p><p></p><p>After investigating the situation, the three donned anti-corrosion suits and gas masks, then slowly entered the acid mist.</p><p></p><p>Squad Leader Nalin smiled at the new soldier teammate, demonstrating the value of having her as a sister squad leader: "Da Liang, come closer to your sister. Let me tell you how to find the core of a natural disaster - finding cores is what I'm best at. Heheh!"</p><p></p><p>The yellow-haired Da Liang moved a bit closer to Squad Leader Nalin as instructed, making the unsightly-nosed male's heart turn sour, more sour than the surrounding acid mist.</p><p></p><p>He felt like the excess one in this squad! Alas, the difference was just too big. Most crucially, he didn't understand where he fell short.</p><p></p><p>Next, the three-person squad wandered around in the acid mist but couldn't find the location of the disaster's core anywhere.</p><p></p><p>The young Da Liang exclaimed in amazement: "Missions really aren't simple. I didn't expect that even the core of the easiest natural disaster would be so hard to find."</p><p></p><p>Squad Leader Nalin thought to herself: "This shouldn't be the case!"</p><p></p><p>After casually reassuring them, she continued searching, but they almost covered the entire acid mist area without finding any trace of its source.</p><p></p><p>As the sun was about to set, the acid mist gradually dissipated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The puzzled yellow-haired Da Liang asked: "Sister Squad Leader, the acid mist is gone. Does that mean we've resolved the natural disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Squad Leader Nalin and the unsightly-nosed male were equally dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Nalin smiled awkwardly: "Yeah! We must have resolved the disaster!"</p><p></p><p>Da Liang marveled: "Sister Squad Leader is just too powerful! Without even realizing it, you resolved a natural disaster just by walking around. The acid mist actually dispersed, but I didn't see how it happened."</p><p></p><p>Nalin and the unsightly-nosed male glanced at each other, seeing the awkwardness on one another's faces: "..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the unsightly-nosed male thought of something and leaned in to whisper to Squad Leader Nalin: "Could it be that a mage passed by this place and casually resolved the anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>Nalin nodded: "That must be it."</p><p></p><p>The unsightly-nosed male said resignedly: "Unlucky."</p><p></p><p>Nalin said: "Let's forget about this one. We took on two disaster missions today, let's go to the next mission location!"</p><p></p><p>When night fell, the three-person squad arrived at the second anomaly mission site, this time a wildfire disaster.</p><p></p><p>But again, the three searched until midnight without finding the disaster's core, while the wildfire gradually died down, leaving the world in complete darkness.</p><p></p><p>The astonished yellow-haired Da Liang exclaimed: "Sister Squad Leader, you two are just too powerful! You mysteriously resolved another natural disaster!"</p><p></p><p>Nalin and the unsightly-nosed male: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao wandered around resolving one disaster after another, he collected enough data for Xiao Guang to identify all kinds of disasters, combined with the 'Disaster Identification' function he wrote. Within the 20,000 mile radar scan range, almost no anomaly could escape detection.</p><p></p><p>Finding disasters became an extremely simple task. He only needed to fly high in the sky; even if half-lying down while flying and reading a book with his legs propped up, he could easily identify all kinds of disasters.</p><p></p><p>As his experience grew, he also gradually summarized the approximate locations of disaster cores, usually accurate with a single touch. Excluding experiment time, it took only about five minutes to resolve various disasters and eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>A year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like nothing had changed - people ate, drank, slept, worked, and boasted about having children... just like before, nothing was different now.</p><p></p><p>Except for some of the yuan mages in certain regions.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, their lives had changed a bit - they became more frugal and no longer dared to spend money as lavishly as before.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that the number of disaster missions issued by the Mage Association had decreased significantly over the past year, directly impacting their income. Some yuan squads couldn't even get a single mission for months, barely getting by on their previous savings.</p><p></p><p>Now everyone was waiting in the main hall of the association's auditorium. As soon as a new mission was announced, no matter what, they would rush to take it first before discussing further...</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that similar situations had occurred in several surrounding major regions recently. Based on various clues, it could be inferred that a powerful yuan squad was roaming between these regions, not even taking association missions, but directly and frantically resolving disasters wherever they appeared...</p><p></p><p>The yuan squads who heard such rumors scoffed at them.</p><p></p><p>Such nonsense could only fool children. What normal person would believe that? Ask yourself, what squad could resolve most of the disasters occurring across several major regions within a year, to the point where other yuan squads struggled to find missions?</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Some self-proclaimed clever individuals analyzed with reason: Drastic changes in the natural environment led to a reduction in disasters... conclusion: yuan mages might face widespread unemployment!</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what these yuan mages thought, Su Hao was unaware. After roaming and eliminating disasters for a year, he finally collected enough data and decided to stop.</p><p></p><p>That day, he transmitted back to the experimental base and took out the yuan artifacts he had scavenged over the past year, neatly arranging them on the experiment table.</p><p></p><p>Sticks, cloth dolls, hourglasses, wheels, javelins, stones, bones... all kinds of shapes and forms.</p><p></p><p>However, the abilities possessed by these yuan artifacts were not as simple as their appearances suggested.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao named these abilities: 'Indomitable Perseverance', 'Birth of All Things', 'Squeeze and Drop', 'Seeking a Sword to Carve a Boat', 'All Just Balloons', 'Flip It Over', 'Every Man for Himself', 'I'll Hit You'...</p><p></p><p>Each one more bizarre than the last.</p><p></p><p>For example, 'Indomitable Perseverance' allowed one to step on their own feet alternately to ascend, or grab the back of one's own neck to lift oneself into the air.</p><p></p><p>'I'll Hit You' made the targeted enemy automatically remove their pants, bend over, and await a slipper beating.</p><p></p><p>...</p>

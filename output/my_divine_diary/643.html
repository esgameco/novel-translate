        <h1>Chapter 643</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The beautiful rings of the Red Ice satellite were unceremoniously torn off by Yahan and Fengcheng after Suhao's comment, as if two ravenously hungry beggars were tearing off a beautiful girl's clothes.</p><p></p><p>The scene was so brutal that Feitian was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>The reason Yahan and Fengcheng were so fired up was because the spacecraft they led the construction of had embarrassingly failed during its test flight!</p><p></p><p>They had to go all out to make up for this blunder.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, the three small worlds created by Suhao were filled to the brim with shattered rocks.</p><p></p><p>Suhao took out a small cube and casually tossed it into one of the small worlds. Soon after, most of the shattered meteorites inside were corroded by the planet virus and transformed into elliptical metal balls in standby mode.</p><p></p><p>First, Suhao took out two planet viruses, then added a high-quality source pearl and threw them into the other two small worlds, allowing them to corrode the shattered rocks inside.</p><p></p><p>Then with a casual tap of his finger, a blue beam shot out from his fingertip and vanished into the virus-filled small world.</p><p></p><p>'Activate focal point system!'</p><p></p><p>In less than an hour, the small worlds were filled with source pearls emitting a soft white glow, like an ocean of source pearls.</p><p></p><p>Mixed in were some materials that did not transform into sources, but compared to the obtained source pearls, they were negligible.</p><p></p><p>When everyone entered the small worlds and saw the plentiful source pearls, even the well-traveled Yahan couldn't help but gape.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the source pearls are dazzling my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"This...seems off!"</p><p></p><p>Feitian looked utterly astounded, hardly believing what he was seeing. He flew down, scooped up a handful to feel them properly.</p><p></p><p>They were indeed source pearls, mostly high-quality with some low-quality ones.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the ocean of source pearls and took a few steps.</p><p></p><p>In all his long life, this was the first time he had indulged like this...</p><p></p><p>What did source pearls mean to them?</p><p></p><p>For Suhao and the others, sources held an extremely high position.</p><p></p><p>Even higher than the value of money for ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>Even though Suhao told Feitian these were source pearls transformed by the planet virus, he still couldn't comprehend how this level was achieved.</p><p></p><p>Feitian thought to himself: "Not only that, the second satellite of the Red Ice Star may have been completely transformed into sources by Mr. Jia Wei.</p><p></p><p>Previously, I fancied myself a supreme genius, though I didn't show it outwardly. But deep down, I was a bit arrogant and looked down on others to some degree...</p><p></p><p>But now, I realize my mind seems inadequate! Yes, compared to the three gentlemen Jia Wei, Jia Yahan, and Jia Fengcheng, it's not enough...</p><p></p><p>No wonder they are powerful aliens capable of roaming the universe!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also scooped up a pile of source pearls and marveled: "We're rich! With so many source pearls, we can buy the entire Zoulexian Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Yahan couldn't help but kick Fengcheng: "You little punk, show some class! As a cultivator, you're still fixated on that scrap of meat in your pants. Shameful!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng grinned sheepishly, then leapt up and dove into the source pearls like a beauty into water, swimming joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Yahan: "......"</p><p></p><p>It did seem quite fun.</p><p></p><p>Then he jumped in too, swimming a lap in the source pearl ocean.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed: "That's about all you're capable of!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Originally they didn't plan to bring the spacecraft back to the source star, but unexpectedly its propulsion system failed so badly that it lacked the power to travel, so it wasn't suitable to leave in space.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao brought the spacecraft back to the original small island, placing it on the original mountain platform.</p><p></p><p>Then he told Yahan and the others: "Let's leave the spacecraft here for now! I'll go design a top-tier propulsion system, and once the blueprints are done, we'll place an order to manufacture it."</p><p></p><p>Suhao had the idea for a top-tier propulsion system long ago.</p><p></p><p>For someone capable of designing the planet virus, it was very simple.</p><p></p><p>However, his requirement wasn't just for a powerful propulsion system, but one that didn't need manual refueling.</p><p></p><p>The method was simple: separate out a small world and set it as a large 'focal point system', then connect the small world's space to a 'mineral harvester'. When the harvester collected materials, they would automatically be transmitted into the 'focal point system' to be transformed into source pearls, directly powering the propulsion system.</p><p></p><p>But actually manufacturing it wouldn't be easy.</p><p></p><p>After all, while Suhao could now directly transform 'temporary mineral products' into various shapes and structures using sources, he couldn't transform real physical materials the same way.</p><p></p><p>To obtain durable, long-lasting equipment, industrial manufacturing was still needed.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Another twenty years passed, and Suhao had been reborn in this world for a hundred years, now 112 years old. </p><p></p><p>Of the people he knew in this world, besides the cultivator Feitian, the rest had passed away.</p><p></p><p>Yet the world remained the same, with masses of humans still living busily in prosperous towns for their own lives.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this prosperity had nothing to do with Suhao, as he didn't participate in it, merely an aloof observer of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was like the legendary saying "transcending the three realms, outside the five elements."</p><p></p><p>Suhao had long since designed the spacecraft's propulsion system, which was manufactured and installed a few years ago, along with ten matching mineral harvesters.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, all sorts of facilities and equipment were manufactured and installed on the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>The 'Genesis' spacecraft was completely finished.</p><p></p><p>However, the long-awaited catastrophe had still not arrived.</p><p></p><p>This made him wonder if the catastrophe had been delayed.</p><p></p><p>A delay meant the affected range would be wider this time, with greater intensity.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring with Fengcheng again and learning there were no anomalies in the stellar system, Suhao was convinced this catastrophe would not be a planetary collision, but would occur through unknown means.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit helpless about this passivity, as it was his least favorite feeling.</p><p></p><p>How could he observe the operation of the catastrophe system?</p><p></p><p>"In the long period ahead, I'll try to deduce a level of spiritual power higher than 'divine thought'! And...that kid Feitian seems to have unique insights into spiritual power, perhaps he can push the cultivation of it further!"</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, this was an unexpected pleasure.</p><p></p><p>He planned to take Feitian aboard the 'Genesis' to journey deep into the cosmos. One reason was to have someone with a different mindset by his side to help cover his blindspots. The other was that he didn't mind the company of a fellow seeker of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect Feitian to have such immense spiritual power talent.</p><p></p><p>However, whether he could succeed, Suhao wasn't sure. He thought that even if Feitian failed, it could still provide new perspectives, so there was no harm in trying.</p><p></p><p>That day, Yahan, Fengcheng and Feitian came to Suhao and said: "Master Wei, all equipment has been loaded onto the 'Genesis'. Should we schedule a second test flight? Rest assured Master Wei, this time I'll stake Fengcheng's scrap of meat to guarantee success!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng's face stiffened, then he laughed: "No problem, after all this is a product personally made by Master Wei. My scrap of meat can vouch for it. Besides, I'm an immortal, if it gets cut off it'll just grow back, I'm formidable like that."</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao said coolly: "If I'm the one wielding the knife, it may not grow back."</p><p></p><p>"Uh--" Fengcheng's voice caught in his throat like a strangled rooster, a chill running down his back.</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed heartily: "Let's go, second test flight for the 'Genesis'!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was brimming with passion.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, whenever doing something together with Master Wei, they were always full of passion.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when a group of people did anything together, even taking a piss could be fun.</p><p></p><p>Happiness is just that simple.</p><p></p><p>Maybe the reason adults aren't happy is because they have no playmates!</p>

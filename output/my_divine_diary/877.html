        <h1>Chapter 877</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Shortly afterward, a violent battle erupted on the Paradise Passage.</p><p></p><p>A group of humans, mountain elves, the Black Thunder Gargoyle Clan, and the Red Gold Gargoyle Clan joined forces and fought a group of Red Gold Gargoyles who called themselves the Demon King.</p><p></p><p>There were countless deaths and injuries.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there was a stalemate, and with Foam Island as the dividing line, the second half of the Paradise Voyageway came under the territory of the Chip Daemon King's Legion, while the first half was the territory of the Eighteen Gods.</p><p></p><p>As for Foam Island, both sides promised not to set foot on it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the battle subsided.</p><p></p><p>The world pattern was quietly divided into two parts with Foam Island as the boundary, one part being the second half ruled by the Chip Daemon King, and one part being the first half ruled by the Eighteen Gods.</p><p></p><p>As for the other continents, the deities didn't care because there was no output of soul power fruits, and neither did the Red Pu Daemon King, he only wanted to beat those arrogant Eighteen Gods down.</p><p></p><p>Both sides wanted to finish off the other side that was in the way, but they were evenly matched, and both seemed to be a little out of their depth.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in the stalemate between the two sides, and the news that the Paradise Voyageway would give birth to the magical 'Soul Power Fruit' spread throughout the entire world, and all those who wanted to gain power and change their destiny flocked to the Paradise Voyageway in search of the ocean's secret treasures, and from time to time, news of someone obtaining a Soul Power Fruit was spread, which made the people even more energized.</p><p></p><p>The Age of Great Adventure, had arrived!</p><p></p><p>There were frictions in all directions from time to time, and there were constantly lucky people obtaining soul power fruits and rampaging through the entire channel, making the entire channel lively.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, the wind and clouds changed, and the sun rose and set.</p><p></p><p>The new generation, like leeks, grows savagely one crop after another, and its swaying body vibrantly rises upward until it is harvested by the times.</p><p></p><p>The world pattern then centered on the Heavenly Voyage, and a fierce battle was waged, with the exception of the Chip Daemon King and the Eighteen Gods, other forces rose and fell, with different names for different eras.</p><p></p><p>The brave man who dared to set sail was destined, the moment he set sail, to a life of splendid intrusion.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how many years later, the Paradise Voyageway was no longer known as the Paradise Voyageway, but became the 'Brave World';</p><p></p><p>And the lucky ones who ate the Brave Fruit were called Brave ......</p><p></p><p>Soul Warlocks and Soul Guards, quietly became historical terms and were no longer remembered.</p><p></p><p>All the brave men who went out to sea possessed a great goal, which was to break into the Brave World, search for the secret treasure of the ocean, the Fruit of the Brave, gain great power, and then crusade against the world's most evil and most powerful Archdemon, the Chip Archdemon.</p><p></p><p>In response, the Red Poo Daemon King laughed loudly, "Come on! Come crusade against me, the Great Demon King Chip! Then you will realize that you know nothing about the power of the Demon King. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention defeating the Chipu Great Demon King, even defeating the 'Demon Kings' 'Demon Lords' 'Demon Monarchs' 'Demon Soldiers' under the Great Demon King ''Demon Soldier'...... would also take a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>The laughter of the Chipu Great Demon King gradually turned into, "Jie Jie Jie ......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The doppelgangers controlled by Su Hao's trio had long since started exploring outwards in a galaxy a billion light years away.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao's test, the consciousness information cast from the Cross Star was indeed able to cause the phenomenon of 'transportation wave' locking, which gave him a bottom line in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after so many years, the life planets were found, none of which had suitable intelligent life present, leaving Su Hao to continue waiting.</p><p></p><p>As for the life world created by Yashan and Feng Cheng in the vicinity of the Xiangpu Galaxy, it was also gradually on track, and during this period Su Hao also went for a spin, which was surprisingly good.</p><p></p><p>But it would take a long time before a specific civilization was born.</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng are working towards this, such as through genetic means, transforming organisms, cultivating suitable life, transforming the planet's environment to promote the evolution of life as soon as possible, and simply hand-creating intelligent life to be directly put in place, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the process of creating the world, the two of them grew at a rapid rate, a body of ability nearly integrated, want the effect and things, often just a thought, can be at hand, any problems encountered, can quickly find a solution, as a real deity, omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>As Yashan and Feng Cheng were progressing, Su Hao didn't fall behind by a single bit, and his rate of progress was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>During these few hundred years, the vast majority of his energy had been focused on transforming a wide variety of commodities with the source, and he had gained initial success.</p><p></p><p>In the mall, there were one-fifth of the commodities that he could already manage to directly transform out with Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he wanted an energy firearm, as long as he snapped his fingers, it would soon be generated out of thin air, and he could 'biubiubiu' it in his hands.</p><p></p><p>What is this? This was the legendary skill that only the Creator had mastered, 'Creating things out of thin air' ah!</p><p></p><p>Don't think that one-fifth of the goods is very little, in fact six hundred years to be able to do this step, has been very difficult, the rest of the four-fifths, are some of its own with unique characteristics of the goods, to directly transform out, very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Still, more time is needed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao estimated that within twenty thousand years, he would be able to transform all the items out at will, including a living 'flesh and blood doppelganger'.</p><p></p><p>Twenty thousand years more?</p><p></p><p>Time well! It wasn't even a problem.</p><p></p><p>The world created by Yashan and Feng Cheng was still slowly developing, and there was no telling how long it would take to harvest a mature civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, the Cross Star that he had transformed was ready to welcome the 'travelers'.</p><p></p><p>As long as a suitable intelligent race was found in a distant outer galaxy, then Su Hao's plan could begin immediately.</p><p></p><p>He took the time to check the development of the Cross Star and nodded his head darkly with great satisfaction, ''Very good! The performance of the Chip Daemon King has exceeded my expectations, so I can consider planting the 'Twin Ring Seal' on him and giving him some rewards."</p><p></p><p>The entire world was caught up in the wave of crusading against the Chipu Great Demon King, full of vigor, truly out of Su Hao's expectation.</p><p></p><p>The second dragon sister, Molly, had also been completely disappointed in love and the male dragons a few hundred years ago, and then with a few golden dragon children, she joined the Chipu Daemon King's legion, and became the number two demon king under Chipu, known as the Golden Dragon Queen, and was also ferocious.</p><p></p><p>And the Chipu Daemon King Legion happens to give the future travelers a certain amount of pressure and purpose, it's just perfect.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked at the starry sky: ''Wait! Although the universe is vast, how difficult it is to come across a suitable intelligent civilization."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he went back into the lab and continued to study the technology of transforming goods with sources.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Another five hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>Their doppelgangers, having explored at least a few billion light years outward, could be said to be very far from the Cross Star, almost beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, Feng Cheng posted a few pictures and a message in the group, "Boss Wei, I seem to have found an old era human civilization."</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao and Yashan saw the message, they were both shocked and quickly opened the pictures.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the pictures showed a small ancient town, many humans wearing simple hemp clothes with long hair were moving to and from the town, a bustling scene.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, there would be some detailed differences from the humans they had seen before, but the general difference was not too big.</p><p></p><p>Judging by the surrounding buildings and the implements in the hands of the humans, they were in a very backward farming era.</p><p></p><p>Yashan couldn't help but burst out, "Crap, Feng Cheng your luck is simply heaven-defying, human civilization was found by you just like this."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also marveled: "Feng Cheng, I think the future exploration mission, you have to contribute more is, you see me and Yashan two, tossed more than a thousand years, hard to find nothing, this is a waste of effort."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng immediately waved his hand, "This is just a coincidence, if I had chosen another direction, the person who found it would not be me."</p><p></p><p>Yashan spat, "The results have already come out, and you're still making assumptions."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng hemmed and hawed, then found a location and created a small world, placing Su Hao's and Yashan's locator stones into the small world and opening a teleportation channel for the two.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, both Su Hao and Yashan arrived at this place, transforming into the appearance of people from this world and strutting up the street.</p><p></p><p>The three of them turned around and said in the group, "The language is not clear, I need to find someone to learn the language of this world, you guys wait for a moment."</p><p></p><p>As long as they recorded the consciousness information and used the language decoding system, they would soon be able to get a whole set of language cross-references, and in ten minutes at most, they would be able to learn the language of this world.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao came back and synchronized the decoded language information to both of their assistants, "Quickly learn it, let's take a good stroll around this world after we learn it. Tsk, tsk, tsk, it's really new!"</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this was the first human world with a civilization that Su Hao had found so far, relying on his own abilities. There were quite a few biological planets found before, and there was no lack of intelligent life in them, but it was the first time to find a world that belonged to the same human race.</p><p></p><p>This was of extraordinary significance to Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, after observing, he quickly confirmed that the humans in this world were able to become 'travelers'.</p><p></p><p>"That's you, Traveler Hometown."</p>

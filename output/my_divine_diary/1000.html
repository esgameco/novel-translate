        <h1>Chapter 1000</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>What did Su Hao think of?</p><p></p><p>In fact, light signals can be transmitted into the pinball space, which is also the main way for the pinball space to receive signals from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this characteristic that allowed Su Hao's Pinball Eye to be realized. After connecting to the consciousness information, he could directly see the scenes outside the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Initially, when Su Hao was thinking about what material could adhere to the outside of the pinball space, he subconsciously did not consider the possibility of light.</p><p></p><p>This is because light has no fixed form, or in other words, no fixed shape. Even if light could adhere to the outside of the pinball space, it would be of no use for the Giant Project.</p><p></p><p>Another reason was that Su Hao could not directly transform the source into light. The material he was looking for subconsciously prioritized materials that could be transformed from the source.</p><p></p><p>In fact, until now, all the materials with fixed forms that Su Hao was aware of, except for light, could be transformed from the source.</p><p></p><p>"The ubiquitous light in the universe may indeed be able to follow the movement of the pinball space freely.</p><p></p><p>What I was looking for before, something that could travel between the material world and the non-material world, was most likely light. Light possesses sufficient uniqueness."</p><p></p><p>"As for how to build the Giant's body with light...don't I master soul force? This is a condensed state of light, another special form of light, but essentially still light.</p><p></p><p>I had tried attaching soul force to the pinball space before, but failed.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the failure was most likely not that soul force could not follow the pinball space when leaving, but that this highly condensed state of soul force lost a certain property of light, and thus could not merge with the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>If I change the condensed state of the soul force, triggering another form of light, perhaps it can successfully merge with the pinball space, and thus follow the pinball space when leaving..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao retrieved the experimental data from his previous failed attempt to attach soul force and carefully examined it again.</p><p></p><p>Now looking at it again with a focused mind, some details that were previously overlooked presented themselves from a different perspective.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed. Su Hao took a deep breath to calm his inner excitement, and quickly retrieved all the information about soul force.</p><p></p><p>Although he was already very familiar with this information, to avoid omissions, he reorganized it once more.</p><p></p><p>Ever since coming into contact with soul force, Su Hao had conducted extensive research on it. He had corresponding experiments and records for the different manifestations of soul force under different environments.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought the greatest use of soul force for him was as a tool for migrating consciousness information, allowing him to gain eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect that in studying the pinball space, soul force would reveal a new use.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the accumulated knowledge was not useless. All the knowledge accumulated in his mind would surely manifest in a surprising way in his later life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise was that he had not forgotten it by then.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it is exactly as I imagined still remains to be verified. Perhaps this inspiration, like the previous ones, will ultimately end in failure. Everything depends on the facts."</p><p></p><p>After going through the information about soul force, Su Hao immediately opened the recording panel and began writing the experimental plan.</p><p></p><p>There was still some distance before the next pinball space landing. This period of time would allow Su Hao to prepare various plans.</p><p></p><p>"Completing the Giant Project may not take too long. I have a feeling that whether the pinball space's Giant Project can succeed or not will depend on the light of the soul force... The one billion years I mentioned to Ya Shanfeng before now seems a bit exaggerated."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, the pinball space landed on a planet again.</p><p></p><p>The program preset by Su Hao immediately executed.</p><p></p><p>The first second, it absorbed a large amount of material and combined it into a focal point system structure. The surging energy converged at one point, obtaining a small amount of source.</p><p></p><p>The second second, the source dispersed, each transforming into various radiations, creating the turbulent environment for the birth of soul force.</p><p></p><p>The third second, a wisp of faint soul force was generated.</p><p></p><p>This complex process was completed in an extremely short time, almost like lightning. This was the result of Su Hao's continuous optimization over so many years.</p><p></p><p>The generated soul force was minuscule, just a wisp, almost undetectable. To obtain such a wisp of soul force in such a short time was already Su Hao's current limit.</p><p></p><p>But as long as there was a wisp, it was enough. He did not intend to create the Giant's body right now. He only wanted to verify whether the soul force could be taken away by the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>"Successfully obtained soul force. The next step is to change the state of the soul force into the 'information state', which is the state of Bai Jia'er's innate skill 'Instant Transmission'. In this state, the soul force should theoretically be able to enter the pinball space."</p><p></p><p>The fourth second, right after the soul force was generated, under the radiation signal released by Su Hao, it changed its state and shot towards the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's highly focused attention, this wisp of soul force merged into the pinball space, transformed into a segment of information stored in a corner, and was marked by Xiao Guang.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, a question arose in Su Hao's mind: "Does this count as a success?"</p><p></p><p>The pinball space had not left yet, and there was still a wisp of soul force being continuously generated. Su Hao took this opportunity to transform these newly generated soul forces into various forms and inject them into the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the twelfth second that the pinball space left this domain and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pinball space, Su Hao's eyes were sparkling because he 'saw' a wisp of soul force attached to the surface of the pinball space, brought along by it.</p><p></p><p>This was a wisp of soul force in a state between the 'condensed state' and the 'information state', which Su Hao called the 'semi-condensed state'.</p><p></p><p>"The Giant Project really hinges on the light of the soul force! This semi-condensed state of soul force is perfect for adhering to the outer surface of the pinball space... Although I witnessed this scene with my own eyes, it still feels somewhat unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao let out a long breath of relief. He knew that it would not be long before the pinball space could build various external devices and become a giant.</p><p></p><p>And his perspective would no longer be limited to his reincarnated body and the inside of the pinball space. Instead, he would be able to roam the unknown as a giant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after fully analyzing the pinball space, he could even gain complete control over it, becoming a truly free-moving giant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao could no longer suppress his excitement, almost dancing within the pinball space.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he felt this sensation of his entire soul being elevated. He thoroughly enjoyed this joy before victory.</p><p></p><p>"If I truly take on the form of a giant, independent in the void, that would surely be another kind of excitement!"</p><p></p><p>After calming down, Su Hao turned his gaze to the wisp of soul force brought along by the pinball space: "Let me see what is so special about this wisp of soul force that allowed it to be taken away by the pinball space."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Su Hao's joyful laughter echoed in a unique way within the pinball space: "Hahaha, I see! Why didn't I think of this before? But then again, how could I have thought of it without witnessing it myself? The marvels of the world are indeed ingenious and wondrous."</p><p></p><p>This wisp of semi-condensed soul force was like a pebble half embedded in a wall, with one half buried inside and the other half protruding outwards.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the 'information state' part had merged into the pinball space, while the 'condensed state' part was exposed outside. It appeared to be divided into two parts, but was actually a single whole.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this unique property that allowed the semi-condensed soul force to successfully adhere to the pinball space, extremely firmly, to the point of being able to follow the pinball space during its special transition.</p><p></p><p>To adhere to the pinball space in such a unique way was something Su Hao had never conceived of.</p><p></p><p>How could he have imagined such an ingenious angle?</p><p></p><p>No wonder, after such a long time, even though I have almost reached the pinnacle of all beings, I remain so humble. In reality, it is not because of my good nature, but because I cannot be arrogant. There are too many unknown things - how could I give rise to a sense of complacency?</p><p></p><p>A long time ago, there was no one left who could teach Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>He had to learn everything on his own, gradually reaching the highest realm of learning: taking all things as teachers.</p>

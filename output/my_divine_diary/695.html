        <h1>Chapter 695</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Every life has its way of survival, and harsh environments are not the sole reason for the extinction of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Following normal logic, if insect eggs are smashed, one would instinctively think the insect eggs are destroyed, which has a certain probability of confusing predators and seeking an opportunity for development.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the human home planet was struck by an insect plague caused by a blue light burst, which lasted three years, it was precisely because of carelessness and ignoring the smashed insect eggs that led to this.</p><p></p><p>After smashing the insect eggs, Su Hao quietly observed how the turbid mucus would develop.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this seemingly ordinary mucus possessed extremely strong corrosive power. It gradually corroded the land of the small world, forming a large pit. Soon after, the mucus mass underwent a change, gradually gathering together and forming a turbid, jelly-like sphere.</p><p></p><p>After about ten hours, the turbid sphere changed again. Its surface gradually turned black and hardened, looking almost like a large black egg-shaped stone.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Under Su Hao's gaze, the black stone cracked open, and a white, tender worm as thick as a human thigh emerged from inside. It then immediately started burrowing into the ground without stopping.</p><p></p><p>However, it could not escape Su Hao's spiritual perception even as it burrowed underground. Su Hao suppressed his urge to capture it for research and simply observed its actions quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the mother worm of the planet-eating worms? It looks quite ugly and crude."</p><p></p><p>This worm only had a shell structure on its head, with two large, sharp mandibles. The rest was just a plump body, without any eyes visible.</p><p></p><p>After burrowing for a while, the mother worm released a special kind of mucus from its body. This mucus was similar to the one from the insect eggs, corroding the surrounding soil and turning it into a transparent liquid. The worm then used its mouth to suck up and consume this converted liquid.</p><p></p><p>The mother worm's body visibly grew larger. Within a day, it became as thick as a middle-aged person's waist. Then, it began laying eggs incessantly...</p><p></p><p>These eggs were also white in color, about the size of an ostrich egg, with around a dozen or so laid at once.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "How interesting!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the captain's resting quarters on the Yuanxing spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>The captain was sitting cross-legged on the bed, eyes closed in meditation, holding an energy block in his left hand. Suddenly, he raised his right hand.</p><p></p><p>"Pong!"</p><p></p><p>A blazing fireball rose from the palm of his hand, its crimson light reflecting on his face, the intense heat washing over him, forcing him to open his eyes and tilt his head back.</p><p></p><p>"I did it...this is a supernatural power! Xu Shiqiang didn't lie to me."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked at the fireball in his hand, his eyes flickering with barely contained excitement.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the power of this fireball, the mere fact that he could use an energy block to cast such a wondrous spell proved everything.</p><p></p><p>He believed that as long as he continued practicing, the 'spiritual power' that Xu Shiqiang spoke of would only grow stronger, and the force he could unleash would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As for how humans with supernatural powers could use them against the Eight-Armed Race in battle, he didn't know, nor did he need to think about that problem. As long as this 'supernatural power technique' was transmitted back to the Blue Light, there would naturally be people who would consider this issue.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the captain was immersed in the joy of becoming powerful, unable to extricate himself!</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period, his emotions gradually calmed down. He thought to himself, "This was only the first spell. I should continue practicing the second spell - the Armor Reinforcement Technique."</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, it could enhance the protective capabilities of armor, a kind of life-saving technique.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the captain's talent was only average at best, not outstanding. It was just that Su Hao personally guided him, allowing him to make faster progress than others.</p><p></p><p>At the same time the captain successfully cast his first spell, others on the Yuanxing had also gradually mastered their first spells.</p><p></p><p>The entire spacecraft became energized.</p><p></p><p>Those officers who had grasped 'supernatural powers' lacked the captain's composure and immediately ran out to show off their achievements.</p><p></p><p>"Behold my Thunder Strike!"</p><p>"Witness my Blazing Inferno!"</p><p>"Hand-formed Laser Cannon!"</p><p>"Levitation Flight Technique!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One dazzling skill after another was unleashed, leaving the observing crew members gaping in awe, their eyes turning purple with envy.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to learn too!</p><p></p><p>These crew members had already thought about how they would beg their officers to teach them later.</p><p></p><p>For supernatural powers, even if the officers demanded they offer up their maidenheads, they would gladly do so!</p><p></p><p>Two days later, in the Yuanxing's command center, the officers who had made progress in their cultivation gathered, each with a mixture of excitement and pride on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Their belts now had many small leather pouches attached, each containing an energy block.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "It seems all the officers have gained something!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the captain finished speaking, everyone immediately reached behind and took out their energy blocks, vying to be the first to showcase their abilities...</p><p></p><p>It took a while before they calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The captain continued, "Since that's the case, let's prepare to head to the planet of the planet-eating worms. Once we receive word from the Blue Light confirming that the 'supernatural power method' is viable, we'll set out immediately."</p><p></p><p>The command center fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The dangers involved were clear to everyone present. During the more than a month of travel through this star domain, the Yuanxing had been struck by insect eggs multiple times, corroding the coating on the ship's surface into a pockmarked mess.</p><p></p><p>They had to send out a large number of crew members every day to clear the insect eggs stuck to the ship's exterior. Otherwise, the eggs would certainly bore a hole through the ship.</p><p></p><p>If there were so many insect eggs in this chosen desolate area, one could imagine the situation they would face when approaching the planet of the planet-eating worms.</p><p></p><p>But things had come to this point, so there was nothing more to say. They could only make every effort to take protective measures and avoid danger!</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, they received a signal from the Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>The 'supernatural power method' was viable!</p><p></p><p>Activating the warp drive, it took only three days to reach the vicinity of the planet of the planet-eating worms.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Yuanxing appeared, they detected dense clusters of insect eggs all around...</p><p></p><p>The density of insect eggs in this region of space exceeded everyone's expectations. In just two hours, twenty insect eggs had already struck the Yuanxing!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Three days was too short a time."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "I don't want to stay a second longer! The Yuanxing is now under intense bombardment from insect eggs. The surface has already been damaged. It's impossible to predict where the next danger will come from. You can't make any more demands."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You don't need to worry about that. I have a way to block the insect egg impacts."</p><p></p><p>With that, he flickered and disappeared from his spot, reappearing outside the ship.</p><p></p><p>The captain: "Where did he go???"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't use Bullseye to shoot himself away, did he?"</p><p></p><p>"Sheeshâ€”Bullseye can be used like that?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the ship, Su Hao pointed at a spot, and a formation quickly took shape. He took out a source bead and embedded it into the indentation in the center of the formation.</p><p></p><p>He then flickered to other locations and set up a total of nine identical formations.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a point of his finger, he activated them.</p><p></p><p>This formation was called the 'Rebounding Defense Formation'.</p><p></p><p>It could deflect incoming objects back along their original trajectories.</p><p></p><p>The activation condition for the insect eggs was breaking apart. So as long as there was sufficient buffering power to negate their immense kinetic energy and prevent them from shattering, the impact on the ship would be minimal.</p><p></p><p>After completing the formation setup, Su Hao casually grabbed an insect egg and smashed it hard against the energy barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Duang!"</p><p></p><p>The insect egg did not break apart but was instead forcefully deflected, shooting off into the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>"That'll do it! The source beads have enough energy to last ten days, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Hao vanished from that spot and returned to the command center.</p><p></p><p>The crew operating machinery outside the ship to clear the exterior gaped at everything that had just happened.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao disappeared, they finally reacted, stammering, "Q-Quick...look! Officer Xu Shiqiang!"</p><p></p><p>"What a freak, appearing outside in the vacuum of space without a suit! Isn't he afraid of dying?"</p><p></p><p>"What's with that white energy barrier? Is that the legendary energy shield? Even the Eight-Armed Race doesn't have that kind of technology, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shiqiang disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the officers in the command center, still unaware of what Su Hao had just done, stared at him blankly when he reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The captain tentatively asked, "Was that Bullseye?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded. "You can understand it that way. I've used 'supernatural powers' to set up a protective barrier around the ship that can block the insect egg impacts. With this, you don't need to worry about any danger. Next, you can stay here for a few days while I take a good look at what these planet-eating worms are like."</p><p></p><p>The captain: "......"</p>

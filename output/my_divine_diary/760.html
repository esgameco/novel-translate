        <h1>Chapter 760</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The reproduction rate of the Eight-Armed race is not much slower than humans, in fact it's even faster. No one knows if there are mother Eight-Armed beings on the billion warships.</p><p></p><p>If there really are, then when the Eight-Armed beings on these warships see the situation is not good, they will hide in the vast universe and vigorously reproduce. For humans, this would be an endless future threat.</p><p></p><p>So Xia Qingjun's intention is, no matter what price must be paid, these Eight-Armed warship fleets must be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>After discussion, their plan gradually became clear: pretend to retreat, lure the enemy in deeper, then concentrate forces to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>Previously they didn't dare let them in, worried that years of construction would be destroyed in an instant, but now it's different. As long as they destroy this Eight-Armed force, the entire Cloud Ring system will belong to humans. Who still cares about this small star domain?</p><p></p><p>Even if the human home planet Blue Light is damaged, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>They need to think bigger!</p><p></p><p>But human strength is absolutely too weak, in this short period of time, they may not be able to annihilate the Eight-Armed warship fleet.</p><p></p><p>What they fear most is the Eight-Armed warship fleet scattering in all directions...</p><p></p><p>He considered it over and over, and finally thought of Su Hao again, thinking to himself: "For now, we'll try to stall the Eight-Armed beings, while also preparing the teleportation arrays. I believe Da Qiang will have follow-up arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's current identity is still the human leader, but in his heart, the position of 'leader' already belongs to Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this side, Xia Qingjun and the others had determined the overall strategy, each filled with confidence.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, on the Eight-Armed warship fleet side, they appeared rather bewildered.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, they could no longer contact the supreme command, and strangely, they could dial through but never get any response from the supreme command.</p><p></p><p>This left the Eight-Armed beings unable to understand the situation.</p><p></p><p>After multiple joint meetings of the warship fleet, they finally reached a conclusion: This is some new human technology interfering with their normal communications with the command center, leaving them unable to grasp the situation, in order to buy time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some Eight-Armed beings who proposed that maybe there was some problem on the colony planets.</p><p></p><p>But those who raised this view were immediately shouted down and dared not speak again.</p><p></p><p>A few colony planets having issues is understandable, but how could all the colony planets have problems? The humans must be aiming for the heavens!</p><p></p><p>If that were really the case, why even bother fighting? They might as well go into hiding wherever they can!</p><p></p><p>"That is absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, although they said that, they still sent out a few fleets to return to the colony planets to investigate the situation, and most importantly, to re-establish contact with the command center.</p><p></p><p>So, most of the Eight-Armed fleet commanders reached the conclusion: The more humans want to buy time, the less they can allow humans to succeed. They must step up attacks, destroy all human fleets and bases, there is absolutely no mistake. So, attack! Attack! Attack!</p><p></p><p>The thinking of the Eight-Armed fleet happened to align perfectly with the human side.</p><p></p><p>This is the role of intelligence. Without real and reliable intelligence sources, the accuracy of decisions made is usually not high.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it's blind guessing, and those who can guess the right answer should go buy lottery tickets - they have a high possibility of achieving financial freedom.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Su Hao installed the blue crystal skull "keys" he called "Planet Network Access Keys" or "Keys" for short into the main Avatar bodies of Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he uploaded the curved space-time gravity wave array diagram to their assistants for them to study on their own.</p><p></p><p>Of course, having the "Keys" and the "Gravity Wave Array" is not enough, they also need Su Hao's years of research data on "space-time warping" and "spatial modules", as well as the "automatic recognition program" that links them together.</p><p></p><p>So Su Hao added a function called "Network Transmission" to Yashan and Fengcheng's all-purpose assistants, allowing them to directly access the relevant data and computing power through the Pinball Dimension to complete the calculations for teleportation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the core data is still stored in the Pinball Dimension, and if Yashan and Fengcheng leave the all-purpose assistant, they will no longer be able to use this ability.</p><p></p><p>However, Yashan and Fengcheng probably won't leave the Pinball Dimension anymore.</p><p></p><p>As Yashan and Fengcheng happily played with the "Network Transmission", Su Hao had a new idea: "Yashan and Fengcheng's mental power is growing stronger, and the current version of the Black Room's restrictions on them seem a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>It's only because the two of them have no intention of probing the background of the all-purpose assistant without my instructions, otherwise they would have discovered the anomaly long ago.</p><p></p><p>So, after dealing with the Eight-Armed race, I need to learn about the programming and encryption knowledge of this world, in order to carry out a comprehensive upgrade of the 'Universal Light' and the Black Room."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's current available manpower is indeed insufficient, but before obtaining eternity, apart from experimental bodies, he has no plans to record any new consciousnesses into the dimension.  </p><p></p><p>The more consciousnesses there are, the higher the possibility of accidents.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>Unless he obtains eternity and can control everything in the Pinball Dimension at any time, without worrying about the consciousness information recorded in the Pinball Dimension having accidents.</p><p></p><p>Because before obtaining eternal life, he is bound to fall into long periods of hibernation, sleeping for millions or even tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>During such a long time, he cannot think, and anything could happen that he cannot handle.</p><p></p><p>If he records too much consciousness information, and suddenly one of them encounters an accident, or a consciousness mutates, causing it to awaken before Su Hao multiple times during his hibernation, the consequences are unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>What he fears most is that the other party accumulates enough knowledge, breaks through the Black Room's defenses, and erases his consciousness existing in the Pinball Dimension...</p><p></p><p>Then it would be completely over.</p><p></p><p>But conversely, if he obtains eternal life, the situation is different.</p><p></p><p>With his current level, no matter what situation arises, he has the ability and means to deal with it, to nip any threat in the bud.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he may even create a "paradise" for consciousnesses in the Pinball Dimension for observation and experimentation.</p><p></p><p>About a month later, Yashan and Fengcheng completed their "Network Transmission" practice and could barely use the "Planet Network" to teleport.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then assigned them specific tasks: "Yashan and Fengcheng, you two go into the 'Planet Network' now and find the Eight-Armed colony planets with the most docked warships. Then teleport over, establish teleportation arrays, and open the channels to Blue Light, letting Xia Qingjun and the others receive the warships there."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng immediately understood Su Hao's plan: to use the Eight-Armed race's own warships to counter their fleets.</p><p></p><p>This way, they could save a lot of time building warships, and their apparent strength could rapidly expand.</p><p></p><p>A good plan.</p><p></p><p>The two replied in unison: "Got it, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Before carrying out the action, Fengcheng asked with anticipation: "Master Wei, can I control a group of Avatar bodies to go fight the warships?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan's eyes also lit up, clearly having been cooped up by years of research life, and hearing Fengcheng's suggestion, he too wanted to go out and make some noise.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said indifferently: "The Eight-Armed race is nearing extinction, so it will be difficult to find material sources later. Although there are thousands of Avatar bodies in the warehouse, it's not that many. You can go out and play, but if you damage them, you'll have to replenish them."</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought for a moment and said: "We can find a colony planet and confine an Eight-Armed tribal group inside to keep as material for future Avatar bodies.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from what I know, humans execute a large number of death row inmates every year, countless numbers. We can also ask Xia Qingjun and the others to get those death row inmates..."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "That makes sense. If we really confine the Eight-Armed beings, I can take charge of controlling them and have ways to prevent their technology from developing."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>After getting Su Hao's approval, the two excitedly entered the 'Planet Network' to find the Eight-Armed warships.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they found a massive number of unmanned Eight-Armed warships.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng flashed in front of the fleet commander and said: "General Gong Liang, how prepared are your teleportation array materials and installation personnel? We're about to start building the teleportation arrays."</p><p></p><p>The commander nodded first: "We're fully prepared, with enough quantities."</p><p></p><p>Then he asked curiously: "Where are so many teleportation arrays being built?"  </p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "Where else could it be? Of course on the Eight-Armed colony planets.</p><p></p><p>After Master Wei dropped the 'Bug Killing Cubes' on the colony planets, not many Eight-Armed survived there. Now there are many warships sitting empty in the military ports. You can go and modify them, and they'll be usable in no time, right?"</p><p></p><p>The commander was greatly shaken: "You can actually bring the teleportation materials and installation technicians directly to the Eight-Armed colony planets?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng grinned: "Who do you think Master Wei is?"</p>

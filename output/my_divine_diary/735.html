        <h1>Chapter 735</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Hao has always been a man of action - once he decides to do something, he immediately takes action.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, with Ya Shan's assistance, Su Hao successfully installed an 'external brain' composed of one thousand neural modules.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao gradually activated the 'recognition platform', opening the channel between his brain and the external brain.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Su Hao felt his spiritual consciousness world gradually become 'illuminated', growing brighter and brighter, until it lit up his entire realm of thought, giving him a sense of mental ease and delight!</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like a person waking up from a dream, gradually transitioning from the illusory to the real...</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was like the process of waking up from that half-dreaming, half-awake state in the early morning.</p><p></p><p>His conscious thoughts were no longer limited to the illusory scenes constructed by the brain, but instead received the light shining in from outside the window, penetrating through the eyelids into the eyes, allowing him to perceive the real world.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan was right, after connecting to the external brain, his 'self-awareness' became much clearer.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had been living in a dream before, seeing the world but not himself. But now, he could see the world and also perceive himself.</p><p></p><p>The world was the world, and he was himself. For the first time, he felt so clearly that he existed, that he was 'alive'.</p><p></p><p>The word 'I', which had been a vague concept before, had become a real 'thing'.</p><p></p><p>Just this one change alone made Su Hao feel that this 'adventure' of connecting to the external brain was worth it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that wasn't all - many of his cognitive abilities had also been greatly amplified.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also understood what Ya Shan meant by 'split personality' and 'omnipotence'.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's words were not wrong, but it was not easy for someone who had never experienced that state to understand it.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao were to express it, he would say: change from series to parallel, do multiple tasks simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>Simply put, if a person has to do a test paper with 500 questions, solving one question per minute, it would take 500 minutes in total. But what Ya Shan called 'split personality' was like dividing those 500 minutes into 500 equal parts, with one minute for each question, and then stacking those 500 divided minutes together into one minute.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Su Hao could solve all 500 questions in one minute.</p><p></p><p>For each question, Su Hao could confirm that he was thinking seriously and focusing, and each question was solved by his own hand.</p><p></p><p>But having 500 'focused' states at once seemed highly contradictory.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a 'split personality' of the self.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "Perhaps this way I could control many [Eight-Armed God] avatars simultaneously?"</p><p></p><p>After getting used to this strange feeling, he tried to extend his 'divine consciousness' outwards beyond the second-dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his consciousness exploded outwards, instantly reaching 200,000 meters away. Just as he was feeling disappointed, the range suddenly expanded tremendously, extending another 200,000 meters, for a total of 400,000 meters. Moreover, he had the feeling that this range could continue growing...</p><p></p><p>"The range of divine consciousness perception has doubled...such an increase is too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Then he fell into deep thought: "My 'divine consciousness' perception range is affected by the radiation range of the 'spiritual force wave', and theoretically the perception limit should be 200,000 meters. But why is my current perception range far exceeding the spiritual force wave range?"</p><p></p><p>Even with tremendously enhanced consciousness power, it should not be able to reach this level!</p><p></p><p>Unless his perception power came entirely from 'consciousness' without any spiritual force involved. But that was clearly not the case - Su Hao could clearly perceive that his perception was still based on the foundation of 'spiritual consciousness'.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao closed his eyes to perceive, while pondering the reason.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he suddenly opened his eyes: "It turns out to be the combined effect of 'split personality' and the 'spatial module'!"</p><p></p><p>The principle was: At the 200,000 meter position, he split out a 'mini-self' which took the lead, opening a spatial channel to connect the two locations. His 'divine consciousness' passed through this spatial channel from the 200,000 meter position to radiate outwards, thereby stacking another 200,000 meters of perception range to reach 400,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>And this whole process was completed instantly with a flash of inspiration in Su Hao's mind, without needing to operate step-by-step. His powerful brain calculated and arrived at the solution in an instant, and completed the attempt...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was very surprised: "It can even work like this? Why didn't I think of this before..."</p><p></p><p>Soon he shook his head: "No, even if I had thought of doing it this way before, without the independent thinking ability of the 'mini-self', I might not have been able to pull it off."</p><p></p><p>A hint of excitement flashed in his eyes: "Too powerful! The distance of perception is not limited to 400,000 meters. Theoretically, this stacking method can continue extending further and further.</p><p></p><p>As long as I set up another 'mini-self' at the 400,000 meter position to take the lead and open another spatial channel, I could perceive up to 600,000 meters away. Set up another 'mini-self' at 600,000 meters, it would be 800,000 meters. Then 1 million, 1.2 million...</p><p></p><p>With each 'mini-self' stacking another 200,000 meters, as long as I keep stacking..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it, he did it. With just a thought from Su Hao, his powerful cognitive abilities instantly found the optimal solution, and then his divine consciousness exploded outwards.</p><p></p><p>600,000...</p><p>800,000...</p><p>2 million...</p><p>...</p><p>10 million...</p><p>20 million...</p><p>...</p><p>80 million meters!</p><p></p><p>That's 80,000 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had reached his limit, able to explore up to 80 million meters away, using over 400 'mini-selves' working in coordination!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao slowly retracted his ability and opened his eyes. Even until this moment, he could hardly believe that he had so easily perceived the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>One must know that previously he was just a tiny speck on this planet!</p><p></p><p>The downsides were, firstly, the farther the distance, the longer it took to activate the perception ability. Secondly, it could only perceive linearly, unable to perceive in a spherical range like 'divine consciousness'. To achieve full spherical perception, the range would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>But overall, it was still an immense delight. The 'mini-self' surely had even more expansive applications."</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Hao tried various other experiments, as if discovering a new world, gaining completely new perspectives on the knowledge he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>For example, regarding programming, he could quickly use his previous IT knowledge to update the 'Little Black Room Defense System' in the Pinball Space, making it more powerful and impregnable...</p><p></p><p>For genetics, he even felt he could grasp the mechanisms directing the differentiation of fertilized egg cells, forcing a dog's fertilized egg to develop into a cat...</p><p></p><p>For his own [Seed of Life], he felt he could evolve his main body into a [God] while retaining an advanced brain...</p><p></p><p>For spatial abilities, creating a huge mini-world and stuffing it into the second-dimensional space also seemed possible. Then couldn't he create many large and small worlds in the cracks of the universe? This universe would be the main world, and the 'mini-worlds' in the second-dimensional space would be sub-worlds...</p><p></p><p>For cultivation, realms above the Celestial Being realm finally had a path - using spiritual force to substitute the 'external brain' and transfer his consciousness...</p><p></p><p>For 'Source Transformation Technology', perhaps he could directly extract 'sources' from complex mixtures, or even directly create simple lifeforms from sources...</p><p></p><p>For curved space navigation technology, which was previously stuck at 9.6 times light speed, he could now continuously break through to the 20,000x light speed limit...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Too much!</p><p></p><p>"With so much accumulated knowledge of the world, the amount of knowledge I've gained is already immense. But most of it hasn't been properly utilized - I've only taken advantage of some functions!</p><p></p><p>Now I realize that what has limited my rapid growth is not the amount of knowledge, but a brain that can integrate and apply that knowledge seamlessly.</p><p></p><p>This unprecedented state is so good, I have a feeling that my growth speed from now on will be even faster than all my previous growth combined!"</p><p></p><p>Sometimes growth happens this way - after reaching a certain level, exponential take-off can be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao muttered, "I'll get used to this for a while first, then continue stacking 'external brains'. This feeling is addictive."</p><p></p><p>However, he should let Ya Shan try it first, in case of any accidents...</p><p></p><p>If something happened to Ya Shan, there was still a chance to fix it. But if something happened to himself, who would fix him?</p>

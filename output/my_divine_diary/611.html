        <h1>Chapter 611</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In these past two years, the speed of change in the world has exceeded everyone's imagination.</p><p></p><p>First, an organization defined as an evil cult called the 'Glorious Society' emerged from somewhere. The royal families of various regions joined forces to launch an annihilation campaign against the Glorious Society.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a year, the royal families around the world were mysteriously annihilated!</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, the Glorious Society wanted to implement some 'real-time monitoring system', demanding everyone's unconditional support. At first, no one looked favorably upon the Glorious Society's actions, but under pressure, they could only outwardly support it.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, another year later, everyone mysteriously found that various disasters that previously posed direct threats to people's lives and property had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it wasn't that the disasters had disappeared, but rather they were detected in advance and then nipped in the bud by mage squads.</p><p></p><p>Such an abrupt change in the world still left everyone in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>You have to know that in a remote small town like Huaishui Town where Su Hao was reborn, they had to endure the invasion of various disasters an average of three times a year, very frequently.</p><p></p><p>The larger towns or cities suffered even more frequent attacks from disasters.</p><p></p><p>But recently, people have been hearing more voices saying 'such-and-such disaster was resolved when it was just emerging.'</p><p></p><p>Gradually, resolving disasters no longer became something exciting, as if it had become a matter of course, and the discussion frequency decreased.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all kinds of disasters had completely left the human world.</p><p></p><p>For source mages, daily life had undergone earth-shaking changes.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they discussed things like how terrifying the disaster in a certain place was, how they experienced various dangers, and finally succeeded in dispelling the disaster.</p><p></p><p>Now, they almost only discussed which 'installation-maintenance-protection' task they had completed, how many points they had earned, and what skills they had exchanged for.</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang had already arrived in Yixuan City, the main city of the Xuanxuan District, a year ago. They temporarily joined the Mage Association headquarters in Yixuan City to take on various tasks.</p><p></p><p>The lobby of the association hall was crowded with mages coming to take on and hand in tasks, extremely lively.</p><p></p><p>A Xing and A Wang entered the hall and headed straight for the skill exchange counter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the skills listed on the exchange counter, A Xing's mouth was almost watering.</p><p></p><p>"Level 9 skill - Super Gas Bomb! If I had this skill, how would I be different from an Explosion Source Mage? I really want it!</p><p></p><p>That means to get a level 9 skill, we need to complete nine tasks. A Wang, who designed this point system? It's way too harsh!"</p><p></p><p>An ordinary task was priced at 20 points, more difficult tasks earned more points, like 40 or 60, with the highest being 100 points.</p><p></p><p>10 points could be exchanged for a level 1 skill, 20 points for a level 2 skill, and so on, with 90 points needed for a level 9 skill.</p><p></p><p>This was designed by Feng Cheng to ensure the source squads took on more tasks to quickly complete Su Hao's mission.</p><p></p><p>A Wang shrugged and said, "Who told you to have no ability to research it yourself? If you want to learn it, you have to work for it! How many points do you have now?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing sighed, "Only 70! To unlock the 'Diligent Little Bee' achievement, I still need one level 9 skill, two level 8 skills, one level 7 skill...that's at least 50 more tasks! I'm going to puke, A Wang!"</p><p></p><p>A Wang asked curiously, "A Xing, if you unlock the 'Diligent Little Bee' achievement and get to exchange for a second talent, what would you choose?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this got A Xing's blood boiling with excitement. "Of course I'd exchange for an Illusion ability! I've had my eye on an ability of the Deception Source Mages."</p><p></p><p>A Wang: "What ability?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing laughed heartily, "'Inseparable Shadow'! It's a perfect match for my Air Source Mage. What about you, A Wang?"</p><p></p><p>A Wang grinned, "I also want an Illusion ability, but from the Divine Source Mages, to pair with my Oddity Source Mage. It would be endlessly useful."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, new tasks were updated on the task board.</p><p></p><p>Everyone got excited.</p><p></p><p>"Damn! That's a 100 point task! Grab it!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, there are only 20 source squad slots for this task. Slow hands miss out, grab it first and talk later!"</p><p></p><p>"Grab it! A Wang! Go for it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Then suddenly someone shouted, "What are you grabbing? This is a deep sea task!"</p><p></p><p>The entire hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>But in the next second, it became a mess again.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, 100 points, I'll go to the deep sea too."</p><p></p><p>"I'm a man who's been to the sea before, all of you step aside and let me do it!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm a Gold Source Mage, invincible in the sea. This task belongs to me!"</p><p></p><p>"My Air Source Mage isn't bad either! My level 7 skill 'Tornado' can go straight to the sea floor, those who can't do it better step aside!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the end, A Xing got his wish and secured a squad slot, earning the right to carry out this deep sea 'positioning device' installation task.</p><p></p><p>A Wang was a bit worried, "A Xing, that's the deep sea. Just the two of us, can we really complete the installation successfully?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing said nonchalantly, "What's there to be afraid of? With the two of us 'lucky stars', the deep sea is nothing to fear. Both you and I have the ability to survive in the deep sea. It's no big deal, worst case we'll call A Yang for backup!"</p><p></p><p>A Wang said, "Alright then...Oh, I happen to have 90 points left, let me exchange for the level 7 skill 'Deep Sea Titan' of the Oddity Source Mage! That will give us some extra assurance."</p><p></p><p>"A Wang, you've saved up quite a few points, but it's a pity it's not a level 9 skill. What a waste!"</p><p></p><p>"The level doesn't matter, as long as it's useful."</p><p></p><p>Two days later, A Xing and A Wang shouldered a huge metal ball and rushed towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>This two-meter diameter metal ball was the deep sea version of the positioning device. As long as enough source pearls were placed inside, it could work continuously without corroding in the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>The positioning device had two indicator lights and a pointer. Currently the red light was on, indicating the device had not been placed at the designated location yet. Only after being placed at the right spot would the green light turn on.</p><p></p><p>The pointer's function was to point towards the installation location. As long as they moved in the direction of the pointer until the green light came on, it meant they had found the installation spot.</p><p></p><p>To the mages, this technology seemed so inconceivable - not only could it accurately pinpoint any location, it could also determine whether the device had reached the designated spot. It was simply amazing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the positioning principle Su Hao used was very simple: grid positioning.</p><p></p><p>Each positioning device had its own ID number, and by connecting to the surrounding installed devices, it could easily calculate its own location to achieve precise positioning.</p><p></p><p>The diligent mages doing tasks would never understand such a simple positioning principle, nor would they bother thinking about it. They preferred to just stand by and shout "666"!</p><p></p><p>A Xing was overjoyed, "This is it! We just need to dive into the sea and bury the device. Once it's activated successfully, we'll complete the task! 100 points will be ours!"</p><p></p><p>A Wang used the 'Deep Sea Titan' skill to create two huge diving steel armor suits. After they put them on, they dragged the device and dived into the sea.</p><p></p><p>This was their first time entering the deep sea, and it was completely different from what they had imagined - dark with no light, poor visibility. The deeper they dove, the more A Wang could feel the pressure squeezing the 'Deep Sea Titan' armor, and the mental strain of maintaining the armor grew heavier.</p><p></p><p>The fish that used to be seen everywhere had also disappeared, with only a few glimmers of bioluminescence visible in the distance, their sources unclear.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sense of dread enveloped the two powerful 'lucky star' source mages.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point they couldn't even communicate, so they could only continue descending and complete the installation task as planned...</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, the two finally dragged the huge device all the way down to the sea floor.</p><p></p><p>They immediately began the installation!</p><p></p><p>The installation wasn't too difficult, just dig a deep pit, find a fixed support point, and bury it.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, A Xing and A Wang finally buried and activated the device successfully, passing the test.</p><p></p><p>Mission complete!</p><p></p><p>They heaved a sigh of relief and began ascending!</p><p></p><p>A Wang was horrified and immediately stretched out the steel hand to knock on A Xing's armor. When A Xing looked over, he gestured a danger signal.</p><p></p><p>A Xing: "What? A sea beast? In this godforsaken place without even a single fish, how could there be sea beasts? Unless we woke it from its sleep?"</p><p></p><p>A Xing's mind was a mess, but he was also aware of the danger. He struggled to swim upwards, the thrusters on the 'Deep Sea Titan' legs running at full power.</p><p></p><p>However, they were ultimately no match for the speed of the sea beast living in the ocean!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an enormously huge sea beast burst out from the darkness, charging straight at them.</p><p></p><p>This sea beast was gigantic beyond belief, shaped like a great white shark but with its entire head covered in sharp teeth like the petals of a blooming chrysanthemum.</p><p></p><p>Compared to it, A Xing and A Wang were like grains of rice to a pigeon - mere snacks!</p><p></p><p>They were so damn unlucky...</p><p></p><p>After exchanging glances, A Xing immediately realized that the two of them would be powerless against this sea beast and had no chance of fighting back! The key was that they couldn't even run away!</p><p></p><p>But in the sea, despite his powerful abilities, he couldn't use them.</p>

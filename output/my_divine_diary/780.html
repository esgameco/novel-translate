        <h1>Chapter 780</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>On the Dragon Planet.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen years or so, earth-shattering changes had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The holy son Yuantan, who originally wholeheartedly wanted to create a wonderful world, after experiencing various heartbreaking things, became completely corrupted and transformed into the demon king of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Because the world without prejudice and discrimination that he had imagined was completely shattered. And he had become utterly disappointed with this world, holding no expectations for any of the dragon races.</p><p></p><p>He found that prejudice and discrimination would not disappear due to the fall of the Wing God - it was something rooted in the flesh and blood of every dragon race.</p><p></p><p>The Wing God had fallen from the divine position and became a wing dragon, but the divine position still existed, in the Mother Goddess Pool at the peak of the Sacred Valley Mountain.</p><p></p><p>All dragon races wanted to become divine races and trample other races underfoot, enslaving other races...</p><p></p><p>It was hopeless!</p><p></p><p>That wonderful world could only exist briefly in fantasy.</p><p></p><p>After coming out of Jiawei's small world, he had expected to see what kind of 'equality among dragons, common development' the world he had struggled for so many years would become.</p><p></p><p>But what did he see?</p><p></p><p>The tyrant dragons, spirit dragons, and rock dragons had completely turned against each other, attacking each other, each wanting to completely annihilate the other two races and solely occupy the Mother Goddess Pool.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly believe the scene he was witnessing.</p><p></p><p>This was not the result he wanted!</p><p></p><p>The three races of tyrant, spirit, and rock dragons viewed him as an enemy, not only unwilling to listen to him, but also blaming him for causing the current state of war and devastation in the world.</p><p></p><p>This shattered his heart...</p><p></p><p>And the wing dragon race also viewed him as a fallen god, impossible to accept him again, and constantly wanted his life.</p><p></p><p>If not for the several hundred former subordinates of the Wing God who were still willing to follow him, he would have lost everything.</p><p></p><p>Yuantan: "The dragon race is such a filthy creature, unworthy of existing in this beautiful world. I will destroy them with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>Then he retreated behind the scenes, transforming into the great villain of the world, struggling to destroy the world...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Yuantan was embodying the great villain plotting how to destroy the world, Su Hao had already left the Dragon Planet and re-entered the vast universe for exploration.</p><p></p><p>The two consecutive life planets had brought different knowledge to Su Hao, filling him with anticipation for the various life planets he might encounter in the future.</p><p></p><p>When would he encounter the next life planet?</p><p></p><p>When would he encounter the next civilization?</p><p></p><p>What would the civilization he encounters be like?</p><p></p><p>Actually, even if they were not enthusiastic at first, Su Hao would not mind, believing that after interacting with him for a long time, the alien civilization would definitely recognize him and become very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>After all, he considered himself to have quite a few advantages.</p><p></p><p>Year after year, time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the intervals when he did not find life planets, Su Hao repeatedly studied the knowledge he had acquired, constantly deepening it.</p><p></p><p>Such as in-depth study of the 'mastery of all languages' technique, as Su Hao did not want to spend too much time deciphering the languages every time he encountered an alien civilization;</p><p></p><p>Studying the all-round planetary exploration and 3D modeling cube technique, as he did not want to almost miss another species-rich underground world like the Dragon Planet;</p><p></p><p>Studying the technique of modifying organisms at the genetic level, as he wanted his main body to directly evolve into a 【God】 in one go, rather than evolving step-by-step to 【Demigod】 and ending there. Of course, it would be best if he could discover the next evolutionary direction after 【Prophet】;</p><p></p><p>As well as the issues of lifespan and dimensional waves that concerned him the most. As long as these two major tasks were not completed, his heart could not truly be at ease.</p><p></p><p>Having a limited lifespan meant he would fall into slumber again, facing unknown risks; the dimensional waves not being completely resolved meant his true self could only hide in the secondary world forever, unable to appear and gain true freedom.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years later, Feng Cheng sent an exciting message: "Wow! Master Wei, Master Ya Shan, I've discovered another life planet!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan could hardly believe it was true. Over these years, he had tried very hard to discover a new life planet before Feng Cheng, but the result was still that Feng Cheng found it first.</p><p></p><p>Why was this happening?</p><p></p><p>Su Hao consoled him: "Look on the bright side, Ya Shan. With three of us searching for life planets, the probability of the same person discovering the first three is one in twenty-seven. Compared to the probability of life emerging in the universe, this is already an enormously high number. So it's normal."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "For the next life planet, I absolutely cannot let Feng Cheng get ahead of me."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but calculate for Ya Shan again: "The probability of Feng Cheng discovering the next life planet is one in three, and you and I both have a one in three chance as well, so this is also a very high probability."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan: "......"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao and Ya Shan transmitted to Feng Cheng's location and observed this life planet.</p><p></p><p>With purple-red and blue as the main colors, upon entering they found that the life forms on this planet were very unique.</p><p></p><p>Most of the plants here resembled giant spiral mushrooms, or perhaps related to the atmosphere structure of this planet. The surface appeared purple-red, absorbing different light than ordinary green plants.</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao casually cut down one of the giant mushroom plants, he found that this plant was not actually a mushroom, but had a very hard, rock-like texture.</p><p></p><p>And the animals were also strange and varied, quite different from what they had seen before.</p><p></p><p>The three of them circled this planet but unfortunately did not find any traces of intelligent life activity.</p><p></p><p>But this was also normal.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental purpose of life is only one thing: survival + reproduction. As long as these two purposes could be achieved, it did not matter what form the evolution took.</p><p></p><p>Evolving intelligence is only one of the countless evolutionary choices.</p><p></p><p>Intelligence is certainly a bonus for survival and reproduction, but survival does not necessarily require intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Take the previous human planet Bluelight for example. Few people would notice that the most successful life form that evolved on Bluelight was not humans, but plants.</p><p></p><p>Compared to plants that covered the entire planet, the number of humans was indeed pitiful.</p><p></p><p>It would be quite accurate to say that plants were the winners of biological evolution.</p><p></p><p>If there was a civilization, Su Hao's research would be more targeted, but even without one, it did not matter much.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, Su Hao had basically analyzed this planet and discovered different genetic structures in the life forms there.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the previous idea of modifying genes can be experimentally tested."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another 150 years later, Feng Cheng discovered yet another life planet: "...Um, I've discovered another life planet, and it looks very unique."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's eyes were about to pop out: "This defies probability at all!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Ya Shan said: "Feng Cheng, let's switch positions. I'll explore your area, and you explore mine."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng readily agreed: "Sure, Master Ya Shan."</p><p></p><p>This was also a planet without intelligent life. In the atmosphere, they found floating spores resembling hot air balloons. Cutting them open revealed hydrogen gas inside, as well as a large number of biological eggs.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao couldn't help but give a thumbs up in praise: "How clever, throwing the eggs up into the sky to avoid predators."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish speaking, they saw a strange beetle-like creature flying over and pouncing on one of the large spores, tearing open a hole with its teeth and burrowing inside to feast.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added: "Of course, no matter how clever, there will always be predators."</p><p></p><p>After a few years of research, Su Hao obtained supplementary techniques like 'Biological Compound Separation to Obtain Elements' from this planet.</p><p></p><p>...</p>

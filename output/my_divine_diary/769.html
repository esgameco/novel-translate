        <h1>Chapter 769</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Yashan were both transmitted to the planet where Fengcheng was located.</p><p></p><p>This was a planet with a dominant blue-green color scheme. Viewed from outer space, it exuded a vibrant vitality.</p><p></p><p>The oceans occupied the vast majority of the planet's surface area, with land making up less than a quarter. However, the land was thickly covered in vegetation, essentially blanketed in green. Even plateaus, loess, and deserts were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a cradle of life.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in an incredible coincidence, this cradle had given birth to life!</p><p></p><p>Massive green plants shot up from the ground, competing to grow taller, branching out in all directions to vie for more space and sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Branches and leaves of all strange shapes and forms employed their unique abilities to secure advantageous positions, striving with all their might for survival.</p><p></p><p>Clear sounds echoed through the forest, spreading across the land.</p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky were sparse, day and night were distinct, and a gentle breeze blew, creating a scene of a vibrant paradise.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble rumble~"</p><p>"Swish swish swish~"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a thunderous roar arose, as if a towering giant beast was running through the forest, trampling the low-lying vegetation on its path, causing them to fall to the sides.</p><p></p><p>Behind the giant beast came many roars, as ferocious beasts pursued it, leaving the forest in disarray.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they had made the giant beast their prey and were engaged in a brutal hunt.</p><p></p><p>Numerous bizarre small creatures were startled, scampering up and down the trees, while some winged animals took brief flights in the sky before disappearing back into the forest.</p><p></p><p>It was a lively scene.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the others quickly explored the entire planet, even venturing into the underwater world to see if there was any so-called marine civilization...</p><p></p><p>In the end, the result confirmed Fengcheng's words - this was a planet without civilization.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the life on this planet was still in a very primitive state. All living beings were instinctively driven by the urge to survive and reproduce, striving with all their might for survival and propagation.</p><p></p><p>There was no concept of happiness or sadness, no warmth or coldness, and certainly no "humanization."</p><p></p><p>All life forms were stubbornly surviving, displaying the most fundamental aspect of life itself.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "The lifeforms on this planet seem rather unique. I'll stay on this planet to study its life forms. You two continue exploring other galaxies.</p><p></p><p>Now that we've successfully found a life-bearing planet, it's a good start. I believe a civilization planet can't be far away."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Captain Su!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were also inspired by this life-bearing planet, filled with hope for the future once more.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, this life-bearing planet made them realize that the universe was not a lifeless void. On the contrary, it was teeming with vitality, only appearing dull because of the vastness of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, Suhao erected a massive base, then created multiple "Eight-Armed God" avatars to collect all kinds of animals from this world, big and small, accepting them all.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao entered the base to conduct a meticulous study of the planet's life forms.</p><p></p><p>As for Yashan and Fengcheng, they continued exploring more unknown galaxies.</p><p></p><p>From the Cloud Ring System to now, the range of their exploration was unimaginably vast.</p><p></p><p>If they were to inform the humans of the Cloud Ring System about their ability to explore other galaxies through the transmission array, it might resolve the conflicts among the Cloud Ring humans.</p><p></p><p>However, the three of them lacked interest and motivation for such matters.</p><p></p><p>What could be more enjoyable than exploring the unknown?</p><p></p><p>In just three years, Suhao had thoroughly studied the life forms on this planet.</p><p></p><p>In terms of their fundamental material composition, they were not significantly different from the other lifeforms he had encountered.</p><p></p><p>However, their structures were unlike any life form he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The neural centers of the lifeforms on this planet were surprisingly located within the layers of their bones, spread throughout their entire bodies...</p><p></p><p>In other words, these lifeforms could be said to have no brain, or they could be said to have a brain.</p><p></p><p>Suhao did not find any brain-like structure within their bodies, so it could be said they had no brain.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he discovered a large amount of neural tissue within the layers of their bones throughout their bodies. All these neural tissues were interconnected, forming a massive neural loop with the same functions as a brain, so it could be said they had a brain.</p><p></p><p>This distributed brain structure gave these lifeforms an extremely strong survival ability, with more advantages than a centralized brain.</p><p></p><p>For instance, there was no obvious brain weakness, so even if any part of their body suffered absolute damage, they could still survive tenaciously.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, even as their bodies grew to enormous sizes, they could still control their movements agilely and swiftly without any sluggishness...</p><p></p><p>Suhao had never encountered such lifeforms before, nor had he ever imagined their existence.</p><p></p><p>This experience once again refreshed his understanding of the diversity of life.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had relied on the "consciousness matching" of the Bouncing Realm for reincarnation, so the worlds he was reborn into had similar fundamental structures to what he knew, and he had not encountered any extremely bizarre lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Everything he had seen was still within the scope of his imagination.</p><p></p><p>But the wonders of the universe truly exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>When he began exploring the universe without relying on reincarnation, the universe's multifaceted nature was revealed.</p><p></p><p>So, just because something was unimaginable did not mean it did not exist.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there could even be life and civilizations that transcended the physical form.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "To discover a planet showcasing the diversity of cosmic life on the first exploration is truly promising for more discoveries in the future."</p><p></p><p>Suhao turned his gaze back to these "bone-brain" lifeforms, pondering a question: Could these lifeforms with distributed brains evolve into intelligent consciousness?</p><p></p><p>Then, he secretly brought a few human consciousnesses from the Cloud Ring System to conduct experiments.</p><p></p><p>Through these experiments, he quickly reached a conclusion: They could indeed develop intelligent consciousness.</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, this represented an entirely new brain structure.</p><p></p><p>He thought, "Perhaps I could reference this brain structure and modify my 'Eight-Armed Gods' by transforming their brain tissue into a 'bone-brain' structure. That way, my 'Eight-Armed God' avatars would gain even greater survival abilities. The obvious brain weakness would also be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, as long as the brain tissue of the "Eight-Armed God" avatars remained, Suhao could still control them through the Bouncing Realm and use the regenerative abilities of the "Gods" to restore their bodies...</p><p></p><p>This was another form of immortality. Previously, Suhao had been concerned about the weakness of the brain, but now it was gone!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Suhao enthusiastically began experimenting with modifying the "Eight-Armed Gods."</p><p></p><p>As for the "Eight-Armed Gods," he had plenty of them, so he didn't mind sacrificing some.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't modify his own main body...</p><p>He would have to be crazy to do that.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, Suhao succeeded in his endeavor, having hidden the brain weakness of the "Eight-Armed Gods."</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "I think my avatars are going to be invincible!"</p><p></p><p>He then spent a few more decades on this life-bearing planet, thoroughly exploiting its life forms and extracting their value, before finally leaving to continue exploring other galaxies.</p><p></p><p>For a life-bearing planet to withstand Suhao's exploitation for decades was an achievement worth taking pride in.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Suhao's research would inadvertently influence the civilization that might emerge on this planet billions of years later.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by swiftly.</p><p></p><p>Another three hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>The three of them explored numerous galaxies and planets but did not encounter a second life-bearing planet.</p><p></p><p>However, just when they thought they might not find any results for the next hundred or two hundred years, Fengcheng suddenly sent a message to the group: "Holy crap, Captain Su, Captain Yashan, I think I've discovered another life-bearing planet!"</p><p></p><p>He attached various pictures.</p><p></p><p>This was a large planet with a dominant yellow-blue color scheme.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the images, Yashan immediately said, "Wow, Fengcheng, how come you have such good luck? Why have I never noticed you having this kind of luck before? For you to discover both life-bearing planets is a bit unscientific!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao, on the other hand, didn't care who discovered the planets. He was more interested in whether there was a corresponding civilization.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message to the group: "Fengcheng, is there a civilization?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng replied, "It doesn't seem so."</p><p></p><p>Suhao was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng added, "Wait? It seems like... there might be? I'm not too sure. Captain Su, you should come and take a look yourself! I've already set up the positioning stones for you. Your positioning stone is number 2371, and Captain Yashan's is number 2106."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The figures of Suhao and Yashan appeared outside this yellow-blue planet.</p>

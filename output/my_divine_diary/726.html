        <h1>Chapter 726</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The captain did not get to see Suhao as he wished, but instead saw Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng pointed at the pile of energy blocks that seemed endless and said indifferently, "Look at all these energy blocks, is this enough? If not, I can go grab some more."</p><p></p><p>The captain swallowed hard, saying in disbelief, "You took all these from the Eight-Armed Race by force?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng raised his eyebrows, "Did I need to take them by force? I just took them. Those belongings of the Octopus Monsters, I didn't need to take by force at all."</p><p></p><p>The captain gasped, gaining a deeper understanding of the power Fengcheng commanded.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly widened his eyes and said, "I heard the Eight-Armed Race has been raging lately, sending more than twenty large fleets towards my Blue Light. The reason was that a few of their colony planets were destroyed. Don't tell me...you were the one who destroyed the Eight-Armed Race's colony planets?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Probably! After taking the energy blocks, I did drop some 'Planet Shatterers' on a few planets."</p><p></p><p>The captain was speechless, finally giving Fengcheng a thumbs up, "Mr. Jia Fengcheng is awesome..."</p><p></p><p>Then the captain briefly explained the current human situation and asked for Fengcheng's opinion.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the power Fengcheng possessed was beyond his comprehension. Perhaps with Fengcheng alone, it would be enough to ensure Blue Light's safety. Whether to inform Suhao or Fengcheng, it didn't really matter.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Fengcheng smiled, "Put your heart back in your belly! Warships, no matter how many come, are useless.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, my boss said they've found a way to deal with the Eight-Armed Race's 'Planet Destroyers'. Even if they fire the Planet Destroyers, they can't reach Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Alright, just let us know when they really arrive."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Fengcheng's words, the captain suddenly became full of confidence about this war!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As humans frantically prepared, time quietly passed.</p><p></p><p>Three years went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's first major fleet quietly arrived outside the star system where Blue Light was located, with 125 warships of all kinds lining up and slowly advancing towards Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>This was only the first batch, which could be considered the Eight-Armed Race's vanguard. The second and third batches would follow consecutively.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Eight-Armed fleet appeared, Fengcheng received the news. Then he sent a message in the group, "Old Masters Wei and Yashan, the Eight-Armed Race's first fleet has arrived outside Blue Light."</p><p></p><p>Suhao only replied with one sentence: "Got it!"</p><p></p><p>Then he went completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Fengcheng, you keep an eye on it first. I have an experiment going on right now and can't leave for the time being. Call me if it's really not working out."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Okay, Old Master Yashan."</p><p></p><p>Now that the Eight-Armed fleet had arrived, different people had different attitudes.</p><p></p><p>Outside, General Xia Qingjun and the other high-ranking officials were scared pale, filled with trepidation. But Suhao and the other two acted as casual as swatting a mosquito - two extremes.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng followed the captain to the Blue Light command center to meet the human leadership.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the general situation, Fengcheng said, "Since you've been prepared, just follow the plan. Let them get closer, then directly attack with the 'Energy Burst Wave'. What else are you worried about?"</p><p></p><p>However, before achieving true victory against the Eight-Armed Race, they still felt an innate trepidation.</p><p></p><p>It was like a little mouse facing a ferocious cat. Even if someone gave the mouse a gun and told it not to be afraid, that it could kill the cat with one shot, what would the little mouse's mentality be?</p><p></p><p>After Fengcheng finished speaking, the high-ranking officials fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They knew their mentality was problematic, but knowing didn't mean they could rid themselves of it.</p><p></p><p>What they needed was to hear Xu Shiqiang confirm they could defeat the Eight-Armed Race, even though it would only provide psychological comfort without any practical use.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun said solemnly, "Mr. Jia Fengcheng, can you confirm that you do have a way to deal with the 'Planet Destroyers' from the Eight-Armed Race?"</p><p></p><p>For Xia Qingjun, the only uncertainty was the extreme long-range Planet Destroyers. As long as they could limit the Planet Destroyers, he was confident of winning this battle.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "Of course, the Planet Destroyers can't get through."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun breathed a long sigh of relief, "That's good then!"</p><p></p><p>Then he said solemnly, "Don't worry too much, just follow the plan! Be prepared to adapt, do the simulations and preparations properly. Devour the entire Eight-Armed fleet in one go, don't give them a chance to transmit intelligence."</p><p></p><p>He took the lead to stand up, pressing his five fingers on the table, "Let's fight a brilliant battle!"</p><p></p><p>The officials stood up and applauded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Then, the ease of the battle far exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>As the Eight-Armed fleet arrogantly advanced into Blue Light and reached the preset location, the 'Energy Burst Waves' that humans had set up on various asteroids all locked onto their respective targets and activated simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's first fleet, including the mothership, didn't make a sound before being blasted into space debris!</p><p></p><p>It was exactly as expected.</p><p></p><p>The expected victory became reality, and the feeling was different from imagination!</p><p></p><p>Everyone who received the news first jumped up excitedly, punching the air and roaring, venting the emotions they had suppressed for so long.</p><p></p><p>Some even embraced and cried with those around them.</p><p></p><p>For humanity, this was a great victory.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng waved his hand in a bored manner, "I told you to just boldly go ahead without worries. What could go wrong?"</p><p></p><p>No one dared respond to him.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, Suhao and the other two's status became extraordinarily lofty.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a dazzling light called 'the hope of humanity' radiated from their bodies!</p><p></p><p>Then they redeployed their contingency plans, becoming even more aggressive.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the Eight-Armed Race's second fleet arrived at the Blue Light star system via warp travel, appearing at another position.</p><p></p><p>They slowly advanced towards Blue Light, attempting to contact the first vanguard fleet but received no response.</p><p></p><p>Uncertain of the reason, with various speculations, the commander of this fleet had collected a lot of information about humans and was very cautious, not recklessly rushing in for credit. Instead, he prioritized sending detailed information to the overall command center for this operation, awaiting orders from the command center.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought the command center's instructions would be to wait at the current position for subsequent fleets to arrive before taking unified action. But what the fleet commander didn't expect was that the command center actually ordered him to scout ahead!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because the first fleet was now silent that he feared there might be danger, so he reported the situation to the command center, planning to wait for the third fleet to arrive before taking joint action!</p><p></p><p>He never imagined the command center would order him to take the risk of scouting ahead...</p><p></p><p>He pondered silently: Did he accidentally offend some 'scoundrel' at the command center without realizing it?</p><p></p><p>He was extremely cautious, sending ten warships to scout ahead first, while the mothership and most of the other warships remained stationary.</p><p></p><p>Steady as can be!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to continue waiting, but the command center repeatedly sent orders demanding he quickly investigate the situation in the Blue Light domain. He had no choice but to wave his tentacle and order the fleet to disperse and advance towards Blue Light.</p><p></p><p>Another month later, abruptly, all the warships in the entire fleet simultaneously turned into fireballs in space, without exception.</p><p></p><p>Before dying, the fleet commander pondered one question: "I must have offended someone! But who?"</p><p></p><p>The second fleet, annihilated!</p><p></p><p>...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 538</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It really ended!</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, shining down on this small willow grove, it was clear and refreshing!</p><p></p><p>They looked around, the ground was damp, the willow trees were covered in water droplets that were dripping down to the ground. It was the scene after rain, but it had at most been a light shower, where were the traces of the torrential downpour from before?</p><p></p><p>However, even though it ended just like that, Axing still had a slight feeling of unreality.</p><p></p><p>He went over to the pile of source pearls, collected them, and then turned to look at the willow branch next to it, which was the whip in the old lady monster's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the legendary source artifact! The power contained within it should have the same effect as the willow branch - if you get whipped by it, your internal organs will run away out of fear!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao and Awang curiously leaned in to look. Axing quickly said, "Don't touch it recklessly! If you accidentally trigger the anomaly, it'll be over!" And also, according to the Association's rules, the source artifacts from anomaly disasters need to be collected. Let's wait for people from the Association to come handle it."</p><p></p><p>Although Suhao was curious, he wouldn't act recklessly. Just as Axing said, if he messed around carelessly and ended up getting himself killed, that would be really ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he obtained the source artifact now, he didn't have the corresponding research tools to study the principles behind it. At present, he didn't even know where to start researching sources.</p><p></p><p>Besides, anomaly disasters were not uncommon, there would be plenty of opportunities to get source artifacts in the future!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in this vast universe, there were all kinds of wonders.</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, he would never have believed that such bizarre things could happen.</p><p></p><p>"Sources are even more miraculous than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of soft sobbing came from nearby.</p><p></p><p>Axing and Awang turned to see Xiaotang kneeling on the ground, crying silently. Axing pushed Awang, gesturing for him to go over.</p><p></p><p>Awang walked over hesitantly and sat down beside Xiaotang, also silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three of them didn't wait long at that spot before people from the Source Masters Association found them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the moment the disaster was dispelled, those constantly monitoring anomaly disasters knew about it immediately and arranged personnel to come in for search and rescue.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>A few figures flashed out, stopping in front of Suhao and the others. A burly man with a full beard spoke first, "Sirs, I am Tingzuo, a senior source master from the Liuzhou Town Source Masters Association and the vice president. I'm in charge of this anomaly incident."</p><p></p><p>Axing immediately paid his respects, "Vice President Tingzuo, we're from the Huaishui Town Source Masters Association, the Yangwangxing Squad. I'm Axing. These three are my teammates - Awang, Ayang, and Xiaotang. We're at your service."</p><p></p><p>Tingzuo nodded, glancing around in surprise, "There's no one else?"</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head, "No, after dispelling the anomaly disaster, we've just been waiting here. We didn't dare wander off."</p><p></p><p>Tingzuo was astonished, "You mean your squad dispelled this anomaly disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Axing calmly nodded, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone flashed in next to them and walked over, "Vice President Tingzuo, there are no other living people in the area. A total of seventy-six corpses were found, along with scattered internal organs, all from the squads that entered the disaster."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tingzuo's pupils constricted slightly. Based on the data, he immediately realized that the four people in front of him were likely the only survivors of this anomaly.</p><p></p><p>His expression became extremely grave as he said, "Master Axing, please give me a brief account of what happened."</p><p></p><p>Axing then described the events after they entered the disaster, emphasizing the horror of the heavy rain and how they luckily came across the core by sheer chance, and were extremely fortunate to be able to shatter the 'lure' and successfully end the disaster.</p><p></p><p>He avoided mentioning Suhao's 'counter-dimensional barrier' ability, reducing complications while concealing this heaven-defying power from his teammates.</p><p></p><p>Resolving anomaly disasters relied on luck, right? Attributing everything to luck should be safe.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Tingzuo didn't find any major omissions and didn't doubt him. He pointed to the small willow branch on the ground, "So this is the source artifact for this anomaly disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Axing nodded, "That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Tingzuo waved his hand, and immediately someone came forward to examine it. They held a rod-like device, scanning it over the willow branch. The device made a 'beep' sound and the tip flashed a green light. The person turned and nodded to Tingzuo.</p><p></p><p>Tingzuo let out a long breath of relief and patted Axing's shoulder, "You've made a great contribution. Tonight there will be a banquet in Liuzhou Town to celebrate you!"</p><p></p><p>Axing didn't decline, as they deserved this. He just showed a faint smile, "Thank you for your hospitality, Vice President Tingzuo."</p><p></p><p>What Suhao was focused on, however, was how the Association people would handle the source artifact - the willow branch.</p><p></p><p>He saw a bald source master carrying a huge box and setting it down next to the source artifact, opening it up.</p><p></p><p>The box was made of layered stone materials, with a thick layer of sand inside.</p><p></p><p>Another person used a special pair of tongs to gently pick up the willow branch and place it on the sand. They then covered it with another thick layer of sand before closing and locking the lid.</p><p></p><p>Suhao watched the whole process, filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>After getting up, the bald source master said, "Vice President Tingzuo, it's done!"</p><p></p><p>Tingzuo said, "Collect the corpses of the masters who died in the disaster. They were all heroes. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao wasn't interested in this kind of banquet, but he wouldn't dampen Axing and Awang's spirits. He symbolically participated, made an appearance to enjoy everyone's praise, then quietly slipped away to enjoy the buffet on his own.</p><p></p><p>During this time, all kinds of girls, women, men and even boys invited him to dance, but he flatly refused them all.</p><p></p><p>There was no particular reason, he just felt he couldn't blend into this lively and extraordinary scene.</p><p></p><p>He was inherently solitary - what did all the worldly splendors have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>Gentlemen enjoyed gentlemanly pleasures, women enjoyed womanly joys, the heroes Axing and Awang enjoyed being the center of attention and praise, little Xiaotang was immersed in the sadness of losing teammates...</p><p></p><p>No matter the joy, anger, sorrow, delight, glory, jealousy, love or hatred, everyone found their own place, and then enjoyed the emotions unique to themselves. That was good enough.</p><p></p><p>This was how Suhao felt now. As a passing traveler in this world, he simply observed the customs and scenery of this world like a traveler. He participated in their ideals, participated in their beliefs, acted together with them, gained knowledge, leaving behind some traces of his passing...</p><p></p><p>Then in the distant future, after experiencing all the wonders of the universe, he could take out these memories as a traveler and savor them, reminisce about them...</p><p></p><p>That would be nice!</p><p></p><p>The banquet was ending.</p><p></p><p>Axing came over to Suhao's side and said softly, "Ayang, do you think Xiaotang will end up with Awang?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed, "You're asking the wrong person. You should ask Xiaotang."</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "You're right."</p><p></p><p>He took a sip of the wine in his cup and gestured, "Want some?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao raised the juice in his hand, "I prefer this."</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "That's a pity...Ayang, why do I feel like you have a lot on your mind tonight?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "You're quite perceptive, I didn't expect that. It's not that I have a lot on my mind, it's just that I'm not used to lively scenes. The livelier it is, the more uncomfortable I feel. I'm most at ease when I'm alone."</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head, "I don't understand! You don't seem like the kind of person with a solitary, reclusive personality. You'll get used to it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed lightly, "I'm already used to this. It's fine, sometimes it's a kind of enjoyment."</p><p></p><p>He had experienced so much, he understood the root of this solitude a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>After all, the youth he was now was different from the youth he once was.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Axing drained the wine in his cup and let out a long breath, "Ayang! I'm really sorry!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao was puzzled, "Why are you apologizing?"</p><p></p><p>Axing said, "If it weren't for you, Awang and I might have died. It was me who brought you all into danger."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Without me, you and Awang wouldn't have participated."</p><p></p><p>Axing shook his head, "That's not certain. There will be more anomaly disasters next time, and I'll still go. Ayang, don't you think I'm too willful and arrogant as a team leader?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "You're a bit reckless and immature. But Axing, being willful is actually the greatest freedom! Being able to be willful is quite nice."</p>

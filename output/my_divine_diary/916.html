        <h1>Chapter 916</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Chipu, wake up, Master is here!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu groggily opened his eyes and saw a group of people looking at him with concern, including his recently acknowledged master Jia Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Part of his fear towards his third brother Lei'an had transferred onto Fengcheng. When he saw Fengcheng's smirking expression looking at him, he immediately scrambled up, thinking: "When did Master arrive? He came so quietly, without the slightest hint. Just like the third brother, too terrifying. Third brother...where are you? Your brother Chipu is being watched, hurry and save your brother!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "Since you're all awake now, let's get to the main topic! Let me formally introduce myself first. My name is Jia Fengcheng, a wanderer roaming the universe, with the goal of exploring the mysterious and vast cosmos. Wherever is the unknown, that is my destination. As long as the universe is infinite, my exploration will be infinite."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the other disciples were hearing someone take exploring the universe as their goal for the first time, and couldn't help their eyes rolling wide open, looking like sheltered people.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't understand what profession a 'wanderer' was.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss--"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others caught another key phrase - infinite life.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts wavered again from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng continued: "However, the universe is so desolate, the vast starry sky unbelievably quiet. I have almost wandered through all the star domains your eyes can see, but I have not encountered any fellow explorers roaming the starry skies like us..."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others were completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>He has wandered through all the star domains their eyes could see?</p><p></p><p>They were not fools, they knew just how vast the 'star domains their eyes could see' were.</p><p></p><p>An indescribable shock welled up in their hearts: Just how powerful was Master Fengcheng to have reached this level?</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng paused, then said: "Such a vast universe, it is too difficult for us alone to explore and gain anything.  So we conceived the idea of finding more fellow wanderers.</p><p></p><p>But many years have passed and we have not found a single one. We are not sure if there are others like us in the universe. Even if there are, the odds of encountering them in the vast cosmos are so infinitesimally small.</p><p></p><p>So we thought of another plan - to find suitable seedlings and teach them to become wanderers with a strong desire to explore, joining us in exploring the unknown in the universe.</p><p></p><p>And coincidentally, during our exploration of the universe, we discovered this Crux Star and all of you."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling took a long while to recover, swallowing hard before saying in disbelief: "Master, are you saying that by taking us as disciples and teaching us to grow stronger, you aim to cultivate us into 'wanderers' to join you in exploring the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng nodded: "Correct."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciples' looks of disbelief, Fengcheng smiled: "Of course, you are still far too lacking at present, only able to hop around on a single planet. You cannot even leave this tiny star system, let alone explore the universe.</p><p></p><p>To reach the level of being able to independently explore the universe, you will need to cultivate for at least a thousand years, at the very least. It does not mean you can do so after just a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>The group looked at each other, filled with both longing and disbelief. The ten crossed-over ones suddenly recalled the blue box that had flashed in their minds before, now understanding its meaning - so this is what a different life means?</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng continued: "Shuling, Feifei, Chipu, you are my senior disciple, second disciple, and third disciple respectively."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the others: "Introduce yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yanfeng stepped forward first: "Greetings Master-Ancestor, I am Luo Yanfeng, senior disciple under Master Tali."</p><p></p><p>A tall man stepped out: "Greetings Master-Ancestor, I am Lu Zhibao, second disciple under Master Gail."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the ten crossed-over ones finished introducing themselves, it was the turn of the six local disciples to step forward one by one: "Luobuo Ruide."</p><p></p><p>"Aisi Kala."</p><p></p><p>Once all had introduced themselves, Fengcheng casually pointed, sending seventeen beams of light shooting from his fingertip into the backs of their hands, forming a twin sword mark.</p><p></p><p>Those who received the twin sword mark were overjoyed, especially the six non-crossed over disciples. Having followed Cong Shuling for many years, they knew a bit about it and yearned greatly to have their own system.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Demon King Chipu, he thought: "So it seems I now have two systems? Which one should I use? What a headache for this dragon."</p><p></p><p>After imprinting his personal twin sword mark on everyone, Fengcheng said: "Let me give you all a taste of the vastness of the universe."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the scene shifted and they found themselves in the vast expanse of space, with the Crux Star behind them.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng transmitted his voice: "Our current location is the Crux Star system. If you could fly at the speed of light, it would take about half a year to fly out of this star system. Do you know the speed of light?"</p><p></p><p>The group nodded: "We know."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu was baffled: "What speed?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng directly ignored Chipu and nodded satisfiedly at the others: "Good that you know."</p><p></p><p>Then Fengcheng brought them to the outermost moon of the farthest planet in the star system and said: "We have now reached the very edge of the star system. See that dimly shining planet over there? That is the Crux Star we were just on."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others were dumbfounded: "......"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng then pointed in another direction to a dazzlingly bright star: "Look here, this is the nearest star system to the Crux Star system, which I have named the Taurus system. If we flew towards Taurus at light speed, it would take about eight years..."</p><p></p><p>Then their view shifted again as their master said: "Now we have crossed a distance of eight light-years to arrive at the outermost planet of the Taurus system."</p><p></p><p>He then took his increasingly numb disciples on a tour of the various planets in the Taurus system before saying: "Do you see? These planets are all molten lava and storms, with environments too harsh for life forms like humans and dragons to survive. They appear completely lifeless. But this is not absolute - such environments may give rise to life forms vastly different from humans and dragons. So we need to thoroughly explore them to find out."</p><p></p><p>"A single star system is already immense, far beyond ordinary people's imagination. And the distance between two star systems is also extremely vast. If I left you all here, even if I told you the direction of the Crux Star, you might exhaust your lifespans without being able to return at your current speeds."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others felt their heartbeats slow: "......"  </p><p></p><p>Fengcheng continued: "Do you know how many stars of this scale exist in the entire vast Milky Way galaxy? At least one trillion."</p><p></p><p>*Gulp*</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling and the others swallowed hard with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu extended his paw to count, looking dazed: "One trillion...how much is that?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said: "And there are countless galaxies as vast as the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>Our goal is to explore those innumerable vast galaxies, to seek out the secrets hidden within, to discover the different wonders concealed in the depths of the cosmos, to find those dazzling civilizations lying on various planets!"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling, Cong Feifei, and even Luo Yanfeng felt their souls elevated in that instant.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly felt different. Although still very weak, a surge of passion washed away all the narrowness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>When they now looked at Fengcheng, their gaze had also changed.</p><p></p><p>They did not know what immense power this human form contained.</p><p></p><p>It was even beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were constantly awed by their master's lofty goals.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the crossed-over ones had wondered if Fengcheng had other motives in taking them as disciples.</p><p></p><p>But in that moment of gazing at the vast starry expanse, such doubts vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>They knew a person yearning for the stars could not harbor any petty scheming in their heart.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 653</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After wandering on this planet for a couple of weeks, the four of them returned to the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging information, they concluded: This is just an ordinary planet. In its current state, it is difficult for life to emerge, unless there is a future impact from an extraterrestrial object that causes drastic environmental changes.</p><p></p><p>There is that possibility!</p><p></p><p>In total, the four of them collected over a hundred types of special minerals they had never seen before, expanding their material library.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Let's stay here for a few more years, looking for useful things. After we explore the entire Yuzhishen galaxy, we'll depart for the next galaxy."</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao set the tone, everyone began to divide up the work. The three with teleportation abilities - Su Hao, Yashan, and Fengcheng - were responsible for searching various planets for special materials and collecting corresponding samples. Feixiang, who lacked teleportation abilities, was in charge of analyzing the samples.</p><p></p><p>Two years later, the three had basically explored all the planets in the galaxy, obtaining over a thousand unknown substances, which Feixiang analyzed to determine their specific structures and compositions.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang said, "I've finished analyzing all the samples we brought back. Thirteen of them have special properties that react with spiritual power at high or low temperatures, making them valuable for research and application."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "It seems this galaxy doesn't have much to offer us. If so, we'll pause our exploration activities for now."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then asked Feixiang, "Those five children are six years old this year, right? How are your preparations going?"</p><p></p><p>Although they had determined that the main direction for researching 'spiritual power' was to find special materials to confirm fluctuations in cosmic energy, Su Hao would not put all his hopes in just one basket.</p><p></p><p>The project to find special materials to build new 'eyes' required research, but the project to strengthen spiritual power itself also needed to be studied.</p><p></p><p>And those five children could assist Feixiang's research project on strengthening spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang nodded, "I've had a teaching plan ready for a long time, we can start anytime."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and said, "You can spend some time each day giving them an introduction, but you'll need to free up more time, because we have something to take care of first."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang asked curiously, "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "We're going to destroy Planet No. 10, the farthest planet in the Yuzhishen galaxy, and then shoot it out."</p><p></p><p>Feixiang's eyes went wide. "Destroy Planet No. 10?"</p><p></p><p>That was a planet with a volume millions of times larger than their home planet. How could he so casually suggest destroying it...and his tone was so nonchalant, as if it were a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao asked Yashan, "Yashan, do we have backups of all the materials we've encountered so far?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied, "Yes, we have backups of everything, with ample quantities. Master Wei, are you planning to use them to test the reaction of materials to energy fluctuations?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Correct. I'll take the opportunity when I destroy the planet to closely observe the reactions of various materials. If there really are the special materials I'm looking for, they're bound to respond under such intense energy bombardment."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "I understand! I'll need about a month to assemble the observation equipment."  </p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Okay, no need to rush. We'll carry out this operation in two months, giving you ample time to make it as thorough as possible."</p><p></p><p>And so it was decided.</p><p></p><p>Feixiang was still in a daze - they had so casually decided the life or death of an entire planet!</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng patted Feixiang's shoulder and said, "What are you spacing out for? Go help Master Yashan!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The one suffering the most on the spacecraft was Yuanfeng, who was on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone know what I've been through these past few years?"</p><p></p><p>"Plop!"</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng turned to see his youngest daughter Lingling had fallen into the pond. He rushed over, pulled her out, and scolded loudly, "How many times have I told you not to play in the water? Did you hear me, Lingling? If you fall in again, I'll spank you!"</p><p></p><p>Lingling was adorable with delicate features. Drenched, she still found it fun and pouted, "If you dare hit me, I'll tell mom!"</p><p></p><p>"..." Yuanfeng was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He had just set the soaked Lingling down when his second son Yuanxiafeng tumbled off the pavilion. After holding it in for a while, he couldn't anymore and started bawling.</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng's head throbbed, his scalp about to explode with anger.</p><p></p><p>These brats were so naughty, climbing and crawling everywhere. If he took his eyes off them for even a moment, they could end up in the most unexpected places.</p><p></p><p>It gave Yuanfeng a huge headache. He wasn't like this as a child - he was so well-behaved!</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, his wife-to-be refused to share the burden, only watching the kids for two hours a day, not a second more. Then under the excuse of "beauty maintenance", she would disappear to read novels and play games!</p><p></p><p>This was karma...the seeds he had sown, he had to nurture with tears.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "Ah...when will Teacher Feixiang come for class?"</p><p></p><p>In addition to assisting Yashan with assembling the detector, Feixiang spent two hours each day teaching the five 6-year-old children.</p><p></p><p>There were two parts to the curriculum - one hour of reading lessons, and one hour of "meditation" lessons.</p><p></p><p>Those two hours were the only time Yuanfeng felt alive.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of freedom!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Feixiang approach, Yuanfeng's face lit up with joy. "Teacher Feixiang, you're here for class! That's wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned and yelled at his five kids with a scowl, "The teacher is here, hurry up and get ready! What a mess!"</p><p></p><p>But the five children ignored their father upon seeing Feixiang, happily running towards him chattering:</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Feixiang!"</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I missed you!"</p><p></p><p>"You finally came, Teacher. Dad was driving me crazy!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Dad is so mean and annoying!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng's blood pressure skyrocketed, he could barely catch his breath. Who was annoying who?</p><p></p><p>Yuanfeng forced a smile at Feixiang to show his gratitude, then disappeared from everyone's sight shortly after.</p><p></p><p>Away from his children, Yuanfeng felt reborn, his life regaining breath!</p><p></p><p>Feixiang smiled at the five kids and began taking attendance: "Ling Baihua, Yuan Xiafeng, Yuan Qiuye, Ling Tingxue, Ling Ling!"</p><p></p><p>"Here!" x5</p><p></p><p>The training Feixiang designed for each of the five was different.</p><p></p><p>But they had one thing in common - attempting to break through the limitations of the human physical body.</p><p></p><p>What are the limitations of the physical body?</p><p></p><p>For example, with eyes closed you cannot see, with ears plugged you cannot hear - those are physical limitations.</p><p></p><p>And Feixiang wanted to find a way from these five children to break free from the shackles of the human physical form.</p><p></p><p>Of course, such methods may not work on the four Spiritual Beings like himself.</p><p></p><p>What he sought was not a 'method' per se, but a viable theory!</p><p></p><p>As for why he chose these five children as test subjects, the reason was simple - although the four adults' spiritual powers were already very mature and flexible, from another perspective they had become fixed. A child's spiritual power was still a blank slate, easier to mold.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao and the others aimed for was an entirely new breakthrough unlike anything before. It would be easier to experiment starting from a blank slate.</p><p></p><p>So how to break through?</p><p></p><p>If all one's power could be focused to a single point, then the possibility of transcending physical limits would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>How to focus all one's power to a single point?</p><p></p><p>In other words - the focal system!</p><p></p><p>Feixiang smiled and called on a quiet, well-behaved little girl. "Ling Baihua, tell the teacher, how is your 'Spiritual Circle' coming along?"</p><p></p><p>As the eldest, Ling Baihua looked every bit the part of the big sister.</p><p></p><p>She stood up, properly bowed to Feixiang, and said, "In response to the teacher, I can now draw the circle in one continuous stroke."</p><p></p><p>The other four younger brothers and sisters stared wide-eyed at their elder sister, as if to say, "Wow, big sis is so amazing."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the little kids didn't understand the meaning of 'genius', but they felt an inexplicable envy.</p>

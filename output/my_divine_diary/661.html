        <h1>Chapter 661</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao's current situation can be described as extremely unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>First, most of the power he had accumulated over an unknown long period of time had collapsed and dissipated, leaving only a small amount of power remaining on his shoulders, neck, and head, barely sustaining his current existence.</p><p></p><p>He had some blood energy, a large amount of spiritual power, and a small amount of source energy.</p><p></p><p>However, a large portion of the spiritual power was still needed to maintain the operation of his "consciousness platform". Unless absolutely necessary, Suhao would not mobilize it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he did not have much usable energy left.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the positioning stones he had intentionally left behind in the universe were not many. The range he could move around next would be greatly reduced. The journey to search for the "Ill-fate System" sensing material was likely to end here.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, most of his cells and organs were gone, leaving only a thinking head behind...</p><p></p><p>As the controller of life force, the "Life Seed", he could feel that even if he later used the "Life Seed's" restorative ability to recover his physical body, it would greatly deplete the life force of the "Life Seed" cells, just like after using the "Life Seed's" unique skill "Decay".</p><p></p><p>In other words, his lifespan might not reach five thousand years anymore.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that after recovering his physical body, even if he cultivated back to the "Deified Realm", he would likely only have a lifespan of less than five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>However, what Suhao cared about was not the issue of lifespan, but that he could no longer continue his journey of exploring the universe.</p><p></p><p>What he regretted most was that he had not finished what he wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his spaceship was gone, and all the precision instruments he had built over many years disappeared with it. This not only meant he lost his dwelling place, but also that many experiments and research could not continue.</p><p></p><p>Many instruments could only be built with the assistance of high-precision equipment.</p><p></p><p>For example, various types of "planetary viruses"...</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, all relevant information has been recorded in the Bouncing Realm. Overall, the gains from this reincarnation were immense, so it was not a wasted journey."</p><p></p><p>Suhao stopped his jumbled thoughts, then entered the Bouncing Realm to check on the consciousness states of Yashan and Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the two were currently motionless in the small dark room, dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>Suhao estimated that these two still did not know how they died, it was too tragic.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, Suhao did not arbitrarily record their consciousness information in the Bouncing Realm. Having Yashan and Fengcheng was enough for now.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the distant future, when his consciousness information successfully broke free from reliance on the Bouncing Realm, and no one could threaten his existence, he would consider removing the Bouncing Realm's restrictions.</p><p></p><p>He could even use the Bouncing Realm to create a second transcendent world.</p><p></p><p>But for now, he still lacked an absolute sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Suhao exited the Bouncing Realm and looked at the empty void in front of him, having to face one question: what should he do next?</p><p></p><p>Suhao always had the habit of clearing the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he only needed to sweep with his "divine consciousness" to grasp the surrounding situation and leave gracefully.</p><p></p><p>But now without the amplification of the core compound rune, the perception range of his "divine consciousness" had greatly shrunk to less than 100,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, outside was a vast particle flow of unimaginable magnitude with chaotic positions, his "divine consciousness" could not probe out to observe the surrounding situation either.</p><p></p><p>This also made him feel very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao waited for two days, but the particle flow showed no signs of weakening, even tending to strengthen gradually.</p><p></p><p>And according to his estimation, in his current state, it would be impossible to break through the affected range of the particle flow horizontally.</p><p></p><p>The affected range was infinitely large for his weakened state. He simply could not fly out.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Too vicious..."</p><p></p><p>After waiting another day, Suhao thought inwardly: "Forget it, no more waiting, I'll teleport away!"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he habitually took a careful look at the surrounding situation again, a habit he had developed a very very long time ago - he would subconsciously do this before leaving each time.</p><p></p><p>"Besides an empty void, is there anything else? Nothing else...no, there's still my head..."</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to tell a cold joke to lighten the mood, but after saying it out loud, he found it was truly cold and couldn't laugh at all.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go...huh? What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes flickered, and he suddenly noticed many semi-transparent small particles in the far distance, extremely tiny. If not for the starlight shining on them from afar, causing a slight refraction that his sharp eyes detected as an anomaly, he would not have discovered their existence.</p><p></p><p>Suhao turned his head, widened his eyes and adjusted the focus to observe carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Although I can't see it too clearly, there is indeed something there! Since there is something, why can it condense here without being carried away by the powerful particle flow? Could it be an illusory substance?"</p><p></p><p>If Suhao's divine consciousness could still be used now, it wouldn't be so troublesome. A sweep of the world's divine consciousness would make everything clear.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait some more! See what happens."</p><p></p><p>So Suhao stayed in the "second-level space", eyes wide open observing the situation of the semi-transparent substance in the far distance.</p><p></p><p>He even formed a telescope in front of his eyes with his adamantine armor to observe that semi-transparent substance from afar.</p><p></p><p>"There are many of those semi-transparent substances, surrounding the entire space. Originally they were very small, but as time passed, they showed a tendency to grow larger, although the increase was very small, they were indeed growing.</p><p></p><p>After growing to a certain extent, they would be carried away by the particle flow.</p><p></p><p>And those tiny ones that slipped through, they were all flying away from me... why would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao became interested, as if finding a new toy, eager to unravel all its secrets.</p><p></p><p>The brain that had been a bit depressed from the previous ordeal also became active again, rapidly turning and analyzing all that he saw.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suhao had a guess:</p><p></p><p>The first point, the reason the semi-transparent particles grew was because this kind of particle had an extremely large mass and relatively strong gravitational pull, causing surrounding particles to converge on each other;</p><p></p><p>And the reason they were carried away after growing larger was because the increased volume meant a larger impact area, causing their motion state to change faster, to the point that I observed the "change in motion state" and thought they were carried away by the particle flow;</p><p></p><p>So, the question came: were there such things on the spaceship?</p><p></p><p>In other words...</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of wisdom flashed in Suhao's eyes, and the corners of his mouth curved up, looking very excited: "This unseen substance was only formed after the spaceship exploded! They were originally all materials from the spaceship, or soil, metal, leaves...</p><p></p><p>It's just that after going through some inexplicable change, they formed this special state with extremely large mass. Then under the mutual gravitational pull, the tiny semi-transparent particles gathered together. I accidentally discovered them!"</p><p></p><p>So, is this kind of thing the "source"?</p><p></p><p>Suhao confirmed it was not.</p><p></p><p>Then what were they?</p><p></p><p>And how were they formed?</p><p></p><p>No matter, wasn't there still some blood energy left? Use it all to produce blood, then supply it to the brain to think!</p><p></p><p>Let this lonely brain exert its last burst of heat.</p><p></p><p>If he could get the answer, then even if the brain burned out, it would be worth it!</p><p></p><p>Burn, brain!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Suhao said silently: "Perhaps, I know the answer!"</p><p></p><p>Searching far and wide for thousands of miles, suddenly turning back, that person was actually in the flickering candlelight.</p><p></p><p>Suhao disliked looking back, but this time, he knew he had to.</p><p></p><p>"What I was looking for, I've finally found you... hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Today is May 15th, I specially prepared 10,000 words ~ Originally I wanted to finish and publish this whole world in one go, but unfortunately I couldn't stay up last night ~ Cough! Today there are only four chapters, which counts as an explosion to some extent ~</p>

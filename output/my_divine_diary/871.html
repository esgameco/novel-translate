        <h1>Chapter 871</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>What is a surprise?</p><p></p><p>For Chipu, this was a surprise, of course, with a certain degree of shock mixed in, which initially left him a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Chipu had never thought that his mountain climbing could lead him to find his third younger brother Leian, because he knew that Leian had a supernatural skill called 'Hundred Shots Hundred Hits', which allowed him to generate an independent space.</p><p></p><p>As long as Leian hid in that space, no person or dragon could find any trace of him.</p><p></p><p>And those missing deities were most likely locked up by his third younger brother in those spaces.</p><p></p><p>The reason he brought a bunch of idiotic giant dragons to climb the mountain was simply because he found it interesting...</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to actually find his third younger brother Leian.</p><p></p><p>Chipu's brain raced: "The situation is a bit awkward now, what should I do to ease it?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the group of red-golden giant dragons following behind him were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suhao's smooth and natural form, coupled with Chipu's address, they instantly realized: they had succeeded, they had found the trail of the Great Demon King Leian, they were about to rescue the deities from dire straits, and they would soon become immortal dragon masters with great power.</p><p></p><p>What an exciting moment for the dragons, their hot blood could no longer be contained.</p><p></p><p>Defeating the world's great villain 'Leian Oakes the Great Demon King' was happening right now.</p><p></p><p>At this point, an impulsive young red-golden giant dragon shouted loudly: "This is the Great Demon King Leian, indeed worthy of being the Great Demon King Leian, with such a powerful presence. If it weren't for Big Brother Chipu standing in front, I wouldn't be able to face him directly. Go ahead, Big Brother Chipu, defeat the Great Demon King Leian in front of us, and we will follow in your footsteps to achieve ultimate victory."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chipu's eyes almost popped out, this guy actually caused trouble at such a time, he almost turned around and spat at the fool.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't expect was that the other giant dragons also started clamoring.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Chipu is so powerful that he can still stand so steadily under the Great Demon King Leian's overwhelming presence. As expected of our big brother."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead, Big Brother Chipu, charge up and take him down!"</p><p></p><p>"We've been searching for so long, and we've finally found the Great Demon King. What are we waiting for? Big Brother Chipu, have you forgotten? In this world, only you can defeat the Great Demon King Leian!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chipu could no longer hold back and roared back: "All of you shut up."</p><p></p><p>All the giant dragons immediately fell silent, Chipu was awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>However, Chipu could no longer back down, no matter what, as the messenger of justice, he had to uphold justice.</p><p></p><p>He turned back, winked at Suhao, and righteously declared: "Great Demon King Leian, the embodiment of evil, the source of sin, the great deities have all been suppressed by your dark power. The world is filled with misery, already a scene of purgatory. I have pursued your evil power for decades, and every time you managed to escape by a fluke. But now, you cannot escape, obediently accept the judgment of justice!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he opened his mouth, pounced, and bit!</p><p></p><p>Suhao slowly raised his hand and gently waved it.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu was immediately shot away like a cannonball, turning into a star and disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>The young giant dragons behind Chipu were about to step forward and follow in Chipu's footsteps, but upon seeing this scene, they all froze, their dragon mouths agape in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp~"</p><p></p><p>"Too...too strong! As expected of the Great Demon King Leian, worthy of being the golden dragon that suppressed the deities."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of power is needed to defeat such a Great Demon King?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they no longer had the courage to take another step forward, but instead kept retreating their claws, ready to flee at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for rescuing the deities, didn't they just see their strongest Big Brother Chipu get slapped away without a trace?</p><p></p><p>Just as the giant dragons were slowly retreating, preparing to go back down the mountain, Suhao casually waved his hand, and Chipu's massive figure instantly appeared in front of Suhao, lying dazed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The young dragons saw this and froze in their tracks again, exclaiming: "Big Brother Chipu!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu shook his head to clear his mind, his vision gradually focused, and he looked towards Suhao, immediately standing up nimbly and laughing heartily as he approached Suhao: "Third brother, haha, I was just joking with you earlier. What Great Demon King? No such thing, I just haven't seen you for so many years, I really missed you, so I came out for a walk to see if I could find you. Haha, just kidding."</p><p></p><p>Chipu's actions left the other young dragons dumbfounded, full of confusion, but Chipu had often instructed them: for the sake of continuing the power of justice, we must be able to hold our heads high and also bend down. In the face of any danger, preserving ourselves is the top priority.</p><p></p><p>So the young giant dragons quickly understood the essence of Chipu's posturing: "Feign weakness to the enemy, and seek another opportunity. Brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao laughed lightly: "Chipu, it's been many years, you seem to have grown much stronger, but you're still as weak as ever."</p><p></p><p>The young giant dragons' hearts shook: "As powerful as Big Brother Chipu, in the eyes of the Great Demon King, he is still so weak. Just how strong is the Great Demon King Leian?"</p><p></p><p>Chipu showed no sign of embarrassment, and said as a matter of course: "That's a must, Third Brother, you are invincible in the world, who could be your match?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao changed the subject: "It seems you really enjoy playing the Demon King game! Since that's the case, I'll impart the power of the Demon King to you, so you can become the strongest Demon King in this world. All you need to do is let your name as the Great Demon King Chipu spread throughout the world, and wait for the heroes to come and subdue you."</p><p></p><p>Chipu was stunned, pointing at himself in disbelief: "Third Brother, you're finally willing to impart your power to me? Can I... can I really learn your power?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao took out a pure soul seed and directly implanted it into Chipu's brain, then said: "This is the power of the Demon King, containing the 'Soul Cultivation Manual' inside. Follow the methods described to cultivate, and once you succeed in forming a soul seed, you'll be able to pass the Demon King's power to your subordinates and build your Demon King's army. Great Demon King Chipu, go forth, and let the world tremble under your rule!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the additional information in his mind, Chipu was so excited that his whole body trembled, almost rushing up to hug Suhao in tears: "I've finally obtained the power of evil... no, I've finally obtained the power of justice!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "Chipu, remember, you are the Great Demon King Chipu, your power is evil!"</p><p></p><p>Chipu nodded dumbly: "Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>Suhao then asked: "By the way, where's Moli?"</p><p></p><p>When Chipu heard Suhao ask about Moli, he couldn't help but say helplessly: "Her? I heard she's been dating several guys, but wasn't very satisfied with any of them and drove them all away. I invited her to join my 'Righteous Demon Purging Army'... cough, I mean 'Great Demon King Chipu's Army' several times, but she refused. According to her, fighting justice is nowhere near as interesting as dating."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded in understanding, and finally smiled: "Great Demon King Chipu, I look forward to your performance."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he teleported away from this place.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao left, the group of giant dragons gathered together, looking at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Chipu..."</p><p></p><p>Chipu immediately corrected: "From now on, call me Great Demon King Chipu."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, we will regard ourselves as Demon Kings. Today's incident was very complicated, more complicated than I imagined, but through this, I have realized that only the evil power of a Demon King can defeat the Great Demon King Leian.</p><p></p><p>Since the power of justice is already absent, then I will use evil to defeat evil. Even if we are Demon Kings, we are still righteous Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>Brothers, you all saw that I have obtained the Great Demon King's powerful force, and one day in the future I will be able to successfully rescue the deities.</p><p></p><p>The path to victory is often rugged, what do a few failures matter? From now on, we are a group of golden dragons wielding evil power for justice.</p><p></p><p>Let's work hard together, brothers! I am the Great Demon King Chipu, and you dragons following me will become Demon Kings, the most reliable force under the Great Demon King Chipu, the core backbone of the 'Great Demon King Chipu's Army'.</p><p></p><p>And you will be able to share my power."</p><p></p><p>The righteous red-golden giant dragons howled excitedly: "Awoooo——"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Suhao's plan for the future of the Cruciform Galaxy World, there was a need for a world's great Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Without a great Demon King, where would the reincarnated 'protagonist' find the motivation to struggle and grow stronger? It's not like the 'protagonist' would come here just to pick up girls, right?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't strive to turn the whole world upside down, how could Suhao observe the ebb and flow of events?</p><p></p><p>However, up until now, he hadn't had a good candidate to be this powerful Great Demon King. But at this moment, coincidentally seeing Chipu who was so enthusiastic about playing the Great Demon King game...</p><p></p><p>He thought he might as well let Chipu be this Great Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was what they called destiny.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason he handed over this power was also because he and Chipu had some history, it was better to do a favor for Chipu who had been bullied by him since childhood, rather than for others.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, Suhao completed the construction of the soul power network node, finally breathing a sigh of relief: "The matter of the Great Demon King has also been settled, all the factors are ready, now I just need to wait for things to develop naturally and bear fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, results... fruits?" </p><p></p><p>Suhao pondered, thinking to himself: "Why don't I plant a 'Talent Soul Power Tree' in a secluded spot at the bottom of the Heaven's Passage, so it can bear soul power fruits with all kinds of abilities, and then let the fruits drift in the ocean with the currents.</p><p></p><p>This way, it can bring more possibilities and hope to the ordinary people of this world, opening up a direct path for them to ascend. Let adventure become the theme for the brave, fill the world with vitality... of course, provided they have good luck."</p><p></p><p>In Suhao's view, worlds with themes like cultivation, ghosts, heaven, hell, and demon kings were prone to class solidification, leaving ordinary people with no chance to advance. After hundreds or thousands of years, such a world would inevitably become stagnant, losing its inherent vitality.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, when the protagonist transmigrated here in the future, Suhao could take the opportunity to give him one of the fruits, so he wouldn't lack survival abilities and die quickly.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more feasible it seemed, and Suhao couldn't help but nod: "It's workable."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Suhao immediately returned to his laboratory to research the technology to produce talent soul power fruits.</p><p></p><p>This was not difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Long before many other worlds, Suhao had studied the subject of 'Innate Divine Abilities'. Now that he had acquired the special 'information force' of soul power, realizing it became even simpler.</p><p></p><p>Happy weekend, it's almost the end of the month, requesting some monthly tickets~</p>

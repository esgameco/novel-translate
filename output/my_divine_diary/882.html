        <h1>Chapter 882</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The ripples extended outward from Luo Lin Madi's consciousness, spreading out in all directions, constantly shifting and transforming in real-time as Luo Lin Madi moved, making them difficult to grasp.</p><p></p><p>At first when Su Hao followed the ripples to explore, it was still okay. But as he flew deeper into the universe, with each fluctuation of the ripples, their amplitude became unimaginably large. The ripples he had been following would disappear from his perception in the blink of an eye, shifting to other locations.</p><p></p><p>The speed of these changes easily surpassed the speed of light. Even as powerful as he was, it was difficult to keep up in real-time.</p><p></p><p>"Resolving the issue of these ripples is indeed not so easy. Continuing like this will yield no results. I need to change strategies."</p><p></p><p>He pondered, then recalled all his avatars, no longer tracking the ripples separately. Instead, he focused on the ripples in one direction and had over a thousand avatars simultaneously track that single ripple stream.</p><p></p><p>"With thousands of avatars watching together from different angles, it won't be easy to lose track of it."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued exploring outward, following the ripple stream. Just as he expected, after flying for a month, he had not lost track of it. "It's working. I can keep increasing the number of avatars to lock onto it tightly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from my analysis during this period, this ripple stream seems to have one or more fixed or slightly moving sources. </p><p></p><p>The reason the ripples fluctuate so violently is because both ends are moving in specific patterns. It's like a jump rope game - one person shakes one end of the rope, causing the middle to oscillate with a certain amplitude.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if I temporarily lose track of the ripples, as long as I identify the general direction and keep going, I'll eventually find that ripple stream again..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Su Hao revealed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>But before his mouth could fully curve up, it froze.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The ripples seem to have completely stopped. What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief check, Su Hao discovered the cause - the world will Luo Lin Madi, the rooster, was dead.</p><p></p><p>"What? The first crossover, the rooster Luo Lin Madi, died just like that? It's only been a month. That's worse than my worst period...I could at least live for a year. And I had even specially arranged for eighteen deities to protect him in real-time. He was supposed to be the chosen one, but he died in such a sloppy way."</p><p></p><p>With the ripples completely gone, Su Hao could only give up and return to the Crossroads to investigate.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for him to figure out what had happened. Originally Big Beard really liked the little rooster and thought he had quality and dreams, thinking he might become a great figure when he grew up. Big Beard also fancied Luo Lin's nominal mother...</p><p></p><p>In any case, Big Beard had wanted to raise Luo Lin well. But Luo Lin often disrespected him and was too arrogant, causing Big Beard to gradually dislike the kid. Plus, there was too much gold left behind by Luo Lin's father. Big Beard became greedy and decided to secretly get rid of Luo Lin, take the gold and the woman for himself, and have an obedient child of his own instead...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao summed it up in one sentence: It was quite ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Luo Lin's death, the Gold God Barry realized he seemed to have done something major.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly called out in the group: "Fellow deities, there's a huge problem. Please come out and provide suggestions."</p><p></p><p>Only a few responded. Order God Red Light, who often played games with him, replied: "I'm gaming right now, just handle whatever it is yourself."</p><p></p><p>Barry waited a while longer but saw no other responses, so he spent points to send a few vibration frequencies.</p><p></p><p>"Are you looking to get beat up, Barry? You interrupted at a crucial moment..."</p><p>The other deities were about to explode with rage as well.</p><p></p><p>Barry sent a message in the group: "The world will Luo Lin Madi is dead."</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Gu: "What the heck?"</p><p></p><p>Salvation God Baishen: "Lord Barry, don't joke around."</p><p></p><p>Heavenly God Nati: "Hahaha, you gave me quite a scare there Barry, very funny."</p><p></p><p>The other deities also weighed in with their opinions.</p><p></p><p>But the Night God Yongshi casually sent a picture: "This is what I just saw - Luo Lin Madi is still buried in the gold cave, dead as a doornail. Hmm, no one has discovered he's dead yet."</p><p></p><p>The deities froze, no longer in the mood for gaming. </p><p></p><p>They all checked the situation through the soul network and indeed, as Yongshi said, the world will Luo Lin Madi was still buried there.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned and dumbfounded. An awkward silence fell.</p><p></p><p>Barry prompted: "Fellow deities, please offer some suggestions!"</p><p></p><p>Red Light immediately exploded: "The guy's already dead, what suggestions? Go dig him up and rebury him? Weren't you watching over him Barry? How did you let him randomly die? You owe me 10,000 points for every 10 years."</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Gu also said: "Barry, you better give us a satisfactory explanation, or you're in big trouble. Did you space out while watching over him?"</p><p></p><p>Barry coughed: "It probably has nothing to do with me. I just played a round of deity games and when I turned back, he was gone."</p><p></p><p>Salvation God Baishen mocked: "I knew having that unreliable Barry take the first shift would cause problems. As expected."</p><p></p><p>"Barry, pay up! You're responsible for our losses."</p><p></p><p>Of course paying was out of the question. Barry posted the task: "Didn't you see it written on the task - 'The birth of a world will is never smooth sailing, it must go through all kinds of trials and hardships.' This is just one of the trials the world will had to face. He couldn't make it through, you can't blame me entirely. I gave my full effort and made plans for his growth."</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare mention that he had planted the seed of greed in Big Beard. He was sure that if he said that, the other deities would spit in his face for a whole year until he became a recluse.</p><p></p><p>Light God Yidan said indifferently: "I guess Lord Leanne will be coming to find us soon."</p><p></p><p>The group fell silent again. </p><p></p><p>Barry said: "So we need to come up with a countermeasure."</p><p></p><p>The other deities thought: "Countermeasure? Just pin it all on Barry."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, soon their consciousness scenes shifted to the 'heaven' world they had jointly constructed.</p><p></p><p>Leanne Oakes's voice rang out: "Deities, long time no see, I hope you all have been well?"</p><p></p><p>The deities were stunned: "Oh crap, Lord Leanne is actually greeting us? This is highly abnormal, something must be up. We're screwed."</p><p></p><p>They replied nervously: "Greetings Lord Leanne."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the deities' slightly panicked looks, Su Hao laughed: "It seems you all already know about the world will's death. So, who wants to tell me exactly what happened? I want to know the details."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao already knew what had occurred, but he still wanted to properly reprimand these negligent deities and make it clear to them that he took the world will's death very seriously and was not happy about it. This was to prevent the next crossover from meeting an early demise.</p><p></p><p>All the other deities looked straight at Barry.</p><p></p><p>Barry: "..."</p><p></p><p>He inwardly cursed how quickly these deities sold him out. Shouldn't they face this together and share responsibility?</p><p></p><p>Barry coughed and slowly said: "Regarding the world will's fate, I deeply express my regret, sympathy and sadness. But what's done is done and cannot be undone. This brings us profound reflection to do better in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said indifferently: "Get to the point."</p><p></p><p>Without changing his expression, Barry immediately shifted topics: "The world will Luo Lin Madi seemed to lack drive, so following the task description, I added a bit of difficulty to motivate Luo Lin Madi to strive harder. I planted the idea of 'seizing the gold' in Big Beard. I didn't expect Big Beard's greed to be so extreme that he directly buried the world will. That's what happened, Lord Leanne, I'm telling the full truth."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other deities glared at Barry and exploded with rage in the group chat, cursing him out.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected Barry to hide the real truth from them as well. The cause of death was clearly Barry taking unilateral action and meddling.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the deities received notifications that the task had failed.</p><p></p><p>Barry had taken action, so his merits and demerits canceled out - no punishment.</p><p></p><p>The other deities had evaded responsibility and operated irregularly, so 500 points were deducted from each.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao publicly announced this handling of the matter right then and there, causing Barry to be cursed out even more severely.</p><p></p><p>The deities were extremely displeased. How could Barry, who directly caused the world will's death, avoid any punishment, while they who did nothing were each fined 500 points?</p><p></p><p>Though unhappy in their hearts, they didn't dare question it in front of Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>So they vented all their anger on Barry through group and private chat bombardments...</p><p></p><p>Eventually Barry went offline directly, muting all the noise.</p><p></p><p>After blocking out all the voices, Barry breathed a sigh of relief: "Finally some peace and quiet."</p>

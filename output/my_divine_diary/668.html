        <h1>Chapter 668</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The captain was really about to cry!</p><p></p><p>The order the squad received was to kill all living enemies, no doubt about that. But this wasn't the way to do it, was it?</p><p></p><p>He understood that the crappy weapons their squad was equipped with could never possibly complete such a killing mission. The essence of the mission was actually to draw some enemy attention from this direction, while the real attack mission was assigned to other squads.</p><p></p><p>But now! What was the situation now?</p><p></p><p>He estimated that in a little while, he would just be a commander without any troops!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, the whole thing seemed off. This new recruit Big Strong was originally quite timid and cowardly. Yesterday when he heard they'd be going into battle today, he almost peed his pants.</p><p></p><p>Now what medicine had he taken to suddenly become so ferocious?</p><p></p><p>It's said some soldiers undergo a major personality change the first time they go into battle, easily getting hot-blooded and fearless of death...</p><p></p><p>"Click!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, many holes opened up in the hemisphere fortress.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish--"</p><p></p><p>A large number of small rocket-like shells gushed out from the holes, densely filling the air, almost blocking out the sky. After shooting out, each shell adjusted its direction, swarming towards Suhao and the other two like hornets.</p><p></p><p>The captain's pupils contracted as he roared: "Tracking fire bees! Take cover quick!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately retreated to the cover position originally occupied by the octopus monster.</p><p></p><p>The other soldier Small Chang also reacted very quickly, not needing the captain's order. He immediately fell back, quickly hiding in the cover and concealing himself completely.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't dare slack off either. When the fortress opened fire, he had already found a place to hide.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the lethality of these small guided shells on his teammates. Though the explosive power wasn't strong, the splashing flames were extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>If their armor got hit, it would quickly burn a big hole, possibly causing direct damage.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>The fire bees randomly bombarded outside their cover positions, flames splashing everywhere like fireworks, dazzling colors carrying deadly force.</p><p></p><p>After the attack passed, the three immediately ran out from cover, completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Those able to survive in the squad not only had strong physical abilities, but also had to be extremely mentally agile.</p><p></p><p>Anyone lacking either would quickly die from all sorts of accidents.</p><p></p><p>The octopus monsters near Suhao's position had stopped poking their heads out, all hiding inside the fortress to counterattack with its weapons.</p><p></p><p>This made things very difficult for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a soft beeping came from Suhao's gun, and he looked down to see a red light blinking.</p><p></p><p>The captain directly threw his own gun to Suhao: "Out of energy, use mine!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao steadily caught it, then casually tossed his drained gun to the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain caught it, first checking it over, then randomly firing a shot, muttering to himself: "This gun seems fine, how did Big Strong shoot it so accurately?"</p><p></p><p>However, a gun without energy was useless, only a cumbersome burden to carry. The captain simply threw away Suhao's gun, then drew a pistol from his back and aimed it at the spherical fortress: "This is a 'Wenjin' made 'Base Sphere' outer shell. We can't break through it, we need the plasma team to do it."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded to show he understood, then turned and started running towards the side.</p><p></p><p>The captain immediately stretched out his hand: "Big Strong, where are you going? Stand still!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao pretended not to hear and kept advancing forward.</p><p></p><p>The octopus monsters nearby had hidden, but the ones in other areas were still putting up fierce resistance against the other squads' attacks, fiercely battling.</p><p></p><p>He needed to go kill more octopus monsters, let the plasma team in to break the defenses, and quickly end the battle.</p><p></p><p>Dragging it out may mean greater danger.</p><p></p><p>The captain cursed: "Dammit! Big Strong, you little rascal, actually disobeying orders to act on your own. I'll deal with you later."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he pulled Small Chang to follow behind Suhao, while reporting to his superior: "Reporting to Captain Jiang, this is Squad 405 captain Yan Xiang. Squad 405 has reached the central base sphere, annihilated all the octopus clan's outer guard soldiers. We are currently advancing towards Squad 744's attack direction to break through! Over!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a gruff, rude voice replied: "Damn it! Yan Xiang, are you messing with me? This is battle, get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan replied: "Reporting to the captain, not messing around! If you don't believe me, you can check Squad 405's battle records. Over!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiang understood Captain Jiang's mood in his heart. If anyone else reported this to him, he would definitely beat that guy's mouth bloody himself.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was just this absurd. If he wasn't following right behind Suhao, witnessing the whole process with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe it no matter what.</p><p></p><p>The other side soon went silent, so Captain Yan didn't bother anymore, focusing on following behind Suhao.</p><p></p><p>The report had been submitted. As for what to do next, that wasn't something he needed to consider!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom--"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of various explosions rang out incessantly across the base.</p><p></p><p>Suhao went around the central base sphere, directly advancing forward. Whenever he saw an octopus monster, he would greet it, and when it turned around, put a bullet through its brain, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>"Zizizi--boom--"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan and Small Chang followed behind, too lazy to even raise their guns to shoot. They devoted all their efforts to dodging the incoming fire, ensuring their own safety.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that the two realized the area behind Suhao seemed to be the safest place on the entire battlefield...</p><p></p><p>Across from Squad 405, Squad 744 had been pinned down by artillery fire, unable to raise their heads. Suddenly, they felt the pressure ease as the attacks from the fortress became more sporadic.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" the captain opened the squad channel to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the captain, unknown!"</p><p></p><p>"Luring us out? We won't fall for that!"</p><p></p><p>"Look quickly! Someone came out from the base sphere cluster!"</p><p></p><p>Someone came out from inside? How was that possible! It must be an enemy spy!</p><p></p><p>The members of Squad 744 couldn't help but peek out, looking towards the octopus monster base. They saw three armored soldiers run out from the base sphere cluster. The one in the lead seemed to pause for a moment, then turned around and ran back in.</p><p></p><p>They were dumbfounded, exchanging glances: "What's the situation here?"</p><p></p><p>One soldier asked: "Captain, what do we do now? Charge in?"</p><p></p><p>"What else can we do? There must be a trap, everyone take cover!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Following Suhao to break through the base, Captain Yan numbly followed him back into the base sphere cluster as well.</p><p></p><p>Out of habit, he reported to his superior again: "Reporting to Captain Jiang, this is Squad 405. Squad 405 has broken through the base, arriving at Squad 744's attack direction. Over!"</p><p></p><p>Soon Captain Jiang's rude voice came through: "Damn it, Yan Xiang are you feeling antsy? Why didn't you say this important thing earlier? I'll have squads attack from 744's direction immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Captain Yan's mouth twitched. What did he mean by not saying it earlier? Could he be blamed for this?</p><p></p><p>Squad leader Lyu Yong was dumbfounded: "Charge in? Now? Reporting to Captain Jiang, the enemy has a trap!"</p><p></p><p>"Trap my ass! Execute the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>Squad leader Lyu Yong jumped up shouting: "Brothers, charge with me!"</p><p></p><p>The soldiers, having received the order, didn't think too much about it. They jumped up, activating their armor's propulsion systems, and charged forward following Lyu Yong.</p><p></p><p>Halfway through they started feeling afraid, all wondering: "Why am I charging out? What am I doing? I'm dead for sure..."</p><p></p><p>However, they kept running until the outermost base spheres, but still didn't see any octopus monsters poking out to counterattack. Only various artillery shells were fired from inside the spheres.</p><p></p><p>But these shells were mainly for fortification attacks and not very maneuverable. Against the excellent mobility of the armored suits, they had no decisive impact.</p><p></p><p>As long as they weren't too unlucky, there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>That said, out of over ten people, there was always someone unlucky...</p><p></p><p>Squad leader Lyu Yong immediately ordered: "Spread out, guard the three base sphere exits on the left and right, don't let the octopus monsters out!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, two more squads appeared at Squad 744's original position. These two squads totaled 40 people, with armor suits of a different style from Suhao's group. They had an extra large box on their backs and held a huge cannon barrel, looking very cumbersome, but they could still run without being slow.</p><p></p><p>The sharp-eyed Squad leader Lyu Yong quickly noticed these two squads and exclaimed excitedly: "It's the plasma breaching teams! Damn, I'm going to get credit for merit!"</p>

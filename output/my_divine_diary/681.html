        <h1>Chapter 681</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Suhao left.</p><p></p><p>Chief Jiang said in wonder, "Captain, just letting that kid go free like that? I'm worried that over time, he'll become undisciplined."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "Does he look undisciplined to you now?"</p><p></p><p>Chief Jiang said, "Well, I suppose not..."</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "I remember some scientists proposed the concept of 'new humans'. Perhaps...he is the 'mutant' that all humans have been searching for - a new human!"</p><p></p><p>Chief Jiang's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The captain said, "I've changed my mind, we must definitely return to Bluray and safely bring this kid Xu Shiqiang back. He is a treasure. This treasure may only allow me to defeat a few ships if I hold onto it. But if held by humanity, it may be the key to humanity's counterattack!"</p><p></p><p>What he didn't say was that returning to Bluray would not be easy, they must first completely break free from the signal base's lock!</p><p></p><p>The responsibility weighing on him had become even greater now. He had to be responsible for the Yuanxing ship, responsible for the over 1,000 officers and soldiers on the Yuanxing, and now, he had to be responsible for the 'new human' born among humanity!</p><p></p><p>The captain muttered, "Damn it! What kind of nonsense is running through my mind? Watching too many movies or what?"</p><p></p><p>Chief Jiang said, "I like watching magic shows."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dining hall, Captain Yan and Xiaochang sat across from Suhao, looking at him slowly savoring the delicious food in front of him, their faces full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan couldn't help but ask, "Daqiang, why has your appetite gotten so small? The food not to your taste? This doesn't fit your persona!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang immediately nodded, "The cooks are wondering if their cooking skills have declined."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Daqiang would eat more food per day than the two of them combined over several days. They had just gotten used to having a 'big eater' as a teammate, and now suddenly he's not eating?</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Really? I didn't notice, I'll just eat more then!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said with a click of his tongue, "Tsk tsk tsk, a genius really is different from us regular folk. You must have been injected with some super enhancement drug! Rich people again! By the way, Daqiang, what do your family do for a living?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Just regular office jobs I think!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang curiously asked, "Daqiang, all your combat videos have been sent back to Bluray. You're now an undisputed human hero, with countless people seeing you as an idol. I heard your military rank will be rapidly promoted, at least to the officer level. What are your thoughts on that?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Not much really! If I had to say, it's probably 'it's normal for me to be an idol'."</p><p></p><p>"Sheesh!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang sucked in a breath of cold air, "So this is the aura a human hero should have? Too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said, "Just that self-confidence alone puts me to shame!"</p><p></p><p>The three chatted idly for a while, when suddenly Xiaochang sighed and said, "I heard our Yuanxing ship can't return for the time being. Don't know when I'll be able to tell my dad thanks in person."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said, "Come on, when you see your dad, I'm afraid you won't be able to get a word out."</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang laughed as if imagining the scene of meeting his old man, "You may be right."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said, "Word is, we're about to activate the curvature engine and head towards the food star worms. After shaking off the Eight Hands clan's pursuit over there, we can return. So Xiaochang, you don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's eyes lit up, catching the key point in Captain Yan's conversation - the curvature engine!</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "If I can learn how to make a curvature engine, then spatial distance will no longer be an obstacle for me to explore the universe."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately added a new mission to his task board in the Pinball Space: Learn space navigation technology.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the technology of this world is more advanced than I imagined. At most a year, and I'll be able to learn all this!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to his dorm, Suhao first sat in meditation to refine the spiritual power within his body, then entered the Pinball Space to design the gene sequence for evolution.</p><p></p><p>"In the previous world, I did experiments with Ayashan and Fengcheng. Mutant evolution can directly leap to the second level [Ranger], then from the second level to the fourth level [Bone Demon], and then to the sixth level [Earth Lord]. So in four months, I can evolve to the highest form [Life Child].</p><p></p><p>After successfully becoming a [Life Child], I'll gradually add on the [Prophet], 'Dynamic Vision', 'Life Perception' and other attachments. Just half a year, and I'll recover all my abilities. After adapting for a period, I'll reach the peak state."</p><p></p><p>"Now, starting from [Ranger]!"</p><p></p><p>He now had the ability to build small worlds. During the evolution sleep, he would hide in a small world, ensuring no one could find him. Even if someone came knocking, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Suhao injected himself with the gene modification liquid, then fell into a deep sleep in the small world.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up again, he had become the second-level mutant [Ranger].</p><p></p><p>"After adapting for a month, I can continue evolving into the fourth level [Bone Demon], at which point my vitality will undergo a metamorphosis."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Suhao's body could contain more blood energy. Without further ado, he converted source into blood energy and absorbed it into his body, filling up his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of always maintaining peak state is really nice!"</p><p></p><p>Replenishing the source pearls' consumption became very simple: he secretly took unwanted 'materials' from various parts of the ship and converted them into 'source'.</p><p></p><p>As a result, for a long period of time, there was a rumor spreading on the Yuanxing that 'there was a ghost on the ship', causing everyone to be on high alert.</p><p></p><p>A month later, a broadcast voice rang out across the ship: "In two hours, the ship will activate the curvature engine. All personnel must immediately enter the adaptation chambers and prepare."</p><p></p><p>"Activating the curvature engine?" Suhao was stunned, waking from his cultivation state. He then put on his clothes and headed out.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about what this curvature engine was and how it worked. Perhaps he could take this opportunity to observe it closely.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan soon found him and led him and Xiaochang straight to the 'adaptation chambers'.</p><p></p><p>Inside the adaptation chambers were individual pod-like chambers laid out neatly like coffins, about 2,000 of them resembling full virtual gaming pods.</p><p></p><p>Suhao quickly found his assigned number, following others' lead by using his face to unlock it, lying down inside and closing it.</p><p></p><p>Just lying there waiting, he didn't know how long had passed when he clearly sensed the entire ship suddenly jolt, and a strange heavy pressure gradually descended, pressing down on every single cell of his body...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think in surprise, "Hey? Isn't this the feeling of traversing space?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, this feeling of heavy pressure was very familiar to Suhao, similar to when he 'teleported', 'flashed', or used 'second-space' movement.</p><p></p><p>Since he had modified himself into a 'balancer' long ago, he didn't feel any discomfort at this time.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's still a bit different. The intensity of the pressure is much lower than 'teleportation'. Even without my 'balancer', the original body's physical strength could withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing it this way, the curvature engine might be closely related to his own 'spatial' abilities. This happened to fall right into his area of expertise - it would be unacceptable if he couldn't learn it.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought, "Perhaps it's another application of space."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he fully extended his spiritual sense and psychic tentacles to jointly perceive the changes in this space.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, through his psychic tentacles, he sensed a subtle anomaly in the surrounding space - space was being compressed and stretched!</p><p></p><p>A spatial differential was gradually forming in front and behind the ship, propelling the ship to accelerate...</p><p></p><p>He could observe the changes in the 'lines' and 'cubes' of space through his psychic tentacles, which greatly astonished him.</p><p></p><p>"How is this done? The energy required to compress and stretch space is enormously huge. How can such a small ship achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>This had clearly entered Suhao's knowledge blind spot. To him, observing the curvature engine was like the captain watching his 'hundred shots, hundred hits' - it seemed incredible, but he didn't know how to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>Suhao's thirst for knowledge was burning fiercely again.</p><p></p><p>Then suddenly a thought occurred to him: "Can the power I possess allow me to achieve the effects of the curvature engine without relying on external forces?"</p><p></p><p>If he could truly achieve these effects without relying on the ship, but solely through his own 'psychic tentacles', 'source', 'spiritual power', or something else, then Suhao could freely travel between galaxies in the universe...</p><p></p><p>This would mean that within his 5,000 year lifespan, the range he could traverse would be beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly an exciting discovery that makes my whole body tremble."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 613</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Two years passed quietly. The 'real-time monitoring system' had been deployed across the entire planet a few months ago, allowing Su Hao to finally obtain the disaster information he wanted.</p><p></p><p>After getting the information, he devoted himself fully to organizing and analyzing the data. Even Ya Shan and Feng Cheng hadn't seen him for a long time.  </p><p></p><p>Su Hao's goal was to establish a mathematical model to convert this data into something more intuitive, thereby finding the special pattern to unravel the heating secret of the 'system'.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the small world of the base...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao synchronized the data collected by the computing center for the day into the pinball space. Then in the pinball space, he manifested a simulation of the entire planet, using dense red dots to mark the locations where disasters occurred today.</p><p></p><p>The statistics showed over two thousand disasters happened today.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly observing for a long time without much gain, Su Hao pondered with a pensive look, muttering to himself: "It seems to have a pattern, but also no pattern at all. What could it be?"</p><p></p><p>This was just like the pattern math problems he used to do - given a set of data, find the nth number...</p><p></p><p>If you knew the answer, it would be easy to solve. But if you didn't know the answer, or had never seen that type before, finding the pattern would make you pull your hair out.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao discarded all his previous ideas, then lit up the planet in front of him according to the time sequence of the disasters. But the observation result was still: "There's a pattern, but I don't know what the pattern is!"</p><p></p><p>This made Su Hao furrow his brow: "What am I still missing? Or maybe the data I obtained is inaccurate."</p><p></p><p>He knew the probability of inaccurate data was low, because after a disaster occurred on the main path, the corresponding source team would immediately go to handle it. If the data was wrong, that source team would definitely report it.</p><p></p><p>Long-term operation proved that the current data had such a small probability of being wrong that it could be ignored.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he exited the pinball space and thought of another idea: "Fei Yao was able to precisely calculate the base's location through the association's crude 'disaster balancers'. Perhaps if I show him this set of data, he may be able to see something."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had shown this data to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, but they were just as clueless as him.</p><p></p><p>As for Xiao Guang...Xiao Guang had no thinking ability, only a series of complex calculation programs.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Guang's core function was calculation, but its computing power was built on Su Hao's cognition. Strong computing power didn't mean it could do anything beyond Su Hao's understanding.</p><p></p><p>Computing ability and thinking ability were essentially two separate tracks.</p><p></p><p>At least Xiao Guang couldn't calculate things beyond Su Hao's cognition.</p><p></p><p>But showing this data to Fei Yao, perhaps with his unique perspective, he could see some clues.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao sent his voice across space to Fei Yao reading in the library: "Fei Yao, come to the data center of my No. 1 lab. There's some data I need your help looking at."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the small world of the base, the tone was always the same - tranquil.</p><p></p><p>But the outside world was not like this.</p><p></p><p>With the deployment of the 'real-time monitoring system', the mages obtained more and more points. This world underwent some inexplicable changes.</p><p></p><p>For example, before you could guess which elemental mage someone was just from their opening move, and make a targeted counter strategy.</p><p></p><p>But not anymore. You never knew what strange second ability the opposing mage was hiding, which could catch you off guard with a single move.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the mages' combat power underwent a leap. The natural disasters and source beast disasters in the wild no longer posed much threat to mages. Only the bizarre disasters remained troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The mages in the midst of this couldn't truly feel these changes. To them, it seemed natural.  </p><p></p><p>But to the higher-ups of the Mage Association, it was not so!</p><p></p><p>And then, they panicked!</p><p></p><p>What if there were no more disasters? Or rather, if the threat of disasters to humans greatly decreased? Could mages still maintain their superior status, respected by all?</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association higher-ups had a deep understanding of human nature. They could fully envision that in the not too distant future, when the threat of disasters to humans dropped to a low point, the authority of the Mage Association might even fall below that of the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>The mages' formidable power would have no way to be displayed! This was extremely dire.</p><p></p><p>After the higher-ups' worries reached a certain point, the Mage Representative wanted to visit Su Hao, but was blocked by Ya Shan.</p><p></p><p>"If there's anything, just tell me. It's not convenient to disturb the Great Lord at this stage."</p><p></p><p>The Mage Representative didn't hesitate much before stating his purpose: "...So now the mages are too powerful, and as their opponents, disasters can no longer keep up. We're very worried the mages' excess energy will turn inward.</p><p></p><p>If this really happens, the Mage Association may split into multiple opposing factions, leading to its disintegration. For this world, this may well be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>My idea is, can we consciously cultivate powerful enough disasters as opponents for the mages?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan's first reaction was that this old man's brain was broken. Wasn't it better with no disasters?</p><p></p><p>Much history had proven that without a strong enough external enemy, humans would descend into endless internal strife, constantly splitting and merging!</p><p></p><p>But Ya Shan keenly sensed what the Mage Representative and others truly cared about - the authority and ruling status of the Mage Association.</p><p></p><p>This was their core concern, not the "world disaster" the Representative mentioned, which was just an excuse.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't good to point this out directly, so Ya Shan said bluntly: "Representative, you can decide these things yourself, no need to ask us."</p><p></p><p>The Mage Representative just smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Who would really believe that? Only a fool would.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan continued: "Our goal is to collect disaster information worldwide, which has been achieved. As long as you don't disrupt the 'real-time monitoring system', how the Mage Association wants to transform is your own business, we won't interfere.</p><p></p><p>If it involves the Radiant Society, you just need to negotiate with them. We have no opinion."</p><p></p><p>The Mage Representative didn't expect this consultation to go so smoothly, unconsciously revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ya Shan smiled too: "Let me add one more thing - please don't lump us three together with the Radiant Society. Our relationship with the Radiant Society is essentially the same as with the Mage Association - a cooperative one.</p><p></p><p>We have our own goals and no interest in ruling the world. You can boldly do as you wish. What kind of world you want, you decide. It doesn't really concern us."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Mage Representative didn't catch Ya Shan's true meaning: I'll mind my own business, why would I care what this world ends up like? As long as you don't get in my way, do whatever you want!</p><p></p><p>Just as the Mage Representative was about to leave, Ya Shan suddenly called him back: "However, if you want to cultivate opponents for the mages, I do have some ideas and suggestions."</p><p></p><p>The Mage Representative asked curiously, "What ideas? Let me hear them."</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan recalled the distant past, the world that belonged to their Zhu Huo people which he had transformed into something else. He also remembered what the Great Lord had once told him: make it big, the bigger the better!</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan looked at the Mage Representative and thought for a moment, then shook his head: "The timing isn't ripe yet, you can't do what I'd suggest now. Just go ahead with your own ideas first. I'll keep this in mind - it should take about ten years."</p><p></p><p>The Mage Representative smiled, thinking: "Then why did you call me back? It would've been better not to say anything..."</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare say it in front of Ya Shan, holding it in was so hard.</p><p></p><p>Still, even though he felt bad, the Mage Association's affairs were handled smoothly, which was a good thing.</p>

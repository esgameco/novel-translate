        <h1>Chapter 774</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the dragon races reached a verbal ceasefire agreement, they roamed around the small world, trying to find a way out.</p><p></p><p>They walked to the boundary, flew up into the sky, dug holes downwards, scratched with their claws, bit with their teeth, leaving no stone unturned.</p><p></p><p>However, without exception, they all failed. Eventually, they gathered together again, exchanging information with each other in a tone of 'mutual disdain'.</p><p></p><p>The result was: no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the dragon races calmed down.</p><p></p><p>After they calmed down, Suhao also came into the small world. To the astonishment of the dragon races, he removed his pink crystal shell, revealing his human true form.</p><p></p><p>The dragon races: "It's not actually a crystal stone? What kind of creature is this...unheard of, unseen before."</p><p></p><p>The dragon races looked at each other, hoping someone well-traveled would recognize what powerful race this was.</p><p></p><p>Unable to communicate through language, Suhao had his own method. He only needed to record some consciousness information, let the little light quickly parse it, and he could soon understand the basic vocabulary.</p><p></p><p>Suhao walked up and reached out to touch a winged dragon.</p><p></p><p>But that winged dragon did not dare let Suhao's hand touch it, retreating in fear.</p><p></p><p>Not just it, all the winged dragons instinctively retreated backwards.</p><p></p><p>To the surprise of all the winged dragons, Suhao's hand did not stop, still reaching forward.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw that the winged dragon that had retreated earlier appeared in front of Suhao out of nowhere, its head right against Suhao's outstretched hand.</p><p></p><p>This made all the dragons break out in cold sweat, their scales contracting.</p><p></p><p>"This is too terrifying! This unseen upright creature is powerful beyond imagination. It's not an exaggeration to say it's all-powerful - how could we ever defeat it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao ignored these dazed-looking dragons. After recording more than a dozen consciousness messages, he left.</p><p></p><p>The dragons whose heads Suhao had touched did not recover their breathing until after Suhao left, looking at themselves in lingering fear: "I...I'm not dead?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Suhao took all the dragon warriors into the small world, Shengze Divine Mountain fell into silence. Of course, at the original battlefield location, there was now an extremely huge deep pit, dozens of kilometers in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The three-race allied army formed a huge force, attacking Shengze Divine Mountain which had ruled the world for tens of thousands of years, to liberate all the dragons in the world from the hands of the winged gods...</p><p></p><p>Just think about it, what a great war this was!</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, this epic battle dragged on endlessly, with no news coming from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that even the scouts with the army had all died?</p><p></p><p>The ferocity of the battle was simply beyond the dragons' imagination!</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, the supply troops of the three races waiting outside the mountain finally could not stand it any longer and sent people to investigate.</p><p></p><p>One look, and they could not help cursing loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Where are the dragons? Not only have all the soldiers of the three races disappeared, even the winged gods are nowhere to be seen."</p><p></p><p>"What's with this basin-like huge pit at the foot of the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened here?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did the promised epic battle go, and what was the outcome?"</p><p></p><p>None of the dragons who saw this scene could explain what had happened in this place recently.</p><p></p><p>Even starting from the current environment to guess and trace back what had occurred, they had no idea where to begin - every guess they made seemed extremely absurd to them, and they ended up dismissing it.</p><p></p><p>But the existence of the huge pit was a fact, and that itself was an extremely absurd thing.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly beyond all the dragons' imagination!</p><p></p><p>And it warned all the dragons in the world that Shengze Divine Mountain was the dwelling place of ancient divine beings, and was henceforth listed as a forbidden area that no dragon was allowed to approach.</p><p></p><p>Many dragons believed it.</p><p></p><p>That night, the domineering dragon clan leader who had declared Shengze Divine Mountain a forbidden area brought a small team of absolutely trusted soldiers and sneaked up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to seize the Mother God Pool for themselves before any other dragons.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the domineering dragon clan would become the new divine race of this world, and they had already thought of a name for themselves - the Domineering Divine Clan!</p><p></p><p>Cool!</p><p></p><p>They believed that no matter what had happened, the result was set in stone and could not be changed. The most urgent task now was to quickly take control of the 'Mother God Pool'.</p><p></p><p>This directly involved the future status and survival of their own race.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were not the only ones thinking this way. The leaders of the spirit dragon clan and rock dragon clan coincidentally also brought their personal guards to secretly climb Shengze Divine Mountain that night.</p><p></p><p>The three clan leaders happened to run into each other at the top of Shengze Divine Mountain as dawn broke.</p><p></p><p>The three leaders were all greatly shocked: "Damn it, these two races are so dishonorable, trying to take it all for themselves behind our backs. Such a despicable act, not at all dragonlike!"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became extremely awkward.</p><p></p><p>Then the three clan leaders thought viciously: as long as they eliminated the other two, the Mother God Pool would be theirs.</p><p></p><p>So a small-scale battle broke out among the three races at the top of Shengze Divine Mountain.</p><p></p><p>After fighting until the end, none could overcome the others, and the remaining troops from each side fled down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the fighting spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>The previously united three-race alliance inexplicably broke apart, fighting bitterly with each other.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the war spread across the spheres of influence of the three races on the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Suhao had basically parsed the language of the dragon races and successfully adjusted his pronunciation to communicate with the dragon races in the small world.</p><p></p><p>Suhao introduced himself to the winged god sovereign: "Let me introduce myself first, you can call me 'Jiawei'. I am a 'human', and as for what humans are, you can understand us as an intelligent race like yourselves, just with rather different appearances.</p><p></p><p>The reason I invited you all into my world this time is to ask you some questions. After I understand the information I want, I will let you leave.</p><p></p><p>I also hope that during this period, you can cooperate well with my work."</p><p></p><p>To the dragon races' ears, Suhao's words sounded very strange - his pronunciation was not fluent, with an inexplicable accent, and most critically, the order of the sentences was chaotic and reversed...</p><p></p><p>But that was not the key point. Suhao spoke slowly enough that they understood the meaning he was expressing.</p><p></p><p>After listening, they first felt relieved: the other party did not want to take their lives, and moreover, this strange creature was not the world sovereign, not the creator, not an ancient divine being...just an ordinary intelligent race.</p><p></p><p>That was a relief...</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the dragons were puzzled and doubtful again.</p><p></p><p>When did this 'human' race suddenly appear?</p><p></p><p>And 'my world' sounded rather powerful...</p><p></p><p>Also, what did he want to ask? If they just obediently answered the questions, they could leave?</p><p></p><p>If so, then they were willing to cooperate...</p><p></p><p>The fallen god Yuantan's eyes narrowed as he looked thoughtfully at the winged god sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The winged god sovereign steadied himself and asked in a resounding voice: "Human, if what you say is true, please ask your questions. As long as it does not involve the fundamentals of us winged gods, I will answer your questions."</p><p></p><p>Suhao seemed very satisfied with the winged god sovereign's response and smiled: "That's best. The first question - what is that purple glow on your bodies?"</p><p></p><p>The sovereign's eyes narrowed as he glanced at Suhao. After a long pause, he answered: "This is the power unique to our winged god race, which we call magic power. Only our winged god race can master such power - you can view it as the innate gift of our winged god race.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why we are called winged gods, while they are merely dragons.</p><p></p><p>Magic power is an innate power we winged gods are born with. We are destined to rule this world."</p><p></p><p>The sovereign pointed his claw at the three-race allied army and angrily said: "While they, these lowly dragons, actually deluded themselves into trying to steal the power of gods, triggering this ridiculous war.</p><p></p><p>They were destined to be nothing but a laughingstock of history!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of light shone in Suhao's eyes as he marveled: "An innate gift?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to bring the winged dragons back to the lab for a thorough examination, the fallen god Yuantan immediately refuted: "Sovereign, you lie. The source of the winged gods' power does not come from an innate gift, but from the Mother God Pool."</p><p></p><p>The sovereign's expression changed drastically as he roared at Yuantan: "You vile traitor, what do you know? Shut your ignorant stinking mouth."</p><p></p><p>Suhao asked curiously: "The Mother God Pool? You mean that purple pool at the top of Shengze Divine Mountain? You winged gods obtained your power through that purple pool?"</p><p></p><p>The sovereign looked extremely unpleasant and stubbornly said: "I'm sorry, human, your question has exceeded what I can answer. I cannot tell you the answer."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 595</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Flying Regulus was filled with embarrassment as he explained the cause of his capture, and also briefly elaborated on the recent events.</p><p></p><p>Lada and the other five people's eyes went round, ''What did you say? The entire Hengxuan District's imperial family died out? The Federation of Eighteen Empires organized an allied army of 100,000 mages to attack the Illuminati?</p><p></p><p>However, regarding the destruction of the Imperial Clan, although the crowd was shocked, they didn't have much to think about, instead a slight pleasure rose in their hearts because of the death of those nasty fellows.</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan shook his head and said, "I don't know, I guess it's still in a standoff and not fighting! We are also taking advantage of the most tense juncture between the two sides, ran over to save you, did not expect ...... haha, was also captured!"</p><p></p><p>Lada also laughed out loud, "Sort of did not recognize you this son for nothing, still know to come to save me! However, I am 'invincible with one punch', I still need you dolls to save me? I have a lot of ways to run out, but now I just want to find out the other side's old background clearly! What the hell!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the degree of toughness of their own president, the crowd had a new understanding. But they didn't poke holes in it, in their hearts, why wouldn't they hope that Chairman Lada really had a way to take them out?</p><p></p><p>Fei Yuan lowered his voice and said, "If we can crack the secret of the forbidden source area, then not only will we be able to run out, we will also master this divine skill. So, Godfather, have you discovered anything in the meantime?"</p><p></p><p>Lada's eyes lit up and he looked at Feiyuan as if he had seen hope, "Right! Your kid's brain is good, maybe you can figure out the other side's forbidden source area's technique and learn it, won't it be easy for us to run out?"</p><p></p><p>"Shhhh~"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan's expression was flustered, reaching out and placing his hand in front of him, he kept shushing for a long time, but Lada's loud voice just wouldn't go down.</p><p></p><p>Radha: "Dare to run here, thought you kid have much guts, didn't think it's nothing more than that, look at your cowardly virtues!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan and others were speechless, Lada added: "Don't worry! Scrape the ground of the armor explicitly said, as long as we properly cooperate with the experiment, will not take us how! Just like home, we can do whatever we want!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan scared, stuttered: "Real ...... experiment?"</p><p></p><p>A cold air straight to the top door.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Feiyuan and the others cleaned up, they were pulled out by Su Hao for questioning.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly figured out how the location of his base small world was exposed.</p><p></p><p>One had to marvel at the curly-haired fellow, Feiyuan, for being so smart, this innate intelligence made Su Hao very envious.</p><p></p><p>"Meaning that by now, the Mages Association all know the location of the island we're staying on?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yuan nodded, "That's right! The association's delay in taking action to come here to surround us is because they want to wait for the allied forces to wipe out the Illumination Society, and then follow the general trend to push across in one breath."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed, "Then they've got the wrong idea, the allied forces have already been annihilated by the Illuminati now."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan looked like he didn't hear it, "Huh? What?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao didn't explain too much, "You shouldn't be able to leave this place in a short period of time, so feel free to live here! When the situation outside stabilizes, I will naturally let you guys leave."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that there was still a chance to leave, the crowd was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao added, "By the way, your name is Feiyuan, right? Are you interested in participating in my research? I'm very curious about your way of thinking!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan: "What ...... research?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "A study on the relationship between the brain and the mind."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss- the brain! Can I refuse?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "You can't!"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan: "......"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao had the idea of continuing to upgrade his brain a long time ago, and had also been collecting information on the brains of various geniuses.</p><p></p><p>It was said that everyone's brains were actually about the same, but as a [Prophet Man], Su Hao understood that the reality was 'worlds apart'.</p><p></p><p>He envied those guys who were born destined to be geniuses, how lucky would that be! And what about him? If he wanted to become a genius, he still had to do it himself.</p><p></p><p>One can only say that different people have different destinies!</p><p></p><p>As long as the research was in place, the geniuses' brains were Su Hao's brains.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, the more Su Hao looked at Fei Yuan, the more interested he became.</p><p></p><p>However, simply Feiyuan alone was not enough, he also needed to collect all sorts of 'thinking' geniuses to assist him in completing the puzzle of 'geniuses', and then upgrading his [Prophet Man].</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao left, Xiang Li said sullenly, ''Feiyuan, do you think what the Armor of Scraping Ground is saying is true? The allied forces were really annihilated?"</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan said, "It's probably true. Once the forbidden source area is opened, no amount of people are useless, 100,000 mages are about the same as 100,000 ordinary people. Based on the other party's methods, it would only take half an hour at most to slaughter the allied forces.</p><p></p><p>In that case, it explains why the other party has returned here at this time!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what kind of character is the Armor of Scraping Ground? Is there a need to lie with us little minions? Lost count!"</p><p></p><p>As if her strength was drained, Xiang Li asked again in disbelief, "Feiyuan, why did you tell him about the method we used to find the island just now? And also let him know that the location of this place has been exposed to the Association.</p><p></p><p>If we hadn't told him, maybe the Association would have sent someone to call and we would have been saved."</p><p></p><p>Feiyuan said, "On the contrary, it was because I was worried that the Association would send people to fight over that I told him that this location had been exposed."</p><p></p><p>Several people were confused, "Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you guys forgotten how we were captured? Do you guys think you can get us out just by sending someone over? Don't be na√Øve, before we break the forbidden source area, it's useless to send as many people over, instead, we'll all end up being captured by him!</p><p></p><p>Shannon suddenly felt that something was wrong, ''Didn't you guess that he can hear us? You've said the hint, why are you still talking so loud ......"</p><p></p><p>Flying Regulus said confidently, "The Armor of Scraping Ground is my lifelong enemy, he'll get it whether I say it or not!"</p><p></p><p>Shannon and the others, "......"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the state of study and research again, and as for what the outside world reflected after the destruction of the allied army group, he didn't pay too much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing needed to give the Mage Association and the seventeen royal families a little time to digest, so that they could think clearly about what kind of character they were going to go against next, and also weigh the pros and cons.</p><p></p><p>It would be best if the other party had a direct internal conflict and internal attrition, reducing the resistance to Su Hao's plan.</p><p></p><p>The world's top metropolis, Xinji City.</p><p></p><p>It was still the top floor conference hall of the Mage Association's headquarters center, 'Fort Wo'.</p><p></p><p>The Mage of Wabi and the seventeen emperors were seated, and the position of the He Emperor of the Yokosuan District was vacant.</p><p></p><p>The meeting hall was silent from the start, no one was the first to speak as it was really hard to know what to say and where to start.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, with a gentle smile on his face, Mage He slowly said, "Emperors, it seems that the strength of the Illuminati has exceeded the original expectations. I wonder what you emperors plan to do next, and if you have any countermeasures."</p><p></p><p>What countermeasures can there be? If there was a countermeasure, it would have been used already! What's the point of sitting here?</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined that this war would end this way.</p><p></p><p>Until it actually happens, no one will think it's true. It's appalling.</p><p></p><p>Yet reality is so inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>The threat level of the Illuminati was raised to the highest level by everyone after this incident.</p><p></p><p>After another moment of silence, Emperor Yun was the first to stand up and said, ''The threat of the Light Flare Society has already reached the level of extinction, if it is not stopped as soon as possible, the entire world will be plunged into darkness, this Emperor hopes that all the Emperors can raise the level of importance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this Emperor proposes that our Seventeen Empires make an exception and activate the Heavenly Calamity Cannon to destroy the entire Luminous Flare Society territory!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Calamity Cannon!!!</p>

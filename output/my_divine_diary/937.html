        <h1>Chapter 937</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the operations carried out by Infinity University and Twin Sword University, Suhao did not find anything improper.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was necessary to maintain the relative purity of the Blue-Purple Planet, so that suitable 'crossers' could be screened from here and sent to various planets, allowing him to observe the waves of fate and analyze them.</p><p></p><p>But now he had learned the true nature of the 'Doom System', the crossers had lost their meaning of observing the waves of fate for him, leaving only the role of screening companions.</p><p></p><p>However, there were many ways to select talents, and the trial of the crossers was just one of them, no longer a necessity.</p><p></p><p>He thought the two universities were quite good. Screening people with the same ideals and suitable minds from the top talents of an era would not necessarily be much worse than the crossers.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, different times call for different measures.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if he still needed a large number of crossers for experiments, he would not have allowed the two universities to run wild.</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't mind, but Yashan and Fengcheng didn't think so.</p><p></p><p>Even before they came, they had seriously communicated with their disciples, telling them not to cause trouble in this world, but they still pulled this stunt.</p><p></p><p>Yashan looked sternly at his disciples who were hanging their heads in shame below, and said indifferently, "I've already told you that coming here is to establish an ordinary university to recruit students. You don't need to do anything too outrageous to avoid disrupting the normal order of this world.</p><p></p><p>Are all these things you've done because you're afraid the whole world won't know how powerful you are?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time the disciples like the Elf King Vali had seen Yashan speak to them so sternly, and they immediately fell silent, feeling extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>The reason Yashan was so stern was that he truly regarded these disciples as his own people. Otherwise, he wouldn't have bothered to say much.</p><p></p><p>Recalling how he had followed MasterWei's instructions precisely when working for him previously, was there ever a single thing he didn't do exactly as Master Wei said?</p><p></p><p>He could beat his chest and guarantee that for many things he did, as long as Master Wei's instructions were clear, he could carry out each one properly, neither going overboard nor being perfunctory.</p><p></p><p>He always kept in mind every word Master Wei said, and even when his memory was poor at the beginning, he would bring a notebook when communicating with Master Wei...</p><p></p><p>What was this? This was respect for Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that his disciples would treat the tasks he assigned in the same way, but he didn't expect that they would forget what they came to do as soon as they got a little carried away.</p><p></p><p>For Yashan, it wasn't crucial if the disciples went a bit overboard, but what he feared most was causing trouble for Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>If these disciples made a mess and accidentally disrupted Master Wei's plan, it would be a serious dereliction of duty on his part as an assistant.</p><p></p><p>Even if Suhao didn't say anything, he would feel more distressed and blame himself more than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Through this incident, Yashan suddenly realized the hidden dangers as the organization grew larger, especially when the members were a group of people with tremendous power. Once they lost restraint, the destruction they could cause would be immense.</p><p></p><p>This time, although no impact was made and Master Wei just laughed it off, the future might not be so forgiving.</p><p></p><p>Disciples with great power, if they didn't understand the tasks assigned to them and acted recklessly according to their whims, would undoubtedly lay hidden dangers in the future.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Yashan took this issue so seriously.</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought to himself, "I can't let it go unchecked. I need to restrain their behavior and set a boundary with a lock for the disciples."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everyone looked remorseful, Yashan softened his tone and said, "Fortunately, this incident didn't cause too much impact, and as I said, you have successfully established the school. The overall environment is still decent, and the screening mechanism is good, so I won't blame you too much.</p><p></p><p>But you need to keep one thing in mind: in the future, you must exercise restraint in your actions and clearly distinguish the key points and requirements of the tasks.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, the key point was to establish an ordinary university for talent screening, and the requirement was not to affect the basic pattern of the world. Obviously, you didn't act according to the key point and requirements.</p><p></p><p>Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali and others immediately replied, "The disciples understand and will remember the master's teachings."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Alright, go back and do your own things!"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali and others bowed and quietly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Yashan found Fengcheng and shared his worries with him, then said, "Fengcheng, these disciples usually follow us, and they don't know much about Master Wei. To prevent them from causing trouble for Master Wei in the future, we need to impose some restraints on the disciples under us."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng thought about it and agreed that it was indeed the case. He and Yashan had followed Suhao for many years and knew what they could and couldn't do, but the newly accepted disciples didn't know this.</p><p></p><p>If the disciples were just a group of ordinary people without much power, it wouldn't matter. But now the disciples possessed increasingly stronger abilities. Like Congshuling and others, they could even freely travel between galaxies. In a few hundred years, they would undoubtedly become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>If left unchecked, there was always a chance of causing trouble for Master Wei.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng asked, "Then, Old Yashan, how do you plan to restrain them?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan thought for a moment and said, "These disciples are different from ordinary mortals, so ordinary methods cannot restrain them. Therefore, I think we need to establish three systems of rules. The first is 'Sect Rules', the second is 'Evaluation', and the third is 'Goals'.</p><p></p><p>With these three systems of rules to restrain and guide the disciples' behavior, they will become an asset to Master Wei instead of a hindrance. I've found you to work together on formulating these systems for the disciples under us."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng readily agreed, "Okay, Old Yashan is more skilled in this area. I'll just provide some supplementary input."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving, the disciples like the Elf King Vali looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali slapped his forehead and said, "Why did I suddenly get hot-headed and want to compete with Congshuling and the others? I almost ruined Master's plans."</p><p></p><p>The Sea King Yuanshu smirked, "Master said that this time, no major impact was caused."</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui widened his eyes and said, "No impact? Master's face turned so dark. This is the first time I've seen Master so angry when speaking to us. To be honest, I almost peed my pants just now."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali sighed, "In any case, we should stay sober when doing what Master has arranged in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Sea King Yuanshu said, "I think just staying sober is not enough because the situations we encounter will always be very sudden or complex. We can't always choose the right option, and we'll always make some mistakes and be scolded by Master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when our Infinite Sect had few members before, Master could oversee most things, and no problems would arise. But as more and more disciples are accepted, perhaps ten thousand or even a million, even if we stay sober, it will be hard to ensure that the disciples below us remain sober."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali said, "Then what should we do? According to what you're saying, there's no solution."</p><p></p><p>The Sea King Yuanshu shook his head, "The reason we ran into problems this time was because we lacked effective feedback during the process, which led us to neglect the effect Master wanted in the end. So we can establish a fixed feedback mechanism, regularly submit progress reports to Master, and report the progress of our tasks, which can prevent the things we do from failing to meet Master's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, our disciples or grand-disciples can also regularly report their task progress to us. With this layered feedback and timely communication, most hidden dangers can be avoided."</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui said speechlessly, "The way you put it, isn't it just like being a king, running a company, or building an organization?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea King Yuanshu smiled, "You can understand it that way. When there were few people, it was just a gang, and we could do whatever we wanted. But with more people, it's inevitable that it will become an organization with certain rules. Otherwise, it will just be a scattered group unable to accomplish anything.</p><p></p><p>Through this incident, we can also understand Master's attitude. Master certainly doesn't want us to act against his requirements, and forming an organization in the future is inevitable."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King carefully considered the Sea King Yuanshu's words and recalled the time when he was a king himself. He couldn't help but sigh, showing a hint of helplessness, "I originally thought that after becoming Master's disciple and gaining tremendous power, I could roam freely in the universe. Little did I expect that after going in a circle, I still have to take on the role of a 'king', which, to be honest, makes me even more uncomfortable than being an actual king."</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other and laughed, "Who says it's not true? Unless you want to be a tyrant, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vali said, "Then I'll take the initiative and report our thoughts and proposals to Master today."</p><p></p><p>After hearing the thoughts and proposals of the Elf King Vali and the others, Yashan couldn't help but laugh heartily and directly told his disciples to proceed as they had envisioned.</p><p></p><p>Yashan suddenly had a feeling that perhaps his disciples were not as unworthy as he had thought.</p><p></p><p>"These disciples may truly be able to become companions in the future."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 896</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The moment Wind Cheng appeared, he attracted the attention of all the deities.</p><p></p><p>However, none of them had seen Wind Cheng before, nor did they recognize who he was. They only knew that this person who had suddenly appeared was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their understanding, the only one capable of suddenly appearing and disappearing was Lord Leian Oakes.</p><p></p><p>Now, another person had inexplicably emerged, causing various speculations to arise in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he had appeared right in front of the two World Scions they were tasked with protecting, and they did not know whether his intentions were good or evil.</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation, Hundred Bodies, hesitantly said, "I have never seen this person who suddenly appeared. He does not belong to our soul network, but I can sense powerful soul fluctuations from him, as well as that unique feeling that I have also sensed from Lord Leian."</p><p></p><p>The God of Order, Red Light, said, "Could this be Lord Leian? It would not be strange for him to take on another appearance."</p><p></p><p>The God of Darkness, Eternal Night, shook his head, "No, Lord Leian's aura is extremely unique. Even if he takes on another appearance, he cannot conceal that profound, calm, and natural feeling from him. Although this person is similar, I can distinguish that it is not the same."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an enemy of Lord Leian's race? Perhaps Lord Leian offended someone in his homeland, fled here, and now the enemy has found him and wants to take revenge on Lord Leian... I have always been curious about what kind of cosmic race Lord Leian belongs to, to possess such tremendous power."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss—it's very possible. The energy intensity I sense from this person is no less than Lord Leian's."</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time to discuss the other party's identity. We should quickly think about how to respond. If the other party harbors ill intentions toward our World Wills, then our efforts over the past decade will have been in vain."</p><p></p><p>"We can only rely on them now. Our main bodies cannot leave, so what can we do? Moreover... if I go out now, I wouldn't dare to. What if he shatters me?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough, if that's the case, we can only let it be. You two little ones, good luck..."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, quickly browse the mall system and see if there's anything useful. I don't know if throwing out a nuclear bomb would work."</p><p></p><p>"It should be somewhat effective, after all, nuclear bombs have considerable impact force and high heat."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng and Ya Shan both knew that Su Hao wanted to find some experimental subjects from the Blue-Purple Star and send their souls to the Cross Star for some experiment, but they did not know the specific details. They also did not know that Su Hao had already implanted systems into the two travelers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the method Su Hao used to implant the systems was through the Black Room, which Wind Cheng could not probe with his divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>If Wind Cheng knew, he would never have given his own "Happy Learning Assistant" to his two new disciples, because that assistant was just a low-permission, incomplete little assistant.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, wouldn't it make his system seem low-end?</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng said in surprise, "What? You don't like the gift I gave you? This Dual Sword Imprint can accompany your growth and help you formulate the best learning path. It also contains many resources for you to browse and search. Perhaps many of the problems you encounter can be found in there. Most importantly, the Dual Sword Imprint also comes with a small space that allows you to store items at will. I generally wouldn't give this to ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling immediately said, "I like it, I really like the teacher's gift. But..."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, she did not know where to start.</p><p></p><p>Should she say that she already had a system?</p><p></p><p>What surprised her the most was that she could open two systems simultaneously without them interfering with each other...</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng asked, "But what? Go ahead and say it, there's no need for hesitation."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling thought about many things for a moment, such as whether the "Diligent Study System" or the "Happy Learning Assistant" was more powerful, as well as whether to reveal the system to Teacher Wind Cheng and how that might go. She even considered the relationship between the Diligent System and Teacher Wind Cheng, since they were both systems, making it hard not to be suspicious...</p><p></p><p>She frowned in distress, "But I don't want to hide anything from the teacher, but I can't reveal it either!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng raised his eyebrows and, connecting the siblings' behavior, said in surprise, "Could it be that you two already have a system?"</p><p></p><p>The two siblings' eyes widened in shock. He could guess that?</p><p></p><p>The siblings looked at each other, wondering if he was an ally.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng looked around the environment and then said, "By the way, do you have any urgent matters to attend to next?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling shook her head, "After overthrowing this pirate gang, we should have a period of rest, so there won't be anything urgent for now."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng nodded, "Alright, since that's the case, I'll stay here and guide you two in getting started!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the colors of the wind and clouds changed, the waves surged outward, and the entire Charred Island shook violently.</p><p></p><p>Under the siblings' astonished gaze, the scattered and uneven Charred Islands seemed to come alive, writhing and converging into one area. The high places melted like icicles, and the low places filled like seawater. In the blink of an eye, the scattered Charred Islands had become a vast circular platform.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't stop there. The center of the platform suddenly bulged upward, and a magnificent palace complex emerged from the ground, with various flying bird and hollow patterns rapidly engraved in exquisite detail.</p><p></p><p>The colors shifted between gray-white and gold as the main hues, accented with red and blue, like a fantasy celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>By the time the palace took shape, the siblings' mouths were agape, staring blankly at the transformations before them.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng looked at the palace in front of him and murmured, "It still needs some greenery."</p><p></p><p>Then, with a casual snap of his fingers, various flowers and plants appeared within the palace grounds, brimming with vitality.</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng said with some pride, "Done. From now on, we'll temporarily reside here until you've learned what you need to, and then we'll leave."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng's performance not only left Cong Shuling and her brother dumbfounded but also shocked the deities.</p><p></p><p>One must know that such a feat was not merely a matter of possessing power.</p><p></p><p>Immense power is typically only capable of destruction, but what they had witnessed was construction—in the blink of an eye, he had merged the scattered Charred Islands into one and completely transformed them into a magnificent palace complex.</p><p></p><p>This was a skill they had only seen from Su Hao, but mostly on smaller projects. They had never witnessed such a grand and majestic transformation process, nor had they ever imagined that a person's power could reach such heights.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over. I think he really is Lord Leian's enemy, taking the two World Wills as disciples under the pretext of luring Lord Leian out. If Lord Leian is not careful, he might fall into the trap."</p><p></p><p>"If something happens to Lord Leian, won't we be permanently trapped here?"</p><p></p><p>"Quietly notify Lord Leian! Those two little ones are probably beyond saving. Let them await death!"</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty, Fuer, frowned, "Don't make wild guesses. We should notify Lord Leian first."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, she opened the system and found a small "Emergency Contact" button at the very bottom of the page.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, she got through to Su Hao, "Lord Leian, a being of similar strength to you has arrived at the Cross Star and taken the two World Wills as disciples. We are concerned that he is your enemy, coming to seek revenge against you. We dare not act rashly for now."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "No need to worry, I arranged this."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he hung up.</p><p></p><p>The deities were dumbfounded, "Lord Leian arranged this?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 883</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Su Hao replayed the process of Brother Chicken's death, once again, and realized that Barry's operation was only one of the death triggers, and there were many other factors that combined together to cause Brother Chicken's death.</p><p></p><p>There was Barry's influence, there was the influence of Brother Chicken's personality, there was the influence of the general ethos of the Paradise Prairie, and there was also the influence of Yunbo.</p><p></p><p>"The influence of Chicken's character might be a bit bigger, acting too arrogantly, not knowing how to restrain himself, annoying people, when still very weak, is the way to take death. Just take me as a comparison back then, I was too much better than the mountain chicken. It's true, there's comparison that hurts, I, Su Hao, am still very good, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>After a little complacency, Su Hao turned to think of another problem: "There is also a relationship with the influence of the transport waves, I can obviously feel that the growth rate of the mountain chicken's transport waves is a little too fast, it seems that the influence caused by the three of us has used the mountain chicken as a cathartic outlet ......</p><p></p><p>In this case, does not it mean that the energy of the transport wave, in fact, has always been accumulating, only did not find the position of the three of us, there is no way to vent?</p><p></p><p>But the impact caused by the three of us, is continuous, that is to say, in the absence of focus scare, the universe while digesting the impact caused by us, we are still causing the impact, when the traveler came over, those who have not yet been digested energy, catharsis to the traveler."</p><p></p><p>This was only Su Hao's speculation, whether this was the case or not had yet to be verified. Such a long time of experience told Su Hao that many seemingly complicated problems actually had very simple answers.</p><p></p><p>He believed that the same was true for the transportation wave.</p><p></p><p>"It's time for the next second traverser, I'm going to verify it properly. Is it possible that the Luck Wave caused by us will automatically lock onto the head of the second traverser."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao entered the pinball space and locked onto the second traverser, Brother Chicken's good brother - Chi.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Zhi, with a relatively mild and astringent personality, possesses more of a self-sacrificing spirit and is very righteous. Or to put it in another way, fighting the heart will not reject others, dare not reject others, well, some inferiority complex. Perhaps such a character can become a qualified traveler? Try it before you know."</p><p></p><p>Two months later, Su Hao found the opportunity to import Chi's consciousness information, into a seven-year-old dying child, and cured him and released him back home.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>'Ding Dong'!</p><p></p><p>"Rebirth of the Will of the World:</p><p></p><p>The rise of the World Will was the choice of the times, some difficulties could not stop him from recovering, the World Will learned from the experience of his first awakening failure and decided to change his identity and start over.</p><p></p><p>Task: always pay attention to the moves of the World Will, without the World Will realizing it, ensure the World Will grows smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Time limit: fifty years.</p><p></p><p>Reward: ......</p><p></p><p>Remarks: 1. The birth of the will of the world is always not very smooth ......</p><p></p><p>2.The name of the Will of the World is Becky Yopp.</p><p></p><p>Please take the quest as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The gods looked at each other in disbelief after reading the mission description, they never expected that the World Will would be so tenacious, that shortly after dying once, it would revitalize itself and come back again with a different identity.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this their gods' favorite game to play in the past? Acting with a split body, dying once and changing to a different one to continue going out and making waves, not dying no matter how they tossed it around. If they hadn't run into His Excellency Lei An, they were afraid that at this moment, they would still be doing their own things with their doppelgangers.</p><p></p><p>The God of Zhentian-Nati marveled, "I didn't think that the Will of the World could still be reborn, could it be that the so-called Will of the World is also a Baikal like us?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't be! Aside from the 'soul' we gave him, I didn't sense the slightest hint of abnormal soul power from his body, not quite like Baikal."</p><p></p><p>The God of Ten Thousand Thunders-Gu sneered, "The Will of the World is Baikal? Isn't that a joke. I can guarantee that Lord Rayan has already lost interest in Bai Garr, and the so-called Will of the World is bound to be something fresh that he got from nowhere."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for us to guess what the Will of the World is, if we want to know why don't we just ask His Excellency Rayan directly. I think he'll tell us if he's in a good mood, so it's better to think about how to keep the World Will's second life growing smoothly."</p><p></p><p>At this time Barry popped up, "That's right, we should think more about how to ensure the growth of the World Will."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the gods saw Barry pop up, another huge pile of trash talk spewed out, drowning Barry.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Barry sent out a red envelope that it got better ......</p><p></p><p>After discussing for a long time, the gods found a new plan: two gods in a group, and anything must be discussed with each other before it is implemented, to ensure that there are no pitfalls in any decision.</p><p></p><p>As for letting all of their deities keep an eye on it together, this is impossible ...... They still have to play the game.</p><p></p><p>Barry is still the first one to appear, beautifully called ''wearing sins''.</p><p></p><p>Barry readily agreed and said with confidence that he would be able to get the new World Will through the first year.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a house on the edge of a small town on the Guangzong Continent, a seven-year-old boy slowly awoke.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the second traveler - Chi.</p><p></p><p>After he awakened, he was still immersed in the moment before his death, and muttered out sadly, "Brother Chicken ......"</p><p></p><p>Only after a long time did he completely wake up and said in shock, "I didn't die? An expert happened to pass by and saved my life. Where is Brother Chicken?"</p><p></p><p>He was about to get up and look for him when he realized that he had turned into a young child.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned, "What ...... is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>The people on the Blue Purple Planet hadn't been inculcated by the era of the Information Explosion, and didn't know what it meant to 'cross over', and his barren imagination made him subconsciously think that this was the world after death.</p><p></p><p>Chi looked a little scared in the face of the unfamiliar environment, he was still more accustomed to having Brother Chicken on the side to take him to do things, and now that he was alone in the scene, he was a little overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a woman pushed the door and put down the burden she was picking on her shoulder, after seeing Chi, she naturally said, "Becky, help mother to pour a cup of water."</p><p></p><p>"Pour water?" Ah Zhi froze, quickly responded and stumbled, "Yes ...... yes!"</p><p></p><p>But where did he know where to pour water, he could only follow his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Wait ...... wait! She just said Mother? My name is Becky? I can speak this unlearned language?"</p><p></p><p>Chi was filled with confusion and quickly stopped thinking about it, "I can't figure out a lot of things anyway, so I might as well not think about it. As long as I don't want to, then there's no problem."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Observing Chi's performance at the beginning, the deities all found it very good, and immediately let go of their hearts, giving a thousand instructions to the first group's God of Gold-Barry and God of Recovery-by-Summer, and then went off to play the game in peace.</p><p></p><p>Barry and by summer two people looked for a while, to this new world will of caution, are very satisfied, although it seems timid some, but safe ah.</p><p></p><p>Barry easily said, "Your Excellency by Xia don't worry, last time it was me who was overhanded, this time to learn from experience, I won't arbitrarily interfere with his actions, I think as long as I don't interfere too much, just like this to watch, there is bound to be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xia stared at the mission panel and fell into deep thought, shaking his head as he sniffed, "Your Excellency Barry, look at what is on the mission panel, 'The birth of the Will of the World will not always go very smoothly, and will inevitably have to go through all sorts of trials and tribulations', I always feel that this sentence is sending a clear signal to us that the Will of the World will often encounter dangerous things and needs our protection. If he does nothing, I think he will also die soon."</p><p></p><p>Barry was startled, "That means that the last World Will, even without my intervention, he would have died very quickly?"</p><p></p><p>By and by, Summer said, "I guess that's it."</p><p></p><p>Barry: "Then why did you curse me so harshly before?"</p><p></p><p>By and by Summer: "Lord Barry, don't care about these details, it's all in the past, we should think about how to better hand over the will of the world to the second group."</p><p></p><p>Barry: "Then does Your Excellency by Xia have any good suggestions?"</p><p></p><p>By-Passing Summer said decisively, "Take the initiative, protect his safety in all aspects, make everyone around the World Will like him from the bottom of their hearts, and protect him ......"</p><p></p><p>Barry: "Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Then the two deities were full of energy and busied themselves, taking all the people that Chi encountered in his life and quietly changing the will of their souls through the soul power network, so that the people around him would treat Chi with unconscious enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>This was just a very simple thing to do for the gods who had toyed with souls for an unknown number of years, and did it with great skill.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Chi found that he was unconsciously surrounded by love.</p><p></p><p>Many amazons would specially run over to give him sweets to eat; passing uncles would put down their work at hand after seeing him, enthusiastically playing with him and lifting him high; when he helped his mother to buy things, others never took his money; all those who saw him would give him a warm smile; the little girls in the whole street loved to surround him, claiming that they wanted to marry him when they grew up... ...</p><p></p><p>However, he was not a clueless seven-year-old child after all; he was an adult with a relatively mature will and the ability to think independently.</p><p></p><p>Chi: "This world after death, it's just horrible, I'm going to escape from here."</p><p></p><p>......</p>

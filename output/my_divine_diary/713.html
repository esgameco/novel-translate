        <h1>Chapter 713</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Yonghua didn't know from when, her mind went completely blank, as if she was a puppet being pulled along by Yashan.</p><p></p><p>She witnessed the entire process, but what was happening clearly exceeded her ability to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Until over a thousand people knelt before her, shouting loudly: "Sorry, we've caused trouble for Miss Yonghua!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did she wake up as if from a dream.</p><p></p><p>She opened her mouth but couldn't say a word, looking somewhat dazed at the mass of black heads in front of her...</p><p></p><p>This incident lasted an entire day, affecting the entire Victory City. It alarmed the security police very early on, and even the naval troops were alerted in the end!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of aircraft deployed, but after entering within a 10km range, they all fell to the ground, unable to fly anymore.</p><p></p><p>After it was over, Yashan pointed at a young man carrying a camera and said: "You, the one over there, come here, yes you! Point the camera at the three of us and the thousand people behind us."</p><p></p><p>The reporter felt flustered, but didn't dare disobey, fearing he might get beaten up and forced to kneel on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He obediently did as told with the camera! After finishing, he realized what had happened - he would get first-hand news.</p><p></p><p>He was excited again!</p><p></p><p>In front of the camera, the experienced Yashan looked up with flared nostrils, coldly looking down at the lens and said indifferently: "Remember these three faces, avoid them if you ever encounter us in the future!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he directly transmitted himself and Yonghua back to the small world!</p><p></p><p>"Poof poof poof!"</p><p></p><p>The mastermind kneeling in the front row suddenly fell to the ground, lifeless!</p><p></p><p>One body after another fell lifelessly without their heads.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>After that, Fengcheng also transmitted away from the scene.</p><p></p><p>Once Fengcheng left, all the suppressed people felt their bodies loosen up as the restraints were removed. They regained mobility, but no one dared to move recklessly, frozen in place awaiting orders from superiors.</p><p></p><p>Soon, chaos ensued as everyone screamed and fled the area. The over a thousand others were almost scared to the point of wetting themselves. Many felt their arms and legs go limp, unable to even crawl up. Those who could crawl scrambled to escape.</p><p></p><p>The pandemonium quickly spread throughout Victory City, with all kinds of videos swiftly uploaded online.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Xia Qingjun heard the news, his eyes widened in shock. He stood up abruptly, saying in disbelief: "What? What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>His secretary immediately recounted the entire story.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun's face flushed red with anger, the veins on his neck bulging: "Utterly outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>He paced around the study for a moment, then immediately ordered: "Summon all Victory City officials at the bureau level and above for a meeting in the auditorium tomorrow at 10am. Attendance is mandatory. Meanwhile, investigate the identities of those two people in secret."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he added: "Also, call General Gong Liang over!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Leader!"</p><p></p><p>The secretary went to make the arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun pondered and used his private line to contact the heads of various departments, calling an emergency meeting...</p><p></p><p>"The naval troops couldn't get within 5km, aircraft couldn't fly within 10km. Just a grab, and 49 people died instantly. They have the same 'teleportation' ability as Xu Shiqiang...</p><p></p><p>According to reports, these two are Xu Shiqiang's assistants.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's not that simple...</p><p></p><p>Just who are they, and what is their relationship with Xu Shiqiang?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun had a feeling the human world was about to be thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, they absolutely could not provoke Xu Shiqiang, nor these few people!</p><p></p><p>They could only be friends, not enemies!</p><p></p><p>After the video was uploaded, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is terrible, a major incident has occurred in Victory City! Dozens of officials were actually killed in public! I watched the video, they were just lightly grabbed and their heads instantly exploded...too bloody and horrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Shocking news! A brutal and bloody massacre took place in Victory City today, suspected to be the work of superhumans..."</p><p></p><p>"Do superhumans really exist? Feels like everything is about to change!"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"  </p><p></p><p>"Rumor is someone defamed Xu Shiqiang and got killed by someone who didn't like it!"</p><p></p><p>"I know that girl, she's Xu Shiqiang's niece! There's information about her online that you can look up!"</p><p></p><p>"What niece? From now on she should be called Miss Yonghua!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The resourceful netizens soon dug up the full story, leaving everyone stunned!</p><p></p><p>"Holy crap, she really is the young miss, what unlucky bastard dared to go after Xu Shiqiang's niece, they have a death wish?"</p><p></p><p>"I thought Xu Shiqiang was just an ordinary civilian who climbed up, didn't expect his background to be even deeper than I imagined, terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Envious of Miss Yonghua! Even when bullied, there are people standing up for her. After this, who would dare bully her? Maybe like that handsome guy said, they'll have to avoid her from now on."</p><p></p><p>"Those two bodyguards are really handsome, envious plus one!"</p><p></p><p>"So handsome!"</p><p></p><p>"Envious plus 10000!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yashan's final line "Remember these three faces, avoid them if you ever encounter us in the future" instantly captured the hearts of many young ladies!</p><p></p><p>Even though Yashan was seen as an unforgivable murderer by many, his extremely high looks, power and overbearing aura made it forgivable.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the small world, Yashan released Yonghua's hand and said: "With this, the problem is solved!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua blankly said: "Solved? It is solved, this way they won't badmouth Uncle again..."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng appeared afterwards and laughed heartily after hearing this: "Who dares to? If they do, I'll grab them over and beat them up, I guarantee not a single one can escape."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua said hesitantly: "But...weren't we too excessive?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "This is just how people are. If you don't scare them thoroughly, they'll keep challenging your bottom line over and over. If we don't do something decisive now, we'll have to do it later anyway."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng agreed: "That's right, this is what we learned from the Great Marshal!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua nodded, accepting their reasoning.</p><p></p><p>But soon, large teardrops rolled down her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>Yashan was surprised: "Why are you crying again?"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Yonghua asked sadly: "Brother Yashan, am I really stupid?"</p><p></p><p>"Not stupid at all! You're quite smart!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua shook her head: "No need to lie to me, I know what I'm like. It's because I'm stupid and didn't study well that I embarrassed Uncle, which led to this whole mess..."</p><p></p><p>Yashan suddenly laughed heartily: "I thought it was something else! Fengcheng and I were way more stupid than you. It's only after learning from the Great Marshal for a long time that our knowledge slowly grew. Initially our foundation was probably not even one-tenth of yours.</p><p></p><p>Look at me now, to be honest there aren't many people at Victory University that I look up to."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also nodded: "That's right, I don't know about Big Bro Yashan, but I was really stupid at first and couldn't understand a lot of things..."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua was half-believing: "Really...really?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Of course, why would we lie to a little girl like you?"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua regained her courage: "Then this semester, I'll study twice as hard for sure and definitely pass the exams."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "What's the point of going back to study? When your uncle returns, just ask him to modify your brain for you!"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng also laughed: "Keep a good attitude and bring some good food, maybe your uncle will really help modify it for you."</p><p></p><p>Yonghua: "???"</p><p></p><p>Though she didn't understand what Yashan meant, she realized Xu Hao wasn't at the base, so she asked: "Where did Uncle go?"</p><p></p><p>"Traveling and doing experiments, probably won't be back for a while."</p><p></p><p>"I see..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After that, Yonghua didn't return to school either, staying in the small world to learn various knowledge from Yashan.</p><p></p><p>Because after this incident, the sacred dream school in her heart had shattered.</p><p></p><p>During the learning process, she was surprised to find that although Yashan appeared young, his knowledge was exceptionally vast.</p><p></p><p>All her questions could be thoroughly solved by Yashan in just a few sentences.</p><p></p><p>He seemed even more formidable than the professors at her school!</p><p></p><p>Yashan said: "Bring some more back, I've made some progress studying this period's knowledge. If I can experiment with a few more ships, the progress would be even faster."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "Got it, Big Bro Yashan!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he disappeared from the spot in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Yonghua saw Yashan and Fengcheng suddenly disappear and reappear, she felt a sense of unreality, asking herself countless times: Isn't this a scientific society? Why do I feel like I've entered a magical world?</p><p></p><p>Her eyes widened: "Where did Brother Fengcheng go?"</p><p></p><p>"To pick up some spaceships!"</p><p></p><p>Yonghua: "Pick up what???"</p>

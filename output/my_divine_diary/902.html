        <h1>Chapter 902</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao knew very early on that the evolution of a civilization would not be so simple, even with the active intervention of the three of them.</p><p></p><p>After setting up the environment, race, intelligence and other factors, they still could not escape the factor of time.</p><p></p><p>Everything needed to be brewed over time in order to obtain the desired result. </p><p></p><p>As for the race they had chosen to carry civilization, whether it would ultimately grow according to their expectations, even Suhao and the other two were not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>For a human life, there could be many unexpected events.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for a civilization - perhaps when they were unable to keep watch, a sudden accident could wipe it out entirely...</p><p></p><p>This possibility was not low.</p><p></p><p>So they overhauled several hundred planets at once. As long as thirty or fifty of those planets could successfully evolve into civilizations, their goal would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>On the planet that Yashan remodeled based on his own homeland, the main civilization was a race similar to mountain gnomes, but appearing taller and more agile, extremely like the elves of legend, and they were called the elf race.</p><p></p><p>The current elf race had already formed sizable settled communities, and had developed a simple language for basic communication among themselves.</p><p></p><p>They wore simple grass leaves and animal skins around their waists, simply covering their vital areas. They jumped and moved nimbly through the forests, completing hunting and gathering tasks. </p><p></p><p>They also consciously hunted special "demonic beasts", bringing them back to the tribe, where the strongest and most prestigious leader would distribute and consume them, attempting to evolve into new forms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the mortality rate was not low.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, after the elves summarized a viable method through many lives lost, they would inevitably be able to increase their survival rate and form a unique, supernatural elf race.</p><p></p><p>The progress of civilization was so cruel - behind every word and symbol might be piled up with countless corpses.</p><p></p><p>Suhao sighed, "Time ah! More time is still needed. Let's go, let's check out the next planet."</p><p></p><p>He did not lack time. Since gaining eternal life, the concept of time had gradually become blurred, becoming merely a tool for him to calculate speed and efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps not long from now, time would gradually become a state of material motion in Suhao's perception...</p><p></p><p>But at least for now, it was not.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng said, "It seems we can only continue to wait for the fruits of civilization to naturally grow and mature. However, we will give a light push at critical junctures to accelerate their progress."</p><p></p><p>A ray of light suddenly flashed through Suhao's mind. "A light push? What if I introduce the Realm of Transmigrators into these immature worlds? Could those transmigrators accelerate the formation of civilization?"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Suhao quickly dismissed this possibility.</p><p></p><p>He currently only had one 'hometown of transmigrators', lacking diversity. If he directly sent transmigrators to these immature civilizations, they would most likely develop in the same direction.</p><p></p><p>This was not the effect Suhao wanted.</p><p></p><p>Although it was theoretically infeasible, Suhao still wanted to try it himself. Some things could not be understood just by thinking - they required practical verification.</p><p></p><p>After all, with hundreds of planets under transformation, testing it on a few dozen planets was inconsequential.</p><p></p><p>'Modern people' transmigrating to the 'primitive era'?</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Suhao followed Fengcheng to tour the conditions of many transformed planets.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they were all embryos of civilized planets, none having fully grown.</p><p></p><p>There were planets of primitive sorcery, where beings could instinctively and vaguely release some spells, perhaps developing into a complete wizard civilization in the future, but without a systematic framework yet;</p><p></p><p>Planets of intelligent beasts, where through long cultivation, the genetic lock could be broken to gain fixed shapeshifting abilities, tending towards a demonic race;</p><p></p><p>Planets of spirit cultivation, permeated with spiritual energy that living beings could absorb and refine, potentially developing into a cultivation civilization;</p><p></p><p>Planets of demons and demonic beasts, filled with demonic energy...</p><p></p><p>Subterranean world planets...</p><p></p><p>Winged humanoid planets...</p><p></p><p>Aquatic race planets...</p><p></p><p>And so on!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the distant future, Suhao would actively open the pathways between these civilizations, allowing them to freely interact and ultimately form an even greater and more perfect universal civilization.</p><p></p><p>As for why he would do this...</p><p></p><p>Suhao revealed a smile: Perhaps to make the universe a bit livelier? Or maybe to spark some different inspirations? He didn't know, he would see in the future!</p><p></p><p>He could do whatever he wanted, no matter how strange, and no one would blame him. So it shouldn't be a problem to indulge a little. If he liked it, what other reason did he need?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After touring the planets under construction, Suhao transmitted himself to the Azure-Violet Planet.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had been waiting here for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Yashan handed over the targets he had marked to Suhao, and said, "Grand Lord Wei, I've selected ten thousand people who seem decent. Should I directly take them away?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao shook his head, "No need. Although we are now incomparably powerful, on par with celestial deities of the star domains, we are still essentially ordinary intelligent beings. At the very least, we must maintain a basic level of respect for intelligent life."</p><p></p><p>Yashan nodded in agreement, "There must be a bottom line. Power may allow us to do as we please, but power is not a reason to do as we please."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Power is merely a tool for us to protect ourselves and explore the universe. Perhaps power itself has the characteristic of 'bullying the weak', but when using this characteristic, we need to draw a line, set a lock. Because without this line, this lock, we will inevitably descend into depravity in the endless stream of life."</p><p></p><p>Yashan looked at his own fist seriously and nodded, "I understand, Grand Lord Wei. Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "I don't want to take that many people. Let's let them choose for themselves whether they want to come or not!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan said in surprise, "Let them choose? Can they really choose?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao's divine consciousness surged out, enveloping the entire Azure-Violet Planet. He then locked onto the ten thousand people Yashan had marked, and a message was sent out, appearing in the minds of these ten thousand people, forming a selection box:</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to experience a different life?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes/No"</p><p></p><p>"Note: Once chosen, it cannot be changed."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yashan realized, "When using power, draw a line and set a lock. I see now."</p><p></p><p>He understood that this was something Grand Lord Wei had deliberately said for him to hear. Grand Lord Wei did not want him to wield his power recklessly, leading to being enslaved by that power and losing his self and emotions in the distant future.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yashan understood this point, Suhao did not say anything further, instead observing the reactions of those people.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An office worker named Luo Yanfeng dragged his weary body and spirit home after working overtime until 12:30 am. He numbly pushed open the door to his cramped single room and threw himself onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to move...didn't want to take off his shoes, didn't want to shower, didn't want to eat, he just wanted to sleep.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a strange voice rang out in his mind:</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to experience a different life?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes/No"</p><p></p><p>"Note: Once chosen, it cannot be changed."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a clear blue box popped out from his mind, clearly displayed as if right in front of him, with a sixty-second countdown behind it. In other words, he had sixty seconds to think it over.</p><p></p><p>He froze in confusion, "What is...this?"</p><p></p><p>As time was about to run out, he subconsciously clicked 'Yes'!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A handsome guy brought out a seemingly drunk, curvaceous beauty from a bar, when a blue box suddenly popped into his mind.</p><p></p><p>He cursed, "What the hell is this? Can't you see I'm about to get busy?"</p><p></p><p>Then he selected 'No'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A bespectacled woman in a black frame came to the bridge to gaze at this beautiful city. She looked at the neon lights reflecting on the water surface, felt the breeze brushing her hair.</p><p></p><p>She had come to this city to make her fortune nearly ten years ago, but this city still felt so unfamiliar, so unfamiliar that she didn't even have a single friend she could talk to. All she could do was walk alone on the bridge and watch the bustling city.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed to have nothing to do with her.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, accompanied by a strange voice, a blue light flashed in her mind.</p><p></p><p>She froze at first, then smiled, "Is this someone's prank? Experiencing a different life sounds quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>So she selected 'Yes'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An internet-addicted youth was furiously playing games, face flushed, neck bulging, expression ferocious, hands moving like a blur.</p><p></p><p>"Failure!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it - crappy game, if I play this again I'm an idiot. I'm switching games, hope you go bankrupt soon."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a box popped up.</p><p></p><p>"A new game?"</p><p></p><p>Then he selected 'Yes'.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Construction workers, knights in yellow robes, white-collar workers, business owners, waiters, sailors, soldiers, assembly line workers, thugs...</p><p></p><p>On this day and night, many people inexplicably had a box pop up in their minds. When they selected 'Yes', their destinies changed completely.</p><p></p><p>Something they had never imagined before selecting 'Yes'.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late for regrets.</p><p></p><p>As for those who chose 'No', it was as if nothing had happened, and they continued living the lives they wanted.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 685</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was quite obvious that although the energy contained within the energy blocks was not as powerful as the 'Source', it was no weaker than 'Spirit Power', and even surpassed many others.</p><p></p><p>If he could master the energy within the energy blocks, not to mention replacing 'Spirit Power', at least it would allow him to utilize a more diverse range of energies.</p><p></p><p>In the previous world when researching the Source, Suhao had specifically studied how to manifest various abilities using the 'Source', which involved guiding different types of energy through spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Now, reorganizing a method to control the 'energy blocks' using spiritual power would not be difficult, similar to a magician cultivating various magics in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>As for the issue of mismatched spiritual power...</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, it was not a problem, because he also mastered a special spiritual power training method - the Point Breaking Surface Spirit Method.</p><p></p><p>While teaching Captain Yan and others 'superpowers', Suhao could also conduct some experiments to perfect the data for the 'Point Breaking Surface Spirit Method'.</p><p></p><p>It would benefit both sides.</p><p></p><p>So Suhao's next plan became very clear: "First, organize the 'spiritual power controlling energy blocks' method, abbreviated as the 'Superpower Heart Method', then spread it out and observe the effects; hmm...I'll spread it after evolving into a 【God】 and successfully evading the Cosmic Tracker's pursuit, to avoid any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Second, try using the Source to transform into energy blocks; if only this world has them, it would be meaningless, so I'll ask Captain Yan later where the energy blocks came from.</p><p></p><p>Third, prepare to execute the raid on the Eight-Armed Tribe, set up the 'Small World Cage' in advance, and take the opportunity to capture more Eight-Armed Tribe members, a few hundred or a thousand would not be too many, to test whether I can evolve into a 【God】 using them."</p><p></p><p>If the plan went smoothly, he could then act without any restraint.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right! I almost forgot about Yashan and Fengcheng...let them sleep a bit longer! I'll deal with them after returning to the Blue Light, as they would definitely also be locked onto by the Cosmic Tracker, so I still need to make some preparations before waking them up."</p><p></p><p>Awakening Yashan and Fengcheng was necessary for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>First, Yashan and Fengcheng could take this opportunity of reincarnating into the interstellar world to absorb a vast amount of knowledge and rapidly progress;</p><p></p><p>Lastly, on the long journey ahead, having two trustworthy people by his side would allow his mood to be more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't even have anyone to play cards with during his leisure time.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After traveling for two months in space, the Voyager finally discovered an Eight-Armed Tribe supply station.</p><p></p><p>The captain originally wanted to find a small military port, but the other officers firmly objected, believing it was too risky.</p><p></p><p>The captain thought it made sense, it's best to take it step-by-step, the matter of military ports could be discussed later.</p><p></p><p>He immediately decided to search for and raid an Eight-Armed Tribe supply station instead.</p><p></p><p>They really did find one after two months of searching.</p><p></p><p>The reason they could find the Eight-Armed Tribe's supply station was not because of sheer luck, but rather the Eight-Armed Tribe's forces were too vast - they had various bases present across many star systems and asteroid belts throughout the entire 'Cloud Ring'.</p><p></p><p>One could say that excluding the Devourer Worms, the Eight-Armed Tribe was the ruler of the Cloud Ring, while humans and the Compound Eye Race were just two races struggling to survive under their rule.</p><p></p><p>Aside from carefully hiding themselves, there was no other way. If their homeworld's location was exposed, it would mean extinction was near.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another possibility - that one day in the future, a breakthrough in human scientific research would allow them to surpass the Eight-Armed Tribe and defeat them...</p><p></p><p>Most humans were pessimistic about this in their hearts, they did not have much hope for humanity's future, only striving their utmost to fight for a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>There were also a small number who insisted 'humanity will prevail' no matter what, believing that a miracle would eventually occur.</p><p></p><p>In the Voyager's command center gathered the captain, Major Jiang, some department heads, the three members of Squad 405, as well as squad leaders receiving this mission.</p><p></p><p>The head of the tactical deployment department, Major Ji, was providing a detailed analysis of the key points for this operation to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Our objective is very clear: take down the supply station and loot all its resources.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this goal, we need to understand the 'actual situation', 'our forces', and 'conditions to be met'.</p><p></p><p>First, the actual situation is that the Voyager's position has been under their monitoring the entire time, without shaking off pursuit. In other words, when we approach the supply station, the Eight-Armed Tribe will definitely know.  </p><p></p><p>It's not hard to guess that they will definitely dispatch a fleet to support and encircle us as soon as possible. The time they leave for us to operate will not exceed five days, or even shorter.</p><p></p><p>In other words, from taking down the supply station to looting it clean, then leaving the planet and entering space again, we have at most five days, possibly even less time.</p><p></p><p>Because once the time drags on, we may run straight into the reinforcement fleet that just arrived."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Major Ji couldn't help glancing at Suhao: "Based on the current situation, perhaps we don't need to be afraid even if we do run into their fleet?"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Suhao's abilities gave everyone tremendous confidence.</p><p></p><p>Major Ji continued: "In order to delay the Eight-Armed Tribe's detection of our target for as long as possible, our upcoming advance route needs to be carefully designed to deceive the Eight-Armed Tribe. Then we'll land on the planet from the direction opposite the supply station and dispatch an armored squad for a lightning raid to quickly take it down!"</p><p></p><p>He joked unusually: "After all, we all know that although the Eight-Armed Tribe is highly intelligent, they're quite gullible."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Everyone couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Suhao had no idea what they were laughing about...</p><p></p><p>After analyzing various possible contingencies and solutions, as well as assigning specific tasks to each squad, Major Ji directly addressed Major Jiang: "Major Jiang, just like last time, you will personally lead the raid team."</p><p></p><p>Major Jiang: "Got it! It'll be a sure success."</p><p></p><p>In his view, with the powerful weapon that was Suhao, how could they possibly fail? He might as well shoot himself if they did.</p><p></p><p>The operation plan was thus determined.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Another twenty days passed, and the Voyager successfully landed on the planet from the far side, then stealthily approached the supply station close to the ground.</p><p></p><p>At a distance of about 1,000 kilometers from the supply station, it stopped and opened the hatch.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the armored soldiers then jumped out of the ship one after another.</p><p></p><p>This raid on the supply station was different from the previous one - this time they did not split into small squads, but rather formed a company of 200 people surrounding Suhao, then collectively ran towards the supply station.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Eight-Armed Tribe was completely unaware that humans would attack their supply station.</p><p></p><p>This time, they had received advance notice and undoubtedly made corresponding preparations. Even though it was just a small supply station, their prepared defensive capabilities would be extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>To them, an attack from a human cruiser was simply incapable of breaking through their defenses.</p><p></p><p>However, the Eight-Armed Tribe could never have imagined what exactly they would be facing next.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers' armor performance was exceptional, allowing them to run at full speed up to 200 km/h on the planet's surface.</p><p></p><p>The supply station 1,000 km away was not too distant for them. After running for over four hours, the soldier company gradually came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Major Jiang came up to Suhao and asked, "Xu Shiqiang, we're still 50 km away from the supply station here, is this distance okay?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "It's fine!"</p><p></p><p>Then everyone spread out and took up distant sentry positions. Suhao took off a specially made energy cannon slung across his back and slowly aimed it towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this, everyone held their breath and stared intently at the cannon's muzzle, their hearts gradually pounding: "It's starting! The invincible 'hundred shots, hundred hits' of the hero Xu Shiqiang!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a faint smile appeared on the corner of Suhao's mouth.</p><p></p><p>This supply station was somewhat larger than the previous one, with over 1,200 Eight-Armed Tribe members present.</p><p></p><p>To Suhao, they were all precious test subjects, all wealth!</p><p></p><p>But it was impossible to simply shoot and kill all these Eight-Armed Tribe members!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he opened fire!</p><p></p><p>'Pew pew pew'!</p><p></p><p>However, these energy blasts he fired were all displaced by Suhao to other locations, not causing any harm to the Eight-Armed Tribe.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Suhao continuously sent spatial modules to the Eight-Armed Tribe, connecting to the space of the Small World Cage, directly relocating them regardless of whether their bodies could withstand the spatial pressure.</p><p></p><p>Within the supply station's core sphere that the soldiers could not see, one Eight-Armed Tribe member after another disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Eight-Armed Tribe members: "???"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 821</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Faced with the vile insults around them, the two deities' way of handling it was very simple - to make everyone shut up forever.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't quite understand what had happened in that fleeting moment, it didn't stop them from casually clearing away the vile insults ringing in their ears.</p><p></p><p>The God of Eternal Night - Yongshi hadn't made a move yet, but the Golden God - Bali had already taken action first.</p><p></p><p>'Golden Tide!'</p><p></p><p>It was foreseeable that in the next second, all the pirates in front would turn into scattered limbs, thereby shutting those foul mouths.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>However, the scene that the Golden God - Bali and the God of Eternal Night - Yongshi had envisioned did not occur. All the arc-shaped air blades shot out, but dissipated into nothingness after traveling ten meters.</p><p></p><p>No, they didn't dissipate into nothingness, but rather shot out from behind them instead.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Bali raised his brows slightly, his body flickering with a golden glow, deflecting all the golden arc blades shooting at him from behind.</p><p></p><p>The attack he had launched forward actually attacked him from behind? This was a scenario he had never imagined.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi was also very curious. She extended her slender hand towards the pirate who had said "Smile for me, darling."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk!"</p><p></p><p>A dark purple beam appeared at the tip of her finger.</p><p></p><p>However, the soul technique that could originally pierce through heaven and earth vanished at ten meters, and in an instant, an identical purple beam came at her from behind, striking her back.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Yet the purple beam that struck her back did not cause her any harm.</p><p></p><p>The pirate she had aimed at was so frightened that he stepped back twice, but was still very much alive and well, looking at her as if she was a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha? This woman has quite the temper, but I like that, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"The newcomers are always like this, thinking they're invincible at first, acting all arrogant. But in the end, don't they all become as obedient as babies?"</p><p></p><p>"Do they think this is some kind of place? Ahahaha! This is the Creator God's absolute domain."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, what I love most is seeing their helpless and shocked expressions. It's so amusing."</p><p></p><p>"It's worth it to see such a beautiful lady get angry."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, how is this ability to launch the same attack from the opposite direction achieved? It's simply too miraculous."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Yongshi's brows gradually furrowed as she walked forward slowly. When she reached ten meters away, she stretched out her hand to feel ahead.</p><p></p><p>It was as if she touched a barrier, yet it also felt like there was nothing there. She pushed forward forcefully, breaking through that strange barrier, and felt an immense invisible pressure squeezing her entire arm.</p><p></p><p>She turned her head to look back and saw that her arm was actually protruding from her back.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi's usually calm eyes widened slightly: "What is... this?"</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely peculiar sensation that she had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Unable to resist her curiosity, she walked forward with her whole body, and then emerged from the opposite side.</p><p></p><p>Bali found it interesting and tried it from another direction, emerging from the opposite side as well.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this was an infinite world that one could walk endlessly forward in, yet it also seemed that this infinite world was only thirty-four meters in size.</p><p></p><p>He wondered curiously: "What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi shook her head: "I don't know, I've never seen anything like this before."</p><p></p><p>The two of them explored the isolated space of this small world, and discovered that no matter which direction they walked, they would emerge from the opposite side, unable to find an exit or disrupt the structure here.</p><p></p><p>In summary, they were trapped in a bizarre cyclical space, with no way out.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the other places where pirates were imprisoned, it was the same - this place was like a prison world divided into separate sections.</p><p></p><p>Bali's mouth twitched: "I told you I didn't want to come with you, but you insisted on dragging me along. Now look what's happened, we've fallen into a trap. This might be even worse than the previous two times my mind got directly blasted.</p><p></p><p>We must have been detected by the Hidden God. And I've observed that these messy people around us are the pirates who previously went missing on the Heavenly Channel. In other words, we've been captured just like those filthy pirates.</p><p></p><p>Hey, this is really bad. Next time I absolutely won't listen to you. When you called me over, I had a vague feeling that something was off."</p><p></p><p>If only Yongshi had fallen into the trap, Bali would have felt quite balanced and comfortable. But since he was also trapped, he didn't feel so happy about it.</p><p></p><p>Bali continued: "And have you noticed, we've lost contact with our main bodies now. In my long life, this has never happened before. This place is definitely not ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi nodded: "I've also lost contact with my main body. This is the first time I've known that a separated consciousness could become independent from the main body."</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it sent chills down her spine.</p><p></p><p>Originally it was one consciousness controlling two bodies, but now the consciousness was forcibly split into two parts, each operating a body independently. What was even more terrifying was that the separated consciousnesses could think independently...</p><p></p><p>She pondered and said: "Let's try all the abilities we can use and see if there's a way to destroy the structure here. You dig underground and see what's below, if there's any chance of escaping from below."</p><p></p><p>Then the two deities exhausted all their means, doing everything from plowing through this small space to no avail. They couldn't even do anything to the pirates surrounding them and watching the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>Bali shrugged: "It seems we've underestimated the Hidden God. I've been killed many times, but this is the first time I've been captured. You tell me what we should do."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi said: "Try separating from our physical bodies and escaping with just our consciousness!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she closed her eyes, and a purple light leapt out from the top of her head, shooting diagonally upwards in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Bali said: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>He also closed his eyes, his consciousness turning into a golden light that flew out and entered the spatial barrier.</p><p></p><p>For the two deities, physical bodies were the least important thing - as long as their sects still existed, they could have as many bodies as they wanted.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they tried to escape their physical shells, they could not break free from this small cyclical world.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the consciousnesses of the two deities returned to their respective bodies. They opened their eyes and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Bali cursed inwardly: "What kind of deity is this? So freakishly bizarre."</p><p></p><p>In the hidden underground palace far away on the vast Zongguang Continent, a beautiful purple-robed girl suddenly opened her eyes full of purple light and murmured softly: "What happened? The connection with my separated consciousness abruptly cut off. Did the Hidden God take action?"</p><p></p><p>On the Heavenly Grasslands, a man suddenly sat up from his bed, rubbing his messy bedhead hair. His heart was unusually startled: "What kind of bizarre deity is this Hidden God? My previous separated consciousness could still escape, but now it's dead without any warning? No, I need to go find Yongshi and ask about the situation."</p><p></p><p>Both deities thought their separated consciousnesses had suddenly died, never imagining they had been trapped in a small world by Su Hao. After all, this was their first time encountering such a situation.</p><p></p><p>They felt a hint of trepidation towards the "Hidden God" whose true form they had never seen.</p><p></p><p>The loss of their separated consciousnesses was a heavy blow to them. To fully recover would take an extremely long time. They both considered this probing attempt a major loss.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After capturing the two deity envoys, Su Hao had been secretly observing their movements from outside the small world. Finally, he murmured with some excitement: "This time I've made a profit. These two deity envoys are much stronger than others, so I should be able to obtain quite a bit of information from them.</p><p></p><p>From their conversation, it seems I've killed them twice before? But it doesn't matter, just trivial little details. After I switch to the [Egg God] avatar, I'll go meet these two."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Hao landed on an uninhabited island with his dragon, and after informing the mother dragon, he flashed into the second-level world to approach a huge red crystal creature.</p><p></p><p>This crystal creature was crouched on the ground, appearing about three meters tall and seven meters long, with wings like a bird, a head and tail like a dragon, and sturdy limbs with sharp spikes growing from the joints, looking sleek yet ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao praised: "Truly an exquisite masterpiece. Let me try out this seemingly exquisite [Egg God] avatar and see how well it performs!"</p><p></p><p>He entered the Pinball Space and activated 'Avatar Control'.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the [Egg God] crouched on the ground suddenly opened its eyes, slowly standing up. He tried taking a few steps, wobbling unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>"Seems a bit unstable. Looks like I need to reintegrate the signals and get used to it first. Let's start with the 'Shapeshifting' ability from [Mimic Human] and turn into a young dragon. As for the other abilities, I can adapt to them after going out."</p>

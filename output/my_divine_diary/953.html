        <h1>Chapter 953</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the eighteen deities obtained the 'teleportation' ability, they excitedly found places to begin cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>With the help of their powerful minds, they quickly mastered this skill. Then without making any plans, they gathered together and showed off their new abilities to each other.</p><p></p><p>They praised each other's teleportation skills in an exaggerated tone, while frantically teleporting in front of each other, hoping for praise.</p><p></p><p>For a while, there were cheers of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang, the shared junior of the eighteen deities, looked on with green eyes, and carefully asked, "Elder brothers, elder sisters, can you teach this junior how to do it?"</p><p></p><p>However, no one paid any attention to him.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding? It took the eighteen deities so much hardship to learn this skill, how could they just give it away because he acted cute?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the deities received a system notification that another group of challengers had completed the final trial, arriving at the Twin Sword City, and each deity was rewarded 5,000 merit points.</p><p></p><p>The deities burst into laughter, complimenting each other.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I almost forgot about those World Wills, this is extra income!"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of us, we've brought out another qualified group of World Wills, double celebration, congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, ever since the lost coins of the Goddess of Fortune came online, I've found these World Wills much easier to guide. I can already see a large amount of merit points beckoning me."</p><p></p><p>The God of Radiance, Yi Dao, said: "Speaking of World Wills, we haven't checked on the situation of the First Lord in a long time, nor have we updated the trial missions.</p><p></p><p>The trial world has changed greatly recently, so the trial missions we wrote before may not be suitable for testing the World Wills anymore.</p><p></p><p>So, fellow deities, we should go back to the Cruciform Star and update the trial missions according to the current situation. Otherwise, if Lord Jia Wei asks about it, we'll have no explanation, and the trust we've built up could completely collapse."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other deities agreed it was true, so they decided to return to the Cruciform Star to reformulate the missions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the God of Order, Red Light, pointed at their junior Cao Shilang and said, "Junior Cao wants to learn, doesn't he? Why don't we teach him how to formulate trial missions? The celestial beings in the Celestial Palace are powerful, but they can't truly experience the strength of the World Wills since they can't go out. But Cao Shilang is different - he has the same body as us and can complete our work..."</p><p></p><p>The other deities' eyes lit up, and they exchanged glances before praising, "Lord Red Light has great foresight!"</p><p></p><p>So there would be someone to take over their work!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they looked at their junior Cao Shilang with much more favor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After receiving the messages sent back from the various construction areas, Cong Shuling personally went to the site to inspect the quality of the project and gather first-hand information.</p><p></p><p>As usual, she soon arrived at the main hall of the Twin Sword City to report progress to Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>"Master, in the areas we're responsible for, all the world passages have been built and tested to operate as expected.</p><p></p><p>Now we just lack some detail work, like concealing the entire world passage, camouflaging the original terrain to restore it to its previous state, and so on.</p><p></p><p>At most it will take ten more years for us to complete everything."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Cong Shuling couldn't help but show an excited expression on her face: "Master, the Infinite Land project is so magnificent. I can't imagine this act of creation being perfected step-by-step. Watching different worlds being connected by our own hands, forming an infinitely vast land, a huge boundless ocean, and a sky that can't be flown to the end, the excitement is indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Now that we're approaching the opening of the world passages, I still feel like I'm in a dream. Not just me, but all the disciples participating in this project are filled with passion.</p><p></p><p>They don't even need much supervision from me, they can handle every detail to perfection. To be able to participate in such a great undertaking is truly without regret."</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the head seat, Feng Cheng opened his eyes and laughed: "Without regret? Don't you want to see how this Infinite Land will grow in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Don't you look forward to what the Infinite Land you helped build will become after thousands or tens of thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling smiled embarrassedly: "Of course I look forward to it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at Cong Shuling and shook his head slightly: "The Infinite Land and Infinite Ocean you see is actually not truly infinite. Very few people understand the meaning of the words 'Infinite Land' in Lord Wei's vision.</p><p></p><p>It represents infinite possibilities and infinite exploration in the future. The Infinite Land you see now is just an initial rudimentary form.</p><p></p><p>However vast the universe is, this land will be that vast, because in the future we will continuously explore outwards from the universe.</p><p></p><p>In the process of exploration, any life-bearing planets we encounter, or any planets with the potential for life, will all be connected to this Infinite Land.</p><p></p><p>That is true infinity! In the distant future, when you travel via Stardust Flight for hundreds or thousands of years without reaching the end of this land, then the Infinite Land will have taken some shape."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling's eyes went wide, stunned by Feng Cheng's words.</p><p></p><p>Unable to reach the end of the land even by traveling at light speed for ten thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Just how vast is this land...</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind, her current Stardust Flight could reach four hundred times the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but murmur: "Will we really be able to find that many life-bearing planets?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said: "What's so difficult about that? As long as we follow the passage of time and never stop exploring, one day we will reach that level."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling asked: "But Master, will we be able to live that long?"</p><p></p><p>She had not yet gained knowledge about soul brains, so she didn't know if she could live that long.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng shook his head: "I don't know, I don't know how long I can live either, but what does it matter? We'll explore for as long as we can live, until we completely die and fall into nothingness."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng looked at Cong Shuling and suddenly smiled: "Shuling, don't worry too much about the future. I'm your master, so naturally I won't let you die easily. Just boldly go out and explore.</p><p></p><p>The Twin Sword Sect doesn't have enough roaming cultivators yet. We need more to join us in completing this infinite undertaking. As the senior martial sister, you need to put in more effort to guide the junior disciples to strive towards our common goal."</p><p></p><p>Cong Shuling said passionately: "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Demon King Chi Pu rushed in from outside. His voice could be heard from afar: "Master, Senior Sister, you really made me search for you. Haha, I've finally caught up with you."</p><p></p><p>Whenever the Great Demon King Chi Pu came to find Feng Cheng, Feng Cheng would quickly teleport away. This time, while envisioning the beautiful future, he was caught off guard by Chi Pu.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng cleared his throat: "Ah, it's Chi Pu. What brings you here to see me?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chi Pu put away his joyful smile and became very serious: "Master, following your mission requirements, after many years of effort I have finally completed the assembly line for the 'Dimension Traverser' and even exceeded expectations by crafting it into an exquisite and stable high-end product. Any disciple who meets certain requirements can use the Dimension Traverser I made to freely roam the depths of the universe.</p><p></p><p>This time, I've come to officially submit the mission to you and express that I have thoroughly and even exceedingly completed the task you assigned me.</p><p></p><p>Please accept it, Master."</p><p></p><p>Both Feng Cheng and Cong Shuling knew that Chi Pu the Great Demon King didn't want to do this job anymore, but they didn't expect his mouth to be so slick, just saying he was submitting the mission!</p><p></p><p>The way he phrased not wanting to do it anymore sounded so matter-of-fact, it was impressive.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed: "Chi Pu, you've done well. It really was hard work for you all these years. I've heard Shuling constantly praising how beautifully you've been working, so there's no need for an inspection. I trust your abilities. However, such a large Dimension Traverser factory still needs someone to oversee it. Among my disciples, I don't feel reassured leaving it to anyone but you!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chi Pu immediately said: "Rest assured, Master, I've already prepared for this. I've trained five exceptionally capable assistants for the Traverser factory over the years. They've been working hard and keeping things running smoothly. With them there, the Traverser factory will only get better and better."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Chi Pu sent a message to Ji Ding and the other four: "Hurry up and come take over your positions as factory overseers."</p><p></p><p>Ji Ding and the other four had no choice but to transmit over. They entered the main hall and bowed to Feng Cheng: "Greetings, Master."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng actually didn't want Chi Pu the Great Demon King causing chaos for the World Passage project, so he had been trying to brush him off. But things had reached this point, so it seemed Chi Pu would have to take over.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng asked: "Chi Pu, since you don't want to be the factory overseer anymore, what would you like to do instead?</p><p></p><p>To be honest, I've always felt you have a talent for being a factory overseer.</p><p></p><p>I was even planning to have you manage all the various factories we'll build in the future.</p><p></p><p>If you don't do this, it would really be a waste of your skills and abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chi Pu shook his head joyfully: "My other talents surpass even this. You'll find out slowly, Master. As for what I want to do, of course it's to join Shuling and the others in working on the great Infinite Land project!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Cong Shuling said softly: "Chi Pu, the Infinite Land project has already been completed."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chi Pu instantly turned to stone: "What...what? It's completed before I could participate?"</p>

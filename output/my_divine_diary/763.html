        <h1>Chapter 763</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Importing consciousness information into the brain, Suhao had already become very proficient. Even with his eyes closed, he could complete this task.</p><p></p><p>However, importing consciousness into a brain made of spiritual power was the first time.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the spiritual power brain created by Suhao should be able to support the operation and thinking of consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>But theory is theory, what the actual situation would be, Suhao had to try it himself.</p><p></p><p>Conveniently, he had plenty of experimental subjects to support him in completing various experiments.</p><p></p><p>If not enough, he could ask the captain for more.</p><p></p><p>Now, as long as he spoke, the captain would help him without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Give people to people, give things to things, very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>First, Suhao transplanted the golden-glowing spiritual power brain into a fresh body, completing the connections of all nerves.</p><p></p><p>Then, through the elastic ball space, he input various command signals into the brain to verify whether the bridging was successful.</p><p></p><p>He saw a body without consciousness or soul stand up and move a few steps under Suhao's control in the small black room, and then open its mouth to say: "What is love in this world..."</p><p></p><p>This showed that the neural signal bridging between the spiritual power brain and the body was successful.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought inwardly: "Neural connection verification successful, but this kind of body has major flaws, at most two days, it will decay and die due to various hormonal imbalances.</p><p></p><p>However, what I want to verify is only whether consciousness information can think relying on the spiritual power brain, the body problem can be solved later.</p><p></p><p>So, the next step is to import consciousness information and try to activate consciousness."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand and pressed it on the head of the body on the experimental table, mobilizing the consciousness information in the elastic ball space, using the body as a bridge to import the consciousness information into the spiritual power brain.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Suhao released his hand and murmured: "The consciousness was bounced back, without any trace of fusion, it seems the consciousness and brain are not compatible. But, I happen to have a way to force a match."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he installed an 'automatic consciousness information recognition and matching mechanism' for this consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try again!"</p><p></p><p>"The consciousness successfully took residence in the spiritual power brain! But the consciousness information shows no signs of movement. Perhaps it's related to the matching with the 'movement spiritual particles'. Let me adjust it a bit..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the Eight-Armed Race was annihilated, humans had changed their name to the 'Cloud Ring System Human Sacred Alliance', worshipping three 'Sacred Ones' - Xu Shiqiang, Jia Yashan, and Jia Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>They had also ushered in a magnificent era of stellar migration.</p><p></p><p>As long as one was daring enough, as long as one was willing to risk their life wandering the universe, there was a great chance to obtain a large tract of land on a colony planet!</p><p></p><p>That was land, something so many people dreamed of. Compared to land, what was wandering the universe?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the transmission formations, the distance to the mother planet Blue Light was just a transmission away, essentially not that far. As long as one wished, one could return to the mother planet at any time.</p><p></p><p>Thus, many people who saw hope in the future flocked out, each heading towards the colony planets around the center of the universe.</p><p></p><p>As time passed year by year, countless love and hatred stories, struggles for power played out on the various planets in the Cloud Ring System. Each person's brilliant life could be written into an adventure tale of laughter and tears.</p><p></p><p>The titles of the 'Three Sacred Ones' and their massive statues were established on colony planet after colony planet, revered by humans for eternity...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only the beautiful wish of humans, hoping to forever remember the great deeds of the Three Sacred Ones.</p><p></p><p>But as time flowed by, those who revered Suhao and the other two faded away, while the ignorant new generation of humans grew up to become the mainstream of society.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, Suhao and the other two, having not appeared before humans for a long time, were slowly forgotten.</p><p></p><p>No matter how widespread their exploits were told, no matter how many statues of the three were everywhere, no matter that they were written into human history books...</p><p></p><p>However formidable a figure was, once they left people's lives, they would naturally be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>After all, what everyone cared about was always their current life.</p><p></p><p>There were even people who equated the strongest super-ability holder Yonghwa, who had resigned as a researcher to join the migration wave, with Suhao and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Yonghwa's childhood dream was to wander and explore all over the universe, to witness the scenery of different planets, never expecting it to be realized so inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she became the publicly acknowledged strongest super-ability holder in the 'Human Sacred Alliance', with immense fame.</p><p></p><p>But Yonghwa deeply knew her own abilities were incomparable to her great-uncles...</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful her great-uncles were, it was impossible to fathom.</p><p></p><p>No matter how she explained, those infatuated with her only thought she was being modest. One day she suddenly realized: when the gap was so great that the human brain could not imagine it, too much explanation was actually useless.</p><p></p><p>It was better to remain silent.</p><p></p><p>But hatefully, those people actually said she had admitted it...</p><p></p><p>Explaining was out of modesty, not explaining was admitting.</p><p></p><p>Human words were fearsome, the human heart was fearsome!</p><p></p><p>Many people inadvertently fell into the mire of corruption, filled with yearning for planets, land, and wealth, losing the trust to have their backs to Xia Qingjun, losing reverence for the organization's authority.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Xia Qingjun suddenly found that people's hearts had scattered.</p><p></p><p>The expansion was too rapid.</p><p></p><p>The current scene that appeared prosperous was only because the wealth left behind by the Eight-Armed Race was abundant enough to conceal the hidden conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun could foresee that if the human civilization expanded along this trend, with various interest groups growing stronger, the Human Sacred Alliance would inevitably split apart.</p><p></p><p>There would never be a lack of ambitious schemers among humans.</p><p></p><p>If this problem was not handled, perhaps future interstellar wars would be internal wars among humans.</p><p></p><p>This was something Xia Qingjun did not want to see.</p><p></p><p>He pondered deeply and finally thought of Suhao, thinking inwardly: "Perhaps the great one has a way to resolve this problem."</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly realized that at some point, he had lost track of Suhao and the other two.</p><p></p><p>He could not find them.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun: "???"</p><p></p><p>His heart felt empty, as if he had lost his audacious reliance, with all the pressure suddenly bearing down on him.</p><p></p><p>After searching in vain, he reproached himself inwardly: "I really was foolish, why did I only think of the great one when I needed him? I should have kept in touch more often."</p><p></p><p>"I must have been a foolish human leader!"</p><p></p><p>Actually, it was not his fault, he had always known that Suhao disliked being disturbed, so he deliberately avoided disturbing him too much, and deep down he believed that he represented human interests, while Suhao would side with him...</p><p></p><p>Turned out he had thought too much.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xia Qingjun stood up and thought: "Doesn't the great one still have that genius niece called Hua Yonghwa? Perhaps she can find the great one and the others."</p><p></p><p>However, when he met Yonghwa, she also looked dejected and said: "Alas, I can't find my great-uncles either! Over a hundred years ago, I encountered Brother Yashan on a planet by chance, even mistaking him for a troublemaker to be taught a lesson for not knowing his place...</p><p></p><p>Little did I know, that was the last time I saw Brother Yashan. As for my great-uncle, I haven't seen him for a very, very long time..."</p><p></p><p>Yonghwa gazed at the starry sky, her eyes vacant, murmuring softly: "Great-uncle, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qingjun felt a dull ache in his head, he reached out and pressed his brow: "In the end, I still have to rely on myself!"</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, he quickly settled on a plan: Whoever controlled the 'Planet of Earth Gods' would have the ability to monitor the entire Cloud Ring System, would have absolute control.</p><p></p><p>So, in order to ensure the absolute authority of the Human Sacred Alliance, he would move the headquarters of the 'Human Sacred Alliance' to the Planet of Earth Gods! Whoever caused trouble, deal with them first!</p><p></p><p>However, what Xia Qingjun did not expect was that it was precisely this move that accelerated the split among humans...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It was also at this time that Suhao concluded his research. </p><p></p><p>Inexplicably thinking of the more distant future, he sent a message in the group: "Yashan, Fengcheng, let's each dispatch a分身 (not sure if this is a special term), heading towards the 'Coiled Snake System' 400 million light-years away. Traveling at the speed of starlight, it will take about 1,500 years to arrive. Perhaps in the 'Coiled Snake System', we will make some discoveries."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng were both stunned: "The Coiled Snake System?"</p>

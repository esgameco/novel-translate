        <h1>Chapter 822</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the matter of adjusting the signal to control his avatar, Su Hao had a lot of experience, so he acted very quickly. He basically completed it before the mother dragon took off again for the next island.</p><p></p><p>Mimicry!</p><p></p><p>It looked exactly the same as Su Hao's original body in this world, even the aura and scent it gave off were identical.</p><p></p><p>After carefully checking that the mimicry was flawless, he sent it over to be beside the mother dragon Shaluo.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, Su Hao was overjoyed: "The fluctuation has disappeared again, ensuring my safety. I no longer need to worry about that inexplicable danger suddenly appearing."</p><p></p><p>When the mother dragon Shaluo saw Su Hao appear, she looked worried and said, "Lei'an, my child, where have you been this time? This is the first time you've been away for so long."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao swaggered past the mother dragon Shaluo and the other two young dragons, even deliberately circling them twice. Seeing they didn't notice anything amiss, he smiled happily and said, "Mother Shaluo, I was just in the 'bullseye' channel! Don't worry, as long as I stay in the channel, no one can find me."</p><p></p><p>When the eldest young dragon Chipu saw Su Hao appear, he came over curiously and asked, "Third brother, how did you suddenly disappear and then suddenly reappear? Why can't I do that?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was in a good mood and reached out his paw to pat Chipu's head, saying, "You're still too young, it's normal you can't do it yet. Maybe you'll be able to when you grow up?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the second sister Moli also stretched her head towards Su Hao and said, "Third brother, pat my head too."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao generously reached out his other paw and patted Moli's head.</p><p></p><p>The two young dragons excitedly flew around, though they didn't know why they were so excited, only feeling that their third brother had become more affectionate today.</p><p></p><p>The mother dragon Shaluo said, "Children, let's set off again! After one more island, we'll be back home. This journey has been much smoother than I expected, thanks to Lei'an's help. Lei'an Oakes, my child, you are destined to become a crimson golden dragon, second only to the gods."</p><p></p><p>She lowered her body and said, "Hop on! I'm taking off."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the mother dragon Shaluo flew away carrying the three young dragons.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Hao, after getting used to some basic skills by controlling the Egg God, he flashed into the small world where the experimental subjects were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did was go before the two 'divine envoys' he had captured. He was extremely curious about the 'divine envoys' and couldn't wait to understand the secret of their immortality.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this young dragon appeared, it immediately drew the attention and wariness of Yongshi and Bali, who stared at the suddenly appearing young dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't rush to kill the young dragon in front of them. Previously, no matter what they tried, they couldn't do anything about the strange barrier around them, instinctively extinguishing any thoughts of using force to resist.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had fallen into the hands of the Hidden God, their specific situation was still unclear, so they needed to be cautious about everything.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the two didn't intend to attack right away, Su Hao smiled slightly and formally introduced himself in the human language: "Let me introduce myself first, you can call me Javier. As you've guessed, this is my world, and the reason you've come here is because I have some doubts that need to be resolved, and as the top figures in the world, you two divine envoys should be able to resolve my doubts.</p><p></p><p>So, I invited you here without your consent. If the hospitality is lacking, I can only apologize."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao casually waved his paw.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, earth-shattering changes occurred here. Simple pavilions, tables and chairs rose up, with water and food placed on the stone table.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao casually pointed to an exquisite pavilion and said, "If you don't mind, let's sit inside and talk."</p><p></p><p>The Night God Yongshi and the Golden God Bali were greatly shaken in their hearts. This scene before them was still quite shocking, even for the two gods.</p><p></p><p>They had seen this young dragon before...</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this one of the three young dragons that had been lying on the back of the crimson golden dragon?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the so-called 'Hidden God' they had been guessing about and searching for was this little thing in front of them?</p><p></p><p>It was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>Even if some expert used 'soul rebirth' to transfer their body into a young dragon, they would still need a few years to integrate before regaining some power.</p><p></p><p>For such a tiny young dragon to possess such powerful and bizarre abilities, it was simply impossible from their perspective.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from their perception, this young dragon didn't have the slightest bit of soul power, which was very strange and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>The two gods were extremely puzzled, racking their brains to find a reasonable explanation. They thought to themselves, "Could this young dragon just be an avatar of the Hidden God? To even turn his own child into an avatar, this new god must be utterly heartless and deranged."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali's thoughts raced as they exchanged a glance. They both calmed their minds and followed Su Hao into the pavilion towards the round table.</p><p></p><p>They had many doubts in their hearts, so since they had a chance to communicate, they were happy to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Kaka ka~"</p><p></p><p>As Su Hao walked, his young dragon body was gradually enveloped in pink crystal, transforming into a human form. Afterwards, the pink crystal receded, revealing a simply dressed human figure.</p><p></p><p>It was the appearance of the previous life's Xu Shiqiang.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali were stunned to see this scene.</p><p></p><p>Bali asked doubtfully, "Are you... the Salvation God - Baishen?"</p><p></p><p>After asking, he shook his head, eliminating this possibility. If the Salvation God Baishen possessed such a bizarre space prison ability, then they other gods wouldn't need to bother anymore.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the strange and thin-looking man in front shook his head and said, "Baishen? No, I'm not any of the gods you know. Please, have a seat!"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali sat down obediently, without any restraint.</p><p></p><p>To the two gods, this was just an avatar, and even if it was destroyed, it wouldn't have much impact on the main body at most, it would just slowly recover over a few years.</p><p></p><p>And for gods who had experienced tens of thousands of years, there was no longer such a word as 'restraint' in this world.</p><p></p><p>After sitting down, Bali directly asked the question on his mind: "Lord Javier, since you are not any of the gods we know, can we assume that you are the nineteenth new god, apart from the eighteen gods?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed lightly, "As for the concept of gods, it's not easy to define, but you can think of me as a god separate from the eighteen gods.</p><p></p><p>Before we officially converse, shouldn't you introduce yourselves first?"</p><p></p><p>Yongshi was the main god, and Bali was the deputy god, so at this point, Bali needed to introduce his nominal superior.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yongshi nod in agreement, Bali formally introduced himself to Su Hao: "This is the chief god of the human race on the Zongguang Continent, the Night God Yongshi. I am the deputy of the Night God Yongshi, the Golden God Bali."</p><p></p><p>After Bali finished speaking, Yongshi said, "Lord Javier, you can just call me Yongshi."</p><p></p><p>"???" Su Hao was momentarily stunned and asked uncertainly, "You said you two are among the eighteen gods? One is the Night God and one is the Golden God?"</p><p></p><p>He had originally only wanted to capture two 'divine envoys' to ask some questions, obtain some information about the gods, conduct some simple experiments, and get an early understanding of the gods' abilities. He didn't expect to randomly capture two gods instead...</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali thought Su Hao had already recognized them, but unexpectedly he still didn't know who they were.</p><p></p><p>Yongshi nodded, "That's correct."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's eyes lit up, looking very pleasantly surprised, "If that's truly the case, I thought you two were just divine envoys. I didn't expect you to actually be gods."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali looked extremely speechless. In this Lord Javier's eyes, did he really see them as so insignificant that he put them on the same level as those servants?</p><p></p><p>It was simply unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao casually waved his hand, and Big Beard Xibo, Weiya, and the other members of the Fugold Squad appeared beside them.</p><p></p><p>They had been sweating profusely from training when suddenly they were transported to an unfamiliar pavilion. They froze in place, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Soon they saw the three people sitting to the side.</p><p></p><p>A thin young man with black hair and black eyes, an extremely beautiful woman with long black hair, and a strong man with golden curly hair and green eyes...</p><p></p><p>The moment they saw Bali, Big Beard Xibo and the others were shaken to their core, an immense sense of dread descending upon their hearts as they immediately recognized the identity of the person before them.</p><p></p><p>This was none other than the god they worshipped, the Golden God Bali.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard Xibo and the others immediately knelt down in a flurry, lowering their heads as they cried out, "Greetings to the revered Golden God Bali!"</p><p></p><p>Before Bali could react, Su Hao casually waved his hand, sending Big Beard Xibo and the others back.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then roared with laughter, "Confirmed, you really are gods! Hahaha, what great luck I have."</p><p></p><p>Yongshi and Bali: "......"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 548</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao could no longer remember how many bases he had built or destroyed in the past. He had become accustomed to relocating bases. Everything he currently saw was considered 'external'. As long as a place looked comfortable and was away from populated areas, he felt it could become a new base. Ya Shan and Feng Cheng felt the same way, not seeing anything wrong with wandering from place to place. As for the usual concept of 'home'...they had long been without a real home.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity about all those machines we had finally built, we'll have to go without enhancing medicine for a while," Feng Cheng kept sighing.</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan smiled, "I have some connections at the Changqing Factory, getting a new set of equipment won't be a big problem, it'll just take some time. Can't be helped when something like this happens, we'll just have to wait."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Ya Shan passed a positioning stone to Xu Hao, saying "Old Master Wei, I'll go place an order at the Changqing Factory now. After confirming the location, I'll teleport back. This will save some time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao took the positioning stone, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan turned to instruct Feng Cheng, "Feng Cheng, do you still remember the 'Large Base Construction Technique' I taught you before? This time building a new base will be your chance to perform."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng excitedly replied, "Yes, Big Brother Ya Shan, you can rest assured. I'll even make your bed bigger and wider!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan laughed and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao and Feng Cheng immediately flew in another direction. Feng Cheng curiously asked, "Old Master Wei, where are we going to build the new base?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao said, "Let's find an overseas island!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to other places, islands seemed quieter. No matter what experiments were conducted, there would be no need to worry. Most importantly, he could teleport freely, so distance was not an issue no matter where the base was located.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's eyes lit up, "An island, I like that."</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Xu Hao and Feng Cheng found an uninhabited small island overseas with a maximum diameter of 30 kilometers. They decided to make this their new experimental base, casually naming it Hulu Island because of its gourd-like shape.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng rolled up his sleeves and showed off his 'Large Base Construction Technique' in front of Old Master Wei, earning his satisfactory praise. He then happily flew to a nearby coastal city to purchase supplies.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, in addition to being responsible for Old Master Wei and Old Master Ya Shan's daily needs, he also had to cultivate and care for various spiritual herbs. His days were very busy but fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was settled, Xu Hao took out the newly acquired 'Processing Knife' artifact and carefully examined it on the experiment table.</p><p></p><p>Artifacts looked no different from ordinary objects, but the feeling emanating from them was vastly different, as if they radiated a kind of fluctuation that wanted to influence surrounding things.</p><p></p><p>This artifact was very dangerous, but its level of danger was still within Xu Hao's tolerance, so he planned to study its function during this period.</p><p></p><p>It was said that artifacts would inherit some abilities from anomalous disasters.</p><p></p><p>As for the direction of research, he already had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>"Kaka ka!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Hao's figure swelled, encased in a set of smooth and powerful armor. Golden armor surged under his feet, rapidly spreading outward and turning the area within a thousand meters into crystal clear crystal.</p><p></p><p>The transforming armor next to Xu Hao surged and protruded, quickly forming a humanoid shape. The crystal humanoid raised its arms and fingers, shaping them like real human hands.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his creation with satisfaction, smiling as he teleported 500 meters away, still within the range of the transforming armor.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would control the dummy to operate the 'Processing Knife' artifact for experiments.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of his golden armor domain, he could conduct any experiment. Most importantly, being 500 meters away from the artifact now provided great safety assurance.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to manipulate the dummy to pick up the artifact and operate it randomly to try triggering its function.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xu Hao reached a conclusion - no!</p><p></p><p>The artifact input was successful, the 'Processing Knife' lit up as if activated, but nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>The third step was to create more dummies around the artifact, then have them run around to try activating it.</p><p></p><p>The conclusion - no!</p><p></p><p>The fourth step was to control the dummy to rotate the artifact in its hand, simulating a processing scenario.</p><p></p><p>Then the surrounding running dummies were attacked and shattered on the ground. The arm rotating the 'Processing Knife', being in motion, was also attacked to some degree. The conclusion - it did not distinguish between friend or foe!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Hao's mouth curved up slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a series of further experiments, Xu Hao finally grasped the usage of this artifact: "Got it! However, compared to anomalous disasters, this artifact lacks the 'static disaster' effect and only retains the 'dynamic disaster' effect. Not only has the attack power weakened considerably, but the affected range has also decreased to 50 meters."</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Hao did not crave the power it brought, no matter how destructive. </p><p></p><p>What he cared about was that by mastering the artifact, he had grasped the 'source' to a certain degree!</p><p></p><p>Studying the artifact could be considered studying prerequisite knowledge of the 'source'.</p><p></p><p>"But before recording the artifact, let me continue some other experiments, such as whether my blood energy can activate the artifact."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Hao eagerly infused his blood energy into the artifact.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xu Hao felt a slight disappointment: "As expected, it doesn't work?"</p><p></p><p>This was actually within Xu Hao's expectations. It would be abnormal if his blood energy could activate the artifact, right? If his blood energy could activate it, the amount of information contained within would be inconceivably vast!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Hao's expression froze slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No, wait! There's a reaction!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about anything else and instantly flashed next to the artifact, eyes wide as he stared at the 'Processing Knife' firmly held by the dummy's hand.</p><p></p><p>He saw a faint glow flickering on the blade, so dim that it was unnoticeable without careful observation. As Xu Hao's blood energy continued infusing, the faint glow showed a trend of growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao's eyes were filled with pleasant surprise: "My blood energy can actually activate the artifact...why?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately entered the Bouncing Realm and retrieved the information on the blood energy he had just infused to probe, looking at what changes had occurred to that portion infused into the artifact.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xu Hao exited the Bouncing Realm and murmured, "The vast majority of the blood energy showed no reaction, but an extremely small amount directly disintegrated and disappeared. In other words, the artifact's reaction is related to this disintegrated portion of blood energy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao pondered, then suddenly increased his blood energy output to saturate the artifact, continuously recording its information in the Bouncing Realm.</p><p></p><p>A full minute later, Xu Hao cut off the blood energy and entered the Bouncing Realm to check the information. After a long while, he exited and muttered, "It seems the artifact is continuously emitting a special force field that irradiated my blood energy over time, causing an extremely small portion to undergo some change and disappear, to the point where I couldn't even detect what it turned into."</p><p></p><p>Turned into what?</p><p></p><p>He had a vague guess: it turned into the 'source'!</p><p></p><p>It could be understood this way: under special irradiation, his blood energy had a small probability of transforming into the extremely peculiar 'source', and this small amount of source then activated the artifact.</p><p></p><p>That was what Xu Hao saw - after infusing blood energy for a period, the artifact gave off a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, then he could draw a conclusion that even shocked himself: blood energy could be transformed into the source!</p><p></p><p>The blood energy within him was something he had painstakingly refined bit by bit, completely under his conscious control. He was extremely familiar with what his blood energy was like, so how could it possibly transform into the enigmatic 'source'?</p><p></p><p>But if his blood energy really could become the source...</p>

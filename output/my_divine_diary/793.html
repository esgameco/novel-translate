        <h1>Chapter 793</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was actually quite simple, just have Yashan or Fengcheng take action...</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is that Suhao is willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he would rather reincarnate than attempt this.</p><p></p><p>As for using spiritual power to gradually replace his brain bit by bit with a spiritual brain every day, is that possible?</p><p></p><p>That definitely would not work.</p><p></p><p>The core structures of the physical brain and spiritual brain are different, and the signal transmission particles are also different. The seemingly obvious method is fundamentally unworkable.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly attempting it might negatively impact his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness is the core of Suhao's core. He is unwilling to try anything that introduces uncertainty to his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought of a seemingly viable method: an "automatic brain transplant program."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, Suhao would set up an automated program. After his death, Xiaolight would be fully responsible for transferring his consciousness into another prepared body to complete the reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>This process requires three things: an automated program controlled by Xiaollight, a body for Suhao to reincarnate into, and a body with its consciousness recorded in the pinball space to serve as a bridge for consciousness transfer.</p><p></p><p>No sooner said than done.</p><p></p><p>Suhao immediately entered the pinball space and, based on his experience of transferring consciousness, began writing the corresponding automated program.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he acquired two bodies of intelligent species and repeatedly collected data on the consciousness transfer process.</p><p></p><p>Ten years passed like this.</p><p></p><p>In the pinball space, Suhao observed the automated program inputting consciousness information into the body.</p><p></p><p>His brow gradually furrowed: "The failure rate is too high. Is this method really not feasible?"</p><p></p><p>This was different from naturally transferring consciousness from the pinball space during reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to directly entering the brain from the pinball space, the current automated program had to use the body as a positioning bridge to input consciousness information, adding an extra step. With no one constantly monitoring it, it could not adapt to all kinds of changes. A slight mistake could permanently damage the consciousness information.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention permanent damage, Suhao was unwilling to have even a tiny part of his consciousness information missing.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how to repair consciousness information if something went wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try again."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When Suhao appeared in the Cloud Ring System, it caused quite a stir. The sacred name deeply imprinted itself in people's hearts, even causing the interstellar wars between the four major alliances to cease for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Countless people searched everywhere, hoping to find the sacred Xu Shiqiang and become his disciples. Putting other things aside, being able to live over six thousand years alone made everyone flock to him like a swarm of bees.</p><p></p><p>However, to everyone's disappointment, no one could find the sacred Xu Shiqiang. Even the leaders of the five major alliances could hardly meet him.</p><p></p><p>Only Xu Shiqiang sought others out.</p><p></p><p>And as time gradually passed, after the sacred Xu Shiqiang disappeared from the public eye, people slowly forgot about this human sacred being.</p><p></p><p>At least the mainstream of life or gossip no longer revolved around the "sacred" figure.</p><p></p><p>But after the previous sudden appearance of the sacred Xu Shiqiang, everyone reached a consensus - the sacred Xu Shiqiang is the guardian of humanity, immortal and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>They all believed that someday in the future when humanity needs the sacred ones, the sacred ones would definitely appear to help humanity through difficulties.</p><p></p><p>So, the five major alliances officially changed the title of Suhao and the other two to: Sacred Guardians.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Cloud Ring System all believed that Suhao and the other two were immortal, eternal beings.</p><p></p><p>But only they themselves knew that unless something unexpected happened, their time was running out.</p><p></p><p>After Suhao repeatedly tried the consciousness information automatic transfer reincarnation experiment without achieving the desired success rate, he knew that the "unexpected" he had hoped for was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he would leave this place and reincarnate again in the unknown universe.</p><p></p><p>What kind of world would the next one be?</p><p></p><p>Unknown...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Suhao asked himself: Is there anything regrettable about this world?</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he shook his head decisively: No!</p><p></p><p>He briefly took stock and could enumerate his gains in this world:</p><p></p><p>The "energy packing technique" learned from the "Planet Destroyer Cannon", from which he created the intergalactic attack technique "Starlight Breaker";</p><p></p><p>The "Point Breaking Surface Psychic Technique" evolved by humanity after collectively learning superpowers;</p><p></p><p>The method of creating [Divine Eggs] obtained from the mother bug's eggs, making it extremely easy to obtain [Divine] avatars in the future;</p><p></p><p>The "intelligent life identification reincarnation" studied from the various intelligent species in the Cloud Ring System;</p><p></p><p>Encountering the dragon race and obtaining the "spirit grid", which combined with "spirit" later to gain a longer-lived spiritual body;</p><p></p><p>Countless major and minor high-end technologies...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Which of these technologies he obtained was not top-notch?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, Fengcheng sent a message in the group: "Old Master Wei, Old Master Yashan, recently I can't even get excited about beautiful girls anymore. I feel like I'm almost done, maybe not even a hundred years left."</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied: "Same here, but you're too weak! Not even a hundred years left? I feel I can still last five hundred years, haha!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "I also don't think I'll die that soon. I estimate Fengcheng's short lifespan is due to excessive indulgence."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was puzzled: "I never knew indulgence could shorten one's lifespan?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said: "Fengcheng, you only have less than a hundred years left before dying, shouldn't you hurry up and chat with some beautiful girls more?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng: "My heart has also aged, I can't even get excited by beauties anymore..."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng felt the terror of approaching death, but he had nowhere to escape. He knew that going forward meant death, but he still followed time forward, with no way to retreat. One year at a time, less than a hundred steps, everything would end.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew Old Master Wei would take his soul to another world.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>He sighed deeply: "Alas! Old Master Wei, I want to stay by your side in the next life too."</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later, Fengcheng passed away.</p><p></p><p>Yashan brought Fengcheng's corpse into space, shook it lightly to shatter it into dust, and scattered it with a casual wave of his hand until it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years later, Yashan dismantled his own laboratory and small world one by one, then informed Suhao. He controlled an avatar to leisurely roam the various colonial planets in the Cloud Ring System, enjoying the relaxation of old age.</p><p></p><p>Another two hundred years later, Yashan suddenly came back to bid farewell to Suhao: "Old Master Wei, Yashan will go first. If there is another life, I, Yashan, will continue to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Then he knelt down and kowtowed three times, got up and left. Not long after, his main body teleported into the universe and self-destructed.</p><p></p><p>For Yashan, since he was destined to die, he would not die later than Suhao, nor would he let Old Master Wei worry. This was his requirement for himself.</p><p></p><p>Aside from a sense of loneliness from Yashan and Fengcheng's departure, Suhao had no other feelings.</p><p></p><p>After all, not long after, he too would fall into a long slumber like them.</p><p></p><p>He hoped the next reincarnation would come faster and that the next world would provide enough gains to solve the problems he encountered.</p><p></p><p>"Time is running out, let me confirm the reincarnation direction one last time!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Suhao had set the reincarnation direction as "humanoid intelligent life".</p><p></p><p>But after exploring alien systems for these thousands of years, he slightly changed his mind. He redesigned it to also include the forms of a few types of creatures he found pleasing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about appearance, increasing the reincarnation probability was good too.</p><p></p><p>A few years later, Suhao handed over his various experimental equipment and some cultivation insights to the fifth generation Immortal Emperor, hoping their cultivation holy land could develop an even more brilliant cultivation civilization in the future.</p><p></p><p>Then, like Yashan, he controlled an ordinary avatar to enter the various colonial planets of the Cloud Ring System, observing this world from another perspective.</p><p></p><p>Over the many years here, he had mostly passed through hastily and never seriously integrated into this world.</p><p></p><p>Now taking a leisurely tour was also a great experience.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years later, Suhao felt his end approaching. He re-entered the pinball space to confirm there was no residual consciousness, then said faintly: "This life ends here!"</p><p></p><p>He destroyed all his [Divine] avatars. His main body returned to the second-level world and sat quietly in the pavilion, admiring the second-level world he had built himself.</p><p></p><p>No one knows how long passed before Suhao's main body silently lost its voice and gradually disintegrated, disappearing completely.</p><p></p><p>Only the three consciousness information fragments left in the pinball space fell into a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the second-level world violently shook, lost its balance, and was forcibly ejected from the second-level space.</p><p></p><p>It then appeared on a desolate planet.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, human exploration probes detected the anomaly. Photos of this beautiful land were transmitted back to the headquarters of the five human alliances, causing a huge commotion.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p>

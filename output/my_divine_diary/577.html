        <h1>Chapter 577</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The plan that Su Hao gave to Zhi Peng was feasible, but a plan alone cannot accomplish great things, it still depends on how the people executing the plan perform.</p><p></p><p>There are countless examples of plans being made perfectly but turning into a mess during implementation.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, Su Hao has also made many plans for various matters, and he deeply understands this principle: A detailed plan is important, but not as important as imagined. The core of a plan is never "what to do", but "what purpose to achieve". The plan serves the result.</p><p></p><p>On this point, Su Hao also gave Zhi Peng some guidance, but it's unknown how much he absorbed.</p><p></p><p>What Su Hao could provide to the Guangyao Society was the "bottom line" for its development. As for what heights the Guangyao Society could ultimately reach, that depended on its leader Zhi Peng.</p><p></p><p>A month later, the Guangyao Society swiftly slaughtered the royal families of ten surrounding cities including Pingkong City, officially stepping onto the world stage. They announced the establishment of the Guangyao Society and its first phase mission: to eliminate the greatest pest of humanity and let the light shine upon the land.</p><p></p><p>They listed the various cruel crimes committed by the royal families in different regions, accompanied by propaganda materials distributed worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Their target was clear - the royal families of the Hengxuan region.</p><p></p><p>The world was in an uproar. There was panic and unease about the coming war, worries about impacts on one's business, indifference from the uninvolved, interest in this fresh event, glee at potential chaos, excitement and wild joy from the righteous...</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also those who disdained this as mere clowning around, believing it would be extinguished within a month.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the Guangyao Society had sufficient survival ability in the early stages, Su Hao specially made more than ten interconnected large "transit spheres" for them. These could hide their base to avoid sneak attacks, while also allowing members to freely travel between locations for flexible tactics against enemies.</p><p></p><p>If even with such conditions the Guangyao Society was still quickly suppressed by the Magicians Association's forces, then they were simply incapable of great achievements and there was nothing more Su Hao could do.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>In the grand meeting hall of the Yixuan City Imperial Palace, the Grand Master Lada of the Hengxuan Region Magicians Association's headquarters exhaled a long puff of smoke. He suddenly stood up and slammed his palm down, shattering the entire round table into pieces. The powerful force made his cape flutter loudly, exuding immense might.</p><p></p><p>The few originally seated people were startled, jumping up to avoid the flying debris. The gorgeous ornaments and crowns they wore were now askew, their dignified demeanor gone.</p><p></p><p>"You damn vicious old bastard! You good-for-nothing royal and noble trash, look at the shit you've done! Now the victims are coming for you scum, and you're scared shitless, coming to us to wipe your asses. Think it'll be that easy? Pah!"</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of thick phlegm landed squarely on the face of a short, middle-aged man with a thin mustache - the Emperor of the Hengxuan Region, titled "Emperor He".</p><p></p><p>Beside Emperor He stood several men in purple and gold robes, princes of the royal family without claim to the throne, second only to Emperor He in power.</p><p></p><p>These people, insulted and spat upon by Grand Master Lada, did not dare utter a word. Their faces were flushed with embarrassment, none daring to look at Emperor He.</p><p></p><p>Emperor He shuddered in disgust, hurriedly wiping his face repeatedly with his sleeve, flushed red from the humiliation. But he could only meekly say, "It was the foolish actions of those beneath us. This time, I will certainly get rid of those useless trash!"</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined the all-powerful Emperor of the entire Hengxuan Region would appear so cowardly? If outsiders knew, they would be dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Lada immediately shouted, "I'm talking about you trash! You! Didn't hear me clearly? This time? You trash, come tell me, what happened?</p><p></p><p>You have teams of thousands of mid and high-level magicians, go deal with them yourself! You have little ability, but top-notch talent for causing trouble. You damn vicious bastard, I'll go change that damn 'Maintaining Royal Authority' agreement right now! Let's see who dares to stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor He and the princes turned pale with shock. They rushed forward, clinging to Grand Master Lada's legs and robes, wailing, "Grand Master Lada, don't be rash! Doing so will cause worldwide chaos, making us the world's criminals!"</p><p></p><p>Lada kicked them away with one foot. "With your pathetic state, you've already lost face! Come on, be a man and loudly refute me!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor He and the others looked at each other but dared not speak, only pleading with their eyes. If they could refute Grand Master Lada as men, they would have shown their family jewels long ago.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in the entire Hengxuan Region, few dared to openly defy Lada, for those who did so mysteriously died, regardless of who they were!</p><p></p><p>But even for someone as powerful as him, changing the final clause of the "Eighteen Empire Alliance Agreement" was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Because this was not something an individual's strength could resolve, unless he was willing to slaughter all opposition.</p><p></p><p>After venting his curses, Lada offered solutions: "First, organize those dog teams nurtured by your royal family and go pacify Pingkong City. Second, bring the heads of those princes to Pingkong to seek a peaceful resolution. Third, just wait for them to come to you, and have you trash eliminated."</p><p></p><p>Emperor He asked in shock, "What about the Magicians Association?"</p><p></p><p>Lada: "You damn vicious bastard, hurry up and die!"</p><p></p><p>Of course Emperor He couldn't die so quickly, as he still had plenty of glory and riches to enjoy. So he chose the first option, organizing the teams of magicians recruited by the royal family to go pacify Pingkong City.</p><p></p><p>After being fed and pampered for so long, it was time for them to demonstrate their value.</p><p></p><p>However, Emperor He was worried: if these pro-royal magician teams suffered heavy losses, would those evil "reformists" seize the chance to change that agreement...?</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes slowly lit up, as if he had a good idea: As the saying goes, money can make ghosts grind the mill.</p><p></p><p>And the royal family controlling the core industries of the entire world certainly did not lack money!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the atmosphere in the Hengxuan Region became increasingly tense. Almost everyone sensed that something momentous was about to occur.</p><p></p><p>However, to Su Hao, such matters were trivial, not even worth getting involved in. He only instructed Feng Cheng to keep an eye on Zhi Peng during this period.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two years of effort, Feng Cheng had learned teleportation and blinking, though the effects were unreliable. But in dangerous situations, it was enough to escape.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Hao had not yet considered who could threaten a celestial cultivator like Feng Cheng, with a 15,000 mile perception range, the mind ability "Mind's Desire", and the "Command Talisman".</p><p></p><p>Of course, against deviant magicians, he might have to strike first. But fleeing was also an option.</p><p></p><p>Ayashan was now also researching ways to disrupt the mental frequencies of magicians, causing their abilities to fail outright and turning them into ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>According to Ayashan, if all went well, results could be achieved within a year.</p><p></p><p>After arranging Zhi Peng's matters with Feng Cheng, Su Hao continued entering the collection room of source artifacts to study them.</p><p></p><p>With a large number of source artifacts for research, combined with having grasped the "system's" tail, Su Hao had a premonition that he would soon find the principle of material transforming into source very soon.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this principle is not as complex as I imagined, but rather quite simple!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 832</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>As the young dragons patiently waited, the sun gradually set, and the horizon turned a brilliant red.</p><p></p><p>Before the sun completely set, out of the eighteen young giant dragons, only ten were able to bring back the accumulated snow from Long Hong Snow Mountain, successfully completing the task.</p><p></p><p>As for the other eight giant dragons who failed, they lost the qualification to awaken their soul power and could only wait until this time next year to participate in the awakening ceremony again.</p><p></p><p>The qualified giant dragons stood silently in the square, awaiting the bestowal from the divine Nati.</p><p></p><p>After Nati simply said some ceremonial words, he opened his dragon claws, from which golden light spheres floated out one by one. Under the anticipating gazes of the young giant dragons, the spheres entered their brow centers.</p><p></p><p>This included Su Hao's "Egg God" avatar.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the soul seed from affecting his main consciousness, Su Hao proactively closed the "avatar control" connection port and instead used the black room's remote body control to observe the changes of the "Egg God" avatar.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao saw a massive condensed information entity enter the "Egg God's" head, constantly searching for a brain, as if this soul seed had to fuse with the brain.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the soul seed did not find a brain in the "Egg God's" head...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought silently, "It seems the soul seed needs to be implanted into the brain."</p><p></p><p>After confirming this, the "Egg God's" outward appearance did not change, but its internal structure underwent rapid and drastic changes under Su Hao's control. A large number of nerve clusters hidden in the bones immediately moved to the head cavity position and interconnected in a specific order, quickly building a temporary "brain."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this makeshift brain will work..."</p><p></p><p>When the brain condensed, the soul seed that entered the head, as if finding its target, drilled into the brain.</p><p></p><p>Then the outer layer of the soul seed slowly expanded, releasing a vast amount of information towards the entire brain.</p><p></p><p>However, the inner layer remained unchanged, slowly fusing with a large number of nerve cells and taking root within them, firmly fixing itself.</p><p></p><p>The entire soul seed was like it split into two parts, an inner and outer layer. The inner layer was like an information soul power core, rooting deep into the brain and fusing with it, while the outer layer turned into a vast amount of information, spreading throughout the entire brain.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the soul seed stabilized and no longer changed, which meant the soul seed implantation was complete.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quickly analyzed the information contained within the soul seed through Xiaoguan and found it consisted of three parts:</p><p></p><p>The second layer contained many methods for tempering and strengthening "soul power", as well as various powerful soul arts and soul techniques. It was similar to a skill textbook - after mastering a certain skill, new skills would automatically unlock. All red golden dragons would train and learn according to this set of skills, and their strength generally depended on the intensity of their soul power and how many skills they mastered.</p><p></p><p>The innermost layer contained an extremely weak sub-consciousness. Su Hao judged that it did not have any autonomous consciousness, but was merely a backdoor left in the soul seed, allowing the deity Nati to implant his own conscious sub-consciousness at any time to completely take over this body.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms: while bestowing power upon the red golden dragons, the deity also demanded that the red golden dragons offer everything to him, including their souls.</p><p></p><p>However, most red golden dragons were unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Not only were the red golden dragons unaware, it was likely that the followers of other divine sects in this world were also unaware.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if they knew, they might still join the divine sect without hesitation, offering their souls to the deity. After all, as long as they offered their souls, they would be eligible to gain even greater power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after offering their souls to the deity, it was still unknown whether the deity would actually take their souls.</p><p></p><p>Each divine sect had countless followers, with hundreds of millions of soul cultivators and soul warriors. Why would the deity bother occupying their bodies? Being occupied could only be considered unlucky...</p><p></p><p>After the soul seed stabilized, Su Hao regained full control of this "Egg God" avatar through the "avatar control."</p><p></p><p>After taking over again, a vast amount of non-soul power information surged into Su Hao's mind through the connection, gradually clarifying the core of soul seeds and soul power to him.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he sensed that this current "Egg God" avatar had formed an inexplicable connection with the deity Nati not far away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when looking at the deity Nati, an endless sense of awe almost occupied his entire brain...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought inwardly, "These deities' brainwashing methods are ridiculously powerful. With this, the followers implanted with soul seeds would be completely obedient before their deity, without any ability to generate thoughts of resistance."</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were eighteen great deities and eighteen great sects, encompassing all intelligent beings. This world could be said to belong not to humans, dragons, and mountain spirits, but to these eighteen deities.</p><p></p><p>The entire society was controlled by the eighteen deities, and all thoughts and mindsets were under their dominion.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Su Hao feel extremely horrified.</p><p></p><p>This world appeared vibrant and full of vitality, but it had not changed for thousands or even millions of years. Any innovative thoughts might be inexplicably suppressed before they could even spread.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao quietly observed the surrounding young dragons and found they were all in a dormant state, perhaps gradually digesting the soul seed information implanted by the deity Nati.</p><p></p><p>So he pretended to sleep along with the young dragons while analyzing and perceiving the soul seed, soul power, and methods to temper and strengthen soul power.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the sun's rays completely disappeared from the horizon and the night sky was filled with stars that the young dragons gradually awoke.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao also awoke and regained mobility.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the deity Nati had been lying down with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep. It was not until now that he opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Su Hao.</p><p></p><p>The deity Nati was puzzled inwardly, "This little one appears very powerful, but why is the operation of his soul seed so crude? His will and vitality are so low, no better than a mindless beast. Is it because he is too young? Or is it that while possessing a powerful physical body, he also has a defective and dimwitted brain... What a pity."</p><p></p><p>While feeling regretful, the deity Nati was also considering whether to take this seemingly very powerful physical body as a spare avatar. Staying in a body that was too stupid for too long could cause his sub-consciousness to become dull.</p><p></p><p>He first created a bright light to illuminate the surroundings, encouraged the red golden dragons who completed the awakening ceremony, telling them to fight for the glory of the golden dragon race. Then he asked Su Hao, "Little one, what is your name?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Leian Oakes."</p><p></p><p>The deity Nati smiled and said, "So you're the little one from the Oakes family. Then, Leian Oakes, are you willing to become a Dragon Tamer and learn from me?"</p><p></p><p>The other young dragons gasped in unison upon hearing this, never expecting that after this little hatchling completed the awakening task, he would immediately be favored by the great deity Nati and become the honorable Dragon Tamer of the golden dragon race, attaining eternal life - an honor that countless dragons strive for their entire lives without obtaining!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed to the mother dragon Shadu and the two hatchlings in the distance and said, "I need to bid farewell to my mother Shadu first."</p><p></p><p>The deity Nati thought inwardly, "Looking at this hatchling's appearance, he seems quite intelligent, yet his brain activity is so low. Perhaps there is some special reason... I'll have to study him carefully later."</p><p></p><p>He praised Su Hao, "That is what you should do."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then flapped his small wings and flew to mother dragon Shadu, saying, "Mother Shadu, I have completed the soul power awakening ceremony. I feel that I can use soul power now."</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shadu was truly happy for her child.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued, "The deity Nati has invited me to become a Dragon Tamer and learn from him, and I have agreed to the deity's invitation. So from now on, I may not be able to continue following Mother Shadu."</p><p></p><p>Mother Shadu was stunned at first, then excitedly said, "Leian, are you saying you will become Nati's Dragon Tamer?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded, "That is what the deity Nati said."</p><p></p><p>"That's wonderful, Leian!"</p><p></p><p>Mother Shadu understood that a Dragon Tamer was the path to eternal life, becoming a Dragon Tamer meant attaining a near-eternal lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Her excitement dispelled Mother Shadu's reluctance to part, and she smiled widely, "Go on, Leian Oakes."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao handed Mother Shadu a positioning stone, "Mother Shadu, keep this stone with you at all times. I can locate your position through this stone at any time."</p><p></p><p>His dragon brother Chipu and dragon sister Moli also came over, eagerly saying, "Third brother, I want a stone too."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took out two more positioning stones and gave one each to Chipu and Moli. Then he told Mother Shadu, "Mother Shadu, if you encounter powerful enemies or any danger, you can channel a wisp of soul power into the stone to protect your life in critical moments."</p><p></p><p>Mother Shadu said, "After this, I will find a place in the ancestral lands to raise your brother and sister until they grow up. Leian, if you have a chance, come back and see your brother and sister."</p><p></p><p>After simply saying this, Su Hao temporarily bid farewell to Mother Shadu and the two hatchlings.</p>

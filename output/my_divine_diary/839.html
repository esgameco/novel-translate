        <h1>Chapter 839</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If the soul-searching target is a follower whose soul was planted by the deity itself, soul-searching is very simple and will not harm the searched follower. However, if another deity performs the soul-searching technique on followers who do not belong to them, the end result is the complete annihilation of the searched target's will.</p><p></p><p>The God of Myriad Thunders - Gu said with a light laugh: "Fuir, I suspect that Nati's disappearance has something to do with this mother dragon. Perhaps we can find some clues from this mother dragon."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty - Fuir did not buy into this: "Even if we need to find the so-called clues you mentioned, it is not up to Lord Gu to take action personally. After all, this is my domain. Lord Gu can act freely in your own realm, but I cannot control that. However, it is not allowed here. Moreover, before coming, we had an agreement that Lord Gu cannot harm my subjects in my domain, and Lord Gu readily agreed to that."</p><p></p><p>The God of Myriad Thunders - Gu said indifferently: "Just like that stupid golden dragon, you dragons always fail to distinguish between important and trivial matters. Have you not smelled the scent of conspiracy from all these things? It is simply ridiculous that you are obstructing me over such a small matter."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty - Fuir also smiled: "How the dragon race is, is not for you black dragons to judge. I don't care about any conspiracies or plots. To me, they are all irrelevant. But today, you cannot take action in my domain."</p><p></p><p>The God of Myriad Thunders - Gu: "Fuir, do you want to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Fuir asked in return: "God of Myriad Thunders - Gu, do you want to actively provoke my dragon race? My dragon race is not afraid of war."</p><p></p><p>The two deities were arguing beside the mother dragon Shaduo, who was a bit dazed at this point.</p><p></p><p>When the God of Myriad Thunders tried to use soul arts to search her soul, she still hadn't quite reacted. It wasn't until the attack was blocked by the Goddess of Beauty - Fuir that she finally woke up from her daze: "Just now...Lord God of Myriad Thunders - Gu was trying to kill me! But why does Lord Gu want to kill me? What is he trying to find from me...and Lord Nati has gone missing..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but recall the scene of her youngest son Leian Oakes suddenly disappearing along with Lord Nati.</p><p></p><p>She had an ominous hunch in her heart: "Could it be that the sudden disappearance was not Lord Nati's ability, but Leian's? In other words, did Leian take Lord Nati away? When I saw Lord Nati and Leian suddenly disappear at that time, I felt that this ability to suddenly disappear was very similar to Leian's.</p><p></p><p>Lord Nati must have truly disappeared, otherwise the God of Myriad Thunders - Lord Gu would not have come in person with the Goddess of Beauty - Lord Fuir to search for Lord Nati..."</p><p></p><p>As mother dragon Shaduo thought about it, she couldn't help but feel a chill run down her spine.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that her own child had kidnapped the Lord deity, which was a huge disaster! This was even more terrifying to her than the sky falling down.</p><p></p><p>Then she rejected this possibility: "It's impossible. My child Leian is an obedient and sensible child. He would not be so disrespectful to a deity. What Lord Gu said must be some other situation, unrelated to Leian. This is just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Then she glanced at the two arguing deities and thought to herself: "Lord Gu wants to kill me...That must be it. Lord Gu is far more powerful than Lord Fuir. Lord Fuir cannot protect me, I will be killed..."</p><p></p><p>Then she thought of her two children: "If I am killed, what will happen to Chipu and Moli, my children? They will definitely starve to death. No, I cannot die!"</p><p></p><p>Her eyes became very determined, and a sense of resistance arose within her, even though the other party was a deity.</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo was a follower of the Deity of Upholding Heaven - Nati. In front of Nati, she would never have the slightest will to resist. But in front of other deities, she would not be the same.</p><p></p><p>Her mind raced, and she then remembered the stone that Suhao had given her. She recalled Suhao's words: "Infuse a bit of soul power into the stone, and it can save your life in a critical moment."</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what it was, but she instinctively believed the words of her youngest son Leian.</p><p></p><p>Then she infused a bit of soul power into the positioning stone, hoping for a miracle to occur.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a miracle did indeed happen. The figure of a small red-golden dragon appeared beside her. She only saw its back, but she knew it was her third child Leian.</p><p></p><p>"How did Leian suddenly appear here? Is this Leian's 'never miss' ability?"</p><p></p><p>However, before she could react to what had happened, she saw her child Leian scan the surrounding environment, and his gaze finally locked onto the two Lord deities.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, her child Leian and the two Lord deities instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo was dazed again. She looked left and right, and apart from her two children Chipu and Moli, the place was empty - where were the deities?</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo did not feel relieved that the crisis was averted. Instead, she fell into even greater panic: "It really was my child Leian who took Lord Nati away. Why would Leian do that? Wasn't he going to learn from Lord Nati?</p><p></p><p>And it's not over yet. Now Leian has taken the other two Lords away as well...Oh my god, Leian, my child, what are you doing? Quickly release the three Lords!"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo felt her mind was in a daze, as if the sky was about to fall.</p><p></p><p>The eldest dragon brother Chipu flew over and curiously asked, "Mother Shaduo, was that third brother who came back just now? Why did he leave so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Mother dragon Shaduo turned to look at her two children, and quickly regained her senses: "No, we must leave here immediately, leave the Dragon Continent, run far away."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suhao sensed the fluctuation of the positioning stone's spiritual tentacles and immediately stopped the experiment he was working on to transmit over.</p><p></p><p>Upon appearing, he roughly understood what had happened. Without hesitation, he transmitted the two giant dragons blocking mother dragon Shaduo into his small world.</p><p></p><p>Through his perception, they were still the avatars of the two deities.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, it's suitable to have them keep Nati company. The more Ten-Colored Plates, the better. It's said that different Ten-Colored Plate attributes have different abilities, so more data is beneficial."</p><p></p><p>Then he fixed the two giant dragons on the left and right, extended his hands to press against their heads, and poured a huge amount of blood energy into their brains. In no time, he had recorded the consciousness information of the two dragon avatars in the Pinball Space.</p><p></p><p>"Done. Now to find their main bodies."</p><p></p><p>Suhao's figure flashed again and disappeared from the spot, transmitting out of the small world...</p><p></p><p>In the small world, the avatars of the two deities were completely baffled, not understanding what had happened in that brief moment.</p><p></p><p>A small dragon suddenly appeared in the den, then the scene changed and they came to this strange place. They found themselves restrained and unable to move, with a strange warm flow pouring into their brains...</p><p></p><p>The two deity avatars' minds raced, trying to guess the current situation, analyze how to break free from the restraints, and find the enemy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice mixed with surprise, delight, and uncertainty came from beside them: "Lord Gu, Lord Fuir?"</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice made the God of Myriad Thunders - Gu and the Goddess of Beauty - Fuir slightly stunned. They rolled their eyes towards the sound and saw a familiar red-golden dragon looking at them with great delight.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Deity of Upholding Heaven - Nati, whom they had been searching for.</p><p></p><p>The God of Myriad Thunders - Gu was very surprised by this. He didn't expect to find the missing Deity of Upholding Heaven - Nati so easily, before he had even truly exerted his full power.</p><p></p><p>Nati laughed heartily in delight: "Ah, my two old friends, Gu and Fuir. I'm so happy to see you both here. Welcome, welcome, all who come here are destined."</p><p></p><p>Gu and Fuir struggled with all their might, trying every means possible but unable to move an inch. They could only temporarily give up and ask through their throats: "Nati, what is going on? What is this place? Where did you go when you suddenly disappeared some time ago?"</p><p></p><p>Nati circled around the two deity avatars, giggling: "Don't rush, you two should first sense whether your connection to your main bodies is still there or not."</p><p></p><p>After Nati mentioned it, the two deities were shocked to find that they had indeed lost their connection to their main bodies. They exclaimed in astonishment: "How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Nati: "Nothing is impossible. This world may be far more interesting than we imagined, and anything can happen. Like you two appearing here, which I didn't expect - what a pleasant surprise! This is the happiest moment I've had in a long time."</p><p></p><p>If one has company in misfortune, it won't seem so sad.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty - Fuir said: "Lord Deity Nati, please release us from these restraints first."</p><p></p><p>Nati spread his hands, indicating he was powerless: "What you cannot do, I also cannot do. Perhaps we'll have to wait for Leian Oakes to return before that can happen."</p><p></p><p>"Leian Oakes?"</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty - Fuir knew the surname Oakes was one of the dragon clan's surnames, but she had never heard of the name Leian.</p><p></p><p>Nati revealed an enigmatic smile: "My two old friends, don't be in a hurry. I think Lord Leian will be back very soon. When he returns, he will naturally release your restraints. And I guess Lord Leian will bring back a surprise for my two old friends. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>If it were truly as Nati imagined, then for Nati it would indeed be a surprise. But for the other two deities, whether it would be a surprise or a shock, that remained to be seen.</p>

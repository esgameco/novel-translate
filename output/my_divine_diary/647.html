        <h1>Chapter 647</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Yashan and Feng Cheng were aware of Su Hao's 'Planet Virus', so powerful that it could easily destroy a planet.</p><p></p><p>But in both of their opinions, Su Hao had no reason to destroy the Origin Star, and furthermore, being eroded by the planetary virus wouldn't be like the 'flames burning the sky' shape that the Origin Star was in at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this disaster of the Source Star was not caused by Su Hao's initiative to cast the planetary virus.</p><p></p><p>Then what kind of power was it that could destroy a planet?</p><p></p><p>The Source Star, destroyed by magic!"</p><p></p><p>Asan and Feng Cheng remained puzzled, "Magic?"</p><p></p><p>Of course they knew what the magic power Su Hao was talking about was, it was none other than the ubiquitous 'source' that filled the air.</p><p></p><p>It was the three of them who set up the focus of the 'Disaster System' in the ubiquitous air after sealing the 'Disaster' with a satellite, causing the air to be filled with 'Source' everywhere, and as the time passed, the concentration of the source grew higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>But what does this disaster have to do with the source in the air? Is it hard to believe that the source was ignited?</p><p></p><p>Only to see Su Hao continue, ''We only know that the sources that permeate the air can't be aggregated and transformed into 'source beads' on their own, but we don't know that when the sources in the air, after the concentration reaches a certain level, will have some other kind of nature.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, we all overlooked that the concentration of 'source' on the planet had reached an extremely dangerous point.</p><p></p><p>This time, the source planet became like this because after the explosion on the island, the chaotic and furious force field pushed the 'source' in the air towards collapsing into 'energy' and caused a chain reaction that rippled to every corner of the world at the fastest speed possible.</p><p></p><p>In other words, wherever there is air movement, no one is immune."</p><p></p><p>It dawned on Asama and Kazunari, "I see."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Su Hao thought of more than that, he also guessed that the chain reaction had spread to all the 'sources' of the entire source star!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, when the chain reaction rippled through, the magical power in the magicians' bodies erupted out of control, instantly tearing their bodies into pieces and dying even faster than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>This was why none of the mages were spared.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the power wizards wielded was very powerful, and although the energy riot on the Source Star was strong, there would still be a very small number of powerful wizards that would survive.</p><p></p><p>However the ones that survived, not a single one, spoke volumes.</p><p></p><p>Whether that was the case or not, a small test was still needed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Hao flipped his hand and touched out a source pearl, violently shooting it out into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh--"</p><p></p><p>In less than a second, the source bead violently released a blinding light, expanding into a huge and incomparable ball of light.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by a violent explosion, the powerful shockwave pushed the unprepared Yashan and Feng Chengdu backward a long way.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao secretly said, "It's true! The chain reaction that was happening on this planet today was still continuing. All the exposed source beads are unable to maintain a stable state, and eventually transformed into energy and exploded outwards."</p><p></p><p>The reason why the source inside the three of them was able to be preserved was because of the 'brittle defense' maintained on the [Destiny Son] armor, which was able to isolate all kinds of fluctuating rays, as well as isolate the chain reaction mechanism!</p><p></p><p>Su Hao was silent for a moment, then said, "Go out first."</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at each other and followed Su Hao as he flew into space.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside of space, the three of them floated in this silence, looking at the burning planet below.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had never imagined that it was because of the 'Disaster Sealing Satellite System' that they had created that had led to the disaster before them.</p><p></p><p>The living planet was so great and so fragile.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's tone was slightly sullen: ''Ever since we built the satellite sealing system, we thought that the world would be heading in the right direction, but it was just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>Each world, has each world's unique operating rules, have its own development trend, we unauthorized changes, bring, often not happiness, but a greater disaster.</p><p></p><p>If we don't have much power, it doesn't matter how we toss it, but the more power we have, the more harm we do to the world.</p><p></p><p>Take this as a warning. With the three of us grasping absolute power, we need to be a bit more scrupulous in doing things in the future, and not act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng immediately said, "Okay Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao thought for a moment and added, "Before understanding the principles thoroughly, one must not act recklessly. However, if you are able to grasp the final result, then you can do as you please."</p><p></p><p>Yayama and Feng Cheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>What Boss Wei said was right!</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked, "Boss Vi, what should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at the 'satellite system' and said, "Let's adjust the satellite first and destroy all the focus systems."</p><p></p><p>When the two heard this, they immediately understood what Su Hao meant.</p><p></p><p>Now that the satellite system was still running, the air was transformed by the 'source' every moment, and it was turned into energy to be vented out by the chain reaction, which meant that it would take a long time for the disaster of the source star to calm down.</p><p></p><p>At least not until the riot of energy that had destroyed all the 'focus systems' naturally.</p><p></p><p>Put the disaster to rest as soon as possible, and maybe the planet can still be saved ......</p><p></p><p>At the very least, there is a chance for life to be born again in the distant future.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's trio acted quickly, destroying the operation of the satellites in turn, and even throwing some of the satellites directly off the source planet.</p><p></p><p>Trueãƒ»Earth to earth!</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'disaster sealing system' was also not needed, as long as it was ensured that disasters would not occur in the near future.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Feng Cheng suddenly messaged, "Boss Wei, there are still two surviving observers here, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao: "Bring them back to the Initial!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay Boss Wei!"</p><p></p><p>A few days later, they had destroyed all the focus systems, but there was no telling how long it would take for the source star to completely calm down.</p><p></p><p>Once this kind of planet-level disaster happened, the chain reaction it triggered was beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to calm down, they wouldn't even think about it without a few hundred or a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao observed the source star for a long time, and after confirming that the focus systems were all temporarily destroyed, he said to Yashan and Feng Cheng, "You two go back to the ship first! I'll study the chain reaction mechanism here."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Feng Cheng complied and went back to the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao, on the other hand, did not rush into the source star to study the principle that caused the chain explosion of magic power in the air.</p><p></p><p>Instead, alone, he quietly floated in space, looking at the burning planet in front of him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But that heart, which had been without any fluctuation for a long time, was slightly trembling at this time.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After Yashan and Feng Cheng returned to the airship, Feiyuan immediately greeted them and asked with a slightly anxious face, "Mr. Yashan, Mr. Feng Cheng, how is our planet now?"</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Feng Cheng brought Yuan Feng and Ling Xue back to the airship and temporarily placed them there, Fei Yuan learned about the matter of the source planet catching fire from the two observers, in addition to not knowing a thing about it.</p><p></p><p>He had a certain affection for this home planet and desperately wanted to know the answer, but the 'transit sphere' in his hand, which allowed him to freely travel between the ship and the source planet, was no longer working and he could not go back.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng said, "The source planet had a sudden special disaster, the magic in the air was ignited and exploded, affecting the entire planet, now there are no survivors except for the two observers you saw."</p><p></p><p>Although he had already sensed that it was not good, learning about the situation from Feng Cheng's mouth was still hard for Fei Yuan to accept.</p><p></p><p>His brain became confused once again and he muttered, "How could this be so. It was all fine and dandy before we came, no signs, what is it, that can set all the sources on fire?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan explained, "'Source' is almost the most amazing thing I've ever seen, and of course, the most dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The world becomes special and splendid because of the sources, but at the same time, there is also a deep and unpredictable danger; as long as certain conditions happen to be met, all the 'sources' in the world, will collapse at the same time, and then devour everything. Just like Boss Vi's 'Planet Virus'.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we don't happen to know what the conditions are that triggers this, and can't prevent it in advance.</p><p></p><p>Things have come to a head, look on the bright side, who knows what will happen next? Who can guarantee that the world can exist forever?"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yashan walked away on his own.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng was also about to leave when Fei Yuan suddenly said, "Teacher Feng Cheng, can you take me back to the Source Star? I want to see it for myself."</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't refuse, "Of course you can, but we have to wait until Boss Wei returns. Boss Wei is still researching the cause of the chain reaction, and he can only go over there after he finds a solution to target it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the instant you reach the source star, the source in your body will be able to blow you to pieces."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 620</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>When Axing decided to call Suhao, the outcome was already determined.</p><p></p><p>Suhao appeared via teleportation, his divine consciousness locking onto the enemy. He snapped his fingers, and the 17 people surrounding Axing and Awang immediately lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Facts once again proved that villains die from talking too much.</p><p></p><p>If you have something to do, just get it done quickly. Talking too much is only to vent the anger in your heart, but you may lose your life before the anger is vented.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of these 17 people possessed high-level titles as mages with first-class combat abilities and experience. If they had adopted a sneak attack strategy from the start, attacking Axing and the other, then Axing may not have even had the time to summon Suhao.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these 17 people thought they had an absolute advantage and hoped to see Axing and the other kneeling down to beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>After casually burying the corpses, Suhao asked, "Axing and Awang, why were you targeted by these people?"</p><p></p><p>Axing simply explained the origins of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Then he sighed helplessly, "I don't know what madness possessed these people, insisting that we stole the glory from their Dragon Heart region..."</p><p></p><p>Awang also quipped, "What kind of glory is that? I reckon it's because the price of source pearls has skyrocketed recently, and these people are greedy for the high-quality source pearls in our hands!"</p><p></p><p>Axing also said, "Yeah, it's getting harder and harder to obtain source pearls recently, so it's no wonder the prices have risen. Even with money, you can't necessarily buy them."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "Times are different now, it's normal!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After returning to his base miniworld, Suhao went straight to Yashan, "Yashan, how is the world transformation plan progressing?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan smiled, "All preparations are ready, Great Lord Wei!</p><p></p><p>We just need the specific plan for transforming the world. Once the 'focus system' is moved into the air, we can officially launch the plan.</p><p></p><p>After all kinds of disasters are cut off, in at most two years, ordinary mages will have almost no source pearls left! At that time, even if they want to make trouble, they won't be able to.</p><p></p><p>If they want to obtain source pearls, they can only get them through the Mage Association's distribution. The Mage Association can use this to complete the first round of reshuffling mages."</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I've designed the transformation plan for the focus system! I need you and Fengcheng to help."</p><p></p><p>He sent the transformation plan directly to their assistants for them to review.</p><p></p><p>After looking it over, Yashan exclaimed in admiration, "A genius' conception, a genius' operation, simply invincible!"</p><p></p><p>The transformation method was not complicated. It only required sending a few hundred satellites into orbit to revolve around the planet in a certain pattern, changing the subtle gravitational parameters of this planet to complete the transformation, without even needing to touch a single blade of grass.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because it was not complicated that it was more remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Yashan had never even thought of such a method.</p><p></p><p>Besides the words "genius" and "invincible", Yashan could not find any other words to describe his boss's unrestrained imagination.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given the level of astronomical knowledge in this world, who knows how many years it would take for them to figure out what those few hundred extra satellites in the sky were about?</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that those invisible satellites floating in space would be linked to the disasters of this world?</p><p></p><p>Counting it up, it wouldn't be inappropriate to call these few hundred satellites the "Disaster Sealing System".</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "What's so amazing about this? There are many ways to transform it, I just happened to think of doing it this way!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan was full of reverence!</p><p></p><p>What was a once-in-a-decade flash of inspiration for ordinary people was just a "casual occurrence" for geniuses.</p><p></p><p>How could you reason with that?</p><p></p><p>The suitable satellites that Suhao referred to were just objects of suitable size and mass. His first target was locked on "mountain peaks"!</p><p></p><p>The selected mountain peaks never expected that while comfortably residing in their territory, one day they would be sent into space for sightseeing!</p><p></p><p>There were too many mountain peaks on the planet that met Suhao's conditions. The three of them quickly found a mountain range. Suhao examined it and said, "This is it. Move this entire mountain range, it should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Yashan, Fengcheng, I'll be responsible for teleporting the mountain peaks into space. You two go into space and turn all these mountain peaks into spheres, and make them move at a uniform speed along the predetermined orbits. The specific parameters have been sent to your assistants.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, measure the mass of the mountain peaks. Send me the data if there's any deficiency, and I'll supplement it."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng replied, "Received, Great Lord Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan added, "With so many mountain peaks of such large volume, don't you need my help?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the previous world where Suhao needed Yashan's assistance to teleport a mountain peak to collide with a planet, he never expected that now Suhao could do it alone. The Great Lord Wei's speed of progress was unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Suhao smiled, "Previously I didn't know how to use spatial domains. Now that I've learned, teleporting a mountain peak is about as difficult as blinking."</p><p></p><p>Yashan asked in surprise, "How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "First create a small world, then stuff the mountain peak into the small world, and then teleport the small world into orbit."</p><p></p><p>Yashan deflated, "I haven't learned that yet...Recently I've been diligently studying 'source frequency conversion' and magic spells, so I've fallen behind in spatial cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Studying is cultivation. When you study deeply enough, you'll be able to integrate many things. When you realize that 'all things do not leave their roots', you'll probably reach the next realm of 'Scholar'!"</p><p></p><p>Yashan had a look of longing. Together with Fengcheng, they performed three consecutive extreme blinks to arrive in space, and continued flying further away from the planet. Their flight speed was extremely fast, but compared to the planet, their speed didn't seem much faster than a snail's.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Suhao began creating his palm-sized miniworld. When he finished one, Yashan sent a message: "Great Lord Wei, I've reached the designated position."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied with "OK", then his Vajra Qi spread out, forming a brilliant array of runes the size of a bathtub, emitting dazzling golden light like the halo behind a Buddha's head.</p><p></p><p>The Twenty-Four Formations - Dawn Sword!</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his wrist, the beam of light swept horizontally, cleanly severing the surrounding mountain peaks from their roots.</p><p></p><p>Then he activated two spell manuals, and his spiritual power surged forth, enveloping the entire mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Super Levitation Technique!</p><p></p><p>Incredibly, Suhao actually lifted the entire mountain peak up a distance, causing many loose rocks to lose balance from the shaking and roll down.</p><p></p><p>Then he pushed his right palm forward, and the basketball-sized miniworld was pushed out, arriving in front of the mountain peak, and swallowed the entire peak.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the miniworld opened an invisible large mouth to devour the mountain peak, very incongruous.</p><p></p><p>After stuffing the entire mountain peak into the miniworld, Suhao transmitted it with a thought to Yashan's side, along with the basketball-sized miniworld.</p><p></p><p>Then he pushed the mountain peak out of the miniworld.</p><p></p><p>That poor mountain peak was left floating alone in the vastness of space.</p><p></p><p>Yashan watched the entire process. The Great Lord Wei's operation was so simple, but no matter what, Yashan couldn't do it!</p><p></p><p>What was infuriating was that he couldn't even take the mountain peak out of the miniworld, otherwise the Great Lord Wei wouldn't have needed to come over in person!</p><p></p><p>Yashan raged inwardly: "Study, study!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Lord Wei said studying could obtain everything, so it must be so.</p><p></p><p>Suhao brought the miniworld back to the previous mountain range to transport the second peak.</p><p></p><p>Yashan remained in place, circling the mountain peak, then landed on it, transforming into the Fate Child form. The Vajra Qi surged from under his feet, dyeing the entire peak crystal clear. The conical peak then changed properties, gradually becoming a huge sphere.</p><p></p><p>Yashan retracted his transformation Qi while calculating the mass of this peak, posting in the group: "Great Lord Wei, Peak No. 1 has a mass of about 980 million tons, lacking 20 million tons."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, an enormous boulder appeared nearby. Yashan measured it and found it was exactly 20 million tons, combining perfectly with the previous peak to form 1 billion tons in total mass.</p><p></p><p>Yashan replied "Received", and merged the large rock into the sphere, forming a brand new satellite.</p><p></p><p>"Next I'll give it an initial velocity to make it revolve in the specified orbit! But I'll need to design a few powerful thrusters for it first, to avoid any special situations that could cause it to deviate from its orbit."</p><p></p><p>After Suhao finished loading the second peak, Fengcheng also sent a message: "Great Lord Wei, I've arrived at the initial position for Orbit No. 2."</p><p></p><p>Suhao brought the miniworld containing the peak to Fengcheng's side and ejected the peak!</p><p></p><p>The second satellite!</p><p></p><p>As for why, Fengcheng said he didn't understand either, he just felt the Great Lord Wei was incredibly awesome!</p>

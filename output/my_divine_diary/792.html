        <h1>Chapter 792</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suhao's research project did not make any breakthrough progress, but Yashan and Fengcheng had bountiful harvests, which greatly cheered up Suhao's slightly gloomy mood.</p><p></p><p>After all, the achievements of Yashan and Fengcheng were essentially his own achievements.  </p><p></p><p>Having achievements is something worth being happy about.</p><p></p><p>Suhao turned to Fengcheng and said, "Fengcheng, what about your gravity array?"</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng laughed and said, "My results are not as impressive as Big Brother Yashan's, but I've also made some breakthroughs."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a large amount of crystal armor surged out from within Fengcheng's body, forming a magnificent suit of armor. Immediately after, dense arrays were engraved all over the armor.</p><p></p><p>He operated it while explaining, "I didn't make any major innovations, but first thoroughly studied the research materials that Master Wei gave me, and then continued deeper experimentation following Master Wei's line of thought.</p><p></p><p>By combining the spirit power grid and spirit body within my body, I extended the external gravity array into my body, utilizing 50% of my total spirit power to provide gravity..."</p><p></p><p>After completing the array engraving, Fengcheng opened up his hands, feet, chest and abdomen to reveal the internal structure to Suhao and Yashan.</p><p></p><p>They saw that both the interior and exterior were covered in pink crystal gravity arrays with a unique structure arranged to stack in the same direction.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said with great interest, "Try it out and see the effect."</p><p></p><p>After closing his opened chest and abdomen, Fengcheng activated his spirit power and instantly turned into a sun...</p><p></p><p>The brilliant light retracted.</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>An extremely powerful gravitational force emanated from Fengcheng, violently attracting surrounding matter to fly towards him.</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually pressed down, and everything returned to its original position and became still.</p><p></p><p>Then he carefully sensed this powerful gravitational force and praised with a nod, "Not bad, the intensity has increased by nearly double compared to before. It seems you've become a qualified researcher, Fengcheng."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Suhao finished speaking, Fengcheng's all-purpose assistant immediately notified: Level upgraded, current level is 'Junior Researcher'.</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He retracted the gravity array and curiously looked at Yashan, asking, "Big Brother Yashan, what's your current level?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan laughed, "Junior Scholar."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng gasped, "Wow, Big Brother Yashan is already a scholar!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Let's go try it out at the black hole in the Cloud Ring System."</p><p></p><p>The three excitedly teleported to a planet near the black hole, then activated Stardrive to travel towards the black hole.</p><p></p><p>Six years later, they were ejected from Stardrive state, and continued flying at full speed.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the increasingly concentrated particle flow, the three opened their 'Cone Force Field' defenses against the particle flow.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after activating the Cone Force Field, the particles that originally struck their defensive array shields were deflected by the powerful force field, passing by the sides to form a cone-shaped clear area perfectly protecting them.</p><p></p><p>Suhao couldn't help but give Yashan a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>As they advanced further, the particle flow became denser, but was effectively blocked, as if the previous obstruction to their progress no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>After flying for another 50 years, Yashan suddenly said, "Master Wei, this is about far enough. If we go further, it seems we'll reach the critical point where spacetime is distorted by the black hole, and the Cone Force Field cannot be maintained."</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded and stopped.</p><p></p><p>His right half suddenly split open, his body dividing into two, with the pink crystal armor rapidly transforming into a crystal armor figure identical to Suhao in no time.</p><p></p><p>This was a temporary clone Suhao created, controlled by a minor consciousness of his.</p><p></p><p>After the crystal armor figure opened its Cone Force Field, it continued flying forward.</p><p></p><p>He intended to personally experience this so-called critical point mentioned by Yashan, and why the Cone Force Field would collapse there.</p><p></p><p>One year into the clone's advance, the Cone Force Field abruptly distorted and collapsed, instantly turning the clone into dispersed particles.</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "......"</p><p></p><p>Sensing Suhao's abnormality, Yashan curiously asked, "What's wrong, Master Wei?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao: "The clone was destroyed. It's like going with the river flow, only to encounter a waterfall and fall without warning.</p><p></p><p>There really is a critical point there. We'll discuss that later, now let's first try the Planetary Network and see how many star systems we can access."</p><p></p><p>Instead of immediately activating the Gravity Array, Suhao directly connected to the Planetary Network, sending out numerous minor consciousnesses that scattered in all directions, reaching the edge of the Cloud Ring System and crossing the narrow clear zone to explore adjacent star systems.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Suhao opened his eyes and smiled, "Just staying here, the maximum range is about 4 million light-years. What about using the Gravity Array?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Suhao maintained the Cone Force Field while transforming his crystal armor to activate the Gravity Array...</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Suhao concluded, "Over 100 million light-years!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning from the test, Suhao held a rare small banquet.</p><p></p><p>A banquet for just three people, but it was extremely lively. They boasted to each other about the complexity of their research, how brilliant their minds were, how incredibly intelligent they were, and how awesome they were.</p><p></p><p>Later, it turned into Suhao telling Yashan and Fengcheng about the vastness of the future universe, the splendid and colorful scenery within, and how to create a lively and extraordinary interstellar universe after attaining eternal life...</p><p></p><p>They didn't drink alcohol, but were happy enough to get drunk without it.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet ended, they each busied themselves with their own matters.</p><p></p><p>Suhao returned to his research on consciousness and spirit brains.</p><p></p><p>However, after the experience of the black hole trip, Suhao had also become more open-minded and no longer obsessed over the explosive power issue of the spirit brain.</p><p></p><p>"This is determined by the inherent nature of matter itself. Forcibly changing its nature is extremely difficult. I don't know if I can do it, but at least for now, I cannot.</p><p></p><p>Being impatient is useless and will only trap me in a cycle of unproductive thinking from which I cannot escape. The current spirit brain must be lacking some key factor. If I cannot find it, no matter how hard I try, there will be no results.</p><p></p><p>The reason I've become so powerful is because I can constantly reincarnate into different worlds and absorb the unique nutrients of each world.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back, if I were confined to a single world, I certainly could not have reached this level.</p><p></p><p>So...no need to dwell on it too much. Get prepared and wait for the next reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>Every time he awoke, Suhao kept telling himself not to pin his hopes of a turnaround on one reincarnation after another, but to strive for himself to break free from this cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Yet in reality, almost all of his knowledge came from his reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>If he broke free from the cycle, unable to encounter new worlds and knowledge, then he would essentially stop progressing, confined to a small area, while the vast knowledge of the greater universe would be beyond his reach.</p><p></p><p>This was something Suhao could not accept either.</p><p></p><p>A bit of a contradiction...</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought to himself, "Perhaps I should not resist reincarnation, as it is the key to my growth. I should...actively seek reincarnation in the future after attaining eternal life!"</p><p></p><p>He felt enlightened and no longer obsessed over it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he entered the Ballistic Space and harvested large amounts of brain data from the 'Crosser' experimental consciousnesses, while gradually terminating the interdimensional travels of the various experimental consciousnesses.</p><p></p><p>For Suhao, the experiments on consciousness and spirit brains had reached this level, which was enough.</p><p></p><p>He had one final question to resolve: "Assuming I have obtained a perfect brain that meets the conditions, how can I perfectly transfer the consciousness information from this current brain into another brain?"</p><p></p><p>If successful, Suhao would master an extremely special skill - body-snatching.</p><p></p><p>Find other human bodies, then forcibly insert his own consciousness into them, taking possession of those bodies.</p><p></p><p>This would be another form of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>As for whether to wait hundreds of millions of years for reincarnation after that, it would be up to him to decide.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not as simple as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Replacing a heart, liver or kidney was very simple, but how could he replace his own brain?</p>

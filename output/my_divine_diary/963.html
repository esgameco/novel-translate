        <h1>Chapter 963</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities and Cao Xiaodi did not leave, but gathered together to discuss what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>The God of Thunder, Gu Manmian, said in disbelief: "Chipu's master is so powerful. In front of him, I didn't even dare to raise my head. For that moment, I thought I was going to die."</p><p></p><p>The God of Salvation, Baishen, was also shaken, saying: "Indeed, only when truly standing before him did I realize how vast the gap is. I could not even muster the thought of resistance. You should know, we did not have such an intense feeling even in front of Lord Jiawai."</p><p></p><p>The God of Darkness, Yongshi, said: "Heh, that was Lord Jiawai intentionally restraining his aura. Otherwise, do you think you could even speak in front of him?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Gold, Bali, shook his head and said: "But I clearly felt that we and Chipu's master are using the same body type, so why is the difference so obvious?"</p><p></p><p>The God of Radiance, Yi, said: "It's simple - different brains! The bodies are the same. We haven't learned teleportation and blinking, so we can't run far either, which shows that Chipu's master has mastered more abilities that we don't know about." Then he added, "The body is a good one, but after thousands of years, it seems we still haven't fully mastered its true usage."</p><p></p><p>Nati nodded: "Indeed, our bodies are obviously more advanced than those of the Infinite Gate and the Twin Sword Sects, but against those people, I still feel daunted. Intuitively speaking, we can't win..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu said helplessly: "This is simple. Your basics are too poor. You only know how to rigidly use your abilities, but you don't understand the principles. In our Twin Sword Sect, we start learning from the basic theories, able to perform all kinds of tricks with various abilities. It's normal that you can't beat them. The key is, I've been trying to get you to study hard all these years, but you just can't learn."</p><p></p><p>The eighteen deities: "That hurts, bro."</p><p></p><p>They had tried to learn those profound and complex bodies of knowledge, but they lacked patience. Having grown accustomed to idleness, although their minds were capable, their attention was easily distracted, making it difficult to focus. So after all these years, they remained the same.</p><p></p><p>They did want to become stronger and more knowledgeable, but their minds would not obey.</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu sighed: "What I'm concerned about now is whether my master will have any objections to me."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, everyone involuntarily looked towards Cao Shilang.</p><p></p><p>They strongly suspected that Cao Shilang had brought the person here.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang immediately waved his hand: "Don't look at me, it's not me, I'm not involved."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone present knew the vastness of the universe and how hopeless it was, as well as how difficult it was to find a life-bearing planet in the universe.</p><p></p><p>One could say that if the Great Demon King Chipu did not voluntarily reveal this new demon realm planet, it would be very difficult, even impossible, for the people of the Infinite Gate and the Twin Sword Sects to find this location.</p><p></p><p>Because Chipu had reported the star system where the new demon realm was located as 'searched' in the system, other disciples would not enter and continue searching after seeing that someone had searched that area.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect to miscalculate. His own master knew that he had found this planet.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang was indeed a very suspicious figure.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no way to explain why, as soon as Cao Shilang arrived, this place was discovered...</p><p></p><p>A million galloping horses raced through Cao Shilang's heart. Even if he jumped into the Endless Sea, he couldn't wash himself clean this time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Demon King Chipu spoke up: "This has nothing to do with Xiaodi Cao. My master has always been mysterious. Even if Xiaodi Cao wanted to, he wouldn't have the opportunity to find my master. It must be for other reasons.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I trust Xiaodi Cao's character. He would not do something like betraying friends and brothers."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang immediately expressed his gratitude for Chipu's trust in him with great emotion and made it clear that he indeed did not have a way to contact the Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Chipu thought to himself: "Perhaps it has something to do with the Twin Sword Imprint. My master may be able to probe my situation through the Twin Sword Imprint. In other words, no matter what I do, my master knows about it...</p><p></p><p>Never mind, judging from my master's attitude, he doesn't seem to intend to take back the new demon realm from me. Let him watch, then. I hid this planet because I was worried it would be taken away by others. Since my master has no such intention, I don't care either."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Great Demon King said: "It's all in the past, we don't need to mention these things anymore. Let's talk about the demon soldiers!</p><p></p><p>Xiaodi Cao, do you have any thoughts on the demon soldiers of our demon realm? Feel free to share them."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang steadied his mind and said: "I do have some immature ideas, but I don't know if they will align with Your Majesty's intentions."</p><p></p><p>Chipu: "Oh? Let me hear them."</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang said: "According to your description of the demon insects, after the third metamorphosis, they will have a certain level of intelligence, which can continue to improve along with their strength and intelligence...</p><p></p><p>So, I think we can assign ranks to the demon soldiers. The lowest level can be called 'First-Rank Demon Soldiers', including all those who have just completed the third metamorphosis and gained low-level intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Next is the 'Second-Rank Demon Soldiers'. They can reach this level either by devouring other first-rank demon soldiers, or by devouring other races, gaining a certain level of intelligence and strength, and then molting into a more advanced form.</p><p></p><p>Following this pattern, there can be Sixth-Rank Demon Soldiers, Seventh-Rank Demon Soldiers, even Tenth-Rank Demon Soldiers, with higher-ranked ones leading the lower-ranked, filling your new demon realm with vitality.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, you can also impart specific skills to demon soldiers of different ranks, giving the higher-ranked ones even greater combat power.</p><p></p><p>As long as the design is reasonable, it won't take long for you to have a vast demon king's army."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Great Demon King Chipu immediately gave his approval: "Good, let's do it this way! This is exactly the demon king's army I envision."</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in this world, demon insects are everywhere, practically inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>As long as the nutrition is sufficient, there is no need to worry about the source of demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Cao Shilang said: "Regarding the appearance of demon soldiers of different ranks, to create a sense of hierarchy, I can provide some reference models. But the specific designs will need Your Majesty to experiment personally."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu said: "Sounds good."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Nati excitedly said: "As for the rank names of the demon soldiers, the first rank can be called 'Little Demons', the second rank 'Demon Captains', the third rank 'Demon Supervisors', the fourth rank 'Demon Managers'..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon King Chipu immediately interrupted: "Hold on, hold on. We'll discuss that later. Let's solve the appearance issue first. Ahem, Xiaodi Cao, please continue."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Blue-Purple Star, in the Infinite Building, the Winged King Quanfugui, dressed in a business suit, entered the 'General Manager's' office and found the Elf King Vari reviewing documents.</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui said: "Senior Brother, I heard that in the Infinite Lands, many of our former classmates who were eliminated back then have now given up their positions as kings of their races and want to find our master. Should we tell our master about this?"</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari frowned deeply: "Former classmates?"</p><p></p><p>He also recalled the old classmates who had studied with them for a hundred years, but were unfortunately eliminated by their master Yashan and sent back to their respective planets.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing that they wanted to find their master again, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>If they had been eliminated back then, they would probably be in the same situation now!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Quanfugui didn't know how to bring it up either.</p><p></p><p>He was someone who valued old feelings and didn't want to easily let go of the past.</p><p></p><p>Vari looked at Quanfugui seriously and said: "Fugui, you can't act according to your own thoughts just because of the loneliness of life. Good intentions cannot be used this way. Because you must always remember, who gave you this 'long life'.</p><p></p><p>Let me remind you, brother: The future is long, you can make many mistakes, but you absolutely cannot sit in the wrong position, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui's spirit was shaken, and he immediately said: "I understand, Senior Brother. But how should we handle this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Vari said: "For matters involving our master, we should not make decisions lightly. We can only let our master decide. I will inform our master about this."</p><p></p><p>Quanfugui let out a long sigh: "Understood."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he also understood that this was all he could do. As for the final fate of those former classmates, they could only leave it to heaven's will.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Vari found Yashan's sub-consciousness and reported this matter to Yashan.</p><p></p><p>Yashan only said: "I have no master-disciple connection with them. If you are attached to old feelings, you can take them as your own disciples."</p><p></p><p>Vari understood Yashan's meaning and said: "I understand, Master."</p>

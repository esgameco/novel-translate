        <h1>Chapter 702</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>There's no mistake, the captain's name is 'Gong Liang', except his wife, no one else would call him that.</p><p></p><p>Because for a very long time previously, whenever the captain heard someone mention 'gong liang' (meaning 'provisions' or 'rations'), he would get startled.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, Suhao didn't know his name, but today his wife finally blurted it out.</p><p></p><p>In the living room, the captain's wife served some snacks to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, the captain's whole demeanor changed greatly compared to when he was on the Yaoxing starship, becoming more mild and relaxed, lacking some of that iron-blooded aura of a soldier.</p><p></p><p>It had only been one evening and he had already changed to this appearance, if he stayed longer what would happen?</p><p></p><p>The captain skillfully brewed tea and poured a cup for Suhao.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and said, "Daqiang ah, why did you come looking for me so soon on just the second day? Can't get used to being back on Bluebright?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't beat around the bush either, saying directly, "Captain, do you still remember those five warships of the Eight-Armed Race?"</p><p></p><p>The captain raised his eyebrows and nodded, "I remember, many people are eager to get those warships from you. But I've temporarily held them off, telling them to come find you again in a couple days. I didn't expect you to be in such a hurry too!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "I'm not in a hurry for the warship matter, that's only part of why I've come to see you this time. The captain should know how those five warships were captured, right?"</p><p></p><p>The captain nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "What I want to say is, capturing those few warships is trivial for me! I command tremendous power, even able to personally confront an entire base planet of the Eight-Armed Race.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have the ability to let humans master powerful strength, even able to turn the tables and gain the upper hand in the confrontation with the Eight-Armed Race, eventually standing at the apex of the Cloud Ring system."</p><p></p><p>The teacup the captain was holding froze midair, his mind buzzing loudly.</p><p></p><p>The information density in Suhao's words was immense, each sentence a mental shock to him.</p><p></p><p>The captain glanced at Suhao, seeing his solemn expression with not a hint of joking.</p><p></p><p>But his mouth opened and closed, finally asking with doubt, "Is this some kind of... superpower?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao thought for a moment, then stood up directly, "Just saying it may not be convincing enough. Captain, would you be willing to come with me for a trip?"</p><p></p><p>Before truly seeing it, just listening to a description makes it hard to imagine the actual effects.</p><p></p><p>The captain asked, "Go for a trip? Where to?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "You'll know when you come with me."</p><p></p><p>The captain pondered briefly, realizing Suhao had no reason to harm him or humanity, so he stood up and said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao casually waved his hand, enveloping the captain in a golden forcefield, while also applying a 'spatial equilibrium' technique to him.</p><p></p><p>'Transmit!'</p><p></p><p>Suhao flickered twice more, arriving in outer space of the planet.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, the captain in casual clothing was floating silently in the void, staring at the yellowish-brown planet in front of him and the vast starry space behind, his mouth slowly dropping open.</p><p></p><p>Suhao pointed at the planet ahead, "Captain, do you still remember this planet?"</p><p></p><p>With Suhao's reminder, the captain immediately recalled - this was the planet they had raided the Eight-Armed Race's supply depot on back then!</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, this place was about 500 light-years away from Bluebright.</p><p></p><p>Not too far in cosmic terms, but also no short distance!</p><p></p><p>How did they arrive here in the blink of an eye?</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Captain, this is the planet the Yaoxing once landed on. Let's go down and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Then Suhao and the captain saw that the Eight-Armed Race's supply depot had been rebuilt here, even larger and more heavily fortified than before.</p><p></p><p>Suhao and the captain hovered high in the air, looking down at the depot below.</p><p></p><p>As the captain stared wide-eyed, Suhao extended a finger, its tip gradually glowing with brilliant golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, with my current abilities, I can destroy an entire Eight-Armed city with a single strike."</p><p></p><p>The captain's eyes were involuntarily drawn to Suhao's glowing finger.</p><p></p><p>When the glow reached a certain intensity, Suhao pointed down at the Eight-Armed depot below.</p><p></p><p>'Destructive Beam!'</p><p></p><p>The next second, a dazzling 'sun' suddenly appeared below, swallowing the entire depot.</p><p></p><p>The captain instinctively closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he gingerly opened them again, all he saw was blinding golden-white light.</p><p></p><p>"Whew—"</p><p></p><p>A powerful shockwave swept over the forcefield protecting him, but he felt nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Then a tremendous explosion thundered, echoing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>When everything settled, below was only an immense crater, as if a small asteroid had struck the planet.</p><p></p><p>The captain asked in shock, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied calmly, "I casually destroyed the Eight-Armed Race's supply depot."</p><p></p><p>The captain stammered, "W-wait wait wait! Let me catch my breath first~"</p><p></p><p>If that was just a casual strike, then at full power, could he reach the level of the Eight-Armed Race's planet-destroying cannons? He could scarcely imagine humans being able to unleash such tremendous might.</p><p></p><p>Suhao nodded, "Sure, take your time. We'll go to the next place."</p><p></p><p>The captain was stunned, "Go where next?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao didn't answer, directly transmitting them to the Star-Devouring Insect planet, then flickering again to hover midair.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Star-Devouring Insect planet we observed before. I could even locate the mother insect here, then destroy this entire planet."</p><p></p><p>Just as Suhao finished speaking, many umbrella-shaped insects drifted towards them, electricity crackling at their bases.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the moment Suhao appeared, this planet's mother insect had detected them and sent these human-killing electric umbrella insects...</p><p></p><p>"Crackle—Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Several thick lightning bolts struck Suhao and the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain cried out in alarm, "Damn, danger!"</p><p></p><p>Yet after the lightning passed, the two were completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Don't worry, the protective barrier around you is very strong. Attacks of this level can't harm you."</p><p></p><p>The hidden mother insect was instantly dumbfounded: "Weren't lightning attacks supposed to be effective against humans? How is there not the slightest effect now?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dense swarm of insects around them, the captain felt a chill, "Why don't we just head back first! Oh right, can we even go back..."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Of course!"</p><p></p><p>'Transmit!'</p><p></p><p>The forcefield dissipated, and the captain's feet landed on solid ground. But he felt his legs go weak, stumbling to plop down in a chair.</p><p></p><p>Looking around at the familiar surroundings, he finally caught his breath, "We're... back?"</p><p></p><p>He had never been so discombobulated before. Even facing those five Eight-Armed warships, it wasn't as shocking as this inexplicable journey.</p><p></p><p>The captain inwardly lamented, "I've disgraced the enhanced soldiers."</p><p></p><p>He noticed the tea on the table, shakily pouring himself a cup and gulping it down to wet his parched throat. Finding it unsatisfying, he simply grabbed the whole teapot and guzzled it down, not caring about the heat.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>The captain took a few deep breaths to finally calm down, then said to Suhao, "Daqiang, don't rush me, let me make sure what I just experienced wasn't a dream."</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Of course it wasn't a dream. If you have any doubts, I can take you on another trip anytime."</p><p></p><p>"No need for now, no need!"</p><p></p><p>After a good while, the captain regained his normal thinking and asked, "Daqiang, was that your 'bullseye' ability?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao said, "Correct, though I prefer to call it 'transmitting'. I can instantly move from one point in space to another, similar to warp travel but even faster by utilizing the properties of space."</p><p></p><p>The captain couldn't help remarking, "This is just 'faster'?"</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Can other people learn this transmitting ability of yours?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao replied, "Normally no, but it should be possible to achieve with machinery."</p><p></p><p>The captain asked, "What do you plan to do?"</p><p></p><p>Suhao showed a smile, "I want to change roles, become a researcher and study a vast amount of knowledge! Then I'll try to recreate the transmitting technique with machinery. If successful, future spaceships may gain transmitting capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Human technology will undergo a qualitative leap. Humanity's living space will expand tremendously. The Eight-Armed Race will no longer be the greatest threat to humans."</p><p></p><p>The captain was stunned, his whole body tingling!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the captain's wife came in to replace their snacks.</p><p></p><p>The captain suddenly stood up, pulling Suhao along, "Daqiang, come, I'll take you to see the leader! As long as we can convince him, you can have whatever you want. Just as long as you can truly research this 'transmitting' technology!"</p><p></p><p>Suhao showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>The first step, successful!</p><p></p><p>The captain's wife couldn't help reaching out, "Gong Liang, where are you two going?"</p><p></p><p>The captain quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>Last night's exertions had depleted twenty years' worth of his rations. Terrifying!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 772</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Winged Divine Tribe and the allied forces soon reached a white-hot stage.</p><p></p><p>Screams and roars intermingled, the clashing of weapons and tearing of flesh resounded. </p><p></p><p>Purple-red blood sprayed, severed dragon limbs flew about.</p><p></p><p>Even more were the dragons lying half-dead, struggling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A large number of allied soldiers fell, while roughly ten allied soldiers died for every single Winged Divine soldier killed.</p><p></p><p>Before initiating this war, Yuan Tan had already devised a plan to defeat the powerful Winged Divine soldiers - to overwhelm their strength with sheer numbers.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't work, then three. If three didn't work, then ten. A hundred if needed!</p><p></p><p>He didn't aim to kill or defeat the Sacred Lord, for he knew that was impossible. The Sacred Lord occupying the entire 'Mother God Pool' was supremely powerful, unmatched by anyone.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could stall the Sacred Lord and prevent large-scale slaughter of the allied forces, they would succeed.</p><p></p><p>And in fact, the war was unfolding just as Yuan Tan had expected.</p><p></p><p>If this trend continued, the Winged Divine Tribe's reign of enslavement would be utterly destroyed today.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>It raised its giant hammer again to block the Sacred Lord's strike, a tremendous force transmitting through the hammer to send it flying far away once more.</p><p></p><p>"Puh!"</p><p></p><p>This time it could no longer endure, violently spitting out a mouthful of purple-red blood.</p><p></p><p>After tumbling upon landing, it quickly steadied itself, taking flight again. Spitting out another mouthful of fresh blood, it laughed uproariously, "As expected of the Winged Divine Sacred Lord, the strongest dragon in the Sacred Grace Realm. I did underestimate you before. But this level of power is still far from enough to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>After batting away the tyrant dragon lord Hong Jun, the spirit dragon Yuan Zhao, and the rock dragon Kong Cheng one by one, the Sacred Lord roared furiously, "Despicable traitor tribe! We the entire Winged Divine race will be disgraced by the appearance of a Fallen One. Do you know that the Fallen Yuan Tan is a disgrace to the Winged Divine tribe? Utterly unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>All Fallen Ones deserve to die. I shall send you to kneel before our Winged Divine ancestors and repent!"</p><p></p><p>It flapped its wings and soared into the sky, raising its purple radiant hammer to plunge down.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Breaking Hammer!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Tan's pupils constricted sharply, sensing extreme danger. It shouted to the other three generals, "We four dragons must resist together!"</p><p></p><p>The other three dragon generals knew there could be no hesitation. They gathered together, bathing in blue-purple light, joining forces to resist.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>After the earth-shaking thunderous blast, a large swath of the allied forces was wiped out. The four allied leaders were also knocked down in four directions, nearly passing out from the immense impacting force.</p><p></p><p>Struggling back up, they looked up at the still formidable Sacred Lord in mid-air, a sense of despair they could hardly suppress rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Who in this world could be an opponent against such overwhelming power?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>When Xu Hao and the others saw the dragons using this purple energy to attack, their eyes gradually lit up.</p><p></p><p>The three were exceptionally delighted in their hearts, "This planet has potential!"</p><p></p><p>After a period of observation, Xu Hao discovered that this purple radiant energy could greatly enhance the dragons' physical qualities, granting them tremendous strength in every movement and action;</p><p></p><p>It could also be imbued into weapons and armor to increase their defensive capabilities;</p><p></p><p>This purple radiant energy's abilities seemed quite simple, but in Xu Hao's eyes, it was not so straightforward.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was not the purple light's formidable destructive power - no matter how powerful, it still couldn't surpass the strength he commanded.</p><p></p><p>What he perceived from the purple light was another hidden system of power behind it.</p><p></p><p>Such a system might just provide him new inspiration, allowing his current abilities to undergo a leap in advancement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao thought to himself, "Or maybe not even a leap, just a small jump would be a worthwhile gain."</p><p></p><p>Watching this brutal battlefield, Xu Hao suddenly felt a tinge of pity.</p><p></p><p>With so many casualties, it somehow seemed...wasteful.</p><p></p><p>"These would all make excellent test subjects! What a pity if they died senselessly in this war. Wouldn't it create far more value if I could experiment on them?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Xu Hao said to Ya Shan and Feng Cheng, "Watching them fight like this is pointless. Let's go mediate a truce!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan and Feng Cheng wondered, "Is it polite to mediate when they're in the midst of intense fighting?"</p><p></p><p>But since the Great Lord said so, then it must be polite.</p><p></p><p>They replied in unison, "Understood, Great Lord."</p><p></p><p>They were about to teleport when Xu Hao added, "Oh, and we mean no ill will. We'll temporarily invite them as guests into our small world so we can learn their language and understand the situation of this world."</p><p></p><p>The two nodded in understanding, exchanging a sly smile before one teleported away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao chuckled lightly and also teleported.</p><p></p><p>In truth, what he said was genuine - he did intend to temporarily invite these beings into the small world as guests. As long as they cooperated obediently, he would release them after learning what he wanted, without harming their lives under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they refused to cooperate...</p><p></p><p>Well, Xu Hao had plenty of ways to deal with the uncooperative.</p><p></p><p>He simply didn't wish to waste time on those unwilling to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Three figures in pink crystal armor appeared on the chaotic battlefield, but failed to draw any attention from the dragons.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao and the other two were far too tiny compared to the dragons.</p><p></p><p>Even the smallest spirit dragon race was several times larger than them.</p><p></p><p>If the dragons did notice, they would likely just mistake the three for pink crystal stones...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had never seen these upright, humanoid creatures before!</p><p></p><p>After circling the battlefield, Xu Hao realized the dragons paid him no mind.</p><p></p><p>So how was he to mediate a truce? This was rather awkward.</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao told Feng Cheng, "Feng Cheng, you have a powerful voice, right? Shout a couple times and see if they'll listen."</p><p></p><p>He knew the dragons wouldn't understand, but he still needed to give them a heads up first. Wouldn't want the dragons to think humans were rude and develop a misunderstanding about this race.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng flew up and bellowed downwards, "All of you, stop this instant!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng's voice boomed like a tremendous bell, rolling out to reach every dragon's ears across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This instinctively made all the dragons glance towards the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>But that was all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they couldn't comprehend what Feng Cheng was saying.</p><p></p><p>To the dragons' ears, Feng Cheng's voice was just some kind of peculiar howling.</p><p></p><p>The scene was akin to a dog barking madly on the battlefield...</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it was meaningless, automatically ignored by their brains as they continued fighting.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng laughed dryly, "Great Lord, they're ignoring me! Why don't we just knock out all the dragons directly?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Hao nodded in agreement, "Looks like we'll have to use force!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Shan also said, "They dare ignore us!"</p><p></p><p>Then the three acted simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Under Feng Cheng's spiritual sense, his 'Mindful Wish' activated, restraining the movements of all the dragons on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Whether Winged Divine or from the three tribes, all the dragons felt an overwhelming force locking down their bodies, rendering them immobile.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why can't I move?"</p><p></p><p>"It's like being encased in solid steel restraining my body. No matter how hard I struggle, I can't budge an inch."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Sacred Lord's power from the 'God Pool'? But no, both enemies and allies are restrained."  </p><p></p><p>"It's not the Sacred Lord. The Sacred Lord is also restrained."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after being struck by the Sacred Lord's hammer, Yuan Tan tumbled and tried to get back up, but found his body as hard as iron, unable to move no matter how he struggled.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help feeling gloomy in his heart, "Am I...going to die? What a pity, unable to witness the birth of a new world. But I'm certain the light will eventually shine upon this realm. I may have failed, but someday a dragon will succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Rolling his eyes towards the Sacred Lord, his eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw that the Sacred Lord also seemed unable to move.</p><p></p><p>His heart was gripped by astonishment, "No, this restraining ability is strange. And it seems the Sacred Lord is also restrained! Inconceivable. Who could possibly have reached this level..."</p><p></p><p>After hammering Yuan Tan and the other dragons away, the Sacred Lord was about to seize the opportunity to finish them off when it suddenly felt an extremely powerful pressure enveloping its body. Despite its unmatched might, it could barely move.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord's heart shook violently, "Such power...who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a voice like a tremendous bell once again rang out from above, "#￥@%......"</p><p></p><p>It couldn't help but turn its eyes towards the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>There, floating in mid-air, were three peculiar pink crystal stone-like objects, their sizes so minuscule they were almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Lord's mind flickered with a thought, "What the heck are those things?"</p>

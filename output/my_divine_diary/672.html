        <h1>Chapter 672</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The closer he was to regaining his powers, the more anxious Suhao became.</p><p></p><p>Were there not enough examples of failure and success in this world?</p><p></p><p>Before truly gaining the power to protect himself, Suhao would not be completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>On this day, after crudely filtering the gene modification liquid, Suhao locked the door and injected the liquid into his own body.</p><p></p><p>He soon felt drowsy and lay down, quickly falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>When he woke from this sleep, he would gain even greater power!</p><p></p><p>While Suhao was asleep, the senior officers of the Starship Yuanxing once again convened an emergency meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Latest news, a Type 2 raiding battleship of the Octopus Race has been detected heading towards Planet Wenwang, quietly approaching. It's estimated to enter the attack range of both sides in three hours."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"That shouldn't be, why did a ship catch up so quickly? Even if they dispatched a ship immediately after discovering us, it's impossible for them to close in this fast."</p><p></p><p>"I think when we raided the Octopus Race's supply station, this battleship happened to be nearby. In fact, as soon as we left that planet, they were right on our tail."</p><p></p><p>"Very likely! It's a pity our detectors are too outdated to discover its trace earlier."</p><p></p><p>"The Octopus Race's raiding battleships are extremely fast. We can't possibly shake them off. At most three hours and they may attack us."</p><p></p><p>"What do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"What else can we do? We have to fight! Destroy that battleship, then we continue fleeing towards the Starworm domain."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, we have to fight, we must show the spirit of humanity. Besides, it's just a Type 2 raiding battleship. We're not afraid of an encounter battle with it."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The captain clenched his fist tightly and slammed it on the table, his face ferocious as he shouted, "All crew, battle stations!"</p><p></p><p>At the captain's order, a piercing sound rang out throughout the Starship Yuanxing.</p><p></p><p>All combat personnel on the Yuanxing immediately sprang into action, donning their armor and preparing!</p><p></p><p>It's just unknown whether the ship will still be around when he wakes up.</p><p></p><p>And unknown what scene he will see when he first opens his eyes - whether he'll be drifting amidst the wreckage of ships in the vast expanse of space.</p><p></p><p>After the alarm sounded on the ship, Captain Yan immediately ran to the armory to put on his armor. It was then that he noticed Suhao was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "Xiaochang, where's Daqiang?"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang shook his head, "Haven't seen him much lately. Heard he got post-traumatic stress disorder."</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan cursed, "Bullshit, look at his demeanor, how could he have PTSD? Xiaochang, you go get the energy packs loaded first, wait for me in Cabin 405."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Captain!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan ran quickly to Suhao's quarters.</p><p></p><p>*Bang bang bang!*</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan pounded loudly on the door, but Suhao showed no signs of waking up, still sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>During full body gene modification, the body releases a powerful sedative that puts him into a deep slumber until the modification is complete, making it very difficult to wake him.</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan knocked and shouted, "Daqiang! Open up, we're about to go into battle! Dammit, don't pretend you can't hear me!"</p><p></p><p>He shouted again, but there was still no movement inside, so he cursed, "I've never led such a weirdo soldier before!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly remembered he had door access privileges. He immediately retracted his helmet visor and put his face in front of the camera.</p><p></p><p>"Door open!"</p><p></p><p>He grinned smugly, grabbed the handle and pushed, but the door didn't budge.</p><p></p><p>"Locked from the inside, having sex in there?"</p><p></p><p>He steeled himself, took two steps back, activated the power assist on his armor, and kicked out with all his might.</p><p></p><p>*Bang!*</p><p></p><p>The door burst open!</p><p></p><p>He charged in and saw Suhao lying motionless on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell! Still sleeping?"</p><p></p><p>He called out a few times with no response, even reaching out to pry open Suhao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If not for sensing Suhao's steady breathing, he would have thought Suhao was dead.</p><p></p><p>"What the...?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan was at a loss, pondered for a moment, then stopped trying to wake Suhao and ran off to assemble with the others.</p><p></p><p>"Might as well consider Daqiang already died in the last battle."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Suhao's soldier type is called a Ship Soldier, a jack-of-all-trades who can do a bit of everything, an all-purpose soldier type.</p><p></p><p>When deployed for planetary combat, he transforms into an assault infantry soldier in armor.</p><p></p><p>For defensive battles, he can become an artillery soldier. When ships battle in space, he can also pilot fighter craft to raid enemy vessels.</p><p></p><p>Like this coming battle against the Octopus Race battleship, the heavy soldiers need to don armor and board small fighter craft to intercept the enemy battleship.</p><p></p><p>These fighter craft overall resemble agile, darting swallows in flight.</p><p></p><p>But one can't underestimate these dense clusters of small fighters - their main cannons have the power to threaten large warships. If they hit an unarmored section head-on, they can blow a massive hole in a large warship!</p><p></p><p>After charging up his armor, Captain Yan brought his weapon to the fighter hangar for Squad 405.</p><p></p><p>Pitifully, only he and Xiaochang were there.</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang asked curiously, "Captain, where's Daqiang?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan said flatly, "Dead asleep!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang: "???"</p><p></p><p>What situation was 'dead asleep'?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his direct superior Officer Jiang contacted Captain Yan's comms: "Yan Xiang, is Squad 405 ready? Tell that brat Blink Sniper to perform well, dammit!"</p><p></p><p>Captain Yan's face twitched, not knowing how to respond for a moment, before finally saying, "Received, Officer Jiang! I will convey your orders to him."</p><p></p><p>After ending the call, Captain Yan left a message on Suhao's comms device: "Daqiang, pilot the fighter and do your dammit mother!"</p><p></p><p>He then took a deep breath, his whole demeanor becoming extremely solemn, and barked, "Board ships!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaochang stamped his foot firmly, "Received!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them then climbed into their respective fighters, initiated pre-heating, checked systems, and sent standby signals to await further orders.</p><p></p><p>Not just their squad, other fighter squads were also boarding their craft and making preparations to launch!</p><p></p><p>In this coming battle, after piloting the fighters out of the Yuanxing, they may never return.</p><p></p><p>But no one had any hesitation - perhaps the moment they became Ship Soldiers, they were prepared to die in space.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Yuanxing command center.</p><p></p><p>"Report, enemy battleship turning starboard and continuing acceleration, maintaining effective attack range from our ship."</p><p></p><p>"Report, our combat personnel are ready, all weapon energy reserves filled, no abnormalities."</p><p></p><p>"Report, Yuanxing's wings have finished folding, converted to high maneuverability combat form."  </p><p></p><p>"Report, space interference pods deployed, breaking enemy battleship's main cannon lock."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The captain stood silently in the center, highly focused as he received this stream of information, issuing corresponding orders while quietly contemplating the enemy's battle strategy.</p><p></p><p>The Octopus Race was highly intelligent - the captain did not dare underestimate them at all. As he analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, he searched for the factors that could lead to his victory.</p><p></p><p>Leading the Yuanxing to victory was his duty as captain.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxing was a cruiser ship, prioritizing stealth during travel above all else.  </p><p></p><p>Though its combat power was formidable, it was not designed specifically for battle, so its mobility and combat ability were far inferior to the enemy's raiding battleship.</p><p></p><p>In a head-on fight, the Yuanxing would be no match for the enemy battleship.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the way the enemy was cautiously probing with its mobility instead of recklessly closing in...</p><p></p><p>The captain thought to himself: "The enemy commander is not being careless despite having the upper hand. This battle will be difficult! So how can I do it, how can I defeat them?"</p><p></p><p>The captain didn't speak, while the others silently watched his back, awaiting his orders.</p><p></p><p>Everyone believed their captain would definitely be able to lead them to victory over the enemy.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely lead them all home safely!</p><p></p><p>*Bang!*</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled by the sudden sound.</p><p></p><p>The captain suddenly broke into hearty laughter: "Or perhaps, I understand now! The enemy is not being cautious, they have no choice but to be cautious. Because they don't have absolute confidence in defeating us either."</p><p></p><p>"We can win this battle!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the Octopus Race's raiding battleship, a towering octopus creature split open the large mouth under its eyes and buzzed in its unique language: "Regrettably, the humans do not know our true intentions. What we must do is deliver the fatal blow when they panic and try to flee!"</p>

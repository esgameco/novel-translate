        <h1>Chapter 722</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Watch my 'Divine Ten Thousand Explosions'!"</p><p></p><p>After a loud roar, Feng Cheng shot a huge sphere emanating golden light into the city of the Eight-Armed Race below.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it was as if a massive sun had been planted in the city, with dazzling golden rays flashing outwards in all directions. </p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>A massive shockwave swept over Feng Cheng, violently knocking him flying.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>A deafening thunderous sound rang out, instantly deafening Feng Cheng's ears, his mind filled with a droning noise.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the Eight-Armed Race from disrupting the structure of the Ten Thousand Explosions while he was firing it, he had intentionally moved in close to unleash it - a technique that inflicted a thousand points of damage on the enemy but five hundred on himself.</p><p></p><p>However, for him it was not a big problem. The damage he sustained was completely healed within just a breath, without leaving any so-called internal injuries behind.</p><p></p><p>He had only lost a bit of blood energy.</p><p></p><p>But the blood energy consumed was just a drop in the bucket compared to the vast blood energy of the "Eight-Armed God".</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, using the Ten Thousand Explosions to bomb everything was easy and effortless, one explosion covering a vast area. It was worth having for everyone!</p><p></p><p>When everything had settled down, Feng Cheng used his 'Divine Sense' to perceive the area, discovering a few survivors slipping through the net, but he didn't bother with them. He just said in a regretful tone: "It seems the spatial disruption device is not here, I'll have to go to the next location to look for it!"</p><p></p><p>However, judging by his excited demeanor, he didn't seem regretful at all, but rather was reveling in it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, his pupils constricted and he stomped his feet hard, flashing towards the extreme distance.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a huge pillar of light shot from the horizon, enveloping his previous location.</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by a violent explosion, it swept over the area that Feng Cheng had already ravaged into ruins once more.</p><p></p><p>The explosive force seemed comparable to Feng Cheng's Three Thousand Explosions, but the core area of the explosion had an intensity comparable to the killing range of the Ten Thousand Explosions.</p><p></p><p>Even with Feng Cheng's body as the "Eight-Armed God" plus his 'Crispy Skin Defense', he dared not take a direct hit.</p><p></p><p>Because when he had tried hijacking a warship before, the "Eight-Armed God" he was controlling was instantly destroyed!</p><p></p><p>He could only keep moving at high speed to evade the lock-on of the arc-shaped cannon.</p><p></p><p>"An attack came from that direction, huh!"</p><p></p><p>He swiftly left this place, advancing towards the direction from which the arc-shaped cannon had fired.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the relatively safe fortress conference room of this colonial planet, the "Ball Chief" of the Eight-Armed Race was furiously scolding his subordinate officials.</p><p></p><p>"XXX, where did that 'Crystal Demon' come from, how did it suddenly run to my planet and start destroying things! I'm so angry! Damn it, damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"What are the Eight-Armed Soldiers for? Tell me, the Eight-Armed Soldiers that I spend so much money nurturing, are they just a bunch of useless trash?"</p><p></p><p>"If that Crystal Demon suddenly appeared above us and dropped a bomb glowing with golden light, tell me, what should I do? Just wait to die?"</p><p></p><p>"The records show that many years ago, a 'Hand-Craving Fleet' had already blasted the Crystal Demon into pieces, right? So what's this Crystal Demon that suddenly showed up again?"</p><p></p><p>"XX, don't tell me there's actually a 'Crystal Demon Race' in the Cloud Ring System, and after killing one, there's another! Don't joke with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, how did the 'Hand-Craving Fleet' kill the Crystal Demon before? Tell me quickly!!!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's "Ball Chief" had two tentacles on the ground while the remaining six were raised and waving around wildly, filling the entire conference room with tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed individuals standing properly below dared not make a sound or even fart, their tentacles drooping limply on the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this point, one of the Eight-Armed individuals weakly raised a tentacle and said, "We first activated the spatial disruption device to lock onto the Crystal Demon's wormhole, preventing it from rapidly changing positions. Then we used the main cannons on a large number of warships to launch an overlapping barrage attack, which is how we killed the Crystal Demon. However..."</p><p></p><p>The Ball Chief glared angrily, "However what?"</p><p></p><p>"However, the Crystal Demon's movement speed and agility on land are much higher than in space. Our various energy cannons simply cannot lock onto its position, so..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't give me 'so'! I want a solution, do you know what a solution is? Give me a solution to solve this problem quickly!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, another Eight-Armed individual spoke up: "We can have all the warships on our planet take off into space, then lock onto the Crystal Demon's position from far away in space, coordinating with the planet's arc-shaped cannons to launch an overlapping barrage attack! As long as we can cover the area the Crystal Demon can move within a given time, if we bombard it with enough rounds, we should be able to kill this 'Crystal Demon'."</p><p></p><p>The Ball Chief raged, "You idiot! Do you want to destroy my planet? Do you know how much wealth I would lose if you did that? I had a really hard time acquiring this planet!"</p><p></p><p>"......" All the Eight-Armed individuals fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Ball Chief could no longer contain himself, frantically waving his tentacles, "Damn it! Damn it! Argh! I'm so angry, quickly order all warships to take off? Just do as you said, launch an overlapping barrage attack from space! Hurry! I want to see the Crystal Demon torn to shreds with my own eyes as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng didn't know how long he had flown before arriving at an immense armed plaza.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng recognized this kind of plaza - it was a docking harbor for the Eight-Armed Race's ships, as well as a super military fortress.</p><p></p><p>However, there were no ships docked in the harbor at this time. He only saw Eight-Armed individuals fleeing in panic from the fortress, which was extending all kinds of huge cannon muzzles, trying to aim and lock onto him.</p><p></p><p>But Feng Cheng's movement speed was too fast.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swish!"</p><p></p><p>Countless self-guided tracking missiles flew out from the fortress, but as soon as they were launched, Feng Cheng used his 'Mind's Desire' to forcibly bend their trajectories, reflecting them back.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——"</p><p></p><p>The fortress was bombarded by its own missiles, so it dared not launch any more missiles.</p><p></p><p>Whether the energy cannons successfully locked onto Feng Cheng or not, they all opened fire indiscriminately, shooting towards Feng Cheng who was flying in an 'S' pattern in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, it was like firing a machine gun at a fly in the sky - no matter how much they fired randomly, they couldn't hit him...</p><p></p><p>He glanced around and saw there were no ships nearby, so he muttered, "Huh? No ships...no matter, I'll bomb them first."</p><p></p><p>"Kachaka kachaka~"</p><p></p><p>Large amounts of pink crystal formed, stacking at an extremely fast pace. In just a minute, he had another huge bomb in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Infusing it with spiritual energy!</p><p></p><p>The 'Ten Thousand Explosions' emitted a golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>The golden light illuminated Feng Cheng's ferocious and excited divine face, making him look like a demonic smile, bloodthirsty yet filled with a violent beauty.</p><p></p><p>He shouted again, "Watch my 'Divine Ten Thousand Explosions'!"</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Explosions was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Another sun rose, its tremendous impact force knocking him flying far away.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the original fortress had already become a field of ruins.</p><p></p><p>The extremely sturdy defensive structures could not withstand the power of the Ten Thousand Explosions.</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng let out a cry of "Awesome!" as he admired his handiwork.</p><p></p><p>He was about to head to the next location when he suddenly stopped, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>His extremely sharp vision allowed him to clearly see a vast number of immense warships floating in the space outside the planet, blotting out the sky.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of cannon muzzles were aimed directly at him.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, after realizing their land-based cannons could not deal with him, the Eight-Armed Race planned to overwhelm him with a massive number of ships!</p><p></p><p>Then Feng Cheng landed, his crystal vines spreading out as he transformed the area within a 10,000 meter radius into a world of pink crystal in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Kachaka kachaka!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Cheng slowly sank underground, the transforming crystals surging up like waves, piling higher and higher until they formed a humanoid shape, then raising one finger towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the crystal giant was engulfed by a sea of light beams.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom——"</p><p></p><p>Explosions rang out incessantly, turning this entire area into a dead zone.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's Ball Chief stared fixatedly at the display screen. The previously ubiquitous pink crystals had now dissipated completely. He muttered, "Was it killed? Such an attack should have killed it, right? If it doesn't die even from that..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, he asked, "Oh right, the form the Crystal Demon transformed into just now was humanoid, right? What did that finger it extended mean?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, one of his well-traveled subordinates answered, "There were previous speculations that the Crystal Demon was related to humans. Now it seems those speculations have been confirmed - the Crystal Demon must definitely be a new weapon developed by humans!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Race's Ball Chief raged again, "An insult? It dared to insult us? It's doomed!"</p>

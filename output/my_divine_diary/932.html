        <h1>Chapter 932</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Not only did Wind Cheng's disciples come to the Blue-Purple Planet, but twenty disciples sent by the Yashān Sect also secretly arrived at another city on the Blue-Purple Planet.</p><p></p><p>The disciples from Yashān were all selected from the Reformed Planet, mainly consisting of male disciples with extremely few female disciples. This time, in establishing the Infinite University, there was not a single female student among them.</p><p></p><p>Among the twenty, led by the Elf King Vari, were others like the Beastman King Heijier, the Winged King Quanfugui, and the Sea King Yuanshu. All had taken on human forms without exception, all extremely handsome. Dressed in smart attire as they walked the streets, they caused a stir among girls, ladies, and aunties of all kinds.</p><p></p><p>What was the concept of twenty top-level handsome guys standing together?</p><p></p><p>The Beastman King Heijier, seeing the various women frequently glancing at him, felt exceptionally pleased, thinking to himself: "If I took off my clothes and exposed my perfectly proportioned muscular body, they would definitely drool, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui took a deep breath of the city's polluted air, unable to stop himself from saying rapturously: "This is the smell, the smell of money and wealth. This is undoubtedly our hometown. It's just that I never imagined it would develop to such an advanced stage. Those with wealth can enjoy all the good things in this world. How enviable."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari smiled and said, "No need to envy. What you possess now is something these people cannot even imagine. No amount of wealth or power can replace it. Be content!"</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui said, "What you say is true, but the greatest wealth in the world was once something I pursued. Although it is now useless to me, I still feel a tinge of regret for never having possessed it."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari shook his head and said, "We are here on a mission from our master. Our master said that besides establishing an ordinary Infinite University, we must not disturb the larger situation. You all must not act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui smiled, "Don't worry, Brother Vari, I was just speaking idly."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Beastman King Heijier said, "Brother, what do you think would be better, an all-male Infinite University or an all-female one? Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>The others looked at Heijier in shock and immediately distanced themselves from him.</p><p></p><p>The Winged King Quanfugui asked, "Brother, where should we go next?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Sea King Yuanshu said, "Why don't we go to the library first to learn about the development history of this world? That would be the quickest way to understand this world."</p><p></p><p>The Elf King Vari thought for a moment and agreed, "Okay, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The disciples sent by Yashān and Wind Cheng enthusiastically began their mission.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Hao had also started working on modifying the 'Shuttlecraft'.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, he completed the first modification of the Shuttlecraft:</p><p></p><p>He then created pairs of 'Synchronized Sub-brains', like a mother insect. One sub-brain was connected to the core mainframe, becoming part of the mainframe, while the other sub-brain was installed in the Shuttlecraft to control it.</p><p></p><p>In this way, no matter where in the universe the Shuttlecraft flew, it could maintain real-time synchronization with the core mainframe and transmit the calculated destination coordinates through the mainframe network.</p><p></p><p>"Let's test how effective it is."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao took the Shuttlecraft into space and activated the 'Gravitational Wave' effect built into the Shuttlecraft. He then connected to the galactic network.</p><p></p><p>Using the Shuttlecraft's gravitational effect, he could only observe planets within the local galaxy through the galactic network, unable to sense neighboring galaxies.</p><p></p><p>To perceive adjacent galaxies through the galactic network, he would need to take the Shuttlecraft near the black hole at the center of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>However, he only needed to test the calculation of the network transmission destination. As long as the transmission within the local galaxy succeeded, it meant cross-galactic transmission would also succeed.</p><p></p><p>'Initiate Soul-Brain Connection Program'.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Hao's soul-brain established a wireless network connection with the soul-brain on the Shuttlecraft.</p><p></p><p>He then entered the galactic network, selected a transmission point, and synchronized the data of a specific reference object to the soul-brain of the Shuttlecraft.</p><p></p><p>'Initiate Shuttlecraft Destination Calculation Program'.</p><p></p><p>The soul-brain of the Shuttlecraft transmitted the received information to the core mainframe in the small world. The mainframe's 'Network Transmission' program immediately started calculating the destination data.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Su Hao's massive mental tentacles frantically extended, quickly receiving the program's prompts and locking onto the specific target.</p><p></p><p>'Transmit!'</p><p></p><p>Su Hao looked around at the environment and revealed a smile: "Success."</p><p></p><p>He then went to different galaxies to conduct experiments, all of which were successful.</p><p></p><p>So he uploaded the Shuttlecraft manufacturing process and operating methods to the All-Purpose Assistant, saying in the group: "Yashān and Wind Cheng, the Shuttlecraft has been modified. The manufacturing process has been uploaded. The difficult part is the production method for the 'Synchronized Sub-brains'. You can directly convert them from the source, but mass mechanical production will likely be more difficult. However, if you two spend some time on it, producing millions or tens of millions should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Yashān was astonished: "So fast?"</p><p></p><p>He opened the materials for careful inspection and soon exclaimed in admiration: "Impressive, Senior Protector Wei! The Synchronized Sub-brains and the Shuttlecraft are a perfect match."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "The Synchronized Sub-brains have even more uses than that. You two can test them out! I've succeeded in using them, but that's not enough since they're meant for your disciples. They need to find them useful. I've granted you adjustment permissions for the core mainframe, so you can customize it according to your needs."</p><p></p><p>Yashān said, "Okay, Senior Protector Wei. I'll have my disciples test the effects immediately. I can handle the follow-up."</p><p></p><p>The success of the Shuttlecraft meant their exploration speed would increase. Now, the only limitation was the number of disciples.</p><p></p><p>Although they occasionally encountered life-bearing planets in the universe and gained some new knowledge from them, the rate of acquiring new knowledge was far slower than their absorption rate, which was unsatisfactory.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, they should at least find a life-bearing planet every ten or twenty years...</p><p></p><p>Yashān also said, "Senior Protector Wei, Wind Cheng and I plan to establish two universities on the Blue-Purple Planet to select talented individuals willing to explore the universe with us. We've already sent our disciples to set up the school framework.</p><p></p><p>Ahem, I was wondering if you might be interested in becoming the honorary president of our universities?</p><p></p><p>What I mean is, does Senior Protector have any courses you're interested in teaching at the school?</p><p></p><p>You could also treat it as a way to relax regularly."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng immediately chimed in: "Yes, Senior Protector Wei! Once the universities are established, we can go and teach classes occasionally to unwind. It would be quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao laughed: "No need for the president title, but I'm open to teaching classes. Interacting with talented students would be a good opportunity to study their thought processes and use that to improve myself.</p><p></p><p>Wait until you've started the schools, then we'll discuss further. I'll visit the universities you've established. Who knows, I might come across a few students I take a liking to and accept them as disciples."</p><p></p><p>Yashān and Wind Cheng were delighted by Su Hao's agreement, immediately elevating the importance of establishing the universities by several levels.</p><p></p><p>Yashān said, "Since Senior Protector Wei will also be teaching classes, I'll offer a course as well."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng curiously asked, "What course will you teach, Elder Yashān?"</p><p></p><p>Yashān replied, "I haven't decided yet... Perhaps I'll teach a course on 'Illusory Source Mages' and see if the students can develop all sorts of strange abilities."</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng exclaimed admiringly, "What a great idea, Elder Yashān!"</p><p></p><p>Yashān asked, "What about you, Wind Cheng? Will you teach a course too?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Cheng said, "Since you two elders are teaching, I'll definitely teach one as well... But I haven't decided yet either. I'm better at biological modifications, so perhaps I'll focus on that and teach a course on modifying physical bodies to see if we can integrate powerful abilities into genes."</p><p></p><p>Finally, they asked, "What about you, Senior Protector Wei? What course do you plan to teach?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled mysteriously: "Perhaps I'll teach something esoteric, like 'Destiny Studies'?"</p><p></p><p>The two were stunned, finding it hard to believe: "Senior Protector Wei, you're going to teach fortune-telling?"</p><p></p><p>After Su Hao mentioned 'Destiny Studies', Yashān and Wind Cheng imagined a fortune-teller wearing sunglasses, with a banner next to him that read 'Predicting Events Like a God, Foreknowing Before Divining'...</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "Perhaps! But like you two, I haven't decided yet. After all, a course that sounds like a scam might not even attract any students to enroll!"</p>

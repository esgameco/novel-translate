        <h1>Chapter 782</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Ring System, there was always a positioning stone regularly updated by Su Hao and the other two, making it very simple to return to the Cloud Ring System - just one teleportation would do.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Cloud Ring System, the three of them immediately entered the 'Planetary Network' to observe the development status of the entire Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>As expected, humans had completely taken over all the colonial planet heritage of the Eight-Armed Race, allowing human footprints to spread throughout the entire galaxy.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to the powerful reproductive ability of humans. Although not every colonial planet was fully populated, at least every habitable colonial planet had people living on it.</p><p></p><p>There were also various teleportation arrays set up everywhere, making the vast distances within the Cloud Ring System seem negligible.</p><p></p><p>As long as one had the corresponding teleportation code and pass, one could instantly reach any desired colonial planet, making travel extremely convenient.</p><p></p><p>This also gave rise to countless tourist planets that earned vast resources and wealth by selling their unique scenery.</p><p></p><p>This allowed everyone's past dream of 'galactic sightseeing tourism' to become not just a dream, but a simple goal that could be achieved as long as one had money.</p><p></p><p>Of course, making a lot of money became people's new dream, or perhaps an eternal and unchanging dream.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that the Cloud Ring System did not remain unified as Xia Qingjun had imagined, unable to maintain the absolute administrative control of the Sacred Human Alliance. Instead, it split into five major alliances and countless small independent regions...</p><p></p><p>The five major alliances were the 'Blue Light Alliance', the 'Sacred Alliance', the 'Latter Rock Alliance', the 'Cloud Ring Alliance', and the 'Cultivation Holy Land'.</p><p></p><p>As for the other large and small independent regions, they were nominally subordinate to the five major alliances, but in reality, each did their own thing and did not follow orders.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Cultivation Holy Land, which no one dared to provoke, the other four major alliances frequently engaged in fierce wars over the border planets, with an intensity comparable to the wars against the Eight-Armed Race.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when humans killed their own kind, they were no more merciful than when killing outsiders.</p><p></p><p>However, in the frenzied process of development and expansion, humans inadvertently overlooked the Star-Devouring Insect Domain.</p><p></p><p>Compared to six thousand years ago, the Star-Devouring Insect Domain had expanded even further. However, the Star-Devouring Insect queen eggs lacked the technology for curved space travel, so they could not expand outward faster, and they coexisted peacefully with humans for now.</p><p></p><p>But if this trend continued, one day they would encroach on the living space of humans in the Cloud Ring System, forcing humans to directly face the problem of the Star-Devouring Insects.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that countless years in the future, a great war lasting tens of thousands of years would break out between humans and the Star-Devouring Insects in the Cloud Ring System, until one side was completely defeated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that day would not come so quickly. At this rate, it would be millions of years from now.</p><p></p><p>What humans would become by then, no one knew.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the current humans in the Cloud Ring System did not worry too much about the Star-Devouring Insects.</p><p></p><p>It was still early, no need to panic!</p><p></p><p>However, what Su Hao cared about upon returning to the Cloud Ring System was not how human forces were faring, but whether the humans in the Cloud Ring System had researched more advanced technologies that were ripe for harvesting.</p><p></p><p>If human technological achievements were considered fruits borne by a tree, then the fruits that took six thousand years to bear would be comparable to the mythical celestial treasures that took three thousand years to bloom, three thousand years to bear fruit, and three thousand years to mature, wouldn't they?</p><p></p><p>Jia Fengcheng asked, "Old Master Wei, Old Master Yashan, we haven't shown our faces for a long time. Humans may not recognize us anymore. Even if they do, if I run up and say I'm Jia Fengcheng, I bet no one would believe me. Why don't we just occupy the capital planets of the four major alliances and take everything by force?"</p><p></p><p>He looked eager to try, very excited at the prospect of overpowering others.</p><p></p><p>Yashan also laughed and said, "I think that works. Let's first use the 'Planetary Network' to locate the technologies, then take them by force."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao shook his head and said, "Don't forget that humans can also enter the Planetary Network for observation. After so many years, it's possible that humans have developed technologies to block Planetary Network scans, so we may not be able to find where the technologies are stored.</p><p></p><p>So I think, in order to find all kinds of technologies, we still need the humans to cooperate and hand them over voluntarily."</p><p></p><p>Yashan said, "Use the abilities of the 'Demonic Source Mage' to turn everyone into friends? That's a good solution."</p><p></p><p>Fengcheng looked a little disappointed, "That is easier, but it feels like something is missing."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled, "Blind guesses are useless. We should go to the human capital planet in person to determine the final plan. Who knows, maybe if we introduce ourselves, they'll obediently hand over the technologies?"</p><p></p><p>Yashan: "Let's split up then!"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao said, "I'm interested in the Cultivation Holy Land and want to take a look around there. You two take care of obtaining the technologies from the other four alliances."</p><p></p><p>Yashan and Fengcheng: "Got it, Old Master Wei."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Cultivation Holy Land was founded five thousand years ago by Su Hao's niece, Hua Yonghua.</p><p></p><p>Back then, after a sudden enlightenment, she casually found a colonial planet and found ways to pass down the lineage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The conditions for this lineage of cultivation only required meditating in a chamber rich in spiritual energy; it did not require having the corresponding cultivation genes, or the so-called spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>This was a technological path of cultivation created by Yonghua by combining the 'Supernatural Power Cultivation Method' and 'Energy Block Technology', ingeniously bypassing the restrictions of spiritual roots on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially a different path.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more people followed Yonghua in cultivation, gaining longevity as well as immense power. That once unremarkable colonial planet also came to be known as the Cultivation Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the force grew larger and spread to surrounding star domains, showing a trend of universal cultivation. Eventually, it even developed into an organization as formidable as the other four major alliances.</p><p></p><p>If Su Hao were to be reborn on one of the Cultivation Holy Land's planets at a certain moment, at first glance he would have judged it to be a world where cultivation technology had reached a certain advanced level, rather than a modern interstellar world.</p><p></p><p>None of the other four major alliances would dare provoke the Cultivation Holy Land. First, the Cultivation Holy Land possessed both 'technology' and 'spiritual energy', making it extremely powerful. Second, the leaders of the other four major alliances all wished to cultivate and gain longevity, so how could they offend it? Making friends was not even enough.</p><p></p><p>The people of the four major alliances loved to send their family's younger generations to the Cultivation Holy Land to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>And those who entered the Cultivation Holy Land, though hostile and ready to fight each other outside, would act very friendly inside, addressing each other as fellow disciples and smiling daily.</p><p></p><p>A harmonious scene.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why this star domain was called the 'Holy Land' - compared to the other four major alliances' domains, this place was indeed a paradise that everyone yearned for.</p><p></p><p>As for Yonghua, the founder of the Cultivation Holy Land, she had already returned to dust two thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>But her status was extremely high, ranking fourth in human history.</p><p></p><p>Only below the three Sacred Human Gods, she was revered by the humans of the Cloud Ring System as the 'First Ancestral Immortal'.</p><p></p><p>After Yonghua's death, her most powerful disciple succeeded her position in the Cultivation Holy Land, taking the title of 'Immortal Emperor'.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao came to this Cultivation Holy Land planet, it was already the fourth generation of Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The words 'Immortal Emperor' represented the highest combat power among all human lifeforms in the entire Cloud Ring System.</p><p></p><p>Among all humans in the Cloud Ring System, each generation's 'Immortal Emperor' was the object of cultivation faith and aspiration for everyone, an undisputed pinnacle of the Cultivation Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>However, the unique social form that the Cultivation Holy Land had developed made Su Hao feel that civilization had regressed, retreating to an era when people's thoughts were constrained and shackled by immortals and deities...</p><p></p><p>"The 'Indomitable Light' that allows an ordinary person's soul to radiate charm has dimmed."</p><p></p><p>Dressed simply in a shirt, Su Hao arrived at the Cultivation Star and appeared before a magnificent and imposing palace complex. Looking up, four gilded words were written on the massive gate tower:</p><p></p><p>'Cultivation Holy Land'</p><p></p><p>On the two sides were written:</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual light of the sea of people cannot be found"</p><p>"Worldly rights and wrongs turn to emptiness"</p><p></p><p>Beside them was the signature 'Wandering Cultivator' - the cultivation name Yonghua had given herself.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 623</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The world was facing unprecedented great changes.</p><p></p><p>For most source mages, it was simply earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>But for ordinary people, going out to work became safer. They no longer had to worry about their hard-earned produce for the year being ruined by sudden disasters. This was an extremely fortuitous event.</p><p></p><p>So you see, the development of things always has two sides, it depends on whose perspective you take and how you view the issue.</p><p></p><p>However, the initial fusion still caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>Most mages suddenly found themselves facing a problem: no more jobs!</p><p></p><p>This was when they realized how terrifying it was to be unemployed!</p><p></p><p>Of course, we'll skip over the minority who felt relieved to be jobless.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely during such dramatic changes that one's true nature would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>The old saying rings true: when you fall into extreme difficulties, you'll see who around you is human and who is a ghost.</p><p></p><p>The same applies when facing serious damage to one's self-interest.</p><p></p><p>Many people saw through the crux of the matter and publicized the fact that the Mage Association had collected source pearls in advance, gaining widespread empathy. They then instigated some hot-blooded and not-so-bright people to openly call out to the higher-ups of the mages, demanding a reasonable explanation and the return of the previously purchased source pearls.</p><p></p><p>The Mage Association possessed a large number of source pearls. Were they afraid?</p><p></p><p>Of course not!</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan was right, the Mage Association had become too bloated, with all sorts of people, making it difficult to form a formidable fighting force. The problem wasn't apparent on normal days, but when facing change, it became a huge obstacle. Their overall combat strength declined instead of rising!</p><p></p><p>And Fashi handed Jia Yashan the Forbidden Magic Book he had given him and began earnestly studying the first chapter.</p><p></p><p>"Meditation and Magic Power. What is magic power? It is something similar to source, scattered in the air. Through meditation and cultivation of spiritual power, one can sense its existence..."</p><p></p><p>"Magic power has the same properties as source. If collected and accumulated within the body to a certain amount, it can coalesce into source pearls..."</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the meaning, And Fashi began closed-eye meditation.</p><p></p><p>As one of the world's most powerful mages, his spiritual power was extremely strong. He quickly grasped the meditation technique and began cultivating according to the book's methods.</p><p></p><p>This meditation method was specially designed by Jia Yashan for source mages. It could enhance the mages' micro-abilities to a certain degree. After cultivating to a certain level, they could sense the special 'source' in the air.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, an unknown amount of time passed. And Fashi's spirit shook suddenly as he perceived the extremely scarce special 'magic power' permeating the air!</p><p></p><p>However, he did not feel disappointed. Instead, he was full of astonishment: "There is actually such a thing as 'magic power' in this world...Could this so-called magic power be similar to source?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, And Fashi shook his head. Whether it was similar or not didn't matter anymore.</p><p></p><p>He could only marvel at the extraordinary abilities of Jia Wei and the others.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, countless talents failed to discover this 'magic power', yet the three of them found it! Simply...</p><p></p><p>And Fashi sighed: "Peerless geniuses of all time...Just which lineage are they from to give birth to such formidable individuals! The Jia clan...I've never heard of a prestigious Jia clan..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's laughter echoed from the lab, causing Jia Yashan, Jia Fengcheng, and the reading Fei Yaochen to prick up their ears.</p><p></p><p>The laughter was rich and resonant, continuous and unbroken, rapidly rising in momentum to a peak before gradually descending...</p><p></p><p>It was certain - Old Master Wei had another major breakthrough in his research!</p><p></p><p>They should go and congratulate him!</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng said in unison: "Congratulations to Old Master Wei on furthering his knowledge!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yaochen stood awkwardly, unsure where to put his hands, wanting to congratulate Su Hao like Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand: "This is only a natural breakthrough, nothing to mention."</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan curiously asked: "Old Master Wei, did you make a decisive breakthrough in your research on transforming 'source' into specific substances?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao nodded: "That's right! I've found the 'integer' for source-to-substance transformation. This means that deducing the other 'fractions' and 'irrational numbers' is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>He then gave them a demonstration.</p><p></p><p>Raising his left hand: "This is hydrogen!"</p><p></p><p>Raising his right hand: "This is oxygen!"</p><p></p><p>Combining the two: "Mixed in a two-to-one ratio, ignite!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous explosion, flames bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Hao said: "Water was synthesized! With extremely little loss during the process, and the synthesized water is a physical object, unlike other 'temporary material products' that would collapse into something else.</p><p></p><p>In other words, I can now stably transform source into specific elements."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only elements for now. He didn't know how long it would take to obtain compounds and mixtures, but since elements had been successfully researched, compounds and mixtures were not far off.</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan's expression turned solemn: "Old Master Wei, how did you accomplish this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao smiled: "The principle is not complicated, but obtaining precise substances is extremely difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"The process of transforming substances into 'source' is essentially an instantaneous 'heating' process. Conversely, transforming 'source' into substances is an instantaneous 'cooling' process, right?</p><p></p><p>You should know that every substance contains a different 'energy'. It's like points on a number line - each point represents a number, and each number represents a substance.</p><p></p><p>As long as I can accurately calculate the corresponding substance's 'energy coefficient', I can obtain that specific substance by precisely cooling the source!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng were astonished: "So it can be done this way! No wonder you're Old Master Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan asked another perplexing question: "Old Master Wei, I don't understand one more thing: how do you ensure that what is transformed is the actual substance itself and not a 'temporary material product' that will naturally collapse into something else in two hours?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan's question hit the mark, causing Su Hao to smile slyly: "The collapse happens because 'temporary material products' are merely illusions constructed by 'source', like bubbles that burst with a poke. So, if I fill the hollow part inside the bubbles, wouldn't they be unable to collapse?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan's eyes lit up as he clapped his hands: "That makes sense! But how do you fill them?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chuckled: "It's simple. Separate out a space using the 'small world', then fill it according to the specific 'material ratio'. Oh, I almost forgot you haven't learned the 'small world' yet. What a pity! Keep working hard!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>As a gold source mage, the clueless Fei Yaochen thought to himself: "What are you all talking about? I really want to join your conversation, but I can't understand it at all!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fei Yaochen felt deeply inadequate about his knowledge. It was a major setback in life.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao continued: "Currently, I've successfully calculated the 'energy coefficients' of various elements, treating these elemental 'energy coefficients' as the 'integers' on the number line, compounds as 'fractions', and mixtures as 'irrational numbers'.</p><p></p><p>I estimate it will take twenty years to calculate the 'energy coefficients' of common compounds while optimizing the 'precise cooling method'.</p><p></p><p>At that time, we can self-produce whatever we want!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng were excited: "Spiritual power is a mixture, but it can be directly synthesized from other compounds! This means that in twenty years, we'll have an almost endless supply of spiritual power!"</p><p></p><p>This meant no more sitting idly to cultivate or consuming pills! Awesome!</p><p></p><p>Irrational numbers in mathematics are non-repeating infinite decimals that cannot be fully expressed. However, the 'irrational numbers' that Su Hao's 'energy coefficients' corresponded to didn't necessarily have to be - things like blood, qi, and spiritual power could be expressed using simple numbers like square root of 2 or square root of 3.</p><p></p><p>Jia Yashan and Jia Fengcheng immediately said: "Old Master Wei is formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yaochen thought: "I always feel out of place with those three...Am I not perverted enough, or am I just too stupid? Or is it that my knowledge is too limited?"</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand grandly: "Let's have a banquet!"</p><p></p><p>Three years later, they were having another banquet. Jia Fengcheng couldn't help but jump up excitedly: "Woohoo!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the banquet, Fei Yaochen secretly found Jia Fengcheng: "Master Jia Fengcheng, I heard you've formed an astronomy society and are recruiting students. What do you think of me?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Fengcheng looked at Fei Yaochen in surprise: "Oh, you're interested in astronomy too?"</p><p></p><p>Fei Yaochen: "Of course I'm interested. I'm interested in everything. But mainly, I feel that Master Jia Fengcheng is extremely knowledgeable, and I want to learn from you for a while to increase my knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Jia Fengcheng immediately agreed: "Hahaha! That I'm knowledgeable, you have good eyes!"</p>

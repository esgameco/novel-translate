        <h1>Chapter 973</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang and the other two were brought away in a daze by Su Hao, eventually entering Su Hao's laboratory without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>Gao Qixin had an ominous feeling and asked nervously, "Mr. Jia Wei, what is this place?"</p><p></p><p>After being brought in by Su Hao, the three of them immediately noticed something was off: the ubiquitous natural 'qi' they could sense was gone!</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, this kind of situation should never occur.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if their internal qi was depleted here, they would have no way to replenish it.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao chuckled, "This is a place for us to learn from each other. Next, we will practice cultivation here. I will also guide you onto the path of immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang said, "Will it take very long? I need to go stop the Demon King from destroying the world."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao replied, "Is that so? It won't take too long. If you're really worried about the Demon King, then I'll bring him here too. That way, you won't have anything to worry about."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao transmitted himself to the Martial Realm planet, swept with his divine consciousness to lock onto the Demon King's qi signature, and pulled him into the laboratory across space.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King's vision suddenly shifted scenes, and he found three familiar figures gaping at him from the side.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King slowly formed a question mark: "?"</p><p></p><p>He quickly realized what happened, glaring fiercely at Lyu Yijiang's group as his aura rapidly rose. With a ferocious look, he said, "Lyu Yijiang, it's you three again! Today, I will make you pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's group also prepared to fight.</p><p></p><p>When Su Hao returned to the laboratory, he saw the tense standoff.</p><p></p><p>He remarked, "Relax, no need to rush. I've separated you all with spatial barriers. This isn't a place for fighting. Once you've learned, you can go defeat each other outside."</p><p></p><p>How ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao extended his hand, "Come, stretch out your hands. Let me examine your bodies first to see which cultivation method suits you."</p><p></p><p>Having come this far, they could only steel themselves and approach Su Hao, stretching out their hands.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao then recorded all their physical and mental information into his spatial realm one by one.</p><p></p><p>He casually took out three tablets and handed them over, saying, "Alright, wait for me for a bit. If you're bored, you can browse information you're interested in on these tablets. Just press the button on the side to turn them on, then follow the voice system's instructions."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Su Hao closed his eyes and entered his spatial realm to analyze the three's physical data.</p><p></p><p>Once Su Hao left, Lyu Yijiang's group stared blankly at the tablets, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>With a light twist, the Berserk Head broke his tablet in two, sparks flashing briefly before it went silent.</p><p></p><p>The Berserk Head said in shock, "This...seems to be broken. What did Mr. Jia Wei say earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qixin's eyelid twitched, "He just said to press the button on the side, it should be..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Lyu Yijiang lightly pressed a button.</p><p></p><p>"Crackle crackle..."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's screen instantly turned to static snow.</p><p></p><p>He marveled, "There's a reaction now."</p><p></p><p>Gao Qixin's tablet booted up smoothly, the startup animation quite dazzling. He glared at the two, "You idiots, press here! The information Mr. Jia Wei gave us is ruined by you two. How will you explain it when Mr. Jia Wei returns?"</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang scratched his head, "It's fine, you still have one right? Let's look at it together!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pulled up the three's physical data for analysis and quickly got the corresponding results.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I suspected, these martial artists' bodies have fused with a special substance, almost indistinguishable. This special substance should be the 'qi' they mentioned.</p><p></p><p>When I fought Lyu Yijiang before, my initial attacks didn't actually hit his physical body, but rather the combined form of his body and 'qi'. All the force was distributed out."</p><p></p><p>This is why these martial artists are so durable - unless the attack force can instantly disrupt their qi, it cannot kill them.</p><p></p><p>Even slicing their necks with a blade is essentially cutting through the qi across their whole body, no different than punching them. Below a certain force, the blade won't be able to penetrate the flesh and sever the head.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, they can also connect with the world's natural 'yuan qi' at any time, transferring damage they take onto the natural qi to have the world help share the burden.</p><p></p><p>As such, martial artists of a certain cultivation level become hard to kill, unless the power gap is too large for them to withstand, like the Demon King against Lyu Yijiang.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists are truly an interesting bunch. But what exactly is this 'yuan qi'?"</p><p></p><p>In Su Hao's eyes, the martial artists' 'yuan qi' was like an extremely powerful adhesive, effectively binding every cell in their bodies together, forming an integrated whole with the qi.</p><p></p><p>This qi-bound whole also had tremendous elasticity, able to distribute any force from any angle across the entire body, reducing localized damage.</p><p></p><p>Qi was simply the perfect warrior's energy source.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao predicted that most spells cast on Lyu Yijiang's group would just tickle or make them look miserable, without any real effect.</p><p></p><p>If thrown into the Infinite Lands without encountering spatial ability users like the Infinite Gate or Twin Swords Sect, they could basically walk through unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Even the various race sovereigns would likely not provoke them recklessly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's put the material structure research aside for now. I should understand more about their spirit cultivation and 'consciousness realm' first."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao's consciousness returned to his [Divine] body. Opening his eyes, he saw Lyu Yijiang's dejected group, each holding a broken tablet, looking utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>Su Hao pointed at them, "Why did you all break them?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Qixin glanced at the other two and muttered, "These two idiots did this..."</p><p></p><p>Then he apologized, "Mr. Jia Wei, I'm really sorry. We don't know how to use this information device and accidentally broke it. However much it costs...we don't have money, but please rest assured, we will work to pay it back."</p><p></p><p>Su Hao waved his hand, "No need for that, it's a small issue!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he flicked his finger, and the three broken tablets floated up from their hands into the air. In the next moment, as if time was reversing, the shattered tablets gradually stretched and flattened, restoring to their original state.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Su Hao held the repaired tablets in front of them and demonstrated, "Fixing them is simple, no big deal."</p><p></p><p>Lyu Yijiang's group was completely stunned, mouths slightly agape with a look of utter disbelief, like they had just witnessed a deity for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Not just Lyu Yijiang's group, even the rampaging Demon King calmed down in astonishment, staring at Su Hao's display.</p><p></p><p>This scene was simply too impactful.</p><p></p><p>Any sane person witnessing this would inevitably start questioning their existence.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the three of them started believing in the "immortal cultivation" Su Hao mentioned.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Su Hao had become the legendary all-powerful "immortal" described in myths.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an immortal coming to help us save the world? No, wait, an immortal shouldn't be so unfamiliar with martial artists' cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Just as they were trying to rationalize it, they heard the "immortal Mr. Jia Wei" continue:</p><p></p><p>"I've finished examining your bodies. You are already mature martial artists, so normal immortal cultivation is no longer suitable. Wait a few days while I design a new program tailored for your situation.</p><p></p><p>For now, let's discuss the matter of martial artists' heart cultivation. So, what is heart cultivation exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The three glanced at each other, then looked to Gao Qixin, the most glib talker, to explain.</p>
